Another new asset\u2014the Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC)\u2014is also expected to provide increased capabilities compared to the Medium Endurance Cutter it is replacing, such as the ability to conduct longer patrols.", "The Coast Guard, however, has not been able to take full advantage of the FRC's and NSC's capabilities because of maintenance and equipment issues limiting their time available for operations. GAO found in March 2017 that while both cutters met their minimum mission capable targets on average over the long-term, more recently\u2014from October 2015 to September 2016\u2014they fell below their minimum targets due to needed increased depot-level maintenance. Both cutters have also been plagued by problems with critical equipment, such as the diesel engines, which have contributed to lost operational days.", "In June 2014, GAO found gaps between the funding amounts the Coast Guard estimates its major acquisitions need and what it has requested. This has continued. For example, senior Coast Guard officials peg acquisition needs at over $2 billion per year, but the President's budget requested $1.2 billion for fiscal year 2018. In an effort to address funding constraints, the Coast Guard delayed new acquisitions through the annual budget process, but lacks a long-term plan to set forth affordable priorities. As a result of these issues, it is facing a gap in the capability provided by its Medium Endurance Cutters, which are slated to reach the end of their service lives before all the OPCs are operational.

The U.S. Coast Guard, within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), is the principal federal agency responsible for  maritime safety, security, and environmental stewardship. In addition, the  Coast Guard has assumed increasing responsibility for security related  missions since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In order to meet  these missions, the Coast Guard employs a variety of surface and air  assets. As part of its efforts to modernize its aging fleet, the Coast Guard  has begun acquiring new vessels, such as the Fast Response Cutter  (FRC) and National Security Cutter (NSC), to replace the legacy Island  Class Patrol Boat and High Endurance Cutter, respectively. The new  cutters are designed to provide the Coast Guard with additional  capabilities above those offered by the legacy vessels.", "Despite the addition of these and other new assets, concerns surrounding  capability and affordability gaps remain. For example, the expected  service life for the Coast Guard\u2019s Medium Endurance Cutter will expire  prior to delivery of the first Offshore Patrol Cutter (OPC), potentially  leaving the Coast Guard unable to execute all of its missions.  Additionally, the Coast Guard has one active heavy icebreaker, which is  already past its initial expected service life, and at times has been unable  to provide this capability due to equipment failures. As it seeks to manage  these issues while building new assets, the Coast Guard will continue to  be hampered by ongoing affordability concerns, forcing difficult trade-off  decisions to be made. These decisions may become more difficult as the  affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s overall fleet also faces a significant  challenge from the upcoming OPC procurement, which is planned to cost  $12.1 billion and will consume about two-thirds of the Coast Guard\u2019s  planned acquisition budget between 2018 and 2032 based on its recent  funding history. The Coast Guard\u2019s ability to accomplish all of these  objectives within its planned budget is not known because the Coast  Guard has yet to provide a long-term plan that matches its needs with its  planned budget. In June 2014 we recommended that the Coast Guard  develop a 20-year fleet modernization plan that identifies all acquisitions  needed to maintain the current level of service and the fiscal resources  necessary to build the identified assets.

After the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, the Coast Guard became  a component of the newly established Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), which resulted in an increase in mission demands. In order to  meet this increase, the Coast Guard completed a Mission Needs  Statement\u2014the document that describes the mission(s) and needed  capabilities to justify a given program\u2014in 2005. The 2005 Mission Needs  Statement compared the new assets for which the Coast Guard originally  planned to procure\u2014in 1996 prior to the creation of DHS\u2014to replace its  legacy assets to the demands of the new missions as laid out by the  recently formed DHS. Based on the 2005 Mission Needs Statement, DHS  approved a program of record in 2007\u2014known as the Deepwater  program\u2014that provided the additional capability required. This effort was  expected to last 25 years at a cost of $24.2 billion resulting in either the  rebuilding or replacing of vessels and aircraft that were reaching the end  of their expected service lives and were in deteriorating condition. Figure  1 shows some of the Coast Guard\u2019s newer assets that are part of this  broader modernization effort.", "In 2016, the Coast Guard revised its Mission Needs Statement in  response to statutory requirements and committee report language, but  this revision states it was not intended to provide details on the specific  assets the Coast Guard needs to meet its mission requirements. Further,  according to the Coast Guard, the 2016 update to the Mission Needs  Statement is to provide a foundation for long-term investment planning  that is to culminate with detailed modeling scenarios to evaluate the  effectiveness of various fleet mixes, and inform the Coast Guard\u2019s Capital  Investment Plan. The 2016 revision, however, does not identify specific  assets or fiscal resources necessary to meet the Coast Guard\u2019s long-term  mission requirements, as we had recommended in June 2014.", "Unlike the 2005 Mission Needs Statement, the 2016 version did not result  in a new program of record for the Coast Guard\u2019s recapitalization effort.  However, since the original program of record in 2007, the Coast Guard\u2019s  recapitalization program has undergone changes as major acquisition  programs have been completed and/or modified in response to  affordability concerns.

The FRC will replace the legacy Island Class Patrol Boat, the OPC will  replace both classes of the legacy Medium Endurance Cutter (210-foot  class and 270-foot class), and the NSC will replace the legacy High  Endurance Cutter. As we reported in June 2014, several of the Coast  Guard\u2019s newest asset classes are generally demonstrating improved  mission performance compared to the assets they are replacing,  according to Coast Guard officials who operate these assets.  Specifically, the FRC and NSC have greater fuel capacity and efficiency,  engine room and boat launch automation, handling/sea-keeping, and food  capacity, all of which increase endurance and effectiveness. In addition,  the FRC and NSC both have a stern ramp that allows them to launch and  recover the cutters\u2019 small boats more safely and in a fraction of the time  that the Island Class Patrol Boats and High Endurance Cutters require,  which allows the cutters to more efficiently and effectively conduct  missions. The OPC is also expected to provide increased capabilities  compared to the Medium Endurance Cutter it is replacing. Table 1  provides comparison information on selected Coast Guard legacy and  new surface assets.", "The Coast Guard commissioned its first FRC in 2012 and, as of April  2017, has received 23 of these vessels. The Coast Guard exercised a  contract option for detail design for the OPC in September 2016, and  there are separate options for the production of each cutter currently  under contract. The Coast Guard anticipates receiving the first vessel in  fiscal year 2021, with deliveries each year through 2035 when the  program is scheduled to achieve full operating capability. Additionally,  since 2008, the Coast Guard has received a total of 6 NSCs, with 3 in  various stages of construction. Due to its improved capabilities, the NSC  has been able to complete longer deployments, which has in part resulted  in more successful drug interdictions than the legacy asset it replaces.", "The Coast Guard is also updating and acquiring new aviation assets that  have increased capabilities compared to the legacy assets they are  replacing. For example, the fleets of H-65 helicopters are being upgraded  to allow for greater reliability, maneuverability, and interoperability  between the H-65 and other government assets. In addition, the Coast  Guard restructured its HC-144A acquisition program in 2014 to  accommodate 14 C-27J aircraft it received from the U.S. Air Force. The  Coast Guard plans to use these twin-engine propeller-driven aircraft to  conduct all types of Coast Guard missions, including search and rescue  and disaster response. As we reported in June 2014, officials at Air  Station Miami stated that since they began regularly operating the HC- 144A in fiscal year 2011, the aircraft has had a significant role in  improving the effectiveness of the Coast Guard\u2019s counterdrug and alien  migrant interdiction operations. However, the HC-144A only fully met  three of its seven key performance parameters during initial operational  testing, but the Coast Guard plans to conduct additional tests in fiscal  year 2017 to demonstrate additional key performance parameters. As we  reported in March 2015, the Coast Guard faces several challenges to  making the C-27Js operational, including purchasing spare parts and a  lack of access to the manufacturer\u2019s technical data that are required to  make modifications to the aircraft\u2019s structure to incorporate, among other  things, the radar. The Coast Guard is currently in the process of transitioning to a new mission system on all of its fixed-wing aircraft,  which is a system currently used by the U.S. Navy and DHS\u2019s Customs  and Border Protection. The new mission system is intended to enhance  operator interface and sensor management, as well as replace obsolete  equipment, which is to enable more commonality between the fixed-wing  fleet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Coast Guard Cutters Are Experiencing Maintenance and Equipment Issues", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FRC and NSC Mission Capable Rates Are Lower than Expected", "paragraphs": ["The Coast Guard has not been able to take full advantage of increased  capabilities of the FRC and NSC due to maintenance issues that have  limited their time available for operations. As we reported in March 2017,  while over the past few years both the FRC and NSC met their minimum  mission capable targets on average, which are 48 percent for the FRC  and 49 percent for the NSC, our analysis of a more recent period\u2014from  October 2015 to September 2016\u2014found that both cutters fell below their  minimum targets due to needed increased depot-level maintenance.  See table 2.", "According to Coast Guard officials, the FRC\u2019s decrease in monthly  mission capable rates below its minimum target is primarily because of a  phased warranty repair drydock period that was not initially anticipated.  The average warranty repair drydock period will last approximately 15  weeks, with at least one FRC not mission capable due to depot-level  maintenance at all times from January 2016 to November 2019. These  drydocks were triggered by continuing structural concerns and problems  with equipment that was installed during production, including continued  failures with the main diesel engine. Given that only a few FRCs have  completed the warranty drydock to date, it is difficult to determine whether  the overall fleet\u2019s mission capable rate will meet its target range once the  drydocks are completed.", "As we noted in our March 2017 report, while the FRC\u2019s decrease is  attributable to the unanticipated drydocks, the NSC\u2019s mission capable  rates are influenced by a roughly 2-year anticipated post-delivery  maintenance period called the post shakedown availability, which is  scheduled for each newly delivered NSC. During this shakedown  period, the NSC will be rendered not mission capable due to depot-level  maintenance for a majority of its time. For example, from January 2015  until September 2016, the NSC Hamilton spent 70.9 percent of its time in  depot-level maintenance, and the NSC James spent 82.6 percent of its  time in depot-level maintenance from September 2015 to September  2016. With only five NSCs in operation as of September 2016, having two  cutters spend the majority of their time not mission capable due to depot- level maintenance is negatively affecting the overall fleet\u2019s mission  capable rates. This will continue as the Coast Guard introduces new  NSCs into the fleet and the last cutter completes its 2-year post  shakedown period\u2014scheduled for 2022 as the ninth cutter is scheduled  for delivery in 2020. While the first three NSCs achieved their mission  capable rate targets on average from January 2014 to September 2016, it  is uncertain if the overall fleet mission capable rate will increase once all  NSCs complete their post shakedown availabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Assets Are Being Fielded with Known Problems", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the negative effect that depot-level maintenance is having  on both the FRC and NSC\u2019s mission capable rates, our March 2017  report found that both cutter classes have been plagued with equipment  failures resulting in lost operational days or a partially mission capable  status. This means that the cutters are either not able to or are  conducting operations in a limited capacity. The main diesel engines on  both cutters, which were manufactured by the same vendor, were among  the equipment systems that resulted in the most lost operational days  from 2014 through 2016 and have been problematic since the cutters  became operational. Problems with the FRC\u2019s engine resulted in  roughly 355 days spent not mission capable due to maintenance.  However, the FRC\u2019s warranty clause has covered several engine  problems and, according to the FRC\u2019s contracting officer, has avoided  about $77 million in potential maintenance costs for the Coast Guard it  otherwise would have needed to pay as of August 2016. Furthermore,  the FRC\u2019s contracting officer stated that as of October 2016, all of the 18  operational FRCs have undergone various corrective repairs on their  main diesel engines, including replacing engines on 6 of the cutters.", "Similar to the FRC, the NSC\u2019s engines have experienced problems and,  as we found in January 2016, the engines overheat in waters above 74  degrees Fahrenheit, which constitutes a portion of the NSC\u2019s operating  area given that they are intended to be deployed worldwide. This can  cause the cutters to operate 2 to 4 knots below their top speed of 28  knots. As a result, the Coast Guard has been forced to operate the NSCs  at reduced speeds during some missions, such as counter drug missions,  where reaching maximum speeds would be operationally useful. The  NSC\u2019s inability to achieve top speed in warm waters has also inhibited the  cutters\u2019 ability to complete their regularly scheduled full power trials,  which are periodic tests of the propulsion plant operated at maximum  rated power. The results of these tests advise operators and maintenance  personnel of the cutter\u2019s full power performance characteristics and can  provide the basis for maintenance activity. Without these tests, the Coast  Guard lacks sufficient information that could be useful for assessing  propulsion systems and planning maintenance.", "Further, as we reported in March 2017, the Coast Guard is conducting  design changes for some critical systems post-delivery for the NSC in  order to minimize the cost increase of the extra work and to adhere to the  cutters\u2019 production schedule. One such design change involves the  NSC\u2019s gantry crane, which was not designed for a maritime environment  and is inadequately sealed to prevent water intrusion. This has led to  accelerated corrosion and the need for excessive repairs that are not  considered suitable over the NSC\u2019s life cycle. The design change to  replace the gantry crane was initiated in January 2010 and the new crane  was approved for fleet-wide replacement. However, all of the remaining  NSCs will be built with the original gantry crane installed and then  replaced during their post-shakedown periods.", "During the work for our March 2017 report, Coast Guard officials stated  that no formal analysis was developed or documented to determine  whether a design change should be installed during production or post- delivery. Instead, they used the professional judgment of Coast Guard  and shipyard officials to determine the most cost efficient timing of when  to install design changes. Keeping the NSC delivery dates on schedule  was one of the primary reasons officials gave for not installing some  design changes during production. Given that the program has been  aware of these design changes for many years, the Coast Guard had an  opportunity to install the design changes during production instead of  during the post-delivery period. We concluded that by not installing the  design changes during production, the Coast Guard will need to maintain  the original equipment installed during production for all NSCs, including  the ninth NSC (the separate production contract for which was awarded in  December 2016), and then later conduct retrofits after accepting delivery  of the cutters. This will necessitate the installation of systems with known  defects or deficiencies during production only to replace such systems  later, requiring maintenance on some of these systems until the retrofits  are complete. In our March 2017 report, we therefore recommended that  the Coast Guard update the Joint Surface Engineering Change Process  Guide to require a documented cost analysis to provide decision makers  with adequate data to make informed decisions regarding the expected  costs and when it is most cost effective to install design changes. The  Coast Guard concurred with our recommendation and plans to  incorporate a documented cost analysis requirement into an update to its  guidance by December 31, 2017."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Affordability of the Coast Guard\u2019s Acquisition Portfolio Remains in Doubt", "paragraphs": ["As we found in June 2014, there are gaps between what the Coast Guard  estimates it needs to carry out its program of record for its major  acquisitions and what it has traditionally requested and received.

According to the Coast Guard, the OPC is its top  priority and, as such, it will be funded before other assets, such as the  River Buoy Tenders and helicopters. However, if the Coast Guard\u2019s  acquisition budget remains at its current levels, the funding remaining for  other assets will be very limited. Beginning in September 2018, the OPC  will absorb about two-thirds of the Coast Guard\u2019s annual acquisition  funding until 2032 based on recent funding history. The Coast Guard  initially plans to fund one OPC per year and eventually two OPCs per  year until all 25 planned cutters are delivered.

The following are some  examples that we identified in our June 2014 report of Coast Guard  assets that will likely require some level of funding while the OPC is in  development:  Icebreakers\u2014The Coast Guard currently has a gap in its heavy  icebreaking capability and has previously been without any heavy polar  icebreakers when the legacy vessels were in disrepair from 2010 to 2013.  In 2014, the Coast Guard returned one of these heavy icebreakers back  to service, but still has one fewer heavy icebreaker than it has historically  operated and two fewer than it needs, according to the Coast Guard\u2019s  June 2013 heavy icebreaker mission need statement. The 2017  President\u2019s budget requested $147.6 million to begin funding the first  heavy icebreaker\u2014with preliminary estimates of about $1 billion. The  Coast Guard\u2019s preliminary estimates indicate that the first new heavy  icebreaker could be available for operations in fiscal year 2023.", "River Buoy Tenders\u2014The Coast Guard fleet of river buoy tenders was  mostly constructed between the 1950s and the 1970s and are in need of  replacing.

However, the Coast Guard truncated this program and now plans to outfit  the NSC fleet with six unmanned aircraft systems for $104 million. The  Coast Guard is currently in the process of demonstrating a small  unmanned aircraft system on the NSC and, according to officials, plans to  issue a request for proposals from industry later this year to outfit the rest  of the NSC fleet.", "In conclusion, as the Coast Guard continues to field new or refurbish  existing cutters and aircraft with improved capabilities, it is important that  the Coast Guard plan for the affordability of its future portfolio so that it  can minimize the capability gaps that can occur as legacy assets reach  the end of their service lives before the new assets become operational.  We have made several recommendations in recent years intended to help  the Coast Guard plan for these future acquisitions and the difficult trade- off decisions that it will likely face. If the Coast Guard fully implements  these recommendations, it will likely position itself to provide decision  makers with critical knowledge needed to prioritize its constrained  acquisition funding. Without these efforts, the Coast Guard will continue,  as it has in recent years, to plan its future acquisitions through the annual  budgeting process, which has led to delayed and reduced capabilities. A  thorough plan regarding the affordability of its future acquisitions would  provide timely information to decision makers on how to spend scarce  taxpayer dollars in support of a modern, capable Coast Guard fleet.", "Chairman Hunter, Ranking Member Garamendi, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
