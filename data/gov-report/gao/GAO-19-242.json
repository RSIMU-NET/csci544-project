Some facilities also serve functions for which they were not designed, reducing their efficiency. In addition, the average age of depot equipment exceeded its expected useful life at 15 of the 21 depots. These factors contributed, in part, to a decline in performance over the same period. From 2007 to 2017, performance at the depots generally declined, reducing the availability of the weapon systems repaired for training and operations. Optimizing facilities and equipment at the depots can improve their maintenance efficiency. For example, the Navy estimates that its shipyard optimization effort will save over 325,000 labor days per year, which would allow an additional submarine overhaul annually.

Equipment generally  lasts for a shorter length of time, though equipment used in production  can be expected to last 10 years or more and can be costly. Because  these facility and equipment investments can take years to plan and  require significant resources, a depot\u2019s decision to invest must often take  place well in advance of the specific need the facility or equipment is  intended to serve.

Over time, this  patchwork of old, modernized, and workaround solutions for new  weapons systems can result in suboptimzed workflow that adds time and  cost to the maintenance process, which can ultimately affect readiness.  For example, at Production Plant Albany, the depot has four welding  centers in different locations throughout the depot. According to officials,  they utilized these welding centers over time as needs arose, and the  centers are not ideally located for an efficient work flow.

Work stoppages are circumstances where maintenance can  no longer proceed because the depot does not have everything it needs,  including the facility space to begin additional work or equipment needed  to perform a certain function. However, table 1 below shows that although  the services have the ability to track work stoppages, they do not all track  both facility and equipment-related maintenance delays across all their  depots. Further, even within a service, the depots may use different  methodologies. Different methodologies make it difficult to compare  across depots and identify issues.

Meanwhile, Navy aviation officials had developed some initial  goals, but expected these goals to change as their planning and  information became more detailed. The Marine Corps is in the  process of developing its plan, but officials say that they have not  determined what analytically-based goals will serve as the foundation  of their efforts. Some have told us that the only goal that is feasible by  the February 2019 deadline is to plan to develop a better plan. Our  prior work has shown that establishing analytically-based goals that  define the desired outcomes and results is a leading practice that can  enhance the success of an initiative.", "Results-oriented metrics. As we noted earlier, planners lack key  data critical for developing investment plans, such as the source and  extent of facilities- and equipment-related maintenance delays. Army,  Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps officials all noted that they were  planning to use metrics to determine the effectiveness of their  respective plans. However, without established goals for their plans,  the services cannot identify the best ways to measure progress in  meeting those goals. In addition, the Army, Navy, and Air Force do  not have metrics that tie their depot investments to specific outcomes,  such as increased performance or improved readiness. Our prior work  has shown that using results-oriented metrics enables effective  monitoring and facilitates targeting efforts to those with the greatest  effect.", "Identification of required resources, risks, and stakeholders.  Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps officials told us that they  have begun identifying the resources needed for their plans. For  example, all services have identified at least some of the project costs  that will be needed for certain depot facility and equipment  improvements. However, without having analytically-based goals to  serve as a starting point, it is impossible to fully identify the required  resources and risks because the desired end state has not been  established. Meanwhile, Army, Air Force, and Navy aviation officials  have identified many stakeholders that they intend to involve in their  optimization efforts, though in some cases these stakeholders have  not been included in the process. Service officials also noted that in  some cases they lack the necessary engineering expertise to  redesign their depot\u2019s workflow process from the ground up.", "The services have identified about $6.5 billion in backlogged  restoration and modernization projects for their depot facilities.  However, this figure is likely under stated because our prior work has  shown that depot facility projects are subject to factors such as  regulatory compliance and historical preservation costs that can be  hard to predict. Moreover, the services track their backlog of needed  facility improvements differently, which makes it difficult to determine  the full scope of investment required and to provide effective  oversight. Our prior work has shown that fully identifying 1) the  resources required to achieve the goals, 2) the stakeholders that have  equities and requisite expertise in the effort, and 3) potential risks to  the effort are leading results-oriented practices that are key to  success.", "Reporting on progress. Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps  officials told us that they are in the process of developing one-time  reports for Congress on the depots\u2019 investment needs. However,  these one-time reports will not provide Congress and decision makers  with information after their initial release. Depot optimization planning  will require time, along with sustained management and congressional  attention to successfully implement. For example, the Navy\u2019s Shipyard  Optimization Plan estimates that it will be a 20-year effort requiring  around $21 billion. However, the other initial steps taken by the  services to address the congressional request are not as focused on  the long term. For example, Army and Air Force officials told us that  their initial plans will likely be \u201cplans to get to a plan\u201d rather than a  decades-long proposal like the Navy shipyards. Our prior work has  shown that reporting on progress is a leading results-oriented practice  that holds the organization accountable for results and provides  information to senior leaders and Congress that can help keep an  effort on track and responsive to changes.", "According to service officials, the military services\u2019 depot optimization  plans will not include all the elements of a results-oriented management  approach because there is no requirement that the plans do so. Our prior  work has found that a results-oriented management approach can help  organizations remain operationally effective, efficient, and capable of meeting future requirements. Specifically, our work has highlighted the  importance of elements such as developing analytically-based goals;  using results-oriented metrics to monitor progress; fully identifying  required resources, risks, and stakeholders; and regular reporting on  progress to making reform efforts more efficient, effective, and  accountable. Congress directed the services to include some results- oriented elements in their plans, such as an identification of key steps and  an initial report to Congress. However, including these additional  elements\u2014establishing results-oriented metrics; identifying all necessary  resources, stakeholders, and associated risks; and regular reporting to  decision makers and Congress\u2014would further enhance the effectiveness  of the plans. Without a plan that includes all the key elements of a results- oriented management approach, the services risk continued deterioration  of the depots and making suboptimal investments that could hinder their  ability to efficiently and effectively support readiness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Office of the Secretary of Defense Does Not Provide Oversight of or Report on Service Efforts to Invest in Depots", "paragraphs": ["DOD has not developed a process to oversee the implementation of the  services\u2019 depot optimization plans or provide reporting on depot  investment effectiveness to DOD decision makers and Congress. Officials  with the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Materiel Readiness  stated that their role is to advocate for the service depots within DOD, and  not to develop depot policies or review service depot investments.  Specifically, they stated that they are unable to set infrastructure policy  and do not have authority to alter service investment decisions. However,  as part of an office reorganization during the summer of 2018, the  Secretary of Defense tasked the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Sustainment with developing logistics and maintenance policy. organizations have successfully used a results-oriented management  approach\u2014which includes regular monitoring and reporting\u2014to oversee  the department-wide efforts to drive significant improvements. For  example, officials with the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Logistics and Materiel Readiness created a Comprehensive Inventory  Management Improvement Plan in 2010 that DOD used to improve data  collection, develop standardized metrics, and provide increased oversight  (see sidebar). The result was that DOD was able to achieve a number of  improvements, such as reducing the value of its on-hand excess  inventory by about $2 billion, improving policy and guidance, and  establishing standardized metrics for monitoring its operations. Based on  these positive results, DOD institutionalized this process through  guidance and has continued to use it since 2010. Using this approach,  DOD was ultimately able to improve its inventory management processes  enough to have it removed from GAO\u2019s High Risk List in 2017.", "2. The team of experts assessed the data  sources and methods used by the services  and DLA and evaluated potential department- wide metrics for measuring demand  forecasting accuracy based on the available  data sources.  3. DOD implemented the standardized metrics  in a phased approach with the initial phase  focused on establishing a baseline for the  metrics.", "Through the process of establishing these  metrics, DOD developed additional areas for  exploration and improvement, such as  improving its guidance on demand  forecasting.", "DOD does report some depot information to Congress; however, the  information reported is limited in nature and does not address key issues  concerning depot facilities and equipment. For example, every other year  DOD is required to report to Congress on its core depot-level  maintenance and repair capability requirements and workload. DOD  must also report annually on the percentage of depot maintenance funds  expended during the preceding fiscal year and projected to be expended  during the current and ensuing fiscal year, for performance of depot-level  maintenance and repair workloads by the public and private sectors.  Combined with the services\u2019 reporting on their depot investment spending  (see appendix I), this information provides Congress with some  information about depot operations and performance. However, these  reports do not inform Congress about several key points, including  whether the service depots are becoming more effective and efficient or  the extent to which DOD has managed to address depot investment  backlogs. We have noted in prior work that the backlog of facilities  restoration and modernization projects at the depots can be significant,  and that reducing these backlogs will likely take a sustained effort over  many years. Furthermore, these efforts are important to improving the effectiveness and efficiency of the depots, which is important to ensuring  the readiness of military forces.", "Improving readiness is one of DOD\u2019s top priorities. Specifically, the  Secretary of Defense issued a memorandum in September 2018 about  improving readiness which set a minimum target of 80 percent mission  capability for DOD\u2019s key aviation platforms starting in fiscal year 2019.  In addition, the memorandum identified reducing operating and support  costs for these platforms every year beginning in fiscal year 2019 as  another priority. Furthermore, DOD has more broadly identified rebuilding  readiness as a priority across all the services. As noted previously, the  depots are essential to providing readiness to DOD in the form of repaired  weapon systems, and depot optimization efforts can provide a return on  investment in the form of reduced maintenance time and cost. However,  the investments made at the depots\u2014which are crucial for optimization,  throughput, and ultimately readiness\u2014often need years and millions of  dollars to execute, which means that long-term planning is essential to  ensuring that investments are made effectively. Regular monitoring of the  services\u2019 depot investment efforts could ensure that these investments  target readiness drivers to produce the greatest effect.", "Furthermore, our previous work has noted that timeframes for  improvement efforts can slip, which makes reporting to DOD decision  makers and Congress essential for holding stakeholders accountable for  making progress. For example, we reported in 2017 that even though the  Navy had developed capital investment plans in 2013 and 2015 intended  to help improve the state of the facilities and equipment at the shipyards,  backlogged restoration and maintenance projects had grown by 41  percent over 5 years which extended the amount of time required to clear  the backlog under expected funding levels. Without providing oversight  of and reporting on service depot investments, DOD risks continued  deterioration of the depots\u2019 facilities and equipment, suboptimal  investments, and reduced military readiness as the services experience  costly maintenance delays."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s 21 depots are critical for repairing and maintaining its complex  array of weapon systems. Inefficient depots contribute to longer  maintenance times, increased costs, and reduced readiness. Currently, a  majority of the depots have facilities that are in poor condition and are  relying on old equipment that is past its useful service life. The military  services spend millions of dollars annually on depot facilities and  equipment in order to meet minimum investment requirements designed  to sustain depot performance. Notwithstanding these expenditures, the  services are not consistently required to track maintenance delays  caused by facility or equipment conditions. This lack of tracking hinders  the services\u2019 ability to target investments to facility and equipment needs  that would have the greatest effect on repair times or other performance  goals. By knowing how often facility and equipment conditions lead to  work delays, the services could reduce the risk of investing in less critical  facilities and equipment. They could also reduce the risk of more work  stoppages caused by facility or equipment conditions.", "The military services are in the midst of developing congressionally- directed depot optimization plans that are expected to include both 1) an  analysis of the cost of depot facilities and equipment modernization and  2) an investment strategy. However, with the exception of the plan  designed to address the Navy shipyards, the services\u2019 plans are still in  the initial stages, and each one is expected to lack key elements of a  results-oriented management approach\u2014including analytically based  goals, results-oriented metrics, full identification of required resources and  risks, and regular reporting on progress\u2014that would help guide  investment. As the shipyard optimization plan has demonstrated, the cost  of optimization may be high and, once defined, will require sustained  management attention over many years to carry out successfully. In  addition, implementing a regular monitoring and reporting process to  provide oversight and accountability over depot investments would further  enhance DOD\u2019s ability to attain improvements at the depots significant  enough to reverse years of decline and reach the challenging goals set by  the Secretary of Defense for improving mission capability rates and  reducing operating and support costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following 13 recommendations to the Department of  Defense.", "The Secretary of the Army should ensure that Army Materiel Command  establishes measures for its depots to track facility or equipment  conditions that lead to maintenance delays.
