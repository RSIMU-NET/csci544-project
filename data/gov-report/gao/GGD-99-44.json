The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (1996 Act) requires us to track, monitor, and evaluate the Attorney General\u2019s strategy and to report our findings to Congress annually for 6 years.  Our first reportdiscussed the Immigration and Naturalization Service\u2019s (INS) progress toward implementing the Attorney General\u2019s strategy for reducing and deterring illegal entry along the southwest border.  This, our third report, provides additional information on the key issues raised in our first report. Specifically, this report addresses (1) INS\u2019 progress in implementing the southwest border strategy during fiscal year 1998, (2) interim results of the strategy, and (3) actions taken on our recommendation that the Attorney General develop and implement a plan for a formal, cost-effective, comprehensive, and systematic evaluation of the strategy.", "INS is continuing to implement its southwest border strategy.

Consistent with this planned approach, INS allocated 740 of 1,000 new agent positions authorized in fiscal year 1998 to sectors in these locations.  INS also added 18 miles of fencing in California and Arizona, increased both the proportion and total amount of time Border Patrol agents at the southwest border spent collectively on border enforcement, and deployed additional technologies such as remote video surveillance cameras.  In addition, in January 1999, INS was testing a resource and effectiveness model to help it determine the right mix of staffing, equipment, and technology for all of its Border Patrol sectors.", "To complement the Border Patrol's efforts between ports of entry, INS Inspections added 179 inspectors to southwest land-border ports of entry in fiscal year 1998 and undertook training and enforcement efforts in conjunction with other agencies located at these ports.  INS also began testing an inspections program designed to measure how well it conducted inspections of travelers.", "Although evaluative data on the overall impact of the strategy continue to be limited, available data suggested that several anticipated interim effects of the strategy have occurred. For example, apprehensions of illegal aliens continued to shift from traditionally high entry points like San Diego and El Paso to other locations along the border, as resources were deployed. Also, southwest border ports of entry inspectors apprehended an increased number of persons attempting fraudulent entry and there were reports of higher fees being charged by smugglers, which INS said indicated an increased difficulty in illegal border crossing.  However, data were not available on whether the other expected results--a decrease in attempted reentries by illegal aliens who previously have been apprehended and a reduction in border area crime--had occurred.", "Available information on the interim results of the strategy does not provide answers to the most fundamental questions surrounding INS\u2019 enforcement efforts along the southwest border.  That is, given the billions of dollars that INS has invested in implementing the strategy, how effective has the strategy been in preventing and deterring aliens from illegally crossing the border?  Pursuant to our 1997 report recommendation to conduct a comprehensive evaluation, INS contracted with private research firms in September 1998 for evaluative studies.  As of April 1999, according to INS, one contractor was working on an evaluation design and analysis plan. INS could provide us with no other information on the contractor\u2019s progress.

The strategy to strengthen the border called for \u201cprevention through deterrence,\u201d that is, raising the risk of apprehension for illegal aliens to \u201cmake it so difficult and so costly to enter this country illegally that fewer individuals even try.\u201d  The objectives of the strategy were to close off the routes most frequently used by smugglers and illegal aliens (generally through urban areas) and shift traffic through the ports of entry that inspect travelers or over areas that were more remote and difficult to cross.  With the traditional routes disrupted, INS expected that illegal alien traffic would either be deterred or forced over terrain less suited for crossing, where INS believed it would have the tactical advantage.", "To carry out the strategy, the Border Patrol was to concentrate personnel and resources in a four-phased approach starting with the areas of highest illegal alien activity, increase the time Border Patrol agents spend on border-control activities, make maximum use of physical barriers, and identify the appropriate quantity and mix of technology and personnel needed to control the border.", "To complement the Border Patrol\u2019s efforts, the strategy called for INS Inspections to enhance efforts to deter illegal entry at the ports of entry and increase the use of technology to improve management of legal traffic and commerce.", "INS\u2019 Border Patrol and Inspections are the two components chiefly responsible for deterring illegal entry along the southwest border.  These two components represented 28 percent of INS\u2019 total budget of $3.8 billion in fiscal year 1998.  INS also provides support for the strategy by allocating funds to other INS programs for computer automation, technology procurement, construction of facilities and barriers, and detention and removal of illegal aliens.", "INS\u2019 Border Patrol is responsible for preventing and detecting illegal entry along the border between the nation\u2019s ports of entry.  The Border Patrol is divided into 21 sectors, 9 of which are along the southwest border.  The Border Patrol\u2019s budget for fiscal year 1998 was $877 million, a 20-percent increase over its fiscal year 1997 budget of $730 million.  As of September 1998, there were about 8,000 Border Patrol agents nationwide.  About 7,400, or 93 percent, were located in the 9 sectors along the southwest border.

INS\u2019 Inspections fiscal year 1998 budget for land-border inspections was about $171 million, a 12-percent increase over its fiscal year 1997 budget of about $152 million.  As of September 30, 1998, Inspections had about 2,000 inspectors at land ports of entry nationwide, of which about 1,500 were located at the southwest border land ports of entry.

Consistent with the strategy, INS allocated 740 (74 percent) of the additional 1,000 Border Patrol agent positions authorized in fiscal year 1998 to phase II sectors in Arizona and Texas.", "The strategy was designed to allow for flexibility in responding to unexpected changes in the illegal immigration flow.  To address an increase in the number of apprehensions of illegal aliens in the El Centro, CA; Yuma, AZ; and Marfa, TX, sectors, INS allocated 215 agents authorized in fiscal year 1998 to these sectors, even though these sectors were not originally scheduled to receive resources until phase III of the strategy.", "As a result of these and previous staff increases, the number of agents along the southwest border increased from 3,389 as of October 1993 to 6,315 as of September 1997 to 7,357 as of September 1998, an increase of 117 percent between October 1993 and September 1998.

INS\u2019 hiring of Border Patrol agents is slowing, despite congressional direction that INS continue hiring and a study that estimated that the Border Patrol may need substantially more agents along the southwest border.  The 1996 Act states that the Border Patrol shall hire 1,000 agents each year for fiscal years 1997 through 2001.  In addition, a study commissioned by ONDCP estimated that the Border Patrol would need about 16,100 agents in the 9 southwest border sectors to control and deter unauthorized crossings.  This number is more than twice the 7,357 agents on board along the southwest border as of September 1998.", "INS does not expect to meet Congress\u2019 requirement that it hire 1,000 Border Patrol agents each year. INS brought on board 449 new Border Patrol agents between the end of September 1998 and the middle of March 1999.  However, INS lost 377 agents during the same time period, resulting in a net gain of 72 agents.  An INS headquarters official said that INS expects to fall short of its fiscal year 1999 Border Patrol agent hiring goal by 600 to 800 agents. In addition, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2000 budget does not request any additional Border Patrol agent positions. In March 1999, the INS Commissioner testified that nearly 48 percent of the Border Patrol agents had less than 3 years of experience, and law enforcement experts had indicated that it is risky to allow an agency\u2019s overall ratio of inexperienced to experienced officers to exceed 30 percent.  Also, according to an INS official, INS lacks adequate facilities to support the increased number of agents along the southwest border.

The House report accompanying INS\u2019 fiscal year 1999 appropriations required INS to prepare a report by November 15, 1998, on its plans for road and fencing improvements along the New Mexico border. INS reported to Congress on February 12, 1999, that it is developing initial assessments of border fence and road improvements for New Mexico and other border areas for archaeological and other environmental considerations.  INS expects to complete these assessments in the summer of 1999.  According to an INS headquarters official, the final report will include an integrated plan for lighting and technology in urban corridors along the southwest border and will be phased in over a 3 to 5 year period. Two specific border projects are currently scheduled for fiscal year 1999 in New Mexico.  Both projects were funded with military engineering support funds.", "With respect to automation and technology, INS received $47 million in fiscal year 1998 for increases in these areas at the border.  Of these funds, INS spent $16.2 million to expand IDENT and ENFORCE, systems designed to track and identify illegal crossers and criminal aliens, $7.5 million to purchase 26 remote video surveillance systems, $3 million to upgrade its integrated sensor and mapping system, and $1 million to purchase additional sensors.", "INS also used its automation and technology funds for the Border Patrol to initiate, along with the Army Corps of Engineers, the Geographical Information Systems (GIS) project.   The goal of the GIS project is to develop a computerized mapping system for the Border Patrol nationwide, adapting technology originally designed for military use.  The Border Patrol anticipates that GIS will be used for such purposes as (1) displaying where apprehensions are made, (2) displaying where agents or ground sensors are deployed, (3) analyzing intelligence data, and (4) displaying the terrain agents will be patrolling to help ensure officer safety.

One such effort has been the construction of dedicated commuter lanes that use technology to automatically identify vehicles and validate the identity of occupants who have passed a preclearance process.  The goal of the dedicated commuter lanes is to reduce the time it takes to complete an inspection at ports of entry by segregating high frequency, low-risk, prescreened travelers from other traffic.  Construction delays prevented INS from adding two dedicated commuter lanes at the San Ysidro, CA, port of entry as originally planned.  INS plans to complete these two lanes and a new lane in El Paso, TX, during fiscal year 1999.", "To increase enforcement efforts, southwest border ports continued activities such as using joint enforcement teams to inspect travelers and conducting multiagency cross-training, according to INS reports.", "To improve its effectiveness in deterring illegal entry, in July and August 1998, INS conducted a 2-month test of the Inspections Travelers\u2019 Examinations (INTEX) process.  INTEX consists of reinspecting a randomly selected number of travelers to determine if the primary inspector made the correct decision.  The INTEX test included 10 air and 10 land ports of entry.  Of the 3,511 travelers inspected during the INTEX test, 3,452 people, or 98 percent, were correctly admitted into the United States by the primary inspector.

These ports of entry also had a 4-percent increase in the number of false claims to United States citizenship, from 19,667 in fiscal year 1997 to 20,496 in fiscal year 1998.  It is difficult to determine whether the increases in the number of fraudulent documents intercepted and false claims to U.S. citizenship were a result of actual increases in illegal entry attempts at the ports and/or a result of greater efforts made to detect fraud."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Evidence of Increased Smuggling Fees", "paragraphs": ["As it became more difficult to cross the border illegally, INS anticipated an increase in fees charged by alien smugglers and the use of more sophisticated smuggling tactics.  There is some evidence that these interim effects have occurred.  For example, a January 1999 report by the Tucson Border Patrol sector indicates the cost of smuggling and the sophistication of smuggling techniques through that sector increased.  According to this report, based on interviews with apprehended illegal aliens conducted by personnel from Tucson\u2019s Anti-Smuggling Unit, the cost of being smuggled from the border to the interior of the United States had increased.  For example, the cost of being smuggled 1,000 miles reportedly increased from about $1,000 in fiscal year 1996 to an estimated $1,350 in fiscal year 1998. At the same time, the Tucson report also stated that alien smugglers were using more sophisticated smuggling tactics.  The report attributed these changes to the increase in Tucson sector personnel that resulted from the implementation of the border strategy.", "Currently, INS is expanding data collection on smuggling fees across the entire southwest border.  In fiscal year 1998, the El Paso Intelligence Center collected baseline data for a 2-month period, on fees charged for smuggling Central American and Mexican aliens from the southwest border to secondary staging areas and final destination points or work locations.  A summary of the findings in INS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 Priorities and Performance Management Plan review stated that smuggling fees from border areas to various cities in the interior of the United States, such as New York and Los Angeles, ranged from $600 to $1,200.  Although the review stated that \u201cthe quantity and quality of the data were not comprehensive,\u201d INS intends to refine its data collection efforts in fiscal year 1999. INS officials also cited concerns that INS\u2019 collection and analysis of intelligence data on alien smuggling is limited because some INS offices do not have full-time intelligence officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "INS Beginning to Measure Attempted Reentries", "paragraphs": ["The strategy postulated that there would be a decrease in recidivism--that is, in attempted reentries by illegal aliens who previously had been apprehended--as control was gained in particular locations.  According to INS, this would be an indicator that the strategy was deterring illegal alien entry.  INS planned to use IDENT, its automated fingerprinting system, to identify recidivists and analyze their crossing patterns along the southwest border.", "In our 1997 report, we stated that computer problems had affected the usefulness of IDENT data and INS\u2019 ability to track recidivism over several years.  At that time, INS officials told us that although IDENT data gathered since January 1996 were reliable and accurate, they had not done any analysis to examine trends in recidivism.", "In April 1999, INS officials told us that since IDENT began as a prototype in October 1994, several modifications have been made to the system\u2019s hardware and software, which have resulted in improved matching and data accuracy.  In addition, the proportion of apprehended aliens enrolled in IDENT has been increasing as more Border Patrol sectors have begun using IDENT.  For example, during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1998, 85 percent of the illegal aliens apprehended by southwest border sectors were enrolled in the IDENT system compared with 56 percent during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 1997.", "As a result, INS determined that IDENT data beginning in October 1997 were sufficiently complete and reliable for internal analysis.  INS officials said that, as of April 1999, INS\u2019 Statistics Branch was analyzing this more recent IDENT data.

A March 1998 review of IDENT implementation on the southwest border by Justice\u2019s OIG found that less than two-thirds of apprehended illegal aliens were being enrolled in IDENT.  The OIG reported that, although IDENT and related biometrics technologies could be useful in many INS operations, \u201cINS is not yet making consistent and effective use of IDENT as a tool for border enforcement.\u201d  The report said that (1) not all apprehended aliens were enrolled in IDENT, (2) INS was not entering the fingerprints of all deported aliens and known criminal aliens into the IDENT lookout database, and (3) INS needed to coordinate with the U.S. Attorneys for each district along the southwest border to establish a border enforcement and prosecution strategy that takes advantage of IDENT.  The report also noted that \u201cthere were virtually no controls in place to ensure the quality of the data entered into the IDENT lookout database.\" In March 1999, an official with the Justice OIG told us that INS had satisfactorily responded to most of the report\u2019s recommendations.  For example, INS was entering a greater proportion of apprehended aliens into IDENT.  To ensure deported and criminal aliens were in IDENT, INS established new procedures and criteria for placing individuals in the IDENT lookout database.  INS instructed Border Patrol Sector chiefs to initiate contact with their local U.S. Attorney to inform them about the usefulness of IDENT in prosecuting recidivists and alien smugglers. Lastly, according to this official, INS added additional data integrity checks to ensure the accuracy of data entered into IDENT.", "INS plans to deploy IDENT systems nationwide. According to INS\u2019 fiscal year 1998 Priorities and Performance Management Plan review, INS deployed IDENT at 194 additional locations in fiscal year 1998, exceeding its goal of 100 locations and bringing the total IDENT locations nationwide to 370.  However, the use of IDENT has been uneven at these locations. During fiscal year 1998, the percentage of apprehended aliens enrolled in the IDENT system at locations nationwide varied from 17 to 90 percent, with an average of 85 percent, just short of INS\u2019 targeted goal of 88 percent.

The crime statistics from these locations identify crimes committed\u2014such as homicide, rape, robbery, burglary\u2014but not persons arrested or their immigration status.

Similarly, if the strategy\u2019s goals are not being achieved, INS should determine the reasons they are not.  Thus, in our 1997 report we recommended that the Attorney General develop and implement a plan for a formal, cost-effective, systematic evaluation of the strategy.", "Pursuant to our recommendation, INS entered into agreements in September 1998 with three independent contractors to provide evaluative studies.

The available data indicated that some of the changes anticipated by the strategy have occurred. For example, traditional routes of entry for illegal immigration, such as San Diego and El Paso, have shown significant declines in illegal alien apprehensions, while apprehensions in other areas have increased. While it does not appear that there has been an increase in the overall number of undocumented migrant deaths, some evidence exists that deaths resulting from attempted crossings in remote areas are increasing, which is an unintended consequence of the strategy.  In addition, there is some evidence of increases in the number of attempted illegal entries at the ports of entry and increased smuggling fees.  However, data are still lacking on some key aspects of the strategy, including the impact of the strategy on reducing attempted reentries of illegal aliens and reducing crime in border cities.", "As we recommended in our 1997 report, a comprehensive and systematic evaluation of the border strategy would go a long way towards providing information about the effectiveness of the strategy in reducing and deterring illegal entry.  The evaluation studies that INS is funding, and INS\u2019 plans to use findings from these studies as a baseline for future evaluation, could potentially begin to provide such needed information.
