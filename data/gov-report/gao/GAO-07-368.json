Specifically, FBI did not consistently (1) configure network devices and services to prevent unauthorized insider access and ensure system integrity; (2) identify and authenticate users to prevent unauthorized access; (3) enforce the principle of least privilege to ensure that authorized access was necessary and appropriate; (4) apply strong encryption techniques to protect sensitive data on its networks; (5) log, audit, or monitor security-related events; (6) protect the physical security of its network; and (7) patch key servers and workstations in a timely manner. Taken collectively, these weaknesses place sensitive information transmitted on the network at risk of unauthorized disclosure or modification, and could result in a disruption of service, increasing the bureau's vulnerability to insider threats. These weaknesses existed, in part, because FBI had not fully implemented key information security program activities for the critical network reviewed. FBI has developed an agencywide information security program, which includes an organization to monitor and protect the bureau's information systems from external attacks and insider misuse and to serve as the central focal point of contact for near-real-time security monitoring. However, shortcomings exist with certain program elements for the network, including an outdated risk assessment, incomplete security plan, incomplete specialized security training, insufficient testing, untimely remediation of weaknesses, and inadequate service continuity planning.

Additionally, FBI had  implemented a specialized security training program that identified a  number of roles with significant security responsibilities. Each role had a  required computer-based specialized training curriculum, and FBI tracked  users\u2019 progress and completion of courses. However, for fiscal year 2006,  only 17 of 44 individuals reviewed had completed the required specialized  training for their role; 11 of 44 individuals had not completed any  specialized training; the remainder had completed some but not all of the  training. FBI officials explained that the specialized training program was  new in fiscal year 2006 and that they had initial problems identifying  individuals with significant information security responsibilities along with  obtaining an appropriate number of licenses for the training.

An effective program of ongoing tests and  evaluations can be used to identify and correct information security  weaknesses. This type of oversight demonstrates management\u2019s  commitment to the security program, reminds employees of their roles  and responsibilities, and identifies and mitigates areas of noncompliance  and ineffectiveness. Although control tests may encourage compliance  with security policies, the full benefits of testing are not achieved unless  the test results are analyzed by security specialists and business managers  and used as a means of identifying new problem areas, reassessing the  appropriateness of existing controls, and identifying the need for new  controls. FISMA requires that agencies test and evaluate the information  security controls of their systems and that the frequency of such tests be  based on risk, but occur no less than annually. Similarly, the FBI  Certification & Accreditation Handbook requires periodic testing to  ensure that the accredited system has maintained its documented  configuration baseline and to identify new vulnerabilities that may be  inherent in the system and not previously identified.", "Although FBI had various initiatives under way to test and evaluate its  network, the tests were not comprehensive. The network had undergone  certification testing as part of FBI\u2019s C&A process, and ESOC conducts  periodic system scans to detect vulnerabilities on its network. However,  the bureau, as noted earlier, did not appropriately consider risks  associated with the current operating environment. Further, the scans  conducted by the monitoring group were limited in capabilities since the  group had not been given administrative access to conduct these tests. As  a result, certain vulnerabilities were not detected.

To accomplish this, remedial action plans  should be developed and progress tracked for each deficiency. FBI\u2019s  Certification & Accreditation Handbook requires that plans of actions  and milestones serve as a management tool to address corrective actions  associated with system deficiencies and any new vulnerabilities.", "FBI did not address remedial actions in a timely manner. For example, the  plan of actions and milestones for the network included 15 unresolved  weaknesses that were over 2 years old. Eight of these outstanding  weaknesses were categorized as \u201chigh vulnerability\u201d or \u201cvery high  vulnerability\u201d weaknesses.

Although the bureau had a 2004  contingency plan that reflected the planned Trilogy network environment,  the plan did not reflect the current internal network operating  environment. FBI also had a contingency plan for its data center, but this  plan did not cover the network. Further, there were neither documented  test plans nor test results indicating continuity of operations testing had  been performed specifically for the network. According to FBI officials,  redundancy has been implemented in the internal network to ensure high  availability.

However, he  took exception to the report\u2019s assertion that the collective result of the  weaknesses presents an increased risk to FBI information. The bureau  does not believe that it has placed sensitive information at an  unacceptable risk for unauthorized disclosure, modification, or insider  threat exploitation. We believe that until weaknesses identified in network  devices and services, identification and authentication, authorization,  cryptography, audit and monitoring, physical security and patch  management are addressed, increased risk to FBI\u2019s critical network  remains. Further, as noted in our conclusion, the lack of a comprehensive  inventory of the current network operating environment\u2014an  enterprisewide view\u2014compounds the effect of these weaknesses.", "He also stated that FBI has made significant strides in reducing risk since  the Robert Hanssen espionage investigation. For example, according to  the Chief Information Officer, since its inception in 2002, the bureau\u2019s  Information Assurance section has taken FBI from an agency wherein only  8 percent of information systems were accredited to maintaining 100  percent accreditation of its major systems. Further, he stated that the  bureau has increased its monitoring capabilities and established a  comprehensive vulnerability assessment program. As stated in our report,  we acknowledged that FBI has developed an agencywide information  security program. However, shortcomings existed in how the bureau  implemented certain elements of the program for the network. For  example, the network risk assessment associated with the accreditation  process was outdated and incomplete. Other shortcomings included an  incomplete security plan, incomplete specialized training, insufficient  testing, untimely remediation of weaknesses and inadequate service  continuity planning. Although positive efforts have been made, until FBI  fully and effectively implements key activities of the information security  program associated with its network, security controls will likely remain  inadequate or inconsistently applied, and the bureau will have limited  assurance that sensitive data will be adequately protected against  unauthorized disclosure or modification, or that network services will not  be interrupted.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
