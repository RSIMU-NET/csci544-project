It has applied this flexibility to admit substantial numbers of foreign workers, in addition to admitting tourists and foreign investors. The covenant grants Congress the right to apply federal immigration law to the CNMI. On December 11, 2007, the House of Representatives passed legislation applying U.S. immigration law to the CNMI; as of report issuance, this legislation was pending in the Senate. If passed, it will amend the covenant and will apply federal immigration law to the CNMI 1 year after the legislation's enactment, subject to a transition period that begins 1 year after enactment but may be delayed 180 days. GAO was asked to review key provisions of the pending legislation, current U.S. immigration law, and current CNMI immigration law, particularly regarding (1) foreign workers, (2) tourists, and (3) foreign investors. The Departments of Homeland Security and the Interior generally agreed with the findings in this report, and the Department of Labor provided no comments. The CNMI government disagreed with some key findings related to GAO's interpretation of the legislation. GAO continues to interpret the legislation as stated in this report."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The pending legislation applies U.S. immigration law to the CNMI and provides federal agencies some flexibility in preserving the CNMI's access to workers, tourists, and foreign investors as it transitions to a federal system. However, without implementing regulations, key details remain unknown. During the transition period, foreign workers may be admitted to the CNMI through exemptions from caps that restrict the number of U.S. visas for nonimmigrant workers. Workers not otherwise eligible under federal law may be admitted through a CNMI-only permit program, which may be extended indefinitely for up to 5 years at a time. Current workers who do not obtain U.S. immigration status may continue to live and work in the CNMI for a limited time. During and after the transition period, CNMI employers also can petition for nonimmigrant and employment-based permanent immigration status for workers under the same procedures as other U.S. employers. However, access to foreign workers in low-skill jobs will be limited after the end of the transition period in 2013 or 2014 and after any extensions of the CNMI-only permit program, because the demand for certain U.S. nonimmigrant worker visas recently has exceeded the supply and because no nonimmigrant visas are available for workers in continuous low-skill positions. While fees for the CNMI-only work permit will be determined by federal regulations and are unknown, the current fees for U.S. foreign worker permits that would apply after the end of the transition period and any extensions range higher than the CNMI's current foreign worker permit fees. The pending legislation establishes a joint visa waiver program by adding the CNMI to an existing Guam visa waiver program. The program exempts tourism and business visitors from certain countries to the CNMI and Guam from the standard U.S. visa documentation requirements. Citizens of countries not included in the CNMI-Guam or other U.S. visa waiver programs may apply for U.S. visitor visas, which require in-person applications and higher fees than the CNMI currently assesses. Changes in tourists' access to the CNMI will depend on the countries included in the CNMI-Guam visa waiver program. Until the joint program's implementing regulations are established, GAO cannot determine whether the program will be more or less restrictive than the current CNMI and Guam waiver programs. After federal immigration law applies, new CNMI foreign investors must meet federal law's more stringent investment requirements to obtain immigrant investor status, which allows investors to petition for U.S. permanent resident status that is currently unavailable in the CNMI. New investors also could apply for nonimmigrant treaty investor status. In addition, the pending legislation allows current CNMI foreign investors to convert to CNMI-only nonimmigrant treaty investors during the transition period."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI) is subject to  most U.S. laws, and the United States has complete responsibility and  authority for CNMI defense and foreign affairs.

The CNMI currently retains legislative authority over  most immigration laws. While it does not have embassies or issue visas in  other countries, it regulates entry to the CNMI through a permit system.  The CNMI recently passed a bill that establishes new immigration and  labor rules for foreign workers in the CNMI, as of January 1, 2008. These  rules continue to provide for, among other things, a nonresident worker  entry permit for noncitizens entering the CNMI whom the CNMI  Department of Labor has certified as eligible for temporary work.  Employers seeking work permits for their temporary workers must be able  to demonstrate that they advertised the position and were unable to find a  qualified CNMI resident, with some exemptions available. CNMI law also  contains an employment preference for citizens and permanent residents,  requiring that most employers in the CNMI hire at least 20 percent of their  employees from these groups, increasing in phases to 30 percent by 2013.  Employers with fewer than five employees are exempt from this  requirement, and the CNMI Secretary of Labor may grant waivers for  construction projects of limited duration and for light manufacturing.  CNMI law currently includes a general moratorium on hiring foreign  workers, under which employers can renew contracts for foreign workers  and can replace current workers with transfers for certain occupations but  cannot add to the total number of foreign workers employed in the CNMI.  Additional exemptions from the moratorium exist for visitor industry  supporting services, certain light manufacturing operations, employers  who have hired over 35 percent of their employees from CNMI citizens,  and major new developments that benefit the CNMI economy.

The Department of Labor had no comments. We also provided a draft for  technical review to the U.S. Department of State, and State had no  comments. The Departments of Homeland Security and the Interior  generally agreed with our findings regarding the pending legislation. The  CNMI government disagreed with some key findings related to the pending  legislation.", "The Department of Homeland Security commented that aliens in the CNMI  could seek protection from persecution or torture, saying that the  department is mindful of U.S. government treaty obligations during the  transition period. While we had included information on this topic in the  draft report, we further clarified the information in response to the  department\u2019s comments. The department also noted that the pending  legislation would have direct effects on U.S. Customs and Border  Protection facilities, staffing, and training requirements. This topic was  beyond the scope of our study.", "The Department of the Interior generally agreed with our findings, saying  that the report presents a fair and objective study on the effect of the  pending legislation.", "The CNMI government disagreed with our analysis of the legislation in  three particular areas. First, the CNMI government contended that the  legislation allows the exemptions from the numerical limitation on H visas  to be extended beyond the end of the transition period in 2013. We  continue to interpret the legislation to allow for an extension of the CNMI- only work permit program beyond 2013 at the discretion of the Secretary  of Labor but not to allow for an extension beyond 2013 of other provisions  of the transition program, including the exemptions from the numerical  limitations on H visas. Because the provision of the pending legislation  authorizing exemptions from the H visa caps for aliens entering the CNMI  confers no specific authority for extending this exemption beyond 2013,  nor does any other related provision confer this authority, the exemption  could not be extended beyond 2013 without further legislation. Second,  the CNMI disagreed with our interpretation that the H visas issued under  the cap exemptions are a separate process from the CNMI-only work  permit program. According to the CNMI\u2019s interpretation, employers of  workers admitted under H visas would have to obtain a CNMI-only work  permit. We continue to interpret the H visa cap exemptions and the CNMI- only permit program as separate processes, because the CNMI-only work  permits are to be issued for workers who would not otherwise be eligible  for admission under U.S. immigration law. As H visas are clearly a part of  U.S. immigration law, workers entering the CNMI with an H visa are  necessarily excluded from the CNMI-only permit process, as are workers  entering under all other available immigrant and nonimmigrant categories  in U.S. immigration law. Third, the CNMI contended that we should not  base any further work regarding the impact of the legislation on the CNMI  economy on a single legal interpretation. While the legislation is highly  technical, we believe we have provided a reasonable, objective  interpretation of the legislation that is consistent with the implementing  agencies\u2019 views. As such, we believe our interpretation of the legislation  can be used appropriately as the basis of further work on the potential  economic impact of the legislation, while acknowledging the range of  possible federal decisions regarding implementation of the legislation.  Officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the agency  responsible for implementing and administering the provisions of the  transition period under the pending legislation, agreed in interviews with  our interpretations of the above provisions.

The CNMI government contended that the legislation allows the  exemptions from the numerical limitation on H visas to be extended  beyond the end of the transition period in 2013. We continue to  interpret the legislation to allow for an extension of the CNMI-only  work permit program beyond 2013 at the discretion of the Secretary of  Labor, but not to allow for an extension beyond 2013 of other  provisions of the transition program, including the exemptions from  the numerical limitations on H visas. As shown in appendix V,  subsection 6(a)(2) of H.R. 3079 establishes a transition period  \u201cbeginning on the transition program effective date and ending on  December 31, 2013, except as provided in subsections (b) and (d).\u201d  Subsection 6(b) authorizes aliens to enter the CNMI with H visas  without counting against the numerical caps established by law for H  visas but confers no specific authority for extending this exemption  beyond 2013. Subsection 6(d) authorizes CNMI-only work permits to  be issued to employers for nonimmigrant workers who are not  otherwise admissible under federal law. Subsection 6(d)(5) allows the  Secretary of Labor to ascertain the labor needs of the CNMI and  \u201cdetermine whether an extension of up to 5 years of the provisions of  this subsection is necessary to ensure an adequate number of workers\u201d  are available in the CNMI. The \u201cprovisions of this subsection\u201d refers  only to the provisions of subsection 6(d), the authorization for the  CNMI-only work permit, and not to other programs available during  the transition period. As the exemption from the numerical limitation  on H visas is contained in subsection 6(b), the exemption could not be  extended beyond 2013 without further legislation. Officials from the  Department of Homeland Security, the agency responsible for  implementing and administering the provisions of the transition period  under the pending legislation, agreed in interviews with our  interpretations of these provisions. The Department of Labor, which  will have the authority to extend the CNMI-only work permit beyond  2013, reviewed the draft report and provided no comments. The  Department of the Interior generally agreed with our findings.  2.  The CNMI government relied in part on legislative history to support  its assertion that the H cap extensions can be extended past 2013. We  reviewed the House Report on which the CNMI relied and found  nothing inconsistent with our interpretation as stated in this report.  3.  The CNMI government disagreed with our interpretation that the H  visas authorized in subsection 6(b) are a separate process from the  CNMI-only work permits authorized in subsection 6(d). According to  the CNMI\u2019s interpretation, employers of workers admitted under H  visas would have to obtain a CNMI-only work permit. However, the  legislation does not state that H visas are to be provided under the  CNMI-only permit work program. Also, subsection 6(d)(2) states that  CNMI-only work permits are to be issued for workers \u201cwho would not  otherwise be eligible for admission under the Immigration and  Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. \u00a7 1101 et seq.).\u201d The CNMI\u2019s contention that  foreign workers who enter the CNMI with an H visa must also obtain  the CNMI-only work permit directly conflicts with the language of the  legislation. As H visas are clearly a part of the Immigration and  Nationality Act, workers entering the CNMI with an H visa are  necessarily excluded from the CNMI-only permit process. Presumably,  the federally-administered permitting process for employers of H visa  holders that is already in place in the United States would apply to H  visa holders in the CNMI once federalization occurs, though the  specifics of implementation will be at the discretion of the Department  of Homeland Security. Officials from the Department of Homeland  Security, which has responsibility for implementing the legislation,  agreed in interviews with our interpretation of this provision. The  Department of the Interior generally agreed with our findings.  4.  The CNMI incorrectly stated that \u201cthe GAO draft report concludes also  that all such H visas granted during the period up to December 31,  2013, must terminate no later than that date.\u201d While the caps would  limit the availability of new H visas for CNMI workers after the  transition period ends on December 31, 2013 or on December 31, 2014,  we note that the length of admission and other terms and conditions  for CNMI-only H nonimmigrants will be determined by DHS in its  implementation of the transition program and, according to DHS  officials, will adhere to federal requirements currently in place for H  visa holders the federal requirements. According to the current federal  requirements, (1) specialty workers who are admitted under H-1B  visas may not be authorized to stay any longer than 3 years initially,  and up to 6 years with extensions, and may not seek readmission for 1  year after leaving, and (2) foreign workers admitted under H-2B visas  are authorized to stay for up to 1 year initially, and up to 3 years with  extensions.  5.  The CNMI government contended that we should not base any further  work regarding the impact of the legislation on the CNMI economy on  a single legal interpretation. While the legislation is highly technical,  we believe we have provided a reasonable, objective interpretation of  the legislation that is consistent with the implementing agencies\u2019  views. Officials from the Department of Homeland Security, the  primary implementing agency for the legislation, agreed in interviews  with our interpretation of this legislation. The Department of Labor,  the agency with the ability to extend the CNMI-only work permit  program, reviewed the draft report and provided no comments. As  such, we believe our interpretation of the legislation can be used  appropriately as the basis of further work on the potential economic  impact of the legislation. However, we agree such work should  acknowledge the range of possible federal decisions regarding  implementation of the legislation and regarding any extensions of the  CNMI-only permit program.  6.  The CNMI government suggested that we include the text of the  pending legislation in this report. We have included the text of H.R.  3079, passed by the House, in appendix V.  7.
