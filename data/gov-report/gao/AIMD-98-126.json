Such information is critical for use by managers and policymakers in making difficult decisions as well as measuring agency performance and the full cost of government activities as envisioned by the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993. Financial management personnel are now required to use new federal accounting standards that are intended to provide greater accountability and enhanced decision-making in a cost-effective manner by enhancing existing accounting and reporting requirements.

We have issued several reports pointing out that DOD has not established policies nor begun to implement many of the accounting requirements that were being phased in and are now effective.Consequently, DOD personnel are now confronting an enormous financial management improvement challenge, the most difficult in the federal government. Training is key to bringing DOD financial managers up-to-date and keeping them current on enhanced accounting standards and legislative requirements. Technical accounting and financial training can thereby improve the performance of financial management personnel so that they can more effectively lead the department\u2019s efforts to pass the test of a financial statement audit and achieve one of the key objectives of the CFO Act.", "This report represents the culmination of an effort we undertook to survey the backgrounds and training of key financial managers, not only throughout various DOD component organizations, but also in selected large state governments and private sector organizations.

It has acknowledged responsibility for the world\u2019s largest dedicated infrastructure, reporting that its physical plant has an estimated value of about $500 billion. In addition, based on data provided by DOD, the department has a network of approximately 32,000 financial management personnel, including the positions held by the 1,409 key financial managers responding to our prior surveys.

In its 1997 report to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), DOD reported that it had 156 financial management systems. However, as we reported, DOD relies on a significant number of other financial management systems and processes operated by DOD entities outside the DOD Comptroller\u2019s organization, such as acquisition, logistics, and personnel, that provide financial data to DOD\u2019s accounting systems. These \u201cmixed\u201d systems are part of the financial systems network at DOD. Further exacerbating the task of DOD financial personnel operating with such a large network of systems are the systems\u2019 seriously deficient processes and controls. For example, the DOD Inspector General recently concluded, in part, that DOD\u2019s financial management systems did not comply with federal accounting standards.", "The diversity, complexity, and size of even the largest private sector corporations pale in comparison to DOD. For example, the company that ranked first in Fortune\u2019s April 1998 list of the 500 largest companies showed assets of about $230 billion, less than 25 percent of DOD\u2019s reported assets for fiscal year 1997.

Specifically, the disciplined process required to generate reliable, accurate financial data has been in place in the private sector for over 60 years following the 1929 stock market crash. In state governments, this disciplined process was enhanced by the passage of the Single Audit Act of 1984. In comparison, former Secretary of Defense William J.

In this regard, we cited numerous examples of Navy and DFAS personnel not performing routine required reconciliations or investigating and resolving unusual trends in large year-to-year account balance variations. More recently, in October 1997, in the course of its work on the department\u2019s working capital funds, which are intended to operate on a businesslike basis, the DOD Inspector General noted continuing pervasive weaknesses in the personnel area, including incomplete or no training, insufficient management oversight, and an inability to respond to a rapidly changing accounting environment.

Although DOD has not yet established a coordinated agencywide training program for its financial management personnel, there are a number of initiatives planned or underway throughout DOD that are intended to enhance the professionalism of the financial management workforce. For example, DFAS officials informed us that beginning with fiscal year 1997 they have centralized control over training funds at DFAS headquarters and have allocated 3 percent of its budget for training its financial management staff\u2014an amount within the range of that spent for training reported by state government and private sector respondents.

The plan calls for job series-specific competencies and recognizes that these competencies may be obtained through a combination of education, training, and work experiences. According to DFAS, a number of sources were considered in developing these competencies, including prior studies by JFMIP and the Office of Personnel Management. In addition, according to a DFAS training official, DFAS contracted with the Office of Personnel Management to obtain assistance in developing the overall career development concept and in obtaining data on core competencies related to DFAS job functions.

In support of this modification, DOD stated that factors such as a lack of training funds can impede an employee\u2019s ability to attain all required training within a specified period.", "We continue to recommend that minimum training requirements be established. Given the poor training record of DOD financial managers in the past\u2014as we reported, 53 percent of our survey respondents had received no accounting or financial training over a 2-year period\u2014and the range of new accounting and systems issues to be mastered, it is imperative that training requirements be established as soon as possible. Without stated minimum requirements and the strong commitment to training that they would represent, it is unlikely that the objectives of DFAS\u2019 Career Development Plan will be achieved. Furthermore, if the department is committed to providing training and enhancing the quality of its financial management workforce, adequate funding will be made available for training.", "DOD also stated that tracking achievement of required training would be extremely difficult to implement. We disagree with DOD\u2019s position. Some level of tracking is obviously necessary to monitor staff progress in meeting the requirements; however, developing and implementing a tracking system need not be a difficult task. For example, in the acquisition community, the planned tracking is the responsibility of the approximately 100,000 acquisition employees and their supervisors. Central management oversight tracking is being planned at the component level (about 50 components throughout DOD have acquisition personnel), not at the individual level. For DOD Inspector General audit staff, fulfillment of training requirements is monitored centrally and periodic reports are provided to staff and supervisors which show the status of training received at that point in the 2-year period.", "Also, although DOD\u2019s response refers to the difficulty in levying penalties for employees not meeting annual training requirements, our recommendation does not call for DOD to levy penalties. The overall purpose of these recommended requirements is not to penalize staff or to create an adversarial relationship between the employee, the supervisor, and the organization, as DOD\u2019s response implies. Rather, the purpose is to ensure that as many financial managers as possible are provided the up-to-date, technical training they need to carry out their responsibilities. Other functions that currently offer a continuous learning environment do not seek to penalize staff. For example, the DOD Inspector General\u2019s office requires its audit staff to complete 80 hours of training over a 2-year period. A grace period of 2 months is provided for staff to complete this requirement if training has not been completed at the end of the 2-year cycle. In the acquisition community, the plans allow for waivers to be granted if a staff member is unable to meet the stated standard after an initial 3-month grace period. The waivers can be extended for an additional 2 years, if specified conditions are met.", "In addition, DOD\u2019s response states that it may not be feasible or beneficial to specify training requirements for all financial managers at all levels. The DFAS plan, which our recommendation addresses, specifies those financial management job series and grade levels that are covered by the plan. The job series are Accounting (GS-510), Auditing (GS-511), Budget Analysis (GS-560), and Financial Administration and Program (GS-501). The grade levels are GS-7 through Senior Executive. The plan states that, as of July 1996, these job series and grade levels include nearly 5,500 positions at DFAS. These and comparable military positions are generally the same as the key financial managers included in our surveys, which we identified in conjunction with DOD.", "Further, DOD did not fully agree with our recommendation that the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) develop and implement a formalized, structured training program for financial management personnel throughout the department in conjunction with the DOD Chancellor for Education and Professional Development. Rather, DOD stated that DFAS will be charged with developing a generic plan that can be used as a model, but that individual organizations should be allowed flexibility in implementing the career management plans. While it is appropriate for DFAS to develop a model or baseline plan for DOD\u2019s financial management staff, the role of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) is critical in both the development and implementation of formalized, structured training programs for financial management personnel throughout the department. Although individual organizations may have to tailor such programs for the specific needs of their staffs, the oversight of the Comptroller is crucial to ensure that such training is consistent and as current as possible throughout the department. Moreover, as stated in the report, the CFO Act specifically charges agency CFOs with responsibility for overseeing the training of personnel to carry out agency financial management functions.", "In addition, regarding our recommendation that these training programs be developed in conjunction with the DOD Chancellor for Education and Professional Development, the Chancellor would not be able to carry out the responsibilities defined in the Secretary of Defense\u2019s 1997 Defense Reform Initiative if he or she were not involved in the coordination and administration of the training of DOD\u2019s financial managers.", "This report contains recommendations to you.
