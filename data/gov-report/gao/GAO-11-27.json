The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Rural Health Care Program, established in 1997, provides discounts on rural health care providers' telecommunications and information services (primary program) and funds broadband infrastructure and services (pilot program). GAO was asked to review (1) how FCC has managed the primary program to meet the needs of rural health care providers, and how well the program has addressed those needs; (2) how FCC's design and implementation of the pilot program affected participants; and (3) FCC's performance goals and measures for both the primary program and the pilot program, and how these goals compare with the key characteristics of successful performance goals and measures. GAO reviewed program documents and data, interviewed program staff and relevant stakeholders, and surveyed all 61 pilot program participants with recent participation in the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FCC has not conducted an assessment of the telecommunications needs of rural health care providers as it has managed the primary Rural Health Care Program, which limits FCC's ability to determine how well the program has addressed those needs. Participation in the primary program has increased, and some rural health care providers report that they are dependent on the support received from the program. For example, a provider in Alaska has used program funds to increase the use of telemedicine, which has reduced patient wait times and travel costs. FCC has been successful in disbursing over 86 percent of all committed funds. However, FCC has disbursed only $327 million in total over the 12 years of the primary program's operation-- less than any single year's $400 million funding cap. FCC has frequently stated that the primary program is underutilized and has made a number of changes to the program, including the creation of the pilot program. Currently, FCC is proposing to replace portions of the primary program with a new broadband services program. However, without a needs assessment, FCC cannot determine how well the current program is targeting those needs--and whether the program is, in fact, underutilized--or ensure that a new program will target needs any better. FCC's poor planning and communication during the design and implementation of the pilot program caused delays and difficulties for pilot program participants. FCC did not consult with the program's administrator, other federal agencies, or relevant stakeholders prior to announcing the program, nor did it request public comment on its design. In addition, FCC called for applications to participate in the pilot program before it fully established pilot program requirements. FCC added additional program requirements after the pilot program began, and survey respondents indicated that program guidance was not provided in an effective manner. Despite these difficulties, most participants were positive about the assistance provided by program officials and reported that the benefits they anticipate receiving from the pilot program outweigh the costs of participating. However, the entire program has been delayed and projects have struggled to meet requirements that were not clearly defined at the beginning of the program. FCC has not developed specific performance goals for the Rural Health Care Program and has developed ineffective performance measures. The performance measures are limited for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that FCC has set no specific performance goals to which to link them. In addition, FCC has not evaluated the performance of the primary Rural Health Care Program and has no evaluation plan for the pilot program. Without reliable performance information, FCC does not have the data that it needs to make critical policy decisions about the overall Rural Health Care Program. If FCC does not correct these deficits in performance management, it may perpetuate the same performance management weaknesses in its stewardship of the new rural health care programs that it has proposed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the FCC Chairman assess rural health care providers' needs, consult with knowledgeable stakeholders, develop performance goals and measures, and develop and execute sound performance evaluation plans.

Telemedicine technologies can allow rural  patients to receive, through remote access, medical diagnosis or patient  care, often from specialists who are located in urban areas or university  hospitals. Increased use of video consultation, remote patient monitoring,  and electronic health records enabled by telemedicine technologies hold  the promise of improving health care quality, safety, and efficiency. The  Federal Communications Commission\u2019s (FCC) Rural Health Care  Universal Service Support Mechanism\u2014or Rural Health Care Program\u2014 was created pursuant to the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (1996 Act)  and enables rural health care providers to receive (1) telecommunications  services at rates comparable to that of their urban counterparts and   (2) access to the advanced telecommunications and information services  necessary for health care delivery. Access to reasonably priced  telecommunications services and Internet access services affords rural  health care providers the ability to provide important telemedicine  technologies that can improve the care of patients while maximizing  limited resources.", "Despite these benefits, FCC has stated that its Rural Health Care Program  is underutilized, in part, because rural health care providers\u2019 needs have  shifted away from discounted telecommunications and Internet services,  and toward the broadband networks and facilities needed to support  advanced telemedicine applications. Thus, in 2006, FCC established a  separate pilot program within the Rural Health Care Program to provide  funding for broadband infrastructure and services. Also, in March 2010, at  the direction of Congress, an FCC task force developed and released a  National Broadband Plan to provide a road map for attaining universal  access to broadband capability. As a result of recommendations in the  National Broadband Plan, FCC is currently reviewing its design of the  Rural Health Care Program and has proposed two new rural health care  programs\u2014the Health Broadband Services Program and the Health  Infrastructure Program\u2014in a July 2010 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking  (NPRM). FCC sought comment on these and other reforms, which could  be implemented by the beginning of the next funding year on July 1, 2011.", "In response to your request that we examine the operation of the Rural  Health Care Program, this report addresses three main questions:    How has FCC managed the primary Rural Health Care Program to meet  the needs of rural health care providers, and how well has the program  addressed those needs?", "How have FCC\u2019s design and implementation of the pilot program affected  participants?", "What are FCC\u2019s performance goals and measures for the Rural Health Care  Program, and how do these goals compare with the key characteristics of  successful performance goals and measures?", "For each of these questions, we reviewed FCC documents, including FCC  orders and requests for comment on the Rural Health Care Program, as  well as written comments submitted in response to these requests. We also  interviewed FCC staff and staff of the Universal Service Administrative  Company (USAC)\u2014the not-for-profit corporation that administers the  Rural Health Care Program under a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) with FCC. To provide information on the design, operation, and  trends of the primary Rural Health Care Program, we analyzed data from  USAC on applications, funding commitments, and disbursements for the  first 12 years of the primary Rural Health Care Program (1998 to 2009). On  the basis of interviews with USAC officials to understand how these data  were handled, stored, and protected, we determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes specified. To provide information on  the pilot program, we conducted a Web-based survey of representatives  from all 61 pilot projects that had recent contact information on file with  USAC at the time of our survey to obtain their views on program  requirements and on how to improve the program, among other things.  Our survey response rate was 100 percent. This report does not contain all  of the results from the survey; our questionnaire and a more complete  tabulation of the results can be viewed in an e-supplement to this report.  To provide information about performance goals and measures, we  reviewed FCC documentation on the agency\u2019s performance goals and  measures for the Rural Health Care Program and compared this  information with literature on results-oriented management and effective  practices for setting performance goals and measures. Additionally, we  interviewed officials from other federal agencies, including the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the U.S. Department of  Agriculture (USDA), and the Department of Commerce, to collect  information on FCC\u2019s collaboration efforts on the Rural Health Care  Program. We also interviewed representatives from telecommunications  and rural health care stakeholder organizations to learn about the impact  of the program on their members.

These payments are  deposited into the federal Universal Service Fund, from which  disbursements are made for the various federal universal service  programs, including the Rural Health Care Program. Companies generally  pass their universal service costs along to consumers through a universal  service fee on customers\u2019 telephone bills.", "FCC\u2019s current Rural Health Care Program is made up of three components  that fund different benefits. As figure 1 illustrates, the first two  components\u2014the Telecommunications Fund and the Internet Access  Fund\u2014are commonly discussed together as the \u201cprimary Rural Health  Care Program.\u201d Both components in the primary Rural Health Care  Program offer discounts on services provided to a single site. In contrast,  the third component\u2014the pilot program\u2014encourages health care  providers to form comprehensive, multisite, state and regional dedicated  health care networks.", "Figure 2 shows how the components in the current Rural Health Care  Program may change if FCC adopts the proposed reforms described in its  July 2010 NPRM. As the figure illustrates, the Health Broadband Services  Program would replace the Internet Access Fund (and raise the discount  percentage). A new Health Infrastructure Program would make available  up to $100 million per year to support up to 85 percent of the construction  costs of new regional or statewide networks for health care providers in  areas of the country where broadband is unavailable or insufficient. This  $100 million would be part of the overall $400 million annual spending cap  that covers the Rural Health Care Program as a whole and that FCC  established in 1997.", "In managing the program, FCC oversees USAC\u2014the not-for-profit  corporation that administers the program. USAC uses its subcontractor,  Solix, Inc., to carry out certain key aspects of the program, such as  reviewing and processing funding applications. An MOU between FCC and  USAC as well as FCC orders and rules set forth the roles and  responsibilities of FCC and USAC in the management, oversight, and  administration of the Rural Health Care Program.

This is in contrast to the primary Rural Health Care Program, which  provides discounts only on monthly recurring costs for  telecommunications services or Internet access to rural health care  providers. The pilot program also provides funding for the cost of  connecting state or regional networks to Internet2 or National  LambdaRail\u2014two national networks that connect government research  institutions as well as academic, public, and private health care  institutions\u2014and the costs of connecting to the public Internet. Any  eligible public and nonprofit health care provider\u2014whether located in an  urban or a rural area\u2014was eligible to apply for funding when the pilot  program was announced.

In November 2007, FCC announced that it had accepted 69  of the 81 projects into the program and capped total funding for all of the  pilot projects at roughly $418 million over 3 years. Since then, a few  projects have merged and 1 project has withdrawn from the program. The  size and scope of the remaining projects vary widely. For example, the  Illinois Rural HealthNet project is using pilot program funds to pay for the  installation of approximately 1,250 miles of buried fiber. The purpose of  this fiber is to create the backbone of a network that will connect rural  critical access hospitals, health clinics, and community mental health  centers to specialists throughout the state and nation.

Alaska\u2019s vast size, harsh winter weather, and sparse population make fiber  networks and other technologies either too expensive or too infeasible.  Some wireless technologies also can be challenging, since Alaskan terrain  often includes mountains or forests that can obstruct line-of-sight  transmission. As a result, satellite is often the most feasible option for  many rural communities in Alaska. Although the cost of  telecommunications service in rural areas can vary considerably, satellite  service can cost up to $13,000 per month, creating a significant difference  in urban and rural rates in parts of Alaska, and making FCC\u2019s Rural Health  Care Program particularly attractive under such circumstances.", "We also found that, according to USAC data, FCC and USAC have been  successful in disbursing committed funds in the primary Rural Health Care  Program. Table 1 shows that USAC generally disburses most of the funds  that are committed to rural health care providers. Of the more than $380  million committed for the program, over $327 million (over 86 percent)  has been disbursed, leaving just over $53 million that has been committed  but not disbursed since the program began.

The primary purpose of a needs  assessment is to identify needed services that are lacking (in this case,  telecommunications services for rural health care providers) relative to  some generally accepted standard. By establishing measures of  comparison, program managers can more accurately determine how well  their programs are doing in meeting the needs of the targeted population  of the program. We have previously recommended that needs assessments  include the following characteristics:    benchmarks to define when needs have increased or decreased,    a plan to determine how needs assessment results will be prioritized in  supporting resource allocation decisions, and integration of information on other resources available to help address the  need.", "However, throughout its 12 years of managing the program, FCC has not  conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to learn how the program  can best target the telecommunications needs of rural health care  providers within the broad latitude provided by Congress in the 1996 Act.", "When designing the $400 million annual spending cap for the Rural Health  Care Program, FCC officials noted the scarcity of information available  about the universe of eligible providers, and what it might cost to meet the  providers\u2019 telecommunications needs. As our analysis showed, the  current $400 million spending cap is not based on meaningful estimates of  program participation. FCC stated in its 1997 report and order that the  Rural Health Care Program spending cap is \u201cbased on the maximum  amount of service that we have found necessary and on generous  estimates of the number of potentially eligible rural health care  providers.\u201d FCC acknowledged at the time that it expected actual  program disbursements to be less than the cap for a number of reasons.  Although FCC expected program disbursement to be under $400 million  annually, on multiple occasions, FCC has released documents stating that  the primary Rural Health Care Program is underutilized. For example, in  its 2006 pilot program order, FCC states that the primary Rural Health  Care Program \u201ccontinues to be greatly underutilized and is not fully  realizing the benefits intended by the statute and our rules. In 1997, we  authorized $400 million per year for funding of this program.

For example:  In a 2003 report and order, FCC provided support for rural health care  providers to obtain a 25 percent discount off the cost of monthly Internet  access services. The 2003 report and order states: \u201cBecause participation  in the rural health care support mechanism has not met the Commission\u2019s  initial projections, we amend our rules to improve the program, increase  participation by rural health care providers, and ensure that the benefits of  the program continue to be distributed in a fair and equitable manner.\u201d", "In a 2004 report and order, FCC changed the definition of \u201crural,\u201d revised  its rules to expand funding for mobile rural health care services, and  allowed a 50 percent subsidy (rather than 25 percent) for Internet access  services for health care providers in entirely rural states. According to  USAC, this report and order increased the number of health care providers  eligible to participate in the primary Rural Health Care Program by adding  new rural areas while grandfathering health care providers in areas no  longer defined as rural.", "In a 2006 order, FCC announced the pilot program, which will be  discussed in greater detail in the next section of this report.

Our prior work has  noted the importance of involving stakeholders (including third-party  administrators like USAC) when designing, implementing, and evaluating  programs. FCC officials stated that they did not consult with USAC  because USAC does not formulate policy. However, USAC\u2019s experience  with the primary Rural Health Care Program may have provided FCC with  valuable insights into how to design a pilot program, particularly regarding  the administrative processes and forms. For example, FCC\u2019s decision to  use the primary program\u2019s forms and processes for the pilot program led  to a complicated administrative process, particularly since some aspects  of the primary Rural Health Care Program\u2019s forms and administrative  processes were ill-suited to the pilot program. Because FCC used primary  program forms rather than creating new and more tailored ones for the  pilot program, the forms required complicated attachments.

We have noted that a lack of  collaboration among federal agencies can lead to a patchwork of programs  that can waste scarce funds, confuse and frustrate program customers,  and limit the overall effectiveness of the federal effort. A number of  federal agencies are involved in telemedicine efforts, and some provide  funds to health care providers that could complement FCC\u2019s pilot  program. For example, the Health Resources and Services Administration  (HRSA), the primary federal agency for improving access to health care  services for people who are uninsured, isolated, or medically vulnerable,  administers a Telehealth Network Grant Program that provides funds to  projects to demonstrate how telehealth programs and networks can  improve access to quality health care services in underserved rural and  urban communities. However, with USDA being the one exception, FCC  did not contact other federal agencies prior to announcing the pilot  program in 2006. FCC officials told us that after announcing the creation  of the pilot program in 2006, they met with representatives from various  agencies within HHS in 2007, to discuss coordination. Representatives  from some of these agencies reported that these meetings were primarily  informational, with FCC explaining its pilot program to them, and that no  strategies for collaboration or follow-up were developed. USDA officials  stated that FCC officials met with them prior to announcing the pilot  program to discuss USDA\u2019s Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program,  including how USDA scored applications and evaluated the program.  However, it is unclear how FCC used the information that USDA provided,  since similar information was not provided in FCC\u2019s call for applications  or order selecting pilot projects. According to federal and other  stakeholders, officials at other agencies also could have    provided FCC with an understanding of rural health care providers\u2019 needs,  potential information technology (IT) issues, and how to design a more  user-friendly program and   helped FCC identify additional appropriate service providers, one of which  had to petition to be included.", "FCC also did not request public comment on its proposed design for the  pilot program. Although FCC did request comments in 2004 on providing  some infrastructure support by funding upgrades to the public switched or  backbone networks, FCC did not imply that it was considering a pilot  program to fund the creation of private networks, or provide specific  details on how such a program would operate. We have previously  reported that FCC\u2019s use of NPRMs to pose broad questions without  providing actual rule text can limit stakeholders\u2019 ability to determine  either what action FCC is considering or what information would be most  helpful to FCC when developing a final rule. FCC officials said that they  did not issue a Notice of Inquiry (NOI) regarding the pilot program  because the process would have delayed the pilot program. However,  providing the public with advance notice of proposed changes and an  opportunity to comment on them is desirable in that it allows agencies,  according to a 2006 resource guide, to \u201cfind out earlier rather than later  about views and information adverse to the agency\u2019s proposal or bearing  on its practicality.\u201d Similarly, in comments submitted to FCC, the  National Telecommunications Cooperative Association, observed that  \u201cinterested or affected parties had no opportunity to explore with the  Commission various aspects of the Pilot Program.\u201d In addition, industry  concerns regarding the funding of redundant networks arose after the  implementation of the pilot program. If FCC had provided a more  detailed explanation of the proposed pilot program and requested  comment prior to establishing the program, it may have been better  prepared to address these concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Pilot Participants Have Experienced Delays and Difficulties, in Part, Because FCC Did Not Fully Establish Requirements Prior to Calling for Applications and Did Not Provide Effective Program Guidance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Pilot Participants Have Experienced Delays and Difficulties for Many Reasons", "paragraphs": ["FCC called for applications to participate in the pilot program before it  fully established pilot program requirements. This, along with the addition  of requirements as the pilot program has progressed, has led to delays and  difficulties for pilot participants. Most importantly, the entire pilot  program itself has been delayed. Participants may issue multiple RFPs as  they progress through various stages of designing and constructing their  networks, but the deadline for pilot participants to submit all of their  requests for funding (projects submit at least one Form 466-A for each  RFP they issue) to USAC was June 30, 2010. On February 18, 2010, FCC  extended this deadline by 1 year, to June 30, 2011. According to USAC  data, at the time of the extension, projects had requested 11 percent of the  roughly $418 million in total program funding. As of July 31, 2010, projects  had requested 17 percent of the total program funding.

Four of the tasks rated as \u201cvery difficult\u201d or \u201csomewhat difficult\u201d by  more than half of the respondents that provided an opinion fall into one of  two categories: the task is associated with program processes and forms  that were carried over from the primary Rural Health Care Program (Form  465 and Form 466-A), or the task is a requirement FCC added, but that was  not mentioned in the initial call for applications (developing a  sustainability plan and obtaining letters of agency). In addition, when  asked to list the top three things that program officials should change if  FCC established a new, permanent program with goals similar to those of  the pilot program, simplifying or improving the administrative process was  the most frequently mentioned issue.", "The Grant Accountability Project, a 2005 Domestic Working Group chaired  by the former United States Comptroller General, notes that an agency\u2019s  ability to ensure that funds are used as intended is impacted when the  terms, conditions, and provisions in award agreements are not well- written. The group also notes that a thorough assessment of proposed  projects can reduce the risk that money may be wasted or projects may  not achieve intended results. However, FCC did not fully establish the  requirements of the pilot program before it requested applications, and it  required projects to provide additional information after they were  accepted into the program. This led to delays because (1) participants  needed additional guidance on how to meet the requirements and (2) Solix  staff (under USAC direction) had to retroactively review projects to  determine the eligibility of the participating entities and activities. In  addition, some participants faced difficulties in funding ineligible  expenses. In contrast, other federal agencies generally provide extensive  detail on program rules when calling for applications for competitive  funding programs, including the criteria by which applications will be  judged and how the criteria will be weighted. For example, USDA\u2019s 2010  Distance Learning and Telemedicine Program Grant Application Guide  provides potential applicants with specific information on eligible uses for  the funds, eligible match funding, copies of the forms to be used, and  information on the application scoring process.", "FCC\u2019s 2006 order establishing the pilot program and calling for  applications did not provide detailed information on many essential  aspects of the program, including    which entities would be eligible to participate in the program (FCC  provided a legal citation, but no actual text);   which expenses could be paid for with program funds; and    how projects could fund their 15 percent match.", "After issuing its call for applications, FCC did provide some of this  information on its Frequently Asked Questions Web page on the pilot  program. However, this information may not have reached all interested  parties, and it would have been more efficient to determine these issues in  advance of requesting applications. FCC also provided some of this  information in its 2007 order; however, by this time, FCC was also  announcing which projects were selected. FCC did not fully screen  applications to determine the extent to which their proposed activities and  entities would be eligible for funding. Thus, several of the accepted  projects had ineligible components. Specifically, based on survey  respondents that provided a substantive answer:    25 of 59 respondents included an entity that was determined to be  ineligible,    25 of 57 respondents included an expense that was determined to be    10 of 59 respondents relied on ineligible sources to fund their match.", "The lack of established criteria and an in-depth screening prior to  announcing pilot project awards led to a lengthy process by which Solix  staff (under USAC direction) determine the eligibility of entities  postaward.

According to our survey, 36 of 60 respondents were delayed by difficulties  in compiling and submitting the documentation needed to establish entity  eligibility. In addition, although 39 survey respondents rated the current  program guidance regarding entity eligibility as \u201cvery clear\u201d or \u201csomewhat  clear\u201d; some confusion remains, as 20 pilot participants rated the current  guidance as \u201cslightly clear\u201d or \u201cnot at all clear.\u201d FCC\u2019s 2007 order also  notes that program administration costs, such as personnel, travel, legal,  marketing, and training costs, are ineligible for program funding.

For example, while the 2006 order states that  the pilot program would use the same forms and administrative processes  used in the primary Rural Health Care Program, the 2007 order also  requires projects to secure a letter of agency from every entity  participating in a project. This letter authorizes the lead project  coordinator to act on the signing agency\u2019s behalf. Since a number of the  selected pilot program participants included providers that were also  participating in another participant\u2019s proposed network, FCC noted that  the letter of agency would demonstrate that the entity has agreed to  participate in the network and prevent improper duplicate support for  providers participating in multiple networks. Considering that FCC  encouraged applicants to create statewide networks, some projects have  hundreds of participating entities, creating the need for such projects to  secure hundreds of letters of agency. The letter of agency requirement has  proven extremely time-consuming and resource-intensive for some  projects. According to our survey, 34 of 60 respondents faced difficulties  in securing letters of agency, and 27 of these respondents were delayed  because of these difficulties. (See fig. 10.)", "Similarly, according to our survey results, FCC has not provided sufficient  guidance to pilot projects on how to meet FCC\u2019s requirement that projects  comply with HHS health IT initiatives. In response to a letter from HHS,  FCC outlined a number of requirements in its 2007 selection order that  pilot program participants should meet to ensure that their pilot projects  were consistent with HHS health IT initiatives. FCC officials stated that  the explanation of the requirements in its 2007 selection order, in addition  to a guidance document created in 2008, provided guidance for the pilot  projects in how to meet these requirements. However, one HHS official  described the language in the 2007 selection order as vague and in need of  an update. In addition, the 2008 guidance document has not been revised  to reflect new developments in interoperability specifications and  certification programs. Currently, pilot participants are required to explain  in each quarterly report how they are complying with the HHS health IT  requirement. However, 34 of 47 survey respondents who provided an  opinion stated the guidance provided on how to meet these requirements  was \u201cslightly sufficient\u201d or \u201cnot at all sufficient.\u201d", "Following the release of the 2007 order, FCC created additional  requirements as the program progressed and did not provide program  guidance in a timely manner on how to meet these requirements. For  example, FCC stated in its 2007 award order that selected pilot  participants generally \u201cprovided sufficient evidence that their proposed  networks will be self-sustaining by the completion of the pilot program.\u201d  However, program officials began requiring more detailed sustainability  plans in the fall of 2008, after some projects had gone through the  competitive bidding process and had requested funding commitment  letters from USAC. Outside of an October 24, 2008, letter to USAC in which  FCC noted that participants should \u201cdisclose all sources or potential  sources of revenue that relate to the network\u201d and intentions to sell or  lease excess capacity in the project\u2019s sustainability plan, FCC did not  provide any other written guidance on what specific information should be  included in participant\u2019s sustainability plans until April 2009. At that time,  FCC posted an item to its Frequently Asked Questions Web page that  suggested more information to be included in a participant\u2019s sustainability  plan, including status of obtaining the match, projected sustainability  period, network membership agreements, ownership structure, sources of  future support, and management structure. USAC and Solix officials noted  that some pilot participants believed that because their application was  accepted by FCC, they met all of the program requirements for  sustainability. In some cases, this misunderstanding led to confusion and  disagreements between the pilot participants and program officials  regarding the need for additional information and the amount of time that  a sustainability plan should cover. Moreover, it appears some confusion  remains.

FCC staff stated that, in some cases, they have not provided written  guidance because they want the pilot program to remain flexible.  However, in some cases, it has taken several months for FCC to make a  decision or provide guidance on issues.

According to USAC officials, questions concerning payment  of fair share or incremental costs for excess capacity shared with  ineligible entities occurred at the pilot program training in February 2008  and continued from participants to USAC and from USAC to FCC  throughout 2008.

In particular, results-oriented organizations implement two  key practices, among others, to lay a strong foundation for successful  program management. First, these organizations set performance goals to  clearly define desired outcomes. Second, these organizations develop  performance measures that are clearly linked to the program goals.  However, FCC has reversed these two key practices. In 2006, 8 years after  FCC first implemented the primary Rural Health Care Program, the Office  of Management and Budget (OMB) assessed FCC\u2019s Rural Health Care  Program and concluded that the program had no performance goals and  measures. In 2007, FCC issued a report and order adopting performance  measures for the Rural Health Care Program related to USAC\u2019s processing  of applications, paying invoices, and determining appeals. However, FCC  stated that it did not have sufficient data to establish performance goals  for the Rural Health Care Program in the report and order. Instead of  specific performance-related goals, the Rural Health Care Program has  operated for 12 years under broad overarching goals, including the  statutory goal established by Congress in the 1996 Act, which is to ensure  that rural health care providers receive telecommunications services at  rates comparable for the same services in urban areas.", "Furthermore, the performance measures that FCC adopted for the primary  Rural Health Care Program and the pilot program in 2007 fall short when  compared with the key characteristics of successful performance  measures that we have identified in our past work. Following is a  discussion of these characteristics and the extent to which FCC has  fulfilled them in developing performance measures:    Measures should be tied to goals and demonstrate the degree to which the  desired results are achieved. These program goals should, in turn, be  linked to overall agency goals. However, as we have previously discussed,  the measures that FCC has adopted are not based on such linkage because  no specific performance goals have been established. By establishing  performance measures before establishing the specific performance goals  that it seeks to achieve through the Rural Health Care Program, FCC may  waste valuable time and resources collecting the wrong data. FCC receives  the data for these performance measures on a quarterly basis from USAC,  but without effective performance goals to guide its data collection, it  cannot ensure that the data gained from these performance measures are  an effective use of resources.", "Measures should address important aspects of program performance.", "For each program goal, a few performance measures should be selected  that cover key performance dimensions and take different priorities into  account. For example, measures should be limited to core program  activities because an excess of data could obscure rather than clarify  performance issues. Performance measures should also cover key  governmentwide priorities, such as timeliness and customer satisfaction.  FCC\u2019s performance measures appear to address certain key performance  dimensions. By selecting just three types of measures\u2014related to USAC\u2019s  (1) processing of applications, (2) paying invoices, and (3) determining  appeals\u2014there are fewer chances of obscuring the most important  performance issues. The measures also appear to take into account such  priorities as timeliness and customer satisfaction. For example, the 2007  performance measures include requirements to measure the number of  current and pending appeals, and the time that it takes to resolve those  appeals. However, again, without first setting specific performance goals  defining what the programs are specifically intended to accomplish, FCC  cannot be sure that it has adopted the most appropriate performance  measures.", "Measures should provide useful information for decision making.  Performance measures should provide managers with timely, action- oriented information in a format that helps them to make decisions that  improve program performance. However, the data collected by these  performance measures\u2014such as the number of applications submitted,  rejected, and granted\u2014are output, not outcome, oriented. The FCC task  force that developed the National Broadband Plan also reported that the  performance measures developed for the Rural Health Care Program need  to be improved to assess desired program outcomes, such as the impact of  the program on patient care. The limited nature of the data obtained by  current performance measures, combined with the absence of specific  performance goals, raises concerns about the effectiveness of these  performance measures for programmatic decision making.", "FCC is attempting to improve its performance management by seeking  public comment on performance goals and measures for the Rural Health  Care Program in its July 2010 NPRM. For example, FCC proposed a  specific measure of how program support is being used: that is, requiring  beneficiaries to annually identify the speed of the connections supported  by the program and the type and frequency of the use of telemedicine  applications as a result of broadband access. Although this is a positive  step, the NPRM does not specify whether this data collection would be  linked to specific connection speed goals that participants should obtain  with program funds, and it does not propose what the goal should be for  type and frequency of the use of telemedicine applications. While this  NPRM could lead to better goals and measures for the Rural Health Care  Program, FCC has exhibited a pattern of repeatedly seeking comment on  goals and measures for the Rural Health Care Program, which indicates  that it does not have a clear vision for what it intends the program to  accomplish within the broad statutory framework provided by Congress.  FCC has sought public comment on performance goals and measures for  the program on two previous occasions that did not result in effective  performance goals and measures for the program:  In June 2005, FCC issued a NPRM seeking comment on whether specific  performance goals were needed and on ways to establish useful outcome,  output, and efficiency measures for each of the universal service  programs, including the Rural Health Care Program. FCC officials stated  that this NPRM led to the 2007 performance measures that we have  previously described.", "In September 2008, FCC issued a NOI seeking comment on how to more  clearly define the goals of the Universal Service Fund programs, including  the Rural Health Care Program, and to identify any additional quantifiable  performance measures that may be necessary or desirable. FCC officials  stated that this NOI led to the July 2010 NPRM, which, again, requests  comment on performance goals and measures.", "Performance goals and measures are particularly important for the Rural  Health Care Program, because they could help FCC to make well-informed  decisions about how to address the trends that we have previously  described. If FCC does use information from the latest NPRM to develop  specific performance goals and measures, it should focus on the results  that it expects its programs to achieve. We have identified the following  practices for developing successful performance goals and measures:    create a set of performance goals and measures that addresses important  dimensions of a program\u2019s performance and balance competing priorities,   use intermediate goals and measures to show progress or contribution to  include explanatory information on the goals and measures,   develop performance goals to address mission-critical management    show baseline and trend data for past performance,  identify projected target levels of performance for multiyear goals, and link the goals of component organizations to departmental strategic  goals.", "Clearly articulated, outcome-based performance goals and measures are  important to help ensure that the Rural Health Care Program meets the  guiding principles that Congress has set forth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Without Effective Performance Goals and Measures, FCC Cannot Reliably Evaluate Program Performance, Which Could Lead to a Repeat of Its Past Management Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["After implementing the key performance management practices that we  have previously discussed\u2014establishing effective performance goals and  measures\u2014results-oriented organizations implement a third, key practice:  that is, evaluating the performance of their programs.

We have previously reported that performance  data can have real value only when used to identify the gap between a  program\u2019s actual performance level and the performance level identified  as its goal. Again, without specific performance goals and effective  performance measures, FCC cannot identify program performance gaps  and is unlikely to conduct evaluations that are useful for formulating  policy decisions.", "FCC has not formally evaluated the performance of the primary Rural  Health Care Program to determine whether it is meeting the needs of rural  health care providers, and it may lack the tools to evaluate the pilot  program\u2014such as an effective progress reporting mechanism and an  evaluation plan. To its credit, FCC has stated that it intends to evaluate the  pilot program after its completion. However, it is unclear whether FCC has  effective evaluation tools for conducting a pilot program evaluation that  will be useful for making policy decisions about the future of the Rural  Health Care Program. To track the progress of pilot projects, FCC requires  pilot program participants to complete quarterly reports that are filed with  FCC and USAC, but it is unclear whether these reports are effective tools  for evaluating pilot program performance for the following reasons:    Quarterly report data are not quantitative. Quarterly reports collect data  that are mostly qualitative (e.g., a narrative description of a project\u2019s  network and how the network will be sustained) instead of quantitative.  While qualitative data can help officials understand project progress on an  individual basis, the information is not objective or easily measured.", "FCC has not involved key stakeholders. We have previously reported that  stakeholder and customer involvement helps agencies to ensure that  efforts and resources are targeted at the highest priorities. However, key  stakeholders and pilot participants are not involved in ensuring that  quarterly reports are providing the most useful information possible. Pilot  program coaches, who guide pilot participants through the program\u2019s  administrative processes, and USAC officials said that FCC has not told  them how the reports will be used to evaluate pilot program progress.  USAC and the pilot program coaches work directly with participants and  without understanding how these reports will be used, they are unable to  effectively guide participants into providing the most useful evaluation  information possible. Additionally, of the 45 pilot program survey  respondents that provided an opinion, 26 said that they receive too little  feedback on their quarterly reports.", "Quarterly reports may require too much information. Of the 58 pilot  program survey respondents that provided an opinion, 28 said that too  much information is required in quarterly reports. As we have previously  discussed, an excess of data can obscure rather than clarify performance.", "FCC officials told us that they have learned lessons from using these  quarterly reports, and that, as part of the 2010 NPRM, FCC requested  public comment on a similar reporting requirement for the proposed  Health Infrastructure Program.", "Furthermore, despite FCC\u2019s intentions to evaluate the pilot program,  officials have not yet developed an evaluation plan for the pilot program.  FCC officials told us that this is because the pilot program is still under  way, and that FCC will plan the evaluation when the pilot program is  closer to completion (as we previously stated, the deadline for participants  in the pilot program to select a vendor and request a funding commitment  from USAC is June 30, 2011). However, we have previously reported that  when conducting pilot programs, agencies should develop sound  evaluation plans before program implementation\u2014as part of the design of  the pilot program itself\u2014to increase confidence in results and facilitate  decision making about broader application of the pilot program. We have  previously identified the following key features of sound evaluation plans:    well-defined, clear, and measurable objectives;    measures that are directly linked to specific program objectives;    criteria or standards for determining program performance;    clearly articulated methodology and a strategy for comparing results with    a clear plan that details the type and source of data necessary to evaluate  the program, methods for data collection, and the timing and frequency of  data collection;   a detailed data-analysis plan to track the program\u2019s performance and  evaluate its final results; and   a detailed plan to ensure that data collection, entry, and storage are  reliable and error-free.", "The lack of a documented evaluation plan for the pilot program increases  the likelihood that FCC will not collect appropriate or sufficient data,  which limits understanding of pilot program results. Without this  understanding, FCC will be limited in its decision making about the pilot  program\u2019s potential broader application to FCC\u2019s proposed future  programs.", "The National Broadband Plan states that for all four universal service  fund programs, including the Rural Health Care Program, \u201cthere is a lack  of adequate data to make critical policy decisions regarding how to better  utilize funding to promote universal service objectives.\u201d FCC has not  effectively followed the three key performance management practices  discussed in this report and has not obtained the data that it needs to  make critical policy decisions and successfully manage the program.  Furthermore, FCC has proposed two new programs under the Rural  Health Care Program in its 2010 NPRM (the Health Broadband Services  Program and the Health Infrastructure Program), even though the  National Broadband Plan states that FCC does not have the data to make  critical policy decisions on how to better use its funds. In our previous  work, we have reported that results-oriented organizations recognize that  improvement goals should flow from a fact-based performance analysis.  However, the proposed improvements to the Rural Health Care Program  are not based on a fact-based performance analysis because the  performances of the primary Rural Health Care Program and the pilot  program have not been evaluated. FCC officials told us that they believe  the proposals set forth in the July 2010 NPRM are \u201cpositive first steps\u201d  toward creating improvements to performance analysis.", "Because FCC has not determined what the primary Rural Health Care  Program and the pilot program are specifically intended to accomplish and  how well the programs are performing, it remains unclear how FCC will  make informed decisions about the new programs described in the July  2010 NPRM. Moreover, as new technologies are developed, measuring the  performance and effectiveness of existing programs is important so that  decision makers can design future programs to effectively incorporate  new technologies, if appropriate. If FCC does not institute better  performance management tools\u2014by establishing effective performance  goals and measures, and planning and conducting effective program  evaluations\u2014FCC\u2019s management weaknesses will likely continue to affect  the current Rural Health Care Program, and will likely carry forward into  the design and operation of proposed Rural Health Care programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the first 12 years of its Rural Health Care Program, FCC has  distributed more than $327 million to rural health care providers to assist  them in purchasing telecommunications and information services. FCC  and USAC have been particularly successful in disbursing committed  funds in the primary Rural Health Care Program, and FCC has generally  seen slow but steady growth in both the amounts of annual disbursements  and the number of annual applicants to the primary program.", "However, since the Rural Health Care Program\u2019s inception, FCC has not  provided the program with a solid performance management foundation.  FCC could better inform its decision making and improve its stewardship  of the Rural Health Care Program by incorporating effective performance  management practices into its regulatory processes. FCC has not  conducted a comprehensive needs assessment to determine the needs of  rural health care providers, has no specific goals and measures for the  program to guide its management decisions, and has not evaluated how  well the program is performing. FCC\u2019s attempts to improve the program  over time, including the 2006 pilot program, have not been informed by a  documented, fact-based needs assessment; consultations with  knowledgeable stakeholders, including other government agencies; and  performance evaluations. Despite FCC\u2019s efforts to improve the program, a  significant number of eligible rural health care providers currently do not  use the primary Rural Health Care Program, and FCC\u2019s management of the  pilot program has often led to the delays and difficulties reported by pilot  participants.", "We found that a number of rural health care providers depend on the  support they receive from the primary Rural Health Care Program, and  that most pilot program participants are seeking services that they believe  would have been otherwise unaffordable. It is possible that FCC\u2019s  proposed changes to the Rural Health Care Program will increase  participation by rural health care providers, thus increasing the amount of  funding committed by the Rural Health Care Program and, ultimately,  increasing the universal service fees paid by consumers on their telephone  bills. Changes in FCC\u2019s approach to performance management could help  ensure that higher telephone bills are justified; that program resources are  targeting the needs of rural health care providers; and that the program, in  fact, is helping our nation to realize more widespread use of telemedicine  technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve its performance management of the Rural Health Care  Program, we recommend that the Chairman of the Federal  Communications Commission take the following five actions. If FCC does  develop any new rural health care programs under the Universal Service  Fund\u2014such as the proposed Health Care Broadband Access Fund and the  Health Care Broadband Infrastructure Fund\u2014these steps should be taken  before implementing any new programs or starting any new data collection  efforts:    Conduct an assessment of the current telecommunications needs of rural  health care providers.", "Consult with USAC, other federal agencies that serve rural health care  providers (or with expertise related to telemedicine), and associations representing rural health care providers to incorporate their knowledge  and experience into improving current and future programs.", "Develop effective goals, and performance measures linked to those goals,  for all current and future programs.", "Develop and execute a sound performance evaluation plan for the current  programs, and develop sound evaluation plans as part of the design of any  new programs before implementation begins.", "For any new program, ensure that FCC\u2019s request for applications to the  program clearly (1) articulates all criteria for participating in the program  and any weighting of that criteria, (2) details the program\u2019s rules and  procedures, (3) outlines the program\u2019s performance goals and measures,  and (4) explains how participants\u2019 progress will be evaluated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Federal Communications  Commission and the Universal Service Administrative Company for their  review and comment.", "In its written comments, FCC did not specifically agree or disagree with  our recommendations but discussed planned and ongoing actions to  address them. FCC agreed that it should continue to examine and work to  improve the Rural Health Care Program to ensure that the program is  effectively and efficiently achieving its statutory goals. In response to our  first recommendation that FCC conduct an assessment of the current  needs of rural health care providers, FCC stated that it is gathering  information about health care needs, including needs assessments  performed by other governmental agencies. FCC also stated that going  forward, it is committed to developing benchmarks to define when needs  have increased or decreased, applying needs assessment results to  resource allocation decisions, and integrating information from other  resources available to help address the need. FCC\u2019s efforts to obtain  information and assessments from other agencies and stakeholders are  encouraging. We continue to believe, however, that FCC would benefit  from conducting its own assessment of the telecommunications needs of  the rural health care providers eligible under its Rural Health Care  Program.", "In response to our second recommendation that FCC consult with  stakeholders and incorporate their knowledge into improving current and  future programs, FCC stated that it is committed to maximizing  collaboration efforts with federal and other knowledgeable stakeholders  and that it will work closely with USAC to prepare for the new program.  FCC included in its comments an October 2010 statement from the Office  of the National Coordinator for Health IT, Department of Health and  Human Services, about collaborative efforts with FCC and other federal  agencies. In response to our third recommendation that FCC develop  effective performance goals and measures, FCC concurred with the need  to develop quantifiable performance measures. However, FCC did not  specifically state whether it concurred with our recommendation to  develop effective goals and to link performance measures to those goals.  We continue to believe that FCC should develop program performance  goals first, and then develop performance measures and link them to those  goals. In response to our fourth recommendation that FCC develop and  execute effective performance evaluation plans for the current and future  programs, FCC stated that it intends to conduct an evaluation of the pilot  program after it is concluded. While FCC did not address evaluation of the  current primary program, it stated that for any future enhancements to the  program, it is committed to developing and executing sound performance  evaluation plans, including key features that we identified in our report. In  response to our fifth recommendation that FCC identify critical program  information, such as criteria for funding, and prioritization rules in its call  for applications for any new programs, FCC stated that the July 2010  NPRM discusses these elements in detail. While we appreciate FCC\u2019s  efforts to better detail proposed programs in its NPRM, we continue to  believe that FCC should detail the requirements for participation in the  call for applications to any future programs.

When analyzing and reporting on the  data, we considered the limitations on how data can be manipulated and  retrieved from both the PATS and SIDS databases since these systems  were designed to keep track of applications and finances and not to be  data retrieval systems. We assessed the reliability of the data by  questioning officials about controls on access to the system and data back- up procedures. Additionally, we reviewed the data sets provided to us for  obvious errors and inconsistencies. On the basis of this assessment, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable to describe broad  trends in the demand for and use of Rural Health Care Program funding.", "We obtained the following data\u2014including annual and cumulative  figures\u2014for funding years 1998 through 2009:  the number and characteristics of applicants, including their entity type,  the type of service requested, and location; the dollar amount of funding commitments and disbursements by entity  type, type of service requested, and state; the number of commitments and disbursements by state; and the amount of money committed but not disbursed by entity type and type  of service requested.", "To provide these data, USAC performed queries on the PATS and SIDS  systems and provided the resulting reports to us in July 2010.

For example,  differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the sources of  information available to respondents, or the types of people who do not  respond to a question can introduce errors into the survey results. We  included steps in both the data collection and data analysis stages to  minimize such nonsampling errors. As we previously indicated, we  collaborated with GAO survey specialists to design draft questionnaires,  and versions of the questionnaire were pretested with four members of the  surveyed population. In addition, we provided a draft of the questionnaire  to FCC and USAC for their review and comment. From these pretests and  reviews, we made revisions as necessary to reduce the likelihood of  nonresponse and reporting errors on our questions. We examined the  survey results and performed computer analyses to identify  inconsistencies and other indications of error and addressed such issues,  where possible. A second, independent analyst checked the accuracy of all  computer analyses to minimize the likelihood of errors in data processing.  In addition, GAO analysts answered respondent questions and resolved  difficulties that respondents had in answering our questions. For certain  questions that asked respondents to provide a narrative answer, we  created content categories that covered more than 90 percent of the  narrative responses provided, and asked two analysts to independently  code each response into one of the categories.
