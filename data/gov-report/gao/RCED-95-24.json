Stronger, more efficient U.S. airlines\u2014American, Delta, and United\u2014joined Northwest as major participants in foreign markets in place of failed or financially ailing incumbents, such as Pan Am and Trans World Airlines (TWA). These airlines helped increase the U.S. share of passenger traffic in international markets. Because of these gains, the international marketplace has steadily become more important to U.S. airlines. Nonetheless, for a variety of reasons, U.S. airlines frequently have been unable to make a profit on their international services. Unlike the domestic market, the international market is heavily regulated, mostly governed by bilateral agreements between countries. In these agreements, countries establish traffic rights\u2014the routes, and in some cases the number of airlines that can offer service and the frequency of flights available for each nation\u2019s airlines. When U.S. airlines encounter discrimination or unfair competitive practices in foreign countries, the Department of Transportation (DOT) has authority to take all appropriate actions to eliminate these practices, commonly referred to as \u201cdoing-business problems.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "International Operations Are Increasingly Important to U.S. Airlines", "paragraphs": ["International traffic is increasingly important to U.S. airlines, accounting for 28 percent of their revenue passenger miles (RPM) in 1993\u2014compared with 21 percent in 1980. This trend is expected to continue. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) estimates that by 2005, international traffic will account for 35 percent of U.S. airlines\u2019 traffic.", "International traffic has increased in importance largely because the U.S. government adopted a market-oriented international aviation policy, and more efficient U.S. airlines have replaced financially ailing or failed carriers (Braniff, Eastern, Pan Am, and TWA) in the international marketplace. The new U.S. competitors are more productive and have lower operating costs than many foreign airlines. For example, a study by the European Union (EU) found that the overall operating costs of major European airlines were about 50 percent higher than the operating costs of major U.S. airlines in 1992. In addition, U.S. airlines introduced into international markets the innovative operating and marketing practices, such as frequent flyer programs, that they had developed to compete in the deregulated U.S. market. These innovations also helped U.S. airlines successfully compete with foreign carriers for passengers traveling to and from the United States. By 1993, the U.S. share of the trans-Atlantic market had increased to 47 percent from 42 percent in 1980; in the Pacific Rim market, the U.S. share had increased to 53 percent from 41 percent.", "Services across the Atlantic and to the Pacific Rim are particularly important to U.S. airlines. As shown in figure 1.1, these services accounted for about 85 percent of U.S. airlines\u2019 international traffic in 1993. As shown in figure 1.2, these two regions also accounted for 83 percent of U.S. airlines\u2019 international revenues. For routes between the United States and these regions, U.S. airlines are often competing against other countries\u2019 flag carrier, such as Air France (France), Alitalia (Italy), Lufthansa (Germany), Japan Air Lines (Japan), or Cathay Pacific (Hong Kong).", "Although U.S. airlines have increased their share of international markets, they have had difficulty making a profit on these services. Over the last 5 years, U.S. airlines have collectively lost over $4.1 billion on international services (see table 1.1). A number of factors contributed to this negative performance, including the Gulf War and the global economic slowdown in the early 1990s, low fares, and increased costs incurred by some U.S. airlines (e.g., Delta) in assimilating into their system the international routes of their failed or financially ailing predecessors (e.g., Pan Am). However, as table 1.2 illustrates, some U.S. airlines have been able to make profits from their international operations.

Two countries negotiate the air transport services between them and award their airlines the right to offer those services. The United States has 72 bilateral aviation agreements covering air services to 107 countries. These agreements establish the traffic rights of the airlines offering service in international markets. In general, traffic rights determine (1) which routes airlines can serve between the countries and to third countries; (2) what services they can provide (e.g., scheduled or charter); and (3) in some cases, how many airlines from each country can fly the routes and how frequently they can offer flights."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems in Doing Business Can Inhibit Airlines\u2019 Ability to Exercise Traffic Rights", "paragraphs": ["Ancillary activities are those necessary to exercise traffic rights.

We also interviewed representatives of U.S. airlines in Washington, D.C. In the Pacific Rim region, we performed our work in Australia, Hong Kong, the Republic of Korea, Japan, and Singapore. We selected these five countries because, together, they accounted for over 90 percent of international airlines\u2019 passenger traffic in the Pacific Rim region and about one-third of international airlines\u2019 traffic worldwide in 1990. To assess problems in Europe, we visited the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Spain, and Italy. We chose these countries because they account for about 77 percent of airline passenger traffic between the United States and Europe. In those countries, we also interviewed officials representing the U.S. government, U.S. airlines, foreign governments, foreign airlines, foreign airport authorities, the European Union, and aviation trade associations.

These problems include (1) limited access to landing and take-off slots at commercially viable times; (2) inadequate airport facilities; (3) restrictions on ground-handling operations, such as servicing aircraft; and (4) restrictions and delays in processing cargo. Foreign airlines, in comparison, generally face many fewer problems when operating at U.S. airports. Although U.S. airlines could not provide precise estimates of the costs resulting from these obstacles, their cumulative effect is to raise the airlines\u2019 operating costs and reduce the quality of services. In general, obstacles at a particular overseas airport are experienced by all airlines\u2014U.S. and non-U.S. alike\u2014except, in many cases, the national flag carrier. That carrier therefore has a competitive advantage. In addition, several of these obstacles can have a disproportionate impact on U.S. carriers because these airlines are generally more efficient than many foreign airlines and thus are best positioned to take advantage of increased freedom to operate without restrictions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limited Access to Slots Reduces Commercial Value of U.S. Airlines\u2019 Traffic Rights", "paragraphs": ["U.S. airlines have only limited access to several congested airports in Europe and the Pacific Rim because they cannot obtain slots\u2014reservations for aircraft landings and take-offs\u2014that allow efficient connections with domestic flights. Airports control slots when the demand for them exceeds their capacity. According to U.S. airline officials, insufficient or inconvenient slots reduce the commercial value of their traffic rights. In contrast, the foreign airlines we spoke with reported no problems obtaining commercially viable slots at the two slot-controlled international airports in the United States\u2014Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport and New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport. For example, in the past, slots at O\u2019Hare Airport have been withdrawn from domestic airlines if they are needed by U.S. and foreign airlines for international services. However, the FAA Authorization Act of 1994 prevents any increase in withdrawal of domestic slots for use by foreign airlines at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare.", "U.S. airlines told us that they had difficulty obtaining slots at commercially competitive times at Frankfurt\u2019s Main, London\u2019s Heathrow, Paris\u2019s Charles de Gaulle and Orly, and Tokyo\u2019s Narita airports. Table 2.1 lists the problems the airlines encountered at these airports.", "Acknowledging that these problems occur, DOT has determined that they are not the result of discrimination against U.S. carriers but rather are due to limited airport capacity. Airlines are not provided with slots automatically when they receive traffic rights. Instead, under guidelines developed by the aviation industry, airlines can request slots twice a year from the designated \u201cslot coordinator\u201d at an airport, often an employee of the national flag carrier or a government entity. Airlines retain the right to those slots that they used during the previous travel season\u2014known as historical slots. In allocating slots, coordinators are supposed to balance requests from domestic and international airlines with the airport\u2019s capacity. Airlines competing on the same routes often prefer slots at the same peak operating hours. When slot coordinators are unable to accommodate an airline\u2019s first request, they try to offer other slots as close in time to the preferred slots as possible or may assign slots that vary from day to day for the same flight. Once airlines are assigned slots, they can exchange slots among themselves, subject to the coordinator\u2019s approval.", "Because national flag carriers dominate the airports in their homeland, these carriers usually have many more historical slots and greater flexibility to adjust their operations than other airlines. When these other airlines, including U.S. airlines, do not have slots for their flights at competitive times, the commercial value of their traffic rights is reduced because uncompetitive slots result in less convenient departure and arrival times or longer layovers for passengers. Obtaining slots is a recurring problem for U.S. airlines at congested airports because they frequently attempt to modify their schedules in response to market demand, according to DOT officials. For U.S. passenger airlines, the ultimate impact is lost revenues because passengers may prefer to fly on competing foreign airlines, particularly national flag carriers, that have more slots and more convenient flight times at their respective hubs. U.S. cargo airlines also lose revenues because inconvenient slots can delay their time-sensitive operations, requiring them to reimburse customers for late deliveries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Airport Facilities Impair U.S. Airlines\u2019 Ability to Provide Quality Service", "paragraphs": ["At a number of airports in Europe and the Pacific Rim, U.S. and other foreign airlines are located in passenger and cargo terminals that have inadequate or inferior facilities for aircraft, cargo shipments, and passenger traffic compared with the newer terminals and facilities assigned to national flag carriers.

As a result, several U.S. airlines contend that they are unable to achieve the same quality of service as the national flag carriers. Some of these airports are in the process of or planning to expand or upgrade facilities used by U.S. airlines. However, these improvements will not be completed for several years, and most of the airports have not provided for interim modifications to reduce the disparities.

As a result, passengers may await their baggage for 30 to 45 minutes or even longer when baggage is transferred between airlines. At Terminal 1, we also noted that all arriving and departing passengers use the same level in the transit and passport control area, making it difficult for departing passengers to reach their gates because of congestion in the terminal.

The new terminal was also more aesthetically pleasing than the old terminal. The old terminal is being upgraded over the next decade to make it comparable to the new terminal, but the U.S. airlines were dissatisfied with the proposed plan because it did not provide for interim modifications to minimize the disparity between the terminals. U.S. airline officials said that the disparity between the old and new terminals would severely impair their ability to attract lucrative business- and first-class passengers. After consultations with U.S. government and airline representatives, Japanese authorities agreed to make interim renovations and to phase in construction work to reduce the adverse effect on U.S. airlines.

Each of these airports also prohibits U.S. airlines from \u201cthird-party handling,\u201d whereby airlines or their subsidiaries are allowed to provide ground-handling services to other airlines.

They or their subsidiaries are the only entities allowed to handle their own ramp operations or provide third-party ground-handling services and, thus, control the cost and quality of these functions or generate additional revenues. However, at Frankfurt and Milan airports, the restrictions apply to the national flag carriers as well. Revenues from ground-handling services can be significant sources of income for the airport authorities and flag carriers. In contrast, U.S. airlines do not enjoy a similar monopoly on ground-handling services at U.S. airports.", "Ground-handling is a significant element of operations, affecting airlines\u2019 costs and ability to compete effectively and to serve customers. U.S. airline representatives emphasized that restrictions on ground-handling services raise operating costs, lower the quality of service, and reduce efficiency. They would like the freedom to conduct such services themselves or freely contract for them by choosing among several competing agents. These representatives contend that current restrictions allow ground-handling agents to charge excessive prices and unilaterally impose charges and fees. For example, one U.S. airline complained that Paris\u2019s Orly Airport does not consult with airlines about its operating plans and fees. In some cases, the U.S. airline itself must provide services which it has already paid the airport to perform. U.S. airlines estimate they could save about $1 million to $1.4 million annually by providing their own ground-handling services rather than contracting for them from current providers at particular airports. Furthermore, representatives from U.S. and other airlines contend that monopoly ground-handling agents\u2014such as those at Frankfurt, Madrid, Milan, and Rome\u2014have little incentive to keep costs low or provide high-quality services and are generally unresponsive to the airlines\u2019 complaints.", "Finally, U.S. airlines believe that restrictions on ground-handling also affect their potential revenues. According to some U.S. airlines, the ability to generate additional revenues through third-party handling would also affect their decision to provide their own services if allowed to do so, especially at airports where they operate relatively few flights and where performing their own ground-handling services would be too expensive. Airport authorities we interviewed, however, cited various reasons for limiting competition in these services and argued that they, not the airlines, can best judge the most efficient use of their airports\u2019 resources. For example, some airport authorities stated that they are entitled to maintain a monopoly in ground-handling because of the capital investments they have made. They also said that allowing more handling agents at their airports could compromise safety, security, and the quality of services. However, according to State Department and DOT officials, such claims need to be carefully evaluated to determine their validity. Airport authorities also expressed concern that removing competitive restrictions on ground-handling could result in labor disputes and staff layoffs.

These problems, which we generally did not find in Europe, are particularly detrimental to international overnight express carriers. Many of these problems stem primarily from foreign countries\u2019 overall trade policies or from bureaucratic complexities, such as the involvement of non-aviation-related government ministries in aviation issues. For example, some delays in freight-forwarding were caused by a lack of sufficient customs inspection officials; staffing levels for these officials are determined by a customs ministry, not by the airport authority.", "U.S. airlines\u2019 experiences in Korea and Japan typify these problems. Korean regulations prohibit foreign companies from operating domestic trucking companies, preventing the two U.S. cargo airlines that serve Korea from directly delivering freight to their customers. Instead, the airlines must hire Korean trucking companies. Similarly, U.S. cargo airlines must use a Japanese trucking company owned in part by a competing Japanese airline to transport cargo between Tokyo\u2019s Narita Airport and their off-site warehouse because Japanese authorities do not allow U.S. airlines to transport their own cargo between the two points. According to U.S. airline officials, these restrictions cause delays in freight delivery, a loss of custody over express packages, and increased costs. One U.S. airline, because it must rely on the Japanese service, cannot offer same-day delivery service and must pass the higher costs on to customers, making its services less competitive.

Even when such practices are covered by bilateral accords, problems still arise if the relevant provision is too general. For example, of the six foreign countries that we visited in which U.S. airlines complained of restrictions on ground-handling and for which air services are governed by bilateral agreements, two countries did not have accords with the United States that addressed ground-handling, and the provisions in the remaining four accords were too general to sufficiently address the airlines\u2019 concerns.Partly as a result, ground-handling problems in these countries persist. According to DOT officials, the Department seeks to solve U.S. airlines\u2019 problems regardless of their legal status; that is, whether the problems are covered by a bilateral accord.

First, the affected airline usually tries to resolve the problem by negotiating with the national flag carrier, airport authority, or government agency. If that fails, the airline contacts the U.S. embassy in that country, which tries to resolve the problem locally by facilitating discussion between the U.S. airline\u2019s representatives and foreign government officials. Additional contacts may be made orally or by diplomatic note through the U.S. embassy or directly from the State Department to the foreign embassy in Washington, D.C. If the U.S. embassy is unsuccessful, it contacts DOT and the State Department directly, and these agencies initiate higher-level intergovernmental contacts. As a last resort, a U.S. airline may file a formal complaint with DOT against an offending foreign airline, airport authority, or government and may call for retaliatory sanctions.", "DOT decides what approach it will take to resolve a problem on a case-by-case basis. It first conducts an initial investigation to ascertain the facts and determine whether the problem warrants action. The agency then formulates a response to the problem in light of the United States\u2019 strategic position in the bilateral aviation relationship. DOT considers several concerns, such as other pending aviation issues between the United States and the foreign government. Staff from DOT\u2019s Office of International Aviation formulate responses. If a major aviation trading partner\u2014such as the United Kingdom\u2014is involved, the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs generally plays a key role. Finally, depending on the nature and gravity of the grievance, the Secretary of Transportation may review responses. Throughout this process, DOT coordinates with the State Department.", "As mentioned above, the legal status of a problem (i.e., whether the problem is addressed in a bilateral accord) is a key factor that shapes DOT\u2019s attempts to resolve the problem. DOT\u2019s approach is also determined by the bargaining leverage available to the U.S. government to resolve the problem. The greater the bargaining leverage the United States has to influence a foreign government, the greater the likelihood that a problem will be resolved satisfactorily. This leverage depends on a mix of factors. For example, a foreign airline might be seeking opportunities from the United States or might hold discretionary authority to serve the United States that is not guaranteed by the relevant bilateral agreement. In such cases, DOT is in a better position to bargain and resolve doing-business problems. According to DOT officials, although DOT can always raise issues with U.S. bilateral partners, the leverage that the United States has to pressure a foreign government primarily determines when a problem is resolved. Consequently, according to DOT officials, foreign governments sometimes develop the political will to resolve such problems only when their flag carriers want additional authority to serve the United States. Finally, DOT attempts to design countermeasures to doing-business problems that are proportional to the harm the problem causes. For example, DOT would not typically threaten to suspend service between the United States and a foreign country to resolve a dispute over the number of check-in counters at a foreign airport. When an airline identifies an issue as important, the U.S. government can instruct embassy staff to discuss the issues with foreign officials, deliver a formal protest, or request consultations or address the problem during ongoing negotiations with its foreign counterparts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative and Regulatory Tools Are Available to DOT in Its Attempts to Resolve Doing-Business Problems", "paragraphs": ["DOT has several statutory and regulatory tools to encourage foreign governments to resolve U.S. airlines\u2019 doing-business problems. First, under 49 U.S.C. section 41304, DOT can suspend, amend, modify, limit, or put conditions on the operating permits of foreign airlines if it finds, among other things, that an airline or its government has engaged in unfair, discriminatory, or restrictive practices against U.S. airlines. For example, DOT has required that a foreign airline fly to a specific airport in the United States or use its U.S. competitor for ground-handling services. Second, DOT can deny foreign airlines the discretionary authority to fly routes to the United States. Similarly, DOT also uses 14 C.F.R. part 213 to require foreign airlines to file their U.S. schedules; DOT can then curtail a foreign airline\u2019s existing services or deny proposed services to the United States to pressure the foreign governments. Finally, as described in chapter 1, DOT can impose retaliatory sanctions under 49 U.S.C. section 41310 or under its general authority to place conditions on or withdraw the licenses of foreign airlines."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formal Complaint Process Has Limited Application in Addressing Nondiscriminatory Doing-Business Problems", "paragraphs": ["Although complaints filed by U.S. airlines under 49 U.S.C. section 41310 have been used to resolve several problems in doing business abroad, many U.S. airlines believe the process is not a good way to resolve problems. First, because such complaints are confrontational, several airlines view the process as a last resort when other means fail. These airlines prefer using cooperative methods to resolve problems out of fear that a foreign government will retaliate or to preserve good relations with the host country. Second, most of the airlines we spoke with believe that formal complaints should be filed only to resolve major issues, such as clear violations of traffic rights. They believe that overuse of the complaint process will undermine its effectiveness. DOT interprets its authority under the statue as requiring a finding of a violation of a legal obligation under the relevant bilateral agreement or other clear instance of unfair or discriminatory treatment before it may approve a complaint and impose sanctions. Because many problems in doing business do not discriminate against U.S. airlines or are not specifically addressed in a bilateral agreement, many airlines believe their complaints are not covered by the statute.", "Nevertheless, the formal complaint process is a valuable vehicle for addressing doing-business problems that clearly violate bilateral agreements. Of the 21 complaints filed between August 1986 and August 1993, 13 involved doing-business issues. Of these 13 complaints, 6 concerned CRSs and 8 concerned ground-handling, operating hours for cargo airlines, cargo warehousing, and currency remittance issues. DOT denied only one of these 13 complaints. In the other 12 cases, an agreement or accommodation was reached and DOT dismissed the complaint."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Affect DOT\u2019s Ability to Resolve Doing-Business Problems", "paragraphs": ["DOT\u2019s efforts to resolve doing-business problems are complicated by several factors. These include (1) negotiating with foreign governments that are often protecting their own flag carriers from increasing U.S. competition, (2) weighing the elimination of these problems with attempts to obtain valuable traffic rights for U.S. carriers, (3) balancing the competing commercial interests of various U.S. airlines, and (4) addressing these problems with significantly fewer resources in DOT\u2019s Office of International Aviation.", "First, DOT faces a difficult task in resolving these problems because it must negotiate with foreign governments that are not inclined to make the environment easier for more efficient U.S. airlines. These governments are often protecting national flag carriers that have lost market share to U.S. airlines over the last decade. In an effort to protect Air France, for example, France renounced its bilateral accord with the United States in May 1992 because the U.S. share of traffic between the United States and France had risen from 49 percent in 1980 to 70 percent in 1992.", "Second, traffic rights tend to take precedence over issues of doing business because such rights determine fundamental access to foreign markets. Almost all U.S. airlines recognize and support the priority of traffic rights because of their desire to gain greater access to international markets. Given the growth in these markets and their potential for profit, U.S. airlines want to expand their international operations. In recent years, negotiations of traffic rights with 6 of the 13 countries we visited\u2014Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, and the United Kingdom\u2014have consumed much of DOT\u2019s and State\u2019s negotiating resources and attention. As a result, the two agencies have been unable to give priority to several doing-business issues. Moreover, the U.S. government must sometimes trade valuable traffic rights to foreign airlines to serve the United States in exchange for adding specific provisions in bilateral agreements to address otherwise intractable doing-business problems. U.S. negotiators cannot simply offer enhanced doing-business rights in the United States because foreign airlines already enjoy comparatively unrestricted rights. Furthermore, many countries are reluctant to agree to such provisions, especially if their flag carriers or airports benefit from restrictive doing-business practices.", "Third, in formulating strategies to resolve problems, DOT must reconcile the diverse, often competing and conflicting interests of U.S. aviation constituencies\u2014airlines, airports, communities, travelers, and shippers. For example, U.S. airlines often have competing commercial interests, and actions taken to resolve one airline\u2019s problems may jeopardize the interests of another airline. Thus, a U.S. airline experiencing no problems in doing business at a foreign airport might resist imposing sanctions to resolve the problems of another U.S. airline in an effort to avoid retaliation by the foreign government that might affect all U.S. airlines.", "DOT must also accommodate other interests. For example, almost all U.S. airlines we spoke with want the right to provide ground-handling services to other airlines at foreign airports. However, U.S. negotiators cannot guarantee reciprocal treatment for foreign airlines at U.S. airports because the vast majority of U.S. airports are locally owned and operated. Although many U.S. international airports allow third-party handling, as a group they are opposed to including this right in bilateral agreements because they want to protect the proprietary rights of airports. In fact, the Airports Council International-North America\u2014an airport trade association\u2014does not want doing-business issues addressed in bilateral accords at all. The need to reconcile conflicting interests makes it difficult to develop a policy to address such problems that satisfies all parties. By contrast, because foreign governments in many cases have an ownership interest in their airlines, they may be more concerned with representing the interest of their national flag carriers than with the interests of other aviation constituents.", "Fourth, DOT must address an increasing workload related to international aviation with diminishing resources. In addition to negotiating bilateral aviation agreements and addressing U.S. airlines\u2019 problems in doing business abroad, DOT\u2019s Office of International Aviation is responsible for processing all U.S. airlines\u2019 requests for authority to serve specific foreign markets and all foreign air carriers\u2019 requests for authority to serve the United States. In 1993, approximately 93 million passengers traveled to or from the United States on U.S. and foreign airlines\u2014an all-time record. According to DOT officials, this growth in traffic has led to a corresponding increase in their workload. However, staffing in the Office of International Aviation has sharply declined during this period. For example, while 23 staff members at the Civil Aeronautics Board conducted aviation negotiations in 1982, DOT\u2019s negotiating team in 1993 consisted of only 11 staff.", "Recognizing these constraints, U.S. airlines attempt to resolve most of their doing-business problems themselves by negotiating directly with foreign airport authorities, airlines, and government agencies. This approach is often appropriate because many problems are primarily commercial disputes. Similarly, U.S. airlines have successfully used airline operator committees, consisting of representatives from airlines serving an airport, to address their concerns about doing-business problems overseas. For example, the Italian antitrust commission recently ruled against the Milan and Rome airport authorities\u2019 ground-handling monopolies in a case filed by the Italian board of airline representatives with substantial support from U.S. airlines. In addition, several U.S. airlines have not reported their problems to DOT or the State Department because these airlines did not believe that U.S. government assistance would be sustained or vigorous enough to resolve the problems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agencies\u2019 Ability to Overcome Constraints Is Hindered by Insufficient Analysis and Limited Expertise", "paragraphs": ["The majority of the U.S. airline officials we interviewed emphasized that DOT and the State Department could be more proactive in resolving those doing-business problems reported to them. However, because it does not collect and analyze information on these problems, DOT is limited in the extent to which it can overcome the constraints that it faces. Likewise, according to U.S. airline officials as well as a recent study, the State Department\u2019s policy of frequent staff rotations limits the expertise that the agency\u2019s staff can bring to bear in attempting to resolve U.S. airlines\u2019 problems.", "In documenting the problems that U.S. airlines encounter overseas, we found that DOT\u2019s Office of International Aviation did not collect and analyze information on doing-business problems, with the exception of formal complaints filed by the airlines. DOT officials noted, for example, that our report would provide the only current compendium of information on U.S. airlines\u2019 doing-business problems overseas. Because it does not collect and analyze such information on a regular basis, DOT cannot determine the extent to which certain problems are pervasive among different countries or identify trends. Noting that DOT staff had difficulty compiling such information during our review, the Assistant Director for Negotiations stated that a centralized \u201cclearinghouse,\u201d in which information on the status of airlines\u2019 problems is collected and analyzed, would provide the agency with a better overview of the problems and allow it to better develop solutions to those problems.", "Likewise, representatives of several U.S. airlines complained that problems that do not violate bilateral accords or overtly discriminate against them often linger because of a lack of monitoring and oversight by DOT. Although these representatives complimented DOT for its successes in resolving problems that clearly violate bilateral accords, they suggested that DOT could better monitor and develop solutions to doing-business problems not specifically covered in such accords by placing one person in charge of resolving them. Currently, DOT\u2019s officers assigned to deal with specific countries are responsible for negotiating both traffic and doing-business rights, and they often find that there is a stronger constituency among U.S. airlines for resolving traffic rights issues than for addressing doing-business issues. In making their suggestion, the airline representatives noted that giving one person responsibility for resolving doing-business problems would allow that person to develop independent expertise in the technical aspects of the problems and find solutions to them. They emphasized that such a \u201cfocal point\u201d could ensure that (1) problems receive sustained attention, (2) problems pervasive in various countries are identified, and (3) DOT staff have the information they need to be fully prepared when entering bilateral negotiations so that if necessary, specific provisions addressing a given problem can be negotiated into the relevant bilateral accord.", "Finally, many airline representatives we interviewed were concerned about the level of expertise among State Department and DOT staff. They maintained that the State Department\u2019s staff rotates too frequently, diminishing the agency\u2019s ability to effectively negotiate the resolution of doing-business problems. One airline representative noted, for example, that during the course of the 10-year renovation of their terminal at Tokyo\u2019s Narita Airport, U.S. embassy officials monitoring the situation will be reassigned, and the new officials will likely be unfamiliar with the issues surrounding the renovation. Similarly, the President\u2019s Commission to Ensure a Strong Competitive Airline Industry concluded that the State Department\u2019s practice of rotating staff limits its expertise on aviation. To improve the level of such expertise at the State Department, the Commission recommended that State strengthen its aviation career track. Acknowledging such criticisms, the State Department has taken action to do this. As of September 1994, the agency has converted one of its aviation positions at headquarters into a nonrotational civil service assignment and plans to convert additional positions in the future. In addition, the State Department has developed a 3-day aviation training course\u2014in which nearly 1 day is devoted to U.S. airlines\u2019 doing-business problems\u2014for U.S. embassy staff serving in aviation-related posts.", "U.S. airline representatives also noted that DOT, while its staff are long term, often lacks the technical expertise required to understand and negotiate doing-business issues successfully. As a result, according to these representatives, DOT staff often do not appreciate the economic impact of doing-business problems.
