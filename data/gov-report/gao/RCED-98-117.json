Although the federal government wished to expand the availability of affordable housing, particularly multifamily housing, reductions in federal spending precluded increases in housing subsidies\u2014the federal government\u2019s primary means of making rental housing affordable to low-income households. In addition, federal credit enhancements, such as mortgage insurance or reinsurance, came under increased public scrutiny after the federal government lost nearly $2.4 billion by 1992 from defaults on multifamily mortgage loans insured through its former coinsurance program\u2014a program delegating federal loan-processing and asset management functions to approved lenders that HUD implemented in 1983 to meet the market\u2019s demands for multifamily mortgage insurance.", "To stimulate the production of affordable multifamily housing and to gain the administrative efficiencies but avoid the risks of the coinsurance program, the Congress, in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, authorized two new risk-sharing demonstration programs. These programs (1) provide credit enhancements to encourage the financing of affordable multifamily housing and (2) divide the financial liability for any default between the federal government and the financial institutions and agencies selected to become its risk-sharing partners.", "This report responds to a requirement in the 1992 legislation that we review these two risk-sharing demonstration programs as well as identify any opportunities for improvement. More specifically, the report looks at how well the programs are meeting their goals, identifies their benefits for participating financial institutions and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and considers opportunities for improving the programs and HUD\u2019s administration of them."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Multifamily Production Declined While More Households Sought Affordable Housing", "paragraphs": ["In establishing the risk-sharing demonstration programs, the Congress recognized that the production of multifamily housing had been declining steadily since the mid-1980s. According to Senate Report 102-332 and studies of the multifamily mortgage markets conducted in the early 1990s, several key factors were responsible for this decline. Among the more important were (1) changes in government policies and regulations on taxation, banking, and housing subsidies; (2) a sharp decline in multifamily mortgage credit enhancement by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA); and (3) the withdrawal from the multifamily secondary market by Freddie Mac (formerly the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation).", "As we reported in 1993, more households were seeking affordable multifamily housing at the same time as the production of such housing declined. Studies issued since 1993 have identified the types of multifamily properties that are needed and the areas where multifamily housing is needed. According to a 1995 HUD analysis, unmet capital needs include smaller properties, larger rehabilitation projects, and housing for the elderly. Affordable new construction is also needed in high-growth markets. Inner-city neighborhoods and rural areas are commonly identified as \u201cunderserved housing markets\u201d that often require smaller properties, both subsidized and unsubsidized. However, because these smaller properties have proportionally high transaction costs and low fees, they are less attractive to lenders than larger properties when interest rates are equivalent. The complexity often associated with the multiple subsidies needed to finance affordable housing also acts as a deterrent. According to HUD\u2019s 1995 analysis, the secondary market has generally not been active in purchasing rehabilitation loans. Such loans are needed in inner-city neighborhoods to preserve low-cost housing units, stabilize neighborhoods, and improve housing conditions for low-income residents. The study concludes that without rehabilitation loans, many properties in inner-city neighborhoods will be demolished or abandoned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Credit Enhancements Complement Housing Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["Governments have several tools, apart from public housing, that they can use to make multifamily housing more affordable\u2014(1) rental subsidies to make up the shortfall between the rents that tenants can afford and the rents that landlords must charge to cover their costs and earn a profit, (2) grants and favorable tax treatment to lower the costs of building or operating housing, and (3) credit enhancements, such as mortgage insurance, to facilitate the financing of affordable housing. While subsidies are the government\u2019s primary means of making multifamily housing affordable for low-income households, credit enhancements can complement subsidies by increasing the financing available for such housing.", "Credit enhancements transfer some of the risk of loss from the lender to the credit enhancer, making loans more secure and encouraging both mortgage lending and investment in mortgage loans. Specifically, credit enhancements encourage primary lenders, such as commercial banks, to make long-term, fixed-rate mortgage loans that they otherwise might not make, and investors, such as pension funds, to buy these loans in the secondary market. The sale of individual loans, or of securities backed by pools of loans, returns funds to primary lenders, creating liquidity and allowing the lenders to make additional loans or otherwise reinvest the funds.", "Credit enhancement can occur when a loan is originated or when it is sold in the secondary market. If it occurs at the time of origination, such as when a housing finance agency sells bonds to raise capital to lend to developers of affordable multifamily housing, it can affect the terms of the loan. Because the enhancement provides additional support\u2014usually through mortgage insurance\u2014it improves the housing finance agency\u2019s bond rating. The housing finance agency can then obtain a lower interest rate and/or a longer-term loan, the benefits of which it can pass along to the affordable multifamily housing developer. In turn, the developer can convey these benefits to tenants in the form of lower monthly rents. If the credit enhancement occurs when the loan is sold in the secondary market, it transfers the credit risk from the investor purchasing the loan to the credit enhancer. At the same time as this transfer reduces the purchaser\u2019s credit risk, it reduces the seller\u2019s reserve requirements, freeing capital for further investment. The credit enhancement that occurs when a loan is sold in the secondary market is called reinsurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstration Programs Were Designed to Overcome Flaws in FHA\u2019s Earlier Mortgage Insurance Programs", "paragraphs": ["Under the traditional mortgage insurance programs, FHA is involved in all aspects of lending\u2014loan underwriting, loan servicing, asset management, and property disposition. These tasks are time consuming and resource intensive. As a result, FHA has traditionally been slow to approve loans through these programs, and it incurs substantial staff costs.", "In 1983, FHA implemented the coinsurance program to expedite loan processing and gain administrative efficiencies by delegating many of its mortgage underwriting, processing, monitoring, and foreclosure functions to approved lenders. The coinsurance program achieved these objectives, but it also resulted in substantial losses to the federal government. Even though the lenders assumed a portion of the credit risk for the loans they approved, this portion was not supported by sufficient reserves to ensure sound underwriting. In addition, the program\u2019s fee structure created incentives for the lenders to focus on the volume rather than the quality of the loans they made. Furthermore, the lenders\u2019 losses were insured by the Government National Mortgage Administration (Ginnie Mae), a government-sponsored enterprise. Thus, when defaults occurred and the lenders\u2019 reserves were not adequate to cover them, Ginnie Mae paid the remaining balance and the federal government was ultimately responsible for the losses.", "Like the coinsurance program, the risk-sharing demonstration programs are designed to expedite loan processing and gain administrative efficiencies by delegating many of FHA\u2019s traditional loan-processing and asset management responsibilities to other entities. The demonstration programs also resemble the coinsurance program in that they are designed to share the risk of loss from default. However, the demonstration programs differ from the coinsurance program in important ways, reflecting lessons learned about flaws in the design of the coinsurance program.", "First, the demonstration programs establish higher standards for participation than the coinsurance program. Entry into the demonstration programs is limited to qualified financial institutions, such as government-sponsored enterprises and state and local housing finance agencies with strong track records in multifamily lending. The housing finance agencies must meet standards of financial soundness and capable management established by a nationally recognized credit rating agency or have a dedicated reserve account with sufficient capital to meet the agency\u2019s outstanding obligations under the programs. The participating institutions are either publicly chartered or are regulated by a state or federal agency. In addition, their mission, like FHA\u2019s, includes supporting affordable housing. Thus, they are held accountable to public entities other than FHA for ensuring that they have the financial capacity and integrity to implement the risk-sharing programs. In contrast, FHA\u2019s partners in the coinsurance program were mortgage bankers unaccountable to a third party.", "Second, the risk-sharing partners generally bear a larger share of the risk under the demonstration programs than under the coinsurance program. In most instances, the risk is divided equally under the demonstration programs, whereas, under the coinsurance program, the lenders assumed the first 5 percent of the losses on loans and shared any remaining losses with FHA on a 15-percent/85-percent basis. The more equal division of risk for most loans currently insured under the demonstration programs creates stronger incentives for FHA\u2019s risk-sharing partners to use sound underwriting terms and service their loans diligently.", "Third, the demonstration programs provide for FHA\u2019s oversight of compliance with their requirements for maintaining a high credit rating or sufficient reserves. While the coinsurance program established reserve requirements for lenders, these requirements were not adequate, and neither FHA nor any other HUD authority monitored the lenders\u2019 reserves.", "Fourth, the demonstration programs explicitly preclude the use of Ginnie Mae\u2019s insurance with risk-sharing loans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Demonstration Programs Test Risk Sharing as a Means of Providing Credit Enhancement", "paragraphs": ["Section 542 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 directs HUD, through FHA, to test the use of risk sharing as a means of providing federal credit enhancements for multifamily loans. Through two demonstration programs, HUD is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of entering into partnerships or other contractual arrangements, including risk-sharing agreements, with qualified financial institutions (subsection b) and with state and local housing finance agencies (subsection c).", "The key statutory objectives of the risk-sharing partnerships with qualified financial institutions are to ensure that the qualified participating entities bear a share of the risk that is sufficient to create strong, market-oriented incentives to maintain sound underwriting and loan management practices; use the resources of FHA to assist in increasing multifamily lending as provide a more adequate supply of mortgage credit for sound multifamily rental housing projects in underserved urban and rural markets; encourage major financial institutions to expand their participation in mortgage lending; increase the efficiency, and lower the costs to the federal government, of processing and servicing multifamily housing mortgage loans insured by FHA; and improve the quality and expertise of FHA staff and other resources, as required for the sound management of reinsurance and other market-oriented forms of credit enhancement.", "The act does not explicitly apply these objectives to the risk-sharing partnerships with state and local housing finance agencies. However, HUD has explicitly incorporated two of these objectives\u2014using the resources of FHA to assist in increasing multifamily lending and increasing the efficiency of processing and servicing multifamily mortgage loans\u2014into its regulations for implementing the demonstration program with state and local housing finance agencies. Moreover, according to FHA\u2019s Commissioner, all six goals are reflected in the design and implementation of the program with state and local housing finance agencies. In this report, we refer to the subsection (b) program as the reinsurance program and the subsection (c) program as the credit enhancement program.", "While both demonstration programs transfer a percentage of the risk of default to HUD\u2019s risk-sharing partners, it is important to note that, to the extent the programs promote the development of affordable multifamily housing that HUD otherwise would not have insured, the federal government\u2019s loss exposure is increased.

Qualified housing finance agencies may also participate in the program. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are both government-sponsored enterprises that function as intermediaries in the secondary market, purchasing individual and pooled mortgage loans from primary lenders for sale as mortgage-backed securities to investors, such as pension funds and life insurance companies. Although Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are private corporations and operate without explicit federal guarantees, they enjoy a special relationship with the federal government because they are federally chartered and, in the view of the investment community, have implicit federal guarantees. The Federal Home Loan banks are not technically secondary market intermediaries, but they perform a similar function by selling combined obligation bonds in the capital markets to finance mortgage loans originated and held by their member institutions. These member institutions include over 6,500 financial institutions, primarily commercial banks and thrifts, and are located in every state.", "Under the risk-sharing reinsurance program, the qualified financial institutions are responsible for originating, underwriting, and servicing loans; managing assets; and disposing of properties in accordance with the terms of their risk-sharing agreements.

HUD will then reimburse its partner for 50 percent of any eligible loss on the loan specified in the risk-sharing agreement. The partner pays HUD an annual risk sharing/reinsurance premium in an amount equal to 25 basis points (0.25 percent) times the average unpaid principal balance on each mortgage loan reinsured under the program.", "Under the program, reinsurance may be provided for loans financing the construction, substantial rehabilitation, refinancing, or acquisition of affordable multifamily housing properties. To qualify as affordable, the housing must satisfy the requirements of the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit program. In addition, the property must continue to qualify as affordable for at least 15 years. When reinsurance is provided for acquisition or refinancing loans, the properties must remain affordable for at least 10 years beyond the terms specified in any existing commitments.", "Not all loans for affordable multifamily housing projects are eligible for reinsurance under the program. Specifically, loans for properties housing transients or serving as hotels, for nursing homes, and for intermediate care facilities are ineligible. In addition, HUD will not reinsure construction loans or refinancing loans when the qualifying financial entity is the mortgagee or guarantor of the original loan. Moreover, HUD will not provide reinsurance until a project is completed and at least 50-percent occupied, although the risk-sharing partner may insure or purchase the loan at any point. Finally, the risk-sharing partner assumes the initial costs of originating the loan and any risk associated with a construction loan.", "Although HUD delegates most of its traditional loan management responsibilities to its risk-sharing reinsurance partners, it retains monitoring and oversight functions.

HUD, in turn, is responsible for assuming the balance of the risk. The agency pays HUD an annual risk-sharing/credit enhancement premium equal to 50 basis points times the percentage of risk FHA has assumed, times the average unpaid principal balance on each mortgage loan insured under the program.", "If a foreclosure occurs, HUD is responsible for advancing 100 percent of the outstanding principal balance to the agency so that the agency can repay the investors.

Those that have reserved over 75 percent of their units generally have active multifamily programs, have a significant demand for multifamily housing within their state, and/or do not have a comparable credit enhancement mechanism available. From the start, many of these agencies appear to have recognized the potential benefits of participation. In contrast, agencies that have reserved fewer than 50 percent of their units generally have less demand for multifamily housing, are not as experienced in operating a multifamily housing finance program, or have an alternative credit enhancement mechanism available.", "As of September 1997, four housing finance agencies had not reserved any of their allocations. The Alaska Housing Finance Corporation had not used its 50-unit allocation because it believed that the program\u2019s benefits were marginal relative to the cost of the credit enhancement. The New York City Housing Finance Agency had not used its 300-unit allocation because, after allocating most of its revenue bond authority to raise capital for financing single-family housing, it did not have sufficient authority to finance multifamily housing. HUD recaptured these agencies\u2019 units and reallocated them to other agencies. In Indiana and Louisiana, the housing finance agencies were slow to use their allocations\u2014300 units and 280 units, respectively\u2014because they did not join the risk-sharing program until a year and a half after other agencies had joined and other priorities delayed the start of their risk-sharing programs.

Our work shows that housing finance agencies and HUD have essentially met these objectives: First, the program has allowed housing finance agencies to finance affordable housing by leveraging their reserves, lowering their interest rates, and extending their loan terms. Additionally, the program has assisted some housing finance agencies in establishing viable affordable multifamily housing programs. Second, by delegating the underwriting and processing of affordable multifamily housing loans to housing finance agencies, the program has enabled borrowers to obtain loans in a more timely manner.

To raise capital to finance affordable multifamily housing, these agencies sell bonds to investors. To pay the lowest possible interest rate on the bonds, an agency provides a credit enhancement (i.e., funded reserves) or purchases a credit enhancement (i.e., risk-sharing insurance) to improve its bond rating. If the agency provides a credit enhancement, it is usually required to fund a dedicated reserve account equal to a fixed percentage of its outstanding mortgages, as required by a national rating agency such as Standard and Poor\u2019s or Moody\u2019s. Consequently, the ability of the agency to finance affordable multifamily housing is limited by its available reserves. The agency can leverage its reserves by participating in the credit enhancement program: When it uses the program to enhance the credit of the loans it offers as collateral for the bonds it sells, it reduces its reserve requirement in direct proportion to the percentage of risk assumed by HUD. For example, when HUD assumes 50 percent of the risk, the agency reduces its reserve requirement by 50 percent, meaning that it can double its financing capacity without increasing its reserves. As of September 1997, about 90 percent of the units were in properties financed by loans for which HUD has assumed at least 50 percent of the risk. All of the participating housing finance agencies with insured loans have derived this leveraging benefit.", "The importance of leveraging varies not only with the percentage of risk assumed by HUD but also with the level of reserves maintained by the agency and the agency\u2019s demand for financing. The benefit is much greater for an agency that does not have sufficient reserves to meet the current and/or anticipated demand than for an agency that has larger reserves and/or lower demand. The California Housing Finance Agency, which was allocated more risk-sharing units than any other housing finance agency, was one of the agencies that derived substantial benefits from leveraging. When the agency entered into a 50/50 risk-sharing agreement with HUD in 1994, the demand for affordable multifamily housing was very high because, according to agency officials, the savings and loans crisis in the late 1980s and an economic recession that continued in many regions of the state until 1995 had limited the agency to financing about $25 million a year, on average, in affordable multifamily housing. After entering the credit enhancement program, the agency increased its financing to about $200 million per year.

Because the credit enhancement program generally enhances the credit rating on bonds issued by housing finance agencies, investors are willing to accept a lower yield (interest rate). If this lower rate is passed on to developers, it makes the development of affordable multifamily housing more feasible. The actual reduction in interest rates attributable to the risk-sharing program varies with the credit ratings of individual housing finance agencies, as well as with market interest rates at given times. Because most housing finance agencies participating in the risk-sharing program generally have at least an \u201cA\u201d credit rating and because market interest rates have been low over the past few years, the risk-sharing program has generally contributed to only a marginal reduction in interest rates (15 to 30 basis points). However, housing finance agencies reported to us that even marginal reductions in interest rates can affect the financial feasibility of affordable multifamily properties.", "In at least one instance, participation in the credit enhancement program contributed to a significant reduction in interest rates. The Montgomery County housing finance agency used the program to refinance a 311-unit property. The original mortgage was financed by two bond issues with a combined interest rate of about 8 percent. After the refinanced mortgage was insured through the credit enhancement program\u2014when market interest rates were lower than they had been at the time the property was originally financed\u2014the interest rate dropped to about 6 percent.

For example, the New York State Housing Finance Agency used the program to provide a 40-year mortgage for an 83-room property with 142 beds designed to serve elderly residents, including those who are mentally ill, handicapped, and/or homeless. Because these residents have very limited incomes, the 40-year mortgage was necessary to make the property financially feasible for the residents. State agency officials said that without the credit enhancement program, the term of the mortgage would have been 30 years because the agency would have had to rely on a state mortgage insurance program that limits mortgages to 30 years or less.

The Florida Housing Finance Agency has taken advantage of the program\u2019s efficiencies to bring together the financing for both construction loans and permanent mortgage loans in a timely way. This agency issues bonds to finance both types of loans for its affordable multifamily properties. While it uses a private bond insurer to provide a credit enhancement for the construction financing, it uses the risk-sharing program to provide a credit enhancement for the permanent financing. Because the private insurer requires assurance that the permanent financing will be available before it agrees to provide the credit enhancement for the construction financing, the agency needs to obtain the credit enhancement for the permanent loan expeditiously. The program provides the credit enhancement expeditiously, whereas delays could occur in HUD\u2019s traditional multifamily insurance programs. Such delays could, in the opinion of agency officials, postpone the development of certain properties long enough to increase their costs to the point that the properties would no longer be financially feasible.", "An associated benefit of more prompt approval of a property\u2019s permanent financing is reflected in the adage that \u201ctime is money.\u201d According to officials at various housing finance agencies, by reducing the time required for processing loans, the program has reduced the costs of developing properties.

The benchmark generally used in the housing industry for unsubsidized properties is about 1.20. However, for subsidized properties, this benchmark can range from 1.05 to 1.15. A lower debt service coverage ratio can allow rents to be lower, making a property more affordable to low-income households. Our analysis of data provided by the 21 housing finance agencies showed that, for the 110 properties completed as of September 1997, the median debt service coverage ratio was 1.11. Moreover, as table 2.1 indicates, about 33 percent of the insured units were in properties with a debt service coverage ratio of more than 1.15, and over 95 percent of the units were in properties with a debt service coverage ratio of at least 1.05.", "The loan-to-value ratio is used to determine whether a property\u2019s cash value will be sufficient to cover the mortgage debt in the event of foreclosure. The lower the ratio, the more the property\u2019s value is likely to be sufficient to pay off the outstanding mortgage obligation. Among private lenders, the benchmark used to finance unsubsidized properties is about 80 percent, and under FHA\u2019s traditional multifamily insurance program for profit-making developers it is 90 percent. Under FHA\u2019s traditional multifamily insurance program for nonprofit sponsors, the loan-to-value ratio can be as high as 100 percent.

In addition, permanency would support the program\u2019s continued use in financing tax-credit-supported properties and would complement anticipated increases in states\u2019 tax credit allocations.

As noted, both the DUS product line and the reinsurance program delegate responsibilities to other parties, and both secure their investment through risk sharing. Because Fannie Mae had been operating the DUS product line since 1988, it and its lenders had experience with delegation and risk sharing when the reinsurance program started. The other original participants in the reinsurance program did not have such experience.", "Modifications to the DUS product line created additional incentives for DUS lenders to participate in the reinsurance program. First, in 1994, Fannie Mae introduced the Targeted Affordable Housing product line, which allows DUS lenders to use more flexible underwriting standards than are required for the traditional DUS program. At the same time, Fannie Mae reduced its total loan guarantee fee to DUS lenders. These changes made it easier for lenders to finance affordable multifamily housing. Second, in 1996, Fannie Mae introduced the modified risk supplement, an incentive that allows a DUS lender to terminate its credit risk entirely within 3 years if a loan is performing according to prescribed criteria for payments, cash flow, and rent rates. By comparison, the traditional DUS program does not provide for terminating a lender\u2019s credit risk at any time during the term of the loan. Termination frees the lender\u2019s cash reserves for redirection to new projects. In addition, termination relieves banks, thrifts, and their mortgage banking subsidiaries of the risk-based capital requirements established for them by their respective federal regulatory agencies.According to Fannie Mae, these requirements have deterred multifamily lenders from participating in the DUS product line.", "Banc One Capital Funding Corporation\u2019s affiliation with a number of local banks has also facilitated Fannie Mae\u2019s participation in the reinsurance program. As a subsidiary of a multibank holding company, it has organizational ties to federally insured banks located in several states with multiple branch locations. This affiliation, which is unique among Fannie Mae\u2019s DUS/risk-sharing lenders, has provided Banc One Capital with a reliable network of local lenders seeking permanent financing for multifamily affordable housing projects. These lenders have an incentive to finance such projects because they are required, under the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, to serve the credit needs of their entire community, including low- and moderate-income neighborhoods. Providing these lenders with easy access to the secondary market also allows them to remain short-term lenders and avoid both long-term credit risk liability and risk-based capital requirements.", "According to Fannie Mae, its efforts to familiarize the DUS lenders with the reinsurance program have increased their participation. Fannie Mae has provided information about the program through a separate chapter on risk sharing in a guide that it publishes for DUS lenders, as well as through special training on risk sharing. In addition, according to Fannie Mae, the willingness of HUD staff to work with Fannie Mae to resolve programmatic issues, such as the restriction on purchasing fully amortizing loans (discussed later in this ch.), has encouraged participation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Sharing Benefits Participants by Encouraging Production and Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["When used with the DUS product line, the reinsurance program offers different but interrelated benefits to Fannie Mae, DUS lenders, and borrowers.

Fannie Mae has done more business through its Targeted Affordable Housing product line\u2014including more business that counts toward meeting the federal affordable housing goals for government-sponsored enterprises.DUS lenders have increased their lending capacity, and borrowers have produced more multifamily housing. Production has increased because participation decreases both the lenders\u2019 and Fannie Mae\u2019s loss exposure by 50 percent and reduces the lenders\u2019 reserve requirements by 50 percent, allowing the lenders to finance more properties. Additionally, under Fannie Mae\u2019s modified risk supplement, the lenders\u2019 loss exposure and reserve requirements are eliminated entirely after 3 years if their loans are performing satisfactorily.

Because HUD delegates its underwriting responsibility to Fannie Mae and Fannie Mae, in turn, delegates its underwriting responsibility to the DUS lenders, thereby eliminating the need for re-underwriting, loans are processed more quickly and their transaction costs are lowered. Efficient processing is particularly important for affordable housing loans because the costs of delays can make such loans financially infeasible.

This requirement excludes balloon mortgages from the reinsurance program because the amortization periods for balloon mortgages exceed the principal repayment periods of the loans. Most of the loans that Freddie Mac purchases have balloon mortgages, according to Freddie Mac; therefore, most of its loans are ineligible for the risk-sharing program. On August 21, 1997, Freddie Mac asked HUD to amend its risk-sharing agreement to allow the purchase of balloon mortgages of 10 years or more. Although HUD, in November 1997, approved a request from Fannie Mae to allow the purchase of 18-year balloon mortgages\u2014commonly used in financing properties with low-income housing tax credits\u2014it considers 10-year balloon mortgages less common in financing affordable housing and believes that they may present a greater refinancing risk to the borrower. HUD is therefore waiting for Freddie Mac to demonstrate that this added risk is worth the potential benefit to Freddie Mac.", "Another impediment to Freddie Mac\u2019s participation in the reinsurance program is uncertainty over the applicability of the term \u201crefinancing loan,\u201d which appears in Freddie Mac\u2019s risk-sharing agreement. Freddie Mac has asked HUD to resolve this uncertainty. According to a senior Freddie Mac official, the term\u2019s usage currently appears to require a 10-year extension of any existing affordability requirements when a borrower with a first mortgage on a multifamily property refinances that mortgage\u2014even when the refinancing occurs shortly after the property\u2019s construction. The possibility that affordability requirements may be extended deters lenders because it appears to reduce the property\u2019s long-term income-producing potential. HUD is planning to resolve this uncertainty as Freddie Mac has requested.", "A third factor that may have limited Freddie Mac\u2019s participation in the reinsurance program is its underwriting standards, which are set at a level that excludes many affordable multifamily mortgage loans. Program Plus, the multifamily product line that Freddie Mac introduced in 1994, requires a minimum debt service coverage ratio of 1.2 and a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 80 to 85 percent. In contrast, Fannie Mae\u2019s Targeted Affordable Housing product line allows a debt service coverage ratio as low as 1.1 and a loan-to-value ratio as high as 90 percent (or higher if a subordinate mortgage is part of a property\u2019s financing). This comparison is not intended to suggest that Freddie Mac should modify its underwriting standards to better accommodate the risk-sharing program, but to indicate that fewer affordable multifamily mortgages are eligible for purchase under Freddie Mac\u2019s reinsurance program than under Fannie Mae\u2019s."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "National Cooperative Bank and FHLB of Seattle Returned Their Units to HUD", "paragraphs": ["The National Cooperative Bank (NCB) signed a risk-sharing agreement with HUD in September 1994, but no risk-sharing loans were ever approved because, according to a senior HUD official, HUD and the NCB have been unable to agree upon when a project legally becomes a cooperative under the terms of the risk-sharing agreement. The risk-sharing agreement prohibited the approval of any cooperative housing loans until the parties concurred on this point and amended the agreement accordingly.

While amending Freddie Mac\u2019s risk-sharing agreement to include the purchase of 10-year balloon mortgages may make the majority of Freddie Mac\u2019s loans eligible for reinsurance, HUD may determine that potential increases in interest rates present an undue risk that it is unwilling to assume. However, because HUD has already determined that 18-year balloon mortgages do not present an undue risk, it could offer to amend Freddie Mac\u2019s or any other risk-sharing partner\u2019s agreement to allow for the use of reinsurance with 18-year balloon mortgages. In addition, if it agrees that the use of a short-term permanent loan as a bridge between a construction loan and a long-term permanent loan does not convert the permanent loan into a refinancing loan with additional affordability requirements, it will alleviate Freddie Mac\u2019s concerns about the possible imposition of such requirements. A senior HUD official said that even if HUD agrees that the use of a short-term permanent loan does not convert the permanent loan to a refinancing loan, he believes that limits will have to be placed on the length of such short-term loans.", "The Federal Home Loan Bank System, with its 6,504 member institutions in all 50 states, presents a major opportunity for expanding the reinsurance program while making minimal demands on HUD\u2019s resources.

However, senior management within HUD pointed out, \u201cit stands to reason\u201d that the substantial reduction in HUD\u2019s responsibilities under risk sharing should result in substantial time savings for HUD. Estimates provided by the FHA Commissioner support this conclusion. For example, according to the Commissioner, one field office estimated that it takes about 480 staff hours to process an application for a traditional mortgage loan through the firm commitment phase, compared with about 80 staff hours under the risk-sharing program. Overall, HUD estimated that processing an application through the firm commitment stage can take as many as 540 hours under the traditional multifamily insurance programs and as few as 12 hours under the risk-sharing program.

Moreover, we found that for all loans from California and Massachusetts, these data elements had not been entered into RSS.

More specifically, HUD said that it is already pilot-testing a new Development Application Process that will track mortgage insurance applications from their submission through to endorsement. HUD said that until data on the risk-sharing projects can be incorporated into this system, it will develop spreadsheets to make the current systems more user friendly and to simplify data input for its risk-sharing partners. Also, to facilitate monitoring, compliance, and timely reporting, HUD said that it would develop an Internet system to provide guidance and solicit verification of its records and the required reports from its risk-sharing partners."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
