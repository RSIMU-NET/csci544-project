To better address such threats, NIST developed, as called for by federal law, a voluntary framework of cybersecurity standards and procedures.", "The Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 included provisions for GAO to review aspects of the framework. The objectives of this review were to determine the extent to which (1) SSAs have developed methods to determine framework adoption and (2) implementation of the framework has led to improvements in the protection of critical infrastructure from cyber threats. GAO analyzed documentation, such as implementation guidance, plans, and survey instruments. GAO also conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 organizations, representing six infrastructure sectors, to understand the level of framework use and related improvements and challenges.

Specifically, two of the nine SSAs had developed methods and two others had begun taking steps to do so. The remaining five SSAs did not yet have methods to determine framework adoption. Most of the sectors (13 of 16), however, noted that they had taken steps to encourage and facilitate use of the framework, such as developing implementation guidance that links existing sector cybersecurity tools, standards, and approaches to the framework. In addition, all of the 12 selected organizations that GAO interviewed described either fully or partially using the framework. Nevertheless, implementing GAO's recommendations to the SSAs to determine the level and type of adoption remains essential to the success of protection efforts.", "The 12 selected organizations using the framework reported varying levels of resulting improvements. Such improvements included identifying risks and implementing common standards and guidelines. However, the SSAs have not collected and reported sector-wide improvements. The SSAs and organizations identified impediments to doing so, including the (1) lack of precise measurements of improvement, (2) lack of a centralized information sharing mechanism, and (3) voluntary nature of the framework. NIST and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have initiatives to help address these impediments.", "Precise measurements: NIST is in the process of developing an information security measurement program that aims to provide the tools and guidance to support the development of information security measures that are aligned with an individual organization's objectives. However, NIST has not established a time frame for the completion of the measurement program.", "Centralized sharing: DHS identified its homeland security information network as a tool that was intended to be the primary system that could be used by all sectors to report on best practices, including sector-wide improvements and lessons learned from using the framework.", "Voluntary nature: In April 2019, NIST issued its NIST Roadmap for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity , version 1.1, which included a tool for organizations to self-assess how effectively they manage cybersecurity risks and identify improvement opportunities.", "While these initiatives are encouraging, the SSAs have not yet reported on sector-wide improvements.

These entities included SSAs, NIST, Sector Coordinating  Councils (SCC), which are made up of nonfederal organizations and  serve as the voice of each sector and principal entryway for the  government to collaborate with each sector, and Information Sharing and  Analysis Centers (ISAC). We included SSAs and SCCs representing all  of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors in our review.

From  these sectors, we asked SCCs, trade associations (e.g., the American  Petroleum Institute), and ISACs to provide a list of small or medium and  large organizations that were users of the framework. We then divided up  the list of identified organizations by sector, and we randomly selected  one large and one small or medium organization from each sector,  resulting in a final list of 12 organizations. We conducted semi-structured  interviews with officials from the selected organizations to understand the  extent to which these organizations were using the framework.", "To address the second objective, we collected and reviewed  documentation, such as survey instruments and guides from federal and  nonfederal entities (NIST, SSAs, SCCs, and ISACs) that discussed their  efforts to measure sector-wide improvements. We compared these efforts  to best practices, such as NIST Special Publication 800-55, to identify any  measures the SSAs and SCCs had established to determine  improvements as a result of using the framework. In addition, we  interviewed officials from the selected organizations to understand the  extent to which they realized improvements in cybersecurity as a result of  framework adoption.

When considered together, these functions provide a strategic  view of the life cycle of an organization\u2019s management of cybersecurity  risk. Categories are the subdivisions of a function into groups of  cybersecurity outcomes tied to programmatic needs and particular  activities (i.e. asset management). Subcategories further divide a  category into specific outcomes of technical and/or management activities  (i.e. notifications from detection systems are investigated). Lastly,  informative references are specific sections of standards, guidelines, and  practices that illustrate a method to achieve the outcomes described and  support one or more informative references (i.e. NIST Special Publication  (SP) 800-53A).", "Implementation tiers characterize an organization\u2019s approach to  managing cybersecurity risks over a range of four tiers.

We also reported that SSAs and NIST had promoted and  supported adoption of the cybersecurity framework in the critical  infrastructure sectors. For example, we reported that DHS had  established the Critical Infrastructure Cyber Community Voluntary  Program to encourage adoption of the framework and had undertaken  multiple efforts as part of this program. These efforts included developing  guidance and tools intended to help sector entities that use the  framework. However, we noted that DHS had not developed metrics to  measure the success of its activities and programs. Accordingly, we  concluded that DHS could not determine if its efforts were effective in  encouraging adoption of the framework. We recommended that the  department develop metrics to assess the effectiveness of its framework  promotion efforts. DHS agreed with the recommendation and  subsequently took actions to implement it.", "We also reported in December 2015 that SSAs had promoted the  framework in their sectors by, for example, presenting the framework at  meetings of sector stakeholders and holding other promotional events. In  addition, all of the SSAs, except for DHS and the General Services  Administration (GSA), as co-SSAs for the government facilities sector,  made decisions, as required by Executive Order 13636, on whether to  develop tailored framework implementation guidance for their sectors.", "However, we noted that DHS and GSA had not set a time frame to  determine, as required by Executive Order 13636, whether sector-specific  implementation guidance was needed for the government facilities sector.  We concluded that, by not doing so, DHS and GSA could be hindering  the adoption of the framework in this sector. As a result, we  recommended that DHS and GSA set a time frame to determine whether  implementation guidance was needed for the government facilities sector.

Officials of the organization also stated that the common  language provided by the framework made it easier to communicate  within the organization when discussing budgets for cybersecurity that  resulted in budget increases.", "Some improvement: One organization explained that the framework is  accepted across organizations and that modeling its capabilities  against the framework provided assurance that it covered the critical  aspects of security. However, the organization noted that, if the  framework did not exist, it would have used another framework to  protect its critical infrastructure and facilitate decision making.", "Little improvement: One organization noted that it already had a very  robust risk management process through the use of international  standards before using the framework. As a result, the organization  stated that use of the framework resulted in little improvements.  Another organization that reported little improvements stated that use  of the framework helped the organization, but there were no specific  improvements that it could identify in protecting its critical  infrastructure as a result of using the framework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Initiatives Available to Help Address Impediments to Collecting and Reporting on Sector-Wide Improvements", "paragraphs": ["NIST Special Publication 800-55 guidance on performance measurement  states that agency heads are responsible for actively demonstrating  support for developing information security measures and facilitating  performance improvements in their information security programs, which  is to include a periodic analysis of data to determine lessons learned.

The SSAs, SCCs, ISACs, and organizations reported  a number of impediments to identifying sector-wide improvements,  including developing precise measurements of improvement, the  voluntary nature of the framework, difficulty in measuring the direct impact  of using the framework, lack of use cases, and lack of a centralized  information sharing mechanism. Figure 2 depicts the number of entities  and organizations that identified these five impediments, and is followed  by a discussion of each challenge.", "Two SCCs, two ISACs, and two organizations identified the difficulty  of having precise measurements of improvements as a result of using  the framework. SCC officials from the communications and healthcare  and public health sectors stated that authoritative and precise  measurements of improvements are difficult to determine in a  consistent and non-subjective manner. For example, the SCC officials  for the healthcare and public health sector stated that they were not  aware of a direct or precise form of sector-wide measurements to  define success in mitigating cybersecurity risk using the framework  within the sector. These officials added that future efforts could  include methodologies to track sector-wide improvements based on  the framework structure or other cybersecurity guidance.", "However, officials from NIST\u2019s Information Technology Laboratory  stated that they were in the early stages of initiating an information  security measurement program to facilitate identifying improvements  sector-wide. Officials stated that the program aims to provide  foundation tools and guidance to support the development of  information security measures that are aligned with an individual  organization\u2019s objectives. The officials stated that they had not  established a time frame for the completion of the measurement  program. They added that, once the program is developed, the SSAs  are expected to be able to customize the program and work with their  respective sector organizations to determine sector-wide  improvements based on their unique objectives.", "Eight SSAs, two SCCs, and four organizations stated that the  voluntary nature of using the framework made it difficult to identify  sector-wide improvements. Officials stated that private sector  framework adoption was voluntary and, therefore, there were no  specific reporting requirements to provide information on  improvements. For example, DOT officials from the Office of  Intelligence, Security, and Emergency Response stated that, while the  department and its co-SSA (DHS) intended to develop a survey to  determine sector-wide improvements, consolidating voluntarily shared  information will not reflect the depth and breadth of sector  stakeholders, as organizations that share information will not  collectively represent a sector.", "In April 2019, NIST issued the NIST Roadmap for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, version 1.1, which included a self- assessment tool that provided a mechanism for individual  organizations to self-assess how effectively they manage  cybersecurity risks in the context of broader enterprise risk  management activities and identify improvement opportunities. In  addition to the road map, NIST\u2019s framework included a section that  encouraged organizations to incorporate measurements of their risks,  which can be used to identify sector-wide improvements related to  using the framework.", "In addition, as previously mentioned, DHS, in partnership with its IT  sector partners, administered a survey to the small and mid-sized IT  sector organizations to gather information on, among other things,  framework adoption, challenges, and related improvements. While  DHS did not plan to report on the results until 2020, the survey was  intended to help the department in identifying improvements across  the small and mid-sized IT sector organizations. The survey was  administered to the small and mid-sized organizations within the IT  sector. DHS officials stated that any small or mid-sized business  across all critical infrastructure sectors could complete the survey and  that the department had promoted the survey to all sectors.", "Moreover, among all 16 sectors, only DOT and its co-SSA (DHS) had  considered the applicability of a similar approach for their sector  organizations. Specifically, DOT, in conjunction with DHS, plans to  distribute a survey intended to cover framework adoption, challenges,  and related improvements across the sector. DOT officials stated that  the survey completion is contingent upon DHS\u2019s Transportation  Security Administration\u2019s coordination of the review and approval  process to meet Paperwork Reduction Act compliance  requirements.", "Three SSAs, four SCCs, one ISAC, and seven organizations stated  that identifying sector-wide improvements as a result of using the  framework was difficult due to organizations struggling with  determining the direct impact from framework use. For example, the  Department of Energy officials from the Office of Cybersecurity,  Energy Security, and Emergency Response stated that the sector  cannot relate improvements to any one framework or model because  the sector organizations are engaged in numerous concurrent public  and private cybersecurity initiatives, each of which could impact  cybersecurity to varying degrees. In addition, EPA officials from the  Office of Groundwater and Drinking Water stated that most  organizations will not be able to link improvements directly to the  framework because EPA does not exclusively incorporate the  framework into the agency\u2019s sector guidance. The officials added that  existing industry standards and best practices are also recognized in  the development of EPA cybersecurity guidance. Therefore, although  an organization might experience improvements from using elements  of the framework, it might not be readily apparent that those  improvements came directly from the framework.", "To provide the sector organizations with access to various framework  resources, NIST updated its website to include sector-specific  implementation guidance and case studies, as well as insights from  organizations using the framework.", "Five organizations identified the lack of use cases as an impediment  to determining improvements. For example, one organization stated  that small and medium organizations struggled with identifying  improvements from using the framework because of the lack of use  cases (examples for how to determine or measure improvements as a  result of using the framework). To address the challenge, the  organization stated that it would be helpful if NIST, in collaboration  with federal and nonfederal entities, would share and provide use  cases or direction on common scenarios small and medium  organizations faced and how these could be addressed through the  framework.", "NIST officials stated that they were in the early stages of developing a  cybersecurity framework starter profile for small organizations. NIST  officials stated that they did not have a time frame for completing the  profile. However, they added that the profile will aim to identify  common solutions to a specific challenge, such as threat surface or  cybersecurity challenges in cloud computing, using a customized  adaptation of the framework.", "In addition, DHS created a small and midsize business road map for  all critical infrastructure sectors in 2018. The road map provided a  guide for small and mid-sized businesses to use in enhancing their  cybersecurity posture. The road map also included DHS\u2019s  cybersecurity information sharing and collaboration program and  secure information sharing portal. The purpose of the information  sharing and collaboration program was to enable actionable, relevant,  and timely unclassified information exchange through trusted public- private partnerships across all critical infrastructure sectors. In  addition, the secure information sharing portal served as a forum to  share cybersecurity strategies and insights with the critical  infrastructure sectors.", "Five organizations identified the lack of a centralized information  sharing mechanism as an impediment. For example, one organization  stated that there is a challenge in sharing information among all  critical infrastructure sectors in a more open and non-judgmental way.  To address this challenge, the organization stated that it would be  helpful to establish a centralized information sharing mechanism to  share and exchange information in an anonymous manner. Another  organization added that the challenge with determining improvements  is that there is no centralized information sharing mechanism to obtain  information. The organization added that it would be helpful to see  how organizations compare with one another in terms of goals  through this type of mechanism.", "DHS, however, identified its homeland security information network as  a tool that was intended to be the primary system used by entities to  collaborate to protect critical infrastructure.

Our report identifies the challenge of determining the direct impact  from framework use and notes that NIST\u2019s website provides the sector  organizations with access to various framework resources, to include  sector-specific implementation guidance and case studies, as well as  insights from organizations using the framework. Hence, organizations  can report on improvements from use of the framework using multiple  initiatives.", "Further, the department stated that suggesting government collection and  reporting of information regarding adoption or improvements erodes the  voluntary character of the framework. We do not agree with this  statement. Our report recognizes the voluntary character of the  framework but also notes that, without collecting and reporting such  information, critical infrastructure sectors may not fully understand the  benefits and value of the framework to better protect their critical  infrastructures from cyber threats.

These entities  included nine SSAs,13 out of the 16 Sector Coordinating Councils (SCC)  representing all 16 critical infrastructure sectors established in federal  policy, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and  Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISAC). We also analyzed  documentation from the SSAs and SCCs, such as the Department of  Energy\u2019s Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model and the Department of  the Treasury\u2019s Financial Services Sector Cybersecurity Profile. We  compared these to best practices, such as the National Infrastructure  Protection Plan and the Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government to determine efforts to facilitate framework adoption across  the sectors. We supplemented our review by interviewing officials from  these entities to determine any actions taken to determine framework  adoption.", "In addition, we selected six critical infrastructure sectors identified in the  2018 National Cyber Strategy of the United States of America as having  critical infrastructure with the greatest risk of being compromised. The six  sectors were (1) communications, (2) financial services, (3) energy, (4)  healthcare and public health, (5) information technology, and (6)  transportation systems. We asked SCCs, trade associations (e.g., the  American Petroleum Institute), and ISACs to provide a list of  organizations that were users of the framework. We divided up the list of  identified organizations by sector, and we randomly selected one large  and one small or medium organization from each sector, resulting in a  final list of 12 organizations. We then conducted semi-structured  interviews with officials from the selected organizations to understand the  extent to which these organizations were using the framework.", "To address the second objective, we collected and reviewed  documentation from NIST and the federal and nonfederal entities, such  as NIST\u2019s framework and its April 2019 Roadmap for Improving Critical  Infrastructure Cybersecurity, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  Information Technology Sector Small and Midsize Business  Cybersecurity Survey and 2018 Cybersecurity Resources Road Map,  and other SSA efforts to determine ongoing efforts to enable the  identification and measurement of improvements as a result of using the  framework. We compared these efforts to the 2014 Cybersecurity Act and  best practices, such as NIST Special Publication 800-55 on performance- based measures to determine the measures the SSAs and SCCs had  taken to determine improvements from using the framework.", "In addition, we interviewed officials from the selected organizations to  understand the extent to which they realized improvements as a result of  framework adoption and the support the organizations received from  federal and nonfederal entities.
