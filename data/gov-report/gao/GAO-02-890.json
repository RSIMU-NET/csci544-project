This program has successfully supported the incineration project's primary goal to safely destroy chemical weapons and has captured and shared many lessons from past experiences and incidents. However, the Lessons Learned Program does not fully apply generally accepted knowledge management principles and lessons sharing best practices, thereby limiting its effectiveness. The program's management plan does not provide policy guidance for senior managers to help them in decision-making or daily operations. In addition, it does not have formal procedures to test or validate whether a corrective action has been effective in resolving its deficiency. Finally, the lessons learned database is difficult to search and does not prioritize lessons. The Lessons Learned Program has been effective in sharing knowledge among the different stakeholders within the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Project. However, as new components were created to destroy the stockpile, the scope of the Lessons Learned Program remained primarily limited to the incineration project.

A lesson learned is thus the product of a process through which lessons are captured and shared with stakeholders.", "After a chemical agent was accidentally released at one of the project\u2019s facilities in May 2000, some Members of Congress and state and local communities near disposal sites became increasingly concerned about the overall safety at the Chem-Demil Program\u2019s incineration facilities. In July 2000, you requested that we report on the status of the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program and on the Programmatic Lessons Learned Program. We issued a report in August 2001 on the Emergency Preparedness Program. For this second report, we (1) assessed whether the Lessons Learned Program has effectively captured and shared lessons to support the Chem-Demil Program\u2019s goal to safely destroy the chemical stockpile and (2) identified the extent to which lessons learned have been shared and areas where sharing could be improved.

These activities evolved into the Chem-Demil Program. The Chem-Demil Program includes the Chemical Stockpile Emergency Preparedness Program, created in 1988, to enhance the emergency management and response capabilities of communities near the storage sites in case of an accident. The Nonstockpile Chemical Materiel Product was added in 1993 to destroy any chemical weapons or materiel not included in the stockpile disposal program.", "The Chemical Stockpile Disposal Project has or plans to use incineration to destroy chemical agents at five sites: Johnston Atoll in the Pacific Ocean; Anniston, Alabama; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Umatilla, Oregon; and Tooele, Utah. Tooele is the only site with a facility currently operating. The three other stateside facilities are scheduled to begin operations in fiscal years 2002-2003. The Johnston Atoll facility has finished destroying its stockpile and is being closed. The Alternative Technologies and Approaches Project will use non-incineration methods (such as agent neutralization by chemical treatment) to destroy agents in bulk containers at Newport, Indiana, and Aberdeen, Maryland. The Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program is also researching alternative methods to destroy agents in weapons at Pueblo, Colorado, and Blue Grass, Kentucky.", "The Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Department of the Army share management roles and responsibilities in the Chem-Demil Program.

In September 2001, the Army updated the life cycle cost estimate for the Chem-Demil Program from $15 billion to $24 billion. The new cost estimate extended the agent destruction schedule at four of the eight stateside sites beyond the initial target date of April 2007. Despite setbacks experienced at Johnston Atoll, Tooele, Utah, and Umatilla, Oregon, among others, the incineration program has successfully destroyed over 25 percent of the original stockpile (see table 1).", "The Lessons Learned Program was created in part because many different contractors were involved in the incineration program, and a system was needed to collect and preserve the institutional knowledge and acquired experience. The program is intended to identify, capture, evaluate, store, and share (implement) lessons learned during the different phases of the chemical stockpile demilitarization process. It collects two different kinds of lessons: \u201cdesign\u201d lessons covering engineering and technical processes and \u201cprogrammatic\u201d lessons involving management, quality assurance, emergency response, and public outreach.  As criteria for assessing the knowledge management processes used by the Lessons Learned Program, we identified four of a number of federal organizations that practice knowledge management and operate lessons learned programs.  In making our selections, we reviewed literature and spoke with knowledge management experts to find organizations recognized for their ability to share lessons or effectively manage knowledge.

The Field Configuration Control Boards have authority over changes at their sites involving lower costs.

The Tooele site had used a superior and more expensive material (hastelloy) to fix their problem than the material used at the other sites. Headquarters decided not to implement the lesson at the three sites primarily because it would have involved higher initial costs. This decision ultimately caused serious safety concerns, higher costs, and delayed the schedule. In February 2002, pipes at Anniston had failures similar to those experienced at the first two sites. This raised safety concerns and resulted in a 4-week delay to replace the pipes with hastelloy. It is too early to determine whether the material used at the Umatilla and Pine Bluff sites will have the same problems.

As a result, some users are reluctant to use the database and thus may not benefit from it when making decisions that affect the program.Many users who responded to our survey stated that they experienced difficulties in searching the database, and some we interviewed described specific problems with searches.

The processes also include prioritizing lessons by risk, immediacy, and urgency.  In 1998, the Army Audit Agency recommended that the database be purged or archived of obsolete items and that current and future lessons be prioritized.

If this transfer of responsibilities does take place, it would be important for the two programs to be already sharing information fully and seamlessly.

The program needs guidance to help senior managers make decisions that allow them to weigh the potential impact of not implementing lessons learned. This guidance would be a set of procedures, including safety and risk analyses, to be followed before deciding to counter a lesson learned. Without such guidance, decision makers, in at least one case, chose lower cost over safety and schedule, ultimately at the expense of all three. Also, the Lessons Learned Program lacks procedures to validate the effectiveness of implemented lessons. The lack of a validation step partially defeats the purpose of the lessons learned process, which relies on the confirmed effectiveness of solutions emerging from knowledge and experience. If the effectiveness of a lesson cannot be validated over time, problems may emerge again, with a negative impact on safety, costs, and schedule.", "Further, the information in the lessons learned database is not easily accessible or prioritized. These drawbacks have frustrated users and may discourage them from using the database. This could lead to wrong or misinformed decisions that could affect safety. In addition, there is no overarching coordination or sharing of information across all the components of the Chem-Demil Program, which grew and evolved over time without policies or procedures to ensure that knowledge would be captured and communicated fully. As a result, fragmented or duplicative efforts continue today, and the Assembled Chemical Weapons Assessment Program in particular lacks access to important data maintained by the Chemical Stockpile Disposal Project and the Alternative Technologies and Approaches Project.

During the incident, and due to a malfunctioning agent-sampling probe, the agent-monitoring equipment in the common stack did not detect agent.", "Lessons learned from this incident include (1) improving the process to purge (flush) chemical agent from the feed line by adding a fuel oil purge and increasing the purge cycle to ensure a complete purge, (2) modifying the alarm system in the common stack to provide redundancy and test the alarms more frequently, and (3) closing all four valves after the agent line is purged and process activities involving the liquid incineration feed system when the furnace is cooling down to the charcoal filters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Construction Incident at Umatilla", "paragraphs": ["On September 15, 1999, more than 30 construction workers were affected by an irritating vapor in the air while working in the munitions demilitarization building.
