Specifically, the DNN Research and Development (DNN R&D) and Nonproliferation and Arms Control (NPAC) programs track and document technology advancements resulting from their projects, such as in project reports. However, NNSA officials acknowledged that DNN R&D\u2014by far the larger program\u2014does not consistently track and document whether its projects result in technologies transitioned to or deployed by end users. In contrast, the NPAC program tracks and documents these project outcomes. By not consistently tracking and documenting technology transition and deployment outcomes, NNSA is unable to demonstrate the full results of its projects. GAO gathered information from various sources on a sample of 91 projects. Of these, 88 projects advanced technologies by, for example, building instrument hardware or developing models for data analysis; the other 3 did not advance technologies but assessed potential applications of existing technologies. Among the 88 projects that advanced technologies, 33 also resulted in technologies being transitioned, including software used to analyze nuclear detonations. Finally, of these 33 projects, 17 also resulted in deployed technologies, including an enrichment monitoring tool used in Iran and space-based nuclear detonation sensors. Reasons that some technologies in the sample did not move beyond the advancement or transition stage included that the technology needed further development or evaluation before being used.", "Limitations with the clarity of the DNN R&D program's publicly reported performance measures make them difficult to interpret, potentially hindering users' ability to determine the program's progress; better documentation of project performance against baseline targets may enhance NNSA's performance assessments. The DNN R&D program's performance measures have clarity limitations because they do not, for example, define measurement criteria or provide context justifying how the program determined that it met its performance targets; this may cause external users of the measures, including Congress, to have difficulty interpreting NNSA's assessment of performance. In a December 2011 report, GAO recommended that NNSA clarify its publicly reported measures for DNN's R&D program. GAO continues to believe that NNSA should do so. Regarding project-level performance, NNSA uses project plans to establish baseline targets for projects' scope and completion date, and tracks progress by communicating with project managers and reviewing documents such as quarterly and final project reports. However, NNSA officials said that final project reports do not document their assessment of performance against baseline targets and that there is no common template for final project reports, which GAO confirmed in a review of several final project reports. Documenting such assessments could enhance NNSA's ability to assess project performance against goals, consistent with federal internal control standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that NNSA consistently track and document results of DNN R&D projects and document assessments of final project results against baseline performance targets.

For instance, we  found that performance measures for DNN\u2019s Nonproliferation  and  Verification R&D program were unclear because the measures assessed  progress using unspecified criteria and milestones from a classified R&D  requirements document. Because these performance measures were  linked to an unstated secondary set of criteria, we found that a third party  unfamiliar with the classified requirements would have difficulty  interpreting the measures and discerning whether the criteria for  measuring progress were appropriate, sufficient, and up to date.

Both the DNN R&D and NPAC programs track  and document projects\u2019 results in advancing technologies. For instance,  the DNN R&D program uses an online system, WebPMIS, to track project  costs and maintain an archive of project-related documentation. This  documentation includes project reports that provide information on the  scientific and technological advancements that result from a project.  Similarly, the NPAC program provided documentation of technology  advancement for our review. However, the DNN R&D program, which is  by far the larger program, does not consistently track and document  projects that result in technologies being transitioned or deployed. NNSA  officials acknowledged that the DNN R&D program does not use the  WebPMIS system, or otherwise collect and maintain information, to track  and document whether its projects result in technologies that have been  transitioned to or deployed by end users.

For instance, the NPAC program generally focuses on developing  technologies at higher readiness levels to prepare them for transition and  deployment in the field, according to NNSA officials. Conversely, most  of the DNN R&D program\u2019s functional areas conduct R&D on  technologies that are further from being deployment-ready because they  require more basic work at lower technology readiness levels, with some  exceptions, NNSA officials told us.

We recommended in our 2011 report that NNSA clarify these  measures. NNSA neither agreed nor disagreed with this  recommendation.", "NNSA officials told us, when we interviewed them for this report, that they  do not agree that the DNN R&D program\u2019s performance measures are  unclear, for two reasons.", "First, according to NNSA officials, NNSA provides supplemental  information for Office of Management and Budget (OMB) users of the  performance information that explains the targets and how  performance is measured. Specifically, NNSA officials told us that the  DNN R&D program provides additional documentation to OMB\u2014 some of which the officials also provided to us for review\u2014that  includes information explaining the progress against annual targets  under each of the program\u2019s performance measures. However, most  of the information that NNSA provided on the DNN R&D program is  classified or official use only.", "Second, an NNSA official told us that the DNN R&D program  performance measures are not unclear because the measures are  used primarily to inform internal program managers who are familiar  with classified requirements against which progress is assessed,  rather than to provide information to third-party users. However, there  may be potential external users of the performance information\u2014such  as congressional decision makers and other external parties\u2014who  are not familiar with the baseline requirements and may have difficulty  interpreting the level of performance achieved by the DNN R&D  program.", "In the current review, the clarity issues we found with the DNN R&D  program\u2019s performance measures were similar to those we identified in  December 2011. We continue to believe that NNSA should clarify these  publicly reported measures, so that users of the performance information\u2014including Congress and the public\u2014have a sufficient basis  to judge the programs\u2019 performance in meeting the United States\u2019 nuclear  nonproliferation technology needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Better Documentation Could Enhance NNSA\u2019s Assessment of Project Performance", "paragraphs": ["NNSA assesses the performance of the DNN R&D and NPAC programs\u2019  projects by reviewing project documentation and communicating with  project managers, but improvements in NNSA\u2019s final project  documentation could enhance assessment of project performance.

According to NNSA documentation we reviewed and NNSA officials we  interviewed, the DNN R&D and NPAC programs establish baseline  targets for projects\u2019 scope of work and completion date in project plans. In  some cases, initial project plans are updated\u2014for example, to incorporate  new or modified project objectives. At the end of the project, project  managers at the national laboratories produce final project reports for  program managers to review.", "NNSA officials stated that these final project reports describe a project\u2019s  technical results.

According to NNSA officials and stakeholders we interviewed at  technology end user agencies, NNSA collaborates throughout the  decision-making and project selection process with the end users. In our  review of program documents and interviews with agency officials, we  found that the DNN R&D and NPAC programs generally take the  following steps in their project selection processes:  Step 1: DNN establishes project requirements. According to NNSA  officials, DNN R&D and NPAC project requirements flow from national  policy documents, such as the Nuclear Posture Review; additionally,  NPAC project requirements flow from international sources such as the  Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT),  Comprehensive Safeguards Agreements; Additional  Protocols; and the  IAEA  Department of Safeguards Long Term R&D Plan. To identify the  technical capabilities that are required to meet the requirements  established in these documents and sources, NNSA officials develop  more detailed plans, such as the DNN R&D program\u2019s goals, objectives,  and requirements (GOR) documents. The GOR documents specify  requirements for five of the DNN R&D program\u2019s six functional areas\u2014all  but the cross-cutting Enabling Capabilities functional area. Additionally,  each GOR document has a corresponding technology roadmap, which  establishes detailed technical requirements to meet the needs identified  in the GOR document. Similarly, the NPAC program develops needs  documents that identify specific needs and corresponding capabilities to  develop; NPAC uses these documents to guide the proposal selection  process. NNSA consults with interagency stakeholders to inform the  requirements specified in the GOR documents and needs documents.", "Step 2: The DNN programs issue annual calls for proposals. Both  programs issue annual calls for proposals, which specify the technical  requirements proposals should address. The programs also require that  those who submit proposals clearly explain how the proposed project  relates to identified project requirements. According to NNSA officials, the  DNN R&D program typically issues its calls for proposals in mid-October and NPAC issues its calls for proposals during the spring. The DNN  R&D program\u2019s calls for proposals specify weighted criteria against which  proposals are reviewed, including mission relevance, scientific and  technical merit, and budget. The NPAC program\u2019s calls for proposals  differ between its two program areas. The Safeguards program area  provides explicit evaluation criteria including cost effectiveness, technical  maturity, and deployment potential. Calls for proposals in the Verification  program area do not provide explicit evaluation criteria, but they provide  information on program goals and areas of technical consideration for the  current budget year. They also require applicants to describe the  proposed work, including activities, milestones, and deliverables.", "Step 3: National laboratories submit informal project proposals. Scientists  at the national laboratories respond to the call for proposals by submitting  informal project proposals, known as white papers, to the NNSA program  offices. The white papers describe proposed projects to demonstrate new  capabilities or technologies sought in the calls for proposals. As specified  in the DNN R&D program\u2019s calls for proposals, the program uses a three- tiered system to rank proposals\u2014specifically, by designating proposals as  hot, warm, or cold\u2014and provides comments to improve the proposals or  future white paper submissions. According to an NNSA official, the DNN  R&D program returns the informal project proposals to the original  submitters. All hot and warm proposals may be amended in response to  program officials\u2019 comments and then resubmitted in the next step of the  process as formal project proposals. NNSA officials stated that cold  proposals receive no further consideration. NNSA officials within the  NPAC program stated that they use a ranking system that is similar to the  DNN R&D program\u2019s system; the officials also provided documentation  that shows their rationale for selecting or not selecting projects for further  consideration. Both programs seek to provide feedback within a general  time frame. The DNN R&D program aims to provide feedback within 2  weeks of receiving the white papers. According to NNSA officials, NPAC\u2019s  Safeguards program area provides feedback on the white papers about 3  to 3 1/2 months from the date of submission, and the Verification program  area provides feedback about 2 1/2 months from the date of submission.  According to NNSA officials and interagency stakeholders we  interviewed, interagency stakeholders are consulted during this step of  the process, as appropriate.", "Step 4: Laboratories submit formal project proposals. Scientists at the  national laboratories amend hot and warm white papers and resubmit  them as formal proposals for NNSA\u2019s consideration.", "Step 5: DNN selects projects in consultation with laboratories and end  users. NNSA officials identify the formal proposals that best meet the  criteria and requirements specified in the calls for proposals, considering  input provided by laboratory officials, interagency stakeholders, and  potential end users on each proposal. According to NNSA officials, after  discussing budgetary considerations and current, prioritized needs with  interagency stakeholders and potential end users, program officials  develop a final, ranked list of projects selected to receive funding and  support. Program officials then circulate this final list to interagency  stakeholders and potential end users.", "Figure 3 shows the general five-step selection process used by DNN\u2019s  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["NNSA\u2019s research and technology development programs make vital  contributions to national security, and the projects they support address a  range of important proliferation detection and monitoring needs, including  improving abilities to detect covert nuclear material production, nuclear  explosions, and potential violations of IAEA  safeguards agreements. It is  not clear, however, how often NNSA\u2019s research and technology  development projects\u2014especially those supported by the DNN R&D  program\u2014result in transitioned or deployed technologies because NNSA  does not consistently track and document such information. We  acknowledge that DNN\u2019s research and technology development programs  pursue a broad range of scientific tools and capabilities, with the goal of  ensuring that the United States remains prepared to deal with  unanticipated nonproliferation  challenges as they emerge. Therefore, we  recognize that not all R&D projects, such as projects conducted at low  levels of technology readiness, are intended to result in a deployed  technology, and that a higher deployment rate does not necessarily  indicate a more successful R&D program, or vice versa. Moreover, we  recognize that in cases where technology transition and deployment are  project goals, certain challenges complicate DNN\u2019s efforts to track the  deployed technologies that result from its projects. Nevertheless, we were  able, as part of our review of selected projects, to track projects\u2019 end  results, including end users\u2019 deployment of technologies that result from  the projects. Moreover, not tracking such end results may affect control  activities by limiting the quality of information that NNSA has available to  evaluate project performance. More consistently tracking and  documenting the transitioned and deployed technologies that result from  its projects would help ensure that NNSA maintains and uses quality  information to evaluate its performance and achieve its objectives, in  keeping with federal internal control standards. Doing so would also  facilitate knowledge sharing within DNN, and it would provide a means by  which to present valuable information to Congress and other decision  makers about the programs\u2019 results and their overall value.", "In addition, better tracking of project results by the DNN R&D program  may have the salutary benefit of providing information to the program that  could allow it to develop clearer program performance measures, as we  recommended in December 2011. The DNN R&D program\u2019s  performance measures continue to have clarity limitations similar to the  ones we identified in the December 2011 report, because understanding  the publicly reported performance information depends on users of the  information having access to or being familiar with criteria in official use  only or classified documents. We continue to believe that it is important  for NNSA to implement our December 2011 recommendation that NNSA  clarify the DNN R&D program\u2019s publicly reported performance measures,  so that Congress and other users of these measures have a sufficient  understanding of DNN programs\u2019 status and progress.", "By documenting assessments that compare the final results of a project  against the baseline targets for scope of work and completion date that  are established in initial plans for each project, NNSA could improve the  quality of the information it needs to evaluate performance at the end of  the project. Specifically, taking these steps could enhance managers\u2019  ability to use quality data to assess actual project performance against  planned or expected results, consistent with federal internal control  standards. Such assessments are essential to ensure that the DNN R&D  and NPAC programs\u2019 research and technology development projects are  effectively and efficiently using resources, another key aspect of federal  internal control standards. If changes to the initial baselines are  necessary\u2014which may be the case in some instances\u2014we believe that  they should be made in such a way that initial project targets are still  documented and available for review in evaluating the full progression of  a project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the NNSA Administrator take these two actions:", "Direct the DNN R&D program to track and document the transitioned  and deployed technologies that result from its research and  technology development projects, to the extent practicable.", "Direct the DNN R&D and NPAC programs to document, using a  common template or other means, their assessment that compares  the final results of each project against the baseline targets  established in each project\u2019s initial project plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided drafts of this report to NNSA, DOD, DHS, and State for  review and comment. In emails, DOD, DHS, and State stated that they  had no comments on the report. In NNSA\u2019s written comments, which are  summarized below and reproduced in appendix V, NNSA neither agreed  nor disagreed with our first recommendation and partially agreed with our  second recommendation; however, NNSA stated that it plans to take  actions in response to both recommendations. NNSA also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its written comments, NNSA did not state whether it agreed or  disagreed with the recommendation that, to the extent practicable, the  DNN R&D program track and document transitioned and deployed  technologies resulting from the program\u2019s projects, but it described  planned actions consistent with the recommendation. NNSA stated that  our report did not clearly or fully disclose reasons that the DNN R&D  program does not track and document transition and deployment of  technologies resulting from its projects. Specifically, NNSA commented  that the DNN R&D program\u2019s space-based activities\u2014unlike the other  DNN R&D program areas\u2014are production and deployment oriented, and  that it would therefore be misleading to track individual projects in this  area that are transitioned and deployed. Regarding the other DNN R&D  program areas, NNSA commented that it does not have ongoing insight  into transition and deployment outcomes for various reasons\u2014for  example, due to classification barriers regarding the transition and  deployment of certain technologies. NNSA also expressed concern that  information on such outcomes may not be readily available or may not be  cost-effective to obtain. Our report discusses a number of reasons why  the agency may not consistently track the deployment\u2013 and transition- related outcomes of the DNN R&D program\u2019s projects and notes the  production and deployment orientation of the space-based project  portfolio. However, we disagree that tracking the outcomes of these  projects would be misleading. To the contrary, it is vital to track these  outcomes, as the space-based program area receives the largest share  of the DNN R&D program\u2019s funding. Moreover, we believe that  information on project outcomes should be readily available to NNSA  program officials in the course of their regular interactions with the project  managers at the national laboratories and the interagency end users of  nonproliferation technologies\u2014as was the case with projects in our  sample. NNSA agreed that, where such information is readily available,  reporting of transitioned and deployed technologies can provide  information on program successes, and it identified actions it will take  consistent with the recommendation. Specifically, NNSA stated it will  complete an assessment by June 2017 of the DNN R&D program\u2019s  portfolio to determine to what extent transition and deployment data are  readily available for specific projects and include additional information on  those projects as part of its performance reporting. If implemented as  planned, such an assessment would be a step toward ensuring that  NNSA maintains and uses quality information to evaluate its performance  and achieve its objectives, in keeping with federal internal control  standards.", "NNSA stated that it agrees in part with our second recommendation\u2014that  NNSA document, using a common template or other means, its  assessment that compares the final results of each DNN R&D and NPAC  project against the baseline targets established in each project\u2019s initial  project plan. NNSA stated that it supports implementation of a common  template for documenting project closeout to provide consistency in  information reporting, but it noted that R&D projects are dissimilar to  acquisition activities and that comparing final project results to an initial  project baseline would be misleading. Specifically, for exploratory R&D  projects, NNSA commented that project outcomes can be \u201csignificantly  indeterminate\u201d at the beginning of a project and stated that it uses an  approach known as \u201cprogressive baselining\u201d to adjust plans and  benchmarks as research matures, where appropriate. NNSA stated that  final project results should be compared to the final approved plans to  ensure consistency in project documentation and to provide a meaningful  assessment of project performance. NNSA agreed that information on the  project\u2019s initial baseline is important to understand the progression of the  project. We acknowledge that adjustments to initial project plans may be  appropriate in some cases, provided that the initial plans remain available  and transparent and that decisions behind such revisions are well- documented, consistent with federal internal control standards. NNSA  stated it will establish a common template by June 2017 and use it to  compare projects\u2019 final results to the final approved plans. It also stated  that the template will require a brief description of significant changes  between the initial and final approved project plans. If implemented as  planned, the template could help NNSA to ensure that the DNN R&D and  NPAC programs\u2019 research and technology development projects are  effectively and efficiently using resources, in keeping with federal internal  control standards.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Administrator of NNSA; the Secretaries of Defense,  Energy, Homeland Security, and State; and other interested parties.

Our selection  criteria ensured variations in program areas and project outcomes. We  generally limited our selection to the top 25 percent of projects in terms of  total funding between fiscal years 2012 and 2015, and excluded all  projects that were not led by one of the five national laboratories listed  above. We also excluded projects in certain categories, such as projects  under the program directors and university accounts.

Specifically, we  interviewed project officials, including the project manager, at the national  laboratory that was the lead on the project, as well as interagency officials  that received technologies transitioned from the DNN R&D and NPAC  programs. Our interviews included officials from the Departments of  Defense (DOD), Homeland Security, and State; the International  Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA); and the Preparatory Commission for the  Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty Organization.

We reviewed the evidence to determine whether each  project in our sample resulted in advanced, transitioned, or deployed  technology or other outcomes. The outcomes that we identified are not  mutually exclusive for any project. For example, one project could  transition a technology to an end user and also result in a publication, or a  project may have resulted in a research outcome that we did not identify  because the outcome was not indicated in the evidence we collected.
