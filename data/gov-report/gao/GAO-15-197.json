Treasury established three initiatives under TARP to  address these issues: MHA, the Hardest Hit Fund, and FHA Short  Refinance. As of September 30, 2014, Treasury had disbursed  approximately $13.7 billion (36 percent) of the $38.5 billion in TARP  housing funds, though the amount of disbursements varied across the  three programs (see fig. 7). For example, of the $29.8 billion dedicated to  MHA, the largest TARP-funded housing program, Treasury had disbursed  $9.3 billion (31 percent) as of September 2014. In the case of the Hardest  Hit Fund, $7.6 billion (59 percent) had been disbursed as of that date. In  contrast, only $0.01 billion (0.13 percent) had been disbursed for the FHA  Short Refinance program. As we have reported, Treasury officials said  that they anticipated using all of the remaining MHA funds, and in April  2014, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) increased its estimate of  likely disbursements under TARP-funded housing programs because of  extensions of the MHA program. But CBO has continued to project an  $11 billion dollar surplus for the TARP-funded housing programs because  it anticipates that fewer households will participate in the housing  programs.", "Treasury will continue to disburse TARP funds under the housing  programs for several more years. Specifically, homeowners have until at  least December 31, 2016, to apply for assistance under MHA programs,  and Treasury will continue to pay incentives for up to 6 years after the last  permanent modification begins. Treasury\u2019s obligation under FHA Short  Refinance will continue until September 2020. Unlike TARP expenditures  under some other programs, such as those that provided capital infusions  to banks, expenditures under these programs are generally direct outlays  of funds with no provision for repayment. As of September 30, 2014, the  estimated lifetime cost for the housing programs was $37.4 billion."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MHA Programs", "paragraphs": ["The centerpiece of Treasury\u2019s MHA program is HAMP, which seeks to  help eligible borrowers facing financial distress avoid foreclosure by  reducing their monthly first-lien mortgage payments to more affordable  levels. Treasury announced HAMP (which originally included what is now  called HAMP Tier 1) on February 18, 2009. At that time, Treasury  projected that the program would help up to 3 million to 4 million  borrowers who were at risk of default and foreclosure. However, we noted  then that reaching the projected number of borrowers might be difficult for  several reasons. In an effort to reach more borrowers, Treasury  expanded HAMP to include HAMP Tier 2, which servicers began  implementing in June 2012. Treasury also provides incentive payments  to services, investors, and borrowers for modifications under HAMP Tier 1  and HAMP Tier 2.", "Since the HAMP first lien modification program began in 2009 through  September 2014, there have been 2,246,680 trial modifications and  1,416,705 permanent modifications. These modifications resulted in a  median monthly mortgage payment reduction of $490 per month.  As shown in figure 8, HAMP participation, as measured by trial and  permanent modifications started each quarter, peaked in early 2010,  generally declined in 2011, and then held relatively steady through the  middle of 2013. However, beginning with the third quarter of 2013, the  number of new HAMP trial modifications began to decline, falling to  27,000 in the second quarter of 2014, then increasing slightly, to 33,000  in the third quarter of 2014\u2014the most recent for which data are available.  During the same period, the number of new HAMP permanent  modifications declined steadily, from 46,000 in the third quarter of 2013 to  29,000 in the third quarter of 2014. As we have reported, according to  Treasury, the decline in HAMP modifications is a reflection of the  shrinking pool of HAMP-eligible mortgages, as evidenced in the declining  number of 60-day-plus delinquencies reported by the industry.", "Treasury has taken steps to increase HAMP participation, including  extending the program application deadline and making other program  changes. First, in June 2014, Treasury announced the third extension of  the program to at least December 31, 2016. With this extension,  Treasury has increased the period for eligible borrowers\u2014including the  unemployed and those facing an increase in interest rates\u2014to apply for  assistance by 4 years from the initial program deadline of December 31,  2012. However, as we have reported earlier, the pool of mortgages  eligible for HAMP programs is declining. Second, in September 2014  Treasury, in conjunction with HUD and the Ad Council, launched a new  series of public service advertisements (PSA) to raise awareness of the  free government resources available through MHA to assist struggling  homeowners in avoiding foreclosure. The campaign includes television,  print, radio, outdoor (billboards and other signage), and digital PSAs.  According to Treasury, since the campaign was initially launched in 2010,  media outlets have donated about $137 million in airtime and physical  and digital space, and more than 16,000 outdoor or transit ads have been  placed nationwide. Treasury officials said that calls to the Homeowner\u2019s  HOPETM Hotline increased by 20 percent during the first week of the  campaign. Treasury attributes the increase to the September 2014  campaign effort. Lastly, in late 2014, Treasury released two Supplemental  Directives. The first, Supplemental Directive 14-04, was issued in October  2014 and stated that the interest rate on a HAMP Tier 2 modification  would be lowered effective January 1, 2015, to the weekly Freddie Mac  Primary Mortgage Market Survey Rate minus 50 basis points (down from  zero basis points). Treasury is lowering the rate in an effort to increase  the population that is potentially eligible for HAMP and provide greater  payment reduction. In particular, Treasury believes the lowered rate will  allow more HAMP Tier 1 borrowers, who might struggle with an interest  rate step-up under Tier 1, to qualify for a HAMP Tier 2 modification. On  November 30, 2014, Treasury issued Supplemental Directive 14-05,  which made several changes to HAMP that, among other things, will  extend the pay-for-performance borrower incentives by an additional  year, to a sixth year for the modification, and increases the amount of the  incentive payment for that additional year to $5,000, up from $1,000 for  years 1 to 5. While previously Tier 2 modifications were not eligible for  pay-for-performance incentive payments, the changes in Supplemental  Directive 14-05 apply to both Tier 1 and Tier 2 modifications, as well as to  FHA-HAMP and RD-HAMP modifications.", "Among the other programs designed to help borrowers, HAFA has  assisted the largest number of borrowers\u2014approximately 169,000\u2014 through September 2014. Under HAFA, 162,498 short sales and 6,975  deeds-in-lieu had taken place, as of September 2014 PRA had provided  an estimated $14.8 billion in principal reduction to borrowers, through  163,951 permanent loan modifications, with $68,861 in median principal  reduction. Through 2MP, servicers reported starting about 141,697  second-lien modifications, of which 38,480 fully extinguished the second  lien as of September 2014. Nearly 67,708 trial modifications were started  that received Treasury FHA-HAMP incentives as of June 2014, and the  median monthly payment reduction for active permanent modifications  was $232. However, as of June 2014, only 187 modifications had been  made that qualified for Rural Development (RD)-HAMP incentives. For  the RD-HAMP loans, the median monthly payment reduction for active  permanent modifications was $260.", "As discussed earlier, Treasury extended HAMP and all MHA programs  until at least December 31, 2016. However, Treasury officials told us that  they might decide at a future date to wind down some programs under  MHA at an earlier date or to extend MHA beyond 2016.

According to  Treasury officials, currently there are no plans to extend the deadline for  committing Hardest Hit Fund monies beyond 2017.
