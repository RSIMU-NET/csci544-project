Millions of taxpayers in at least 36 other countries that also have tax withholding systems do not have to prepare income tax returns because these countries have alternative filing systems not currently available in the United States.", "Generally, there are two types of such alternative filing systems found in other countries. One type of filing system, which provides that the taxing authority prepares the return for the taxpayer, can be referred to as the \u201ctax agency reconciliation\u201d system. The other type of filing system provides that taxpayers\u2019 income tax is withheld at the source and remitted to the tax agency by employers and other payers who are responsible for withholding taxes that equal but do not exceed each taxpayer\u2019s tax liability.

Also, unlike many countries with final withholding systems, the United States tax system does not exempt or limit taxes on interest and dividend income, nor does it require married couples to file separately. (Appendix I lists these 34 countries and describes how final withholding systems generally operate in those countries.)", "A tax agency reconciliation system would be easier to implement in the United States because it would not require statutory changes. In general, under a tax agency reconciliation type system, the tax agency is to calculate the tax liability on the basis of information returns or income reports received from payers, such as wage reports prepared by employers and interest income reports prepared by financial institutions. The tax agency then is to send the taxpayer a printed tax return or reconciliation statement. Upon receipt of the tax return, the taxpayer is to review and correct its contents, add information if any is missing, and return the completed return to the tax agency. After the tax agency receives and reviews the tax return, it is to send the taxpayer either a refund or tax bill.", "In 1994, Denmark prepared tax returns for 85 percent of its 4.5 million taxpayers, and Sweden prepared returns for 74 percent of its 7.3 million taxpayers.", "In 1987, in response to a provision in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, IRS studied the feasibility of a tax agency reconciliation filing system.

IRS would spend the next 4 to 6 weeks processing these documents. Some taxpayers would receive their returns in early March, but most taxpayers would start receiving theirs in early April.", "IRS concluded that the tax agency reconciliation filing system it studied was not feasible primarily because it would be very difficult to receive, verify, and post over 900 million wage and information documents in time to generate tax returns.

However, we did not attempt to quantify the benefits and costs to them of implementing such a system. Rather, we viewed the approach to considering the feasibility and desirability of devising an alternative filing system as encompassing two levels of efforts: first, an initial look using readily available data to determine whether additional research by IRS might be warranted and second, a more detailed effort that might involve gathering and analyzing additional data, including specific impacts on third party stakeholders. While we restricted our effort to the first of these two levels of effort, we did make a presentation, on how a tax agency reconciliation system would work, to IRS\u2019 Information Reporting Program Advisory Committee, which is composed of representatives from third-party stakeholders, such as financial institutions, employers, and other payers.

We also interviewed officials at the Department of the Treasury and IRS to determine what administrative changes would have to be made to the federal tax system to have a voluntary tax agency reconciliation type system. We also reviewed the literature on how the tax agency reconciliation systems worked in Denmark and Sweden. We compared information on the operations of tax systems in these countries with the operations of our federal income tax system to determine how they differed.

IRS does not receive information returns on taxpayers\u2019 costs to produce income.", "Similarly, taxpayers who itemized deductions were excluded from the eligible population because some itemized deductions, such as medical expenses and charitable contributions, are not reported on information returns.

IRS could develop a test to determine whether the risk involved in sending the refund with the return would be acceptable.", "The tax return would serve as a tax bill if the taxpayer\u2019s income tax withholdings did not cover the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability.

We estimate that about 858,000 of the 51 million tax agency reconciliation eligible taxpayers would have been pursued by IRS under its underreporter program at a cost of $17.61 per taxpayer. Therefore, under a tax agency reconciliation system, the underreporter program cost savings would be about $15 million.

According to IRS data, about 57 million or 72 percent of the 93 million taxpayers who received refunds in 1995 were issued them by the end of April.

Also, over 2 million taxpayers participated in IRS\u2019 tax year 1995 TeleFile program in which they relied on IRS to accurately calculate their taxes. On the other hand, one of IRS\u2019 selling points for using TeleFile was that taxpayers would receive their refunds sooner than if they filed paper returns. According to IRS, about 23 million taxpayers who filed tax year 1995 forms 1040EZ were eligible to participate in the TeleFile program in 1996, which was the first year the program was available nationally.", "As with other alternative filing options that IRS has introduced, such as electronic filing and TeleFile, getting taxpayers to volunteer to participate in a tax agency reconciliation system may depend upon how well the system works.

Such a system would also benefit IRS by reducing its returns processing and compliance costs. An unknown, however, is the extent to which taxpayers would voluntarily participate should such a system be adopted in the United States. Key considerations in this regard would be taxpayers\u2019 perceptions of how efficiently, accurately, and fairly IRS could administer such a system. In addition to addressing these perceptions, IRS would need to design the system to minimize, to the extent possible, its own administrative problems and any additional burden imposed on other stakeholders, including employers and affected financial institutions in proving information returns electronically and more timely.", "A major impediment to establishing a tax agency reconciliation system is the length of time it takes IRS to process information returns. IRS\u2019 current processing time frame would not allow it to provide taxpayers\u2019 federal returns before April 15, which is the due date for filing tax returns. IRS\u2019 1987 study of return-free filing also noted this impediment as the major reason why a return-free system could not be implemented at that time.

It should also assess the added burdens and costs that such a system would have on employers, affected financial institutions, and other stakeholders and develop ways of mitigating these burdens and costs.", "Because of the uncertainty about stakeholder receptivity to such a system, we also recommend that, if the reexamination results in IRS initially determining that an agency reconciliation system may be feasible and desirable, the Commissioner expand the reexamination to include a limited pilot test. Such a test would provide IRS with useful data for addressing stakeholder concerns and demonstrating its ability to administer such a system fairly and accurately.

He indicated that a reexamination of the feasibility and desirability of designing and implementing a tax agency reconciliation system could become part of the Tax Settlement Reengineering project, which is an IRS initiative that uses a structured methodology to examine IRS\u2019 business processes and ways to reduce paper processing. However, he noted that it would be a difficult task to do a complete cost-benefit analysis of a tax agency reconciliation because much of the information needed to do the analysis, such as private sector costs, may not be available. We recognize the difficulty of obtaining complete information on private sector costs, but we believe that IRS should be able to do an adequate evaluation of the feasibility of a tax agency reconciliation system because it has experience in evaluating other alternative filing systems such as TeleFile.", "The Deputy Commissioner noted that our report identified that the Service Center Recognition and Image Processing System and the Simplified Tax and Wage Reporting System as steps that IRS is taking to accelerate information returns processing. However, he stated that the draft report did not describe how close these activities are to accelerating information returns processing and therefore did not accurately portray the impact of this obstacle on a tax agency reconciliation system. During the course of our work, we asked for, but IRS did not provide estimates of when these initiatives are projected to be able to accelerate information returns reporting. The Deputy Commissioner\u2019s letter is also silent in this respect.", "Finally, the Deputy Commissioner commented that the costs of a tax agency reconciliation system would be more than the costs to process electronically filed returns. We agree that the costs associated with the type of tax agency reconciliation system described in the report would be more than the costs to process the same number of returns electronically filed. However, we estimated that only 8 million of the 51 million taxpayers who could have been included in an alternative filing system in tax year 1992 filed electronically.

Budget constraints could hamper IRS\u2019 ability to adopt a tax agency reconciliation system, but this should not prevent it from reexamining the concept. Similarly, if information returns processing cannot be accelerated in time to issue tax returns well before April 15, IRS would not be able to implement the type of tax agency reconciliation system described in the report unless federal and state laws are changed. We expect that information return filing and processing would be the key element in IRS\u2019 examination of the system. In regards to whether taxpayers who volunteer for the system may not let IRS know when they have income not covered by information returns, we agree that the reporting of income not subject to information returns is potentially problematic. However, that problem exists today for paper returns and TeleFile, and we see no evidence it would be worse under a tax agency reconciliation system. As part of its examination of a tax agency reconciliation system, IRS may be able to get a handle on this type of noncompliance by evaluating a sample of TeleFile participants to determine whether they failed to report noninformation return income. As to whether the IRS would be more error-prone in processing tax changes under a tax agency reconciliation system than processing tax returns, we assume that IRS would have controls and procedures that would minimize errors under any system it develops.", "The Institute noted that a tax agency reconciliation system is too dependent on future IRS and SSA improvements and that it is too costly for IRS to undertake such a system until after the successful implementation of these future improvements. The Institute stated that paper processing may be more efficiently reduced by expanding opportunities for electronic filing and TeleFile and it concluded that IRS is correctly focusing its attention on these initiatives. We agree that IRS should continue to reduce taxpayer burden and paper processing through electronic filing and TeleFile.

Our costs estimates were based on the combined costs to process the Form 1040 series of returns, which included both paper and electronically filed returns. The costs of TeleFile returns were not considered because we used tax year 1992 return data, and TeleFile was not implemented nationwide until 1996 for tax year 1995 returns.

These costs dealt with the loss of federal revenues due to a decrease in taxable income reported by paid preparers and the costs of unemployment insurance and public assistance payments if the paid preparer industry experiences a significant loss of jobs. These types of costs are difficult to quantify.

However, there are differences among the countries using this system in when and how employers calculate the final withholding. For example, under the United Kingdom\u2019s cumulative final withholding system, the employer must calculate the employee\u2019s tax for a given pay period as well as the cumulative tax to date and then make any necessary adjustments. To determine how much tax employers need to withhold, the employee is to submit a form to the United Kingdom\u2019s tax agency showing basic factors affecting the taxpayer\u2019s tax status, such as the number of dependents and amount of allowances the taxpayer is entitled to claim. From this information, the tax agency is to develop a code and give it to the employer who then applies the code to tax tables to determine the amount of taxes to withhold. Tax agency auditors are to later verify whether employers withheld the correct amounts of taxes. More than three-fourths of the 22.4 million taxpayers eligible for final withholding in the United Kingdom did not have to file tax returns in 1994.", "Germany\u2019s final withholding system is similar to the United Kingdom\u2019s except that at the beginning of the calendar year the tax agency is to issue a certified wage card to each employee, listing basic factors affecting the employee\u2019s tax status. The employee is to present the wage card to the employer for use in determining the amount of taxes to withhold. At the end of the year, the employer is to summarize the wage and withholding information, and if necessary, adjust the employee\u2019s last paycheck so that the correct amount of taxes is withheld.", "Under Japan\u2019s final withholding system, employees are to submit to the tax authorities, through their employer, statements providing exemption information, which include the names of dependents and other necessary particulars. Employers are to use the exemption information to withhold income tax on employment income according to tax tables based on variables, including the size of the income, number of exemptions, and periodic employment income. At the end of the year, the employer is to compare the taxes collected with the yearly tax amounts due and adjust the last paycheck so that the withholding equals the tax liability.", "Many countries with final withholding filing systems reduce the number of taxpayers required to file tax returns by either exempting, limiting, or taxing interest and dividend income at the source. Fourteen countries exempt all or a portion of interest, while another 14 countries tax interest with a flat amount at the source (e.g., tax on interest is withheld by the financial institution).", "Countries with final withholding filing systems may not allow married taxpayers to file joint returns. Twenty-two countries with a final withholding filing system specifically require married taxpayers to file separately. Other countries either require joint tax returns or give married couples that option. According to International Monetary Fund officials, administering a final withholding system with a \u201cmarried filing joint\u201d filing status would be very difficult if both spouses work. In that circumstance, each employer would need to take the income of the taxpayer\u2019s spouse into consideration when calculating the final withholding amount.", "Under nearly all final withholding systems, including those of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, taxpayers are required to file returns under some circumstances.

The final withholding criteria were identified to minimize tax law and administrative changes, limit burden on employers and other payers, and maximize the number of taxpayers that could be included in the system. To meet these criteria, taxpayers would not be able to itemize deductions and, instead, would take the standard deduction; taxpayers could have only wage income because other types of income are generally not subject to withholding; only taxpayers with one employer could be covered by final withholding because taxpayers with more than one employer would increase the burden on employers, who would have to know the income received from other employers to withhold the correct amount of taxes; married couples where both spouses had income were excluded because employers would have to know the income of both spouses to withhold the correct amount of taxes; and taxpayers could not claim any credits because employers would have to calculate the credit, which would impose additional recordkeeping burdens on them.", "We estimated that about 18.5 million taxpayers in 1992 met these conditions and could be covered under this type of final withholding system.

For example, in addition to knowing about current withholding requirements and forms, employers would need to become familiar with separate withholding and reporting requirements for employees who volunteer for final withholding and those who do not. Unlike under the current employment tax requirements, employers would need to ensure that they accurately track withheld taxes so that they could make a year-end adjustment to make the withheld taxes equal to the taxpayer\u2019s tax liability.

When the computer identifies nonfilers, IRS service centers send a series of computer-generated notices to potential nonfilers.

Therefore, the tax agency reconciliation underreporter population would be 1.1 million taxpayers (2.3 million x 46 percent). Since underreporter costs are only associated with cases that IRS worked, and it handled 78 percent of its cases in 1991, we estimated that IRS would have worked 858,000 of the 1.1 million tax agency reconciliation eligible cases. IRS estimated that it cost about $17.61 to work and close a tax year 1991 underreporter case. Thus, the cost savings of not having to work these underreporter cases would be about $15.1 million (858,000 x $17.61).

We estimated that 30 million of the 51 million taxpayers had income from wages, interest, and unemployment compensation, their filing status was either single or married filing joint returns, and they had no dependents. Taxpayers with these characteristics would have return preparation tasks associated with taxpayers who could file Form 1040EZ.

IRS estimated that it takes taxpayers 4 minutes to complete Schedule EIC. We assumed that taxpayers could take twice as long to complete the taxpayer information form because taxpayers may have to enter twice as much data on the taxpayer information form.", "Therefore, we estimated that the 51 million taxpayers would spend an estimated 6.8 million hours preparing the form.", "Copying, assembling, and sending the form to IRS: For this task, we also used IRS\u2019 average time estimates for Schedule EIC, which was 5 minutes.
