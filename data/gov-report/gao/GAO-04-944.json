DOD delivered its reports to Congress months after the time that Congress began considerations for the new budget, and accessibility was limited because the reports were classified. BTR data in the reports to Congress were derived through subtraction, rather than totaling the actual value of BTR transactions. The reports do not provide a complete picture of how BTRs are implemented on a program-by-program level. DOD has no overall system for maintaining detailed BTR and withhold data across organizations, although such data can be reconstructed from DOD's multiple data collection systems. GAO found that DOD organizations used BTRs frequently to increase or decrease research and development program funding levels. The Air Force, Army, Navy, and Missile Defense Agency (MDA) executed 1,927 BTRs, amounting to about $1 billion in fiscal year 2003. This amounted to about 2 percent of the research and development funds for these organizations. Among the programs affected by BTRs, about half lost funds and more than one-fourth gained funds. While the dollar amounts and frequency differed for fiscal year 2002, the patterns were similar. Although GAO did not observe any instances in which DOD's use of BTRs exceeded the thresholds, GAO's work was not conclusive on this point, as GAO did not design steps to assess compliance with thresholds. DOD withheld about $2.8 billion in funds in fiscal year 2003. Officials cited several reasons for implementing BTRs and withholds, including accommodating unanticipated changes or events, implementing congressional mandates, and, in the case of some withholds, controlling the execution of individual programs. Congress has required DOD to provide better and more timely information on reprogramming and withhold activities."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2003, Congress appropriated $59 billion for defense research  and development overall. Most of this amount was appropriated for  research and development accounts for the military departments and  Defense-wide, including the Missile Defense Agency (MDA) and the Office  of the Secretary of Defense. While such funds are designated for hundreds  of individual programs, Congress recognizes that the Department of  Defense (DOD) needs to have some flexibility to adjust these funds for  unexpected needs or for other valid reasons. In fiscal year 2003, DOD  adjusted several billion dollars worth of appropriated research and  development funds for the military departments, MDA, and the Office of  the Secretary of Defense.", "DOD uses two key mechanisms to adjust the distribution of research and  development funds\u2014reprogramming and withholding. In this report,  reprogramming refers to the shifting of funds by DOD within individual  research and development accounts for purposes other than those  contemplated when Congress appropriated the funds, such as to different programs. Congressional defense committees have established  reprogramming guidelines, including setting dollar thresholds, that direct  DOD to seek the prior approval of the committees before executing the  movement of funds. In accordance with these guidelines, DOD regulations  require that when the amount to be reprogrammed falls below the  threshold, referred to as a below-threshold reprogramming (BTR), DOD  generally does not need congressional committee approval. DOD  regulations also provide that reprogrammings above the threshold do  require prior congressional committee approval. A single reprogramming  transaction adjusts at least two programs\u2014the donor and the recipient.  Often, several programs can be adjusted. In this report, we treat each  adjustment as a BTR. Withheld funds are those funds appropriated to  programs that DOD temporarily holds back for some period of time during  the funds\u2019 period of availability before releasing them to research and  development programs. Withheld funds are eventually either released to  the designated programs or reprogrammed for other uses.", "The appropriations committees have expressed concern about how DOD is  reprogramming and withholding appropriated funds for research and  development and that DOD has not kept Congress adequately informed  about such actions. The Conference Report accompanying the fiscal year  2004 DOD Appropriations Act (P. L. 108-87) mandated that GAO review  DOD\u2019s movement and withholding of research and development funds.  In response to the mandate, this report addresses (1) the quality of the  information available about DOD\u2019s use of BTRs and withheld funds in  fiscal years 2002 and 2003 and (2) the amount and volume of BTRs and  withheld funds for those years. The report also addresses recent  congressional direction on reprogramming and withholding defense  research and development funds.", "We focused our review on the military departments\u2014the Air Force, Army,  and Navy (including the Marine Corps)\u2014as well as MDA and the Office of  the Secretary of Defense. To determine the quality of the information  available about DOD\u2019s use of BTRs and withholds, we reviewed the DOD  Financial Management Regulation and congressional reports; DOD internal  reports and reports to Congress; financial reports; data collection systems;  and financial records for all of the research and development programs  from the Army, Air Force, Navy, MDA, and Office of the Secretary of  Defense. In accordance with federal internal control standards, we have  defined quality of information as measured by such factors as timeliness,  accessibility, accuracy, and appropriateness of content. To determine the  amount and volume of BTRs and withheld funds, we obtained available  data from the Air Force, Army, Navy, and MDA\u2019s data collection systems on  actual BTRs and withholds and developed a database containing data on  each research and development program. We conducted multiple analyses  about BTRs. We interviewed DOD policymakers and decision makers to  gain an understanding of how various reports are prepared and to obtain  information about BTRs and withholds. To gain insight into program-level  activities, we interviewed program managers and collected data from at  least three selected research and development programs in each of the  three military departments. We selected the programs on the basis of three  criteria: a laboratory, a program with significant net reduction or addition  of funds through BTRs, and a program with a relatively high number of  both reductions and additions of funds through BTRs. We performed our  review from November 2003 to July 2004 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. More details about our  methodology are in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The funds that DOD managers need for their research and development  programs first must be considered by DOD for inclusion in the President\u2019s  Budget. If the President includes the funds in the budget he transmits to  Congress, then Congress considers the request. If Congress approves the  request, it appropriates funds for the programs in the annual DOD  appropriations act that is signed into law by the President. Three years can  lapse from the time a program manager begins formulating a research and  development program budget request to the time that funds are included in  an appropriations act that is signed into law and designated for the  program in the accompanying conference report. Figure 1 shows a typical  scenario for the research and development program budgeting process.", "The resulting appropriations act typically specifies a lump sum for several  different accounts, including the research, development, test and  evaluation appropriation account of each of the military departments as  well as separately for DOD-wide research and development activities.", "The account for research, development, test, and evaluation (referred to in  this report as research and development) is further broken down into  budget activities, such as basic research and advanced technology  development. Each budget activity is then subdivided into program  elements, which we refer to as programs in this report. The conference  report that accompanies the appropriations act lists the amounts Congress  designated for each activity and program. An individual program can be  further subdivided by DOD into projects or other activities. Following the  annual enactment of the appropriations act, the Office of Management and  Budget apportions the funds and DOD allots the funds and\u2014except for  those being withheld\u2014makes the money available or releases it to  managers for executing programs. Managers generally have 2 years to  obligate research and development funds before the funds expire.", "By the time the budget approval process is complete and the funds are  made available, several things can be said about the appropriated amounts  for the individual program: (1) they represent decisions by Congress to  approve programs as requested, create new programs, and adjust the  requested amounts for others; (2) because of the elapsed time from the  point the program manager began formulating the budget request until  enactment of the appropriations act, situations may have changed that  cause a misalignment between the approved funds and the actual status of  the program; (3) the inherent unknowns in research and development will  result in some programs not being executed as contemplated by the  budget; and (4) unanticipated events will develop during the execution year  that were not anticipated in the budget.", "It is for these and other reasons that Congress recognizes that DOD needs  some flexibility to adjust research and development funds after they are  appropriated. A primary vehicle for exercising this flexibility is  reprogramming. DOD can also withhold funds from programs prior to  reprogramming or releasing the funds. The Air Force and MDA restrict the  authority to reprogram or withhold funds to their headquarters staffs, while  the Army and Navy grant their subordinate commands and program  executive offices this authority.", "This report defines withheld funds\u2014or a withhold\u2014as appropriated DOD  research and development funds that are not released by DOD to a  designated program for part of the 2-year period of availability of those  funds. Prior to being released for execution, funds may be withheld by the  Office of the Secretary of Defense and the headquarters for the military  departments and MDA. DOD withholds funds for a variety reasons and  does not seek prior congressional approval for these transactions. While  funds are withheld, the funds are still designated for the program but not  yet released to that program.", "In contrast, reprogramming of appropriated funds is a mechanism for  which DOD has established a formal process for internal review and  approval and, when necessary, congressional notification and approval.  For fiscal year 2003, to implement congressional guidelines, DOD\u2019s  reprogramming policy required prior written approval from congressional  defense committees for any research and development reprogramming  increase of at least $10 million to an existing program and for any decrease  of at least $10 million or 20 percent of the program\u2019s appropriation,  whichever was greater. In fiscal year 2002, the threshold for increases was  $4 million, and, for decreases, $4 million or 20 percent of the appropriated  amount, whichever was greater. These thresholds are applied at the  program level of the budget. According to DOD\u2019s Financial Management  Regulation and congressional guidelines, DOD generally does not have to  seek prior congressional approval for reprogrammings that do not exceed  the threshold; hence, these are BTRs. The threshold applies to both  individual BTRs and the cumulative amount of BTRs in each program  element. Thus, multiple BTRs for the same program must not exceed the  threshold in total. If congressional committees have denied a  reprogramming request above the threshold, DOD policy prohibits the use  of a series of BTRs to achieve the denied request.", "DOD submits a number of reports to Congress each year to convey  appropriations-related information for each research and development  program. One of these reports, the DD 1416, is intended to capture all  changes made to the amount designated by Congress for a program,  including BTRs. The DD 1416 is Congress\u2019s primary vehicle for information  about BTR changes by DOD to the amount designated for a program. The  annual DD 1416 report for Congress covers the entire fiscal year ending  September 30. A DOD regulation requires that the annual report for  Congress be sent by DOD components to the DOD Comptroller within  30 working days after September 30 for review prior to submission to  Congress.

It appears that until  the reports were received, congressional committees were less informed  about the funds that were moved from one research and development  program to another when considering program budgets for the following  year.

Officials also  noted that current levels of flexibility are too limited given the adjustments  that may be needed to deal with such changes. For example, testing on a  program may have been accelerated or delayed; new requirements may  have arisen; design changes may be required; a program\u2019s costs may have  increased; new technologies may have emerged; priorities may have  shifted; and unexpected events, such as operations in Afghanistan and Iraq,  may have occurred. Consequently, funding changes may be needed after  funds are appropriated.", "Military department and MDA officials stated that having the flexibility to  adjust funding in such circumstances allows them to make better use of  available funds by fixing a problem promptly, taking advantage of an  opportunity, or responding to an unexpected contingency. For example, in  fiscal year 2003, the Air Force reprogrammed almost $10 million to the  KC-10S program to address unexpected cost increases in the cockpit  modernization program. According to Air Force officials, obtaining these  funds when they were needed avoided contract and schedule issues that  would have been detrimental to the program. Ultimately in this case, the  cockpit modernization program continued to experience unexpected cost  increases and schedule slippages, and the Air Force later cancelled the  program. In another example, Army officials stated that the presence of  improvised explosive devices in the Iraq conflict has made explosive  disposal robots more important than the budget preparation process  anticipated 3 years ago. They noted that the Army is using some of its BTR  flexibility to address this higher priority need.", "Military department officials told us they also withhold funds for  unexpected events or opportunities that may arise during the fiscal year.  These withheld funds are then available for reprogramming as needed. For  example, the Army withheld and subsequently reprogrammed about  2.3 percent of funds from most programs in fiscal year 2003 to cover  expenses of ongoing operations. Officials said that this is the only year the  Army instituted a general withhold on its programs. The Navy withheld  2 percent from most research and development programs in fiscal year  2002 and 1 percent in fiscal year 2003. These funds were used to address  unexpected contingencies and emerging technological requirements. While  Air Force officials stated that they do not routinely withhold funds from all  programs, the Air Force Research Laboratory withholds about 5 percent  from all laboratory programs to provide for its headquarters unit. The  Office of the Secretary of Defense, Research and Development, withholds  and subsequently reprograms as necessary about 10 percent from the  research and development programs it manages to provide for  contingencies and to cover reductions resulting from statutory  requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementing Statutory Obligations", "paragraphs": ["Military department officials also use withholds to fund statutory  obligations. For example, DOD is required by statute to set aside research  and development funds for small business concerns to conduct research  projects that have the potential for commercialization. Two programs are  supported with these funds: the Small Business Innovation Research  Program, which stimulates early-stage research and development by small  business concerns; and the Small Business Technology Transfer Program,  which funds cooperative research and development projects involving a  small business and a research institution. The military departments and  MDA vary in the way they set aside the funds for these statutory  obligations. This variation provides these organizations with additional  flexibility in adjusting appropriated research and development funds. In  2003, the Army and the Navy exempted some intelligence programs from  the Small Business Innovation Research and the Small Business  Technology Transfer assessments. They then withheld the funds needed to  cover these assessments from the remaining programs. Air Force officials  informed us that they reallocate the assessments during the fiscal year to  adjust funds available to programs. For example, in fiscal year 2002, the Air  Force used a BTR to restore the Small Business Innovation Research  assessment it had earlier made against the B-2 program, to provide the  program with more money. Other programs were assessed a higher amount  to make up the difference.", "In addition, military department officials use withholds to allocate  rescissions and reductions that are included in appropriations acts and  cancel appropriated funding. Rescissions or reductions may apply  specifically to some or all research and development accounts or across- the-board to other appropriations accounts. For example, for fiscal year  2003, because of a change in projected inflation estimates, Congress  directed a reduction of $1.4 billion across all operations and maintenance,  procurement, and research and development appropriations accounts, with  the reduction to be applied proportionally to each program within each  account. To implement this reduction, the Air Force and Navy used  withholds to reduce research and development programs\u2019 appropriations  by $105.6 million and $78.2 million, respectively.", "Officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense noted that they  withhold funds from research and development programs to make certain  programs achieve a particular milestone or other event and to assure that  additional funds appropriated by Congress beyond the program\u2019s requested  budget reach the intended program and can be used effectively. For  example, the Office of the Secretary of Defense sometimes withholds a  portion of a program\u2019s appropriation to assure the program completes a  report, accomplishes a test, or complies in some other way with  headquarters\u2019 direction. Often, these withholds are in response to a  congressional directive contained in authorization or appropriations report  language. Funds are usually released once the program has accomplished  the required task. Each year, Congress adds funds to certain programs\u2019  requested budgets. Officials observed that there is often some uncertainty  as to which program Congress intended these funds to benefit and whether  those programs can effectively use the funds. Consequently, they withhold  the funds until they can determine which programs are to receive the  additional funds and to ensure that those programs can use the money  effectively before releasing the funds. In fiscal year 2002, these types of  withholds represented a large percentage of the Office of the Secretary of  Defense withholds, amounting to nearly $2.7 billion. However, the Office of  the Secretary of Defense has subsequently reduced its withholds of  congressional additions, while some of the departments have increased  theirs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Managers Have Adopted Strategies for Anticipating BTRs and Withholds", "paragraphs": ["DOD, military department, MDA, and program officials informed us that  while they can expect with some confidence that reprogramming and  withholds will occur during the budget year, they cannot predict the timing  or amount. In anticipation of these funding adjustments, program and  military department officials noted that program budgets are often  increased during preparation. While this does not appear to be an unusual  practice, we did not assess its extent or magnitude. This practice allows  programs to perform at planned levels if and when these actions actually  occur. Program officials stated that in cases for which anticipated  reductions were underestimated, schedules are sometimes slowed down in  response to BTRs and withholds. For example, tests or other scheduled  events may be delayed until withheld funds are released or the funds lost  through BTRs are paid back. If funds are not paid back, program schedules  may be permanently slowed. For example, according to Air Force officials,  when the Air Force reduced the C-130 avionics modernization program\u2019s by  $35 million in fiscal year 2003, the program manager extended the  development program and renegotiated the development contract.", "Funds also may be informally held back after they have been released to  programs. That is, program managers may be told not to spend some  portion of the funds that have actually been released to their programs in  order to provide funds for later reprogramming. This differs from  withholds because withholds can only be implemented before funds are  released to programs. The informal holding back of funds occurs after  funds are released, is done verbally, and is not recorded. This essentially  creates a pool of reserved funds that can be used to meet anticipated but  not fully identified requirements. MDA officials informed us that the Office  of the Secretary of Defense requires them to informally hold millions of  dollars each year in anticipation of the annual omnibus reprogramming.  Omnibus reprogramming is a compilation of several above-threshold  reprogrammings sent to Congress late in the fiscal year. For example, in  fiscal year 2003, the Office of the Secretary of Defense required MDA to  informally hold about $23 million and later used about $6 million of this  money for omnibus reprogramming. The remaining funds were then  released to MDA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Congressional Direction for Better Information", "paragraphs": ["Congress has continued to express concerns about how DOD is adjusting  funding for research and development programs and about the adequacy of  information from DOD about such actions. Congress recently revised its  guidance to DOD on reprogramming and withholding appropriated funds  for research and development and on keeping Congress adequately  informed about such actions.", "For fiscal year 2004, congressional guidelines had tightened the threshold  for decreases to $10 million or 20 percent of the program\u2019s appropriation,  whichever was less, rather than the greater provision of fiscal year 2003.  For fiscal year 2005, Congress maintained the tightened thresholds of 2004  and added new direction on the reprogramming and withholding of  appropriated funds for research and development programs.", "Furthermore, Congress directed DOD to provide better information on  reprogrammings and withholds both in the short- and the long-term.  Specifically, Congress directed:  the Secretary of Defense to provide data by January 31, 2005, on the  adequacy and use of the DOD\u2019s current reprogramming and withholding  practices;  DOD to work with congressional defense committees on a method  providing timely and accurate data on reprogramming activity (both  below and above the threshold) and the application of statutory and  administrative withholds;  that reprogramming data be available on a least a monthly basis,  potentially in conjunction with DOD\u2019s DD 1002 reports; and  that DOD should transmit the data electronically, if feasible, to  congressional defense committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD has a legitimate need for a degree of flexibility to adjust the funding  levels designated for individual research and development programs.  Congress has a legitimate need to maintain oversight over the funds it has  appropriated. Ideally, both sets of needs can be met through a combination  of approval thresholds for adjusting funding levels and reports on how  funds have been adjusted. However, DOD has not provided information of  sufficient quality and detail to Congress on how it adjusts appropriated  research and development funds through BTRs and withholds. In reaction,  Congress has tightened thresholds to a level of flexibility DOD officials  believe is too limited.", "In passing the fiscal year 2005 DOD Appropriations Act, Congress has  directed DOD to take several actions to improve the information it provides  to Congress regarding DOD\u2019s use of reprogrammings and withholds. The  direction for DOD and the congressional defense committees to work  together provides an excellent opportunity for DOD to make changes that  can serve the needs of both Congress and DOD. These changes may not be  difficult to make, as much of the desired information already exists within  DOD and some of the existing data collection systems are already  automated and contain more detailed information than currently reported.  How DOD responds to this direction will be critical to realizing this  opportunity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided us with written comments on a draft of this report.

DOD expressed concern that  Congress had a misconception that the department had violated existing  threshholds and policies and had used the BTR process to initiate new start  programs. DOD disagreed that its recent reports to Congress provide BTR  information of limited quality and cited other information it provides to  Congress in addition to the DD 1416. It pointed out that the formats for the  information were developed with and approved by committee staff to  satisfy Congress\u2019s needs. DOD did note that the issues we raised on the  quality of information it provides can be addressed, and that DOD was  open to suggestions and will gladly work with the committee staff to satisfy  its needs.", "DOD offered several suggestions to put the findings of the report more in  context. These included providing the percentage value of BTRs along with  the dollar value, and noting the reasons DOD uses BTRs. DOD also noted  that the issue of withholds is separate from BTRs and that they are used  primarily to temporarily hold funding from execution until adequate  justification is provided that the resources will be executed efficiently and  effectively as intended by Congress. DOD stated that it was unaware of the  practice of increasing of budget requests to cover anticipated BTRs and  withholds and that this was against DOD policy.", "DOD\u2019s willingness to work with Congress is a constructive response that  can lead to reporting changes that can meet the needs of both Congress and  DOD. While current reporting formats may have been developed with  committee staff to meet its needs, recent congressional direction suggest  these needs have changed. Congress has required DOD to provide better  and more timely information on reprogramming and withhold activities. We  have clarified the language in the report that we did not observe any  instances in which DOD\u2019s use of BTRs exceeded thresholds, but we cannot  be conclusive on this point as we did not design steps to assess compliance  with thresholds. The same observation and qualification applies to whether  BTRs were used to start new programs.", "We did analyze the additional information DOD provides to Congress on  BTRs, specifically budget exhibits and monthly accounting reports.  However, in their current format, these reports do not provide detailed  information on individual BTRs or any information on withholds. To  provide additional context for our findings, we have added the percentage  value of BTRs in addition to their total dollar value, however, we do not  believe it is necessary for individual programs. While the draft report does  present the reasons DOD uses BTRs and withholds, we have added  language earlier in the report to highlight these reasons. We believe the  distinction between BTRs and withholds is adequately clear in the report.", "We note that while withholds are used to ensure programs are properly  executed, we did find instances in which withholds were used to make  funds available for reprogramming.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; the Director, Missile  Defense Agency; and interested congressional committees.

We  reviewed DOD policy and interviewed decision makers to gain an  understanding of how various reports are prepared and to obtain  information about BTRs and withholds. Our interviews included officials in  the research and development and financial management offices of the Air  Force, Army, Navy and MDA; financial management and acquisition policy  decision maker offices including the Office of the Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller); Office of the Director of Defense Research and Engineering,  Director of Plans and Programs; Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for  Acquisition; Office of the Naval Research Controller; Aeronautical Systems  Command Financial Management office; Air Force Research Labs  Headquarters, Propulsion Directorate, and Sensors Directorate; Assistant  Secretary of the Army for Financial Management and Comptroller,  Investment Division-Army Budget Office; Deputy Assistant Secretary of the  Army, for Plans, Programs, and Resources Office; Army Science and  Technology Integration Office; and Army Research Laboratory  Headquarters.
