The CHCC has followed key practices of identifying leadership; including relevant participants; bridging organizational cultures, such as agreeing on common terminology; and addressing resource issues. Most participants also reported that the CHCC was a helpful forum for sharing information. However, the CHCC has not fully demonstrated other key practices for enhancing collaboration. First, the CHCC and two of its three working groups have not developed short- and long-term goals. Moreover, the CHCC has not clarified participants' roles and responsibilities on the committee or its working groups.

In August 2016, the Assistant Secretary of State for Educational  and Cultural Affairs, acting pursuant to delegated authority under the  International Cultural Property Act, imposed the import restriction.  Under this restriction, no designated Syrian archaeological or ethnological  materials may be imported into the United States unless accompanied  by specified documentation of lawful exportation. Similarly, U.S.  Customs and Border Protection (CBP) issued a regulation on April 30,  2008, to reflect import restrictions on designated archaeological and  ethnological material of Iraq imposed by State pursuant to delegated  presidential authority under the CPIA.

Objects  documented as part of a collection may also be stolen from individuals,  museums and similar institutions, and other places of origin. Looted and  stolen objects may be trafficked or illicitly traded, sometimes outside the  location in which the objects were looted or stolen.", "A Deputy Assistant Secretary of State reported that ISIS has encouraged  the looting of archeological sites as a means of erasing the cultural  heritage of Iraq and Syria and raising money. The State official noted  that the U.S. raid to capture ISIS leader Abu Sayyaf in May 2015 resulted  in the discovery of documents that demonstrated ISIS had established an  Antiquities Division with units dedicated to researching known  archaeological sites, exploring new ones, and marketing antiquities.  According to these documents, ISIS\u2019s Antiquities Division collects a 20  percent tax on the proceeds of antiquities looting and issues permits  authorizing certain individuals to excavate and supervise excavations of  artifacts. Documents found during the raid also indicate ISIS made  statements prohibiting others from excavating or giving permits not  authorized by ISIS. Sales receipts indicated the terrorist group had  earned more than $265,000 in taxes on the sale of antiquities over a 4- month period in late 2014 and early 2015.

Cultural property is defined in the CPIA by reference to  the 1970 UNESCO Convention, that defines the term \u201ccultural property\u201d  for purposes of the convention to mean property, which on religious or  secular grounds, is specifically designated by each state as being of  importance for archaeology, prehistory, history, literature, art, or science  and which belongs to certain categories. According to State officials, the CPIA addresses undocumented looted materials of a State Party by  providing the President the authority to enter into a bilateral or multilateral  agreement with the State Party to impose import restrictions and by  providing the authority to impose import restrictions if an emergency  condition applies. As it relates to articles of stolen cultural property from  Iraq and Syria, and other Parties to the 1970 Convention, the CPIA also  restricts cultural property belonging to the inventory of a museum or a  religious or secular public monument or similar institution, which was  stolen from such museum, monument, or institution after April 12, 1983 or  after the date the country of origin became a party to the Convention.", "In addition to the 1983 CPIA import restriction on stolen documented  property, the United States has implemented other restrictions related to  a wider range of cultural property from Iraq and Syria. In response to  Iraq\u2019s invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990, the United States imposed  comprehensive sanctions against Iraq. After the 2003 intervention in Iraq,  the Iraq National Museum in Baghdad was looted, resulting in the loss of  approximately 15,000 items, including ancient amulets, sculptures,  ivories, and cylinder seals, some of which were subsequently returned to  the museum. In 2007, pursuant to the Emergency Protection for Iraqi  Cultural Antiquities Act of 2004, State determined the existence of an  emergency condition under the CPIA, and import restrictions for cultural  property illegally removed from museums, and monuments, and other  locations in Iraq since 1990 were also put in place. DHS\u2019s CBP then  issued a regulation on April 30, 2008, to reflect the imposition of the  import restrictions.

According to DHS officials, DHS has the primary role for enforcing import  restrictions on Iraqi and Syrian cultural property. CBP conducts  monitoring of shipments, cargo, and travelers for illicit cultural property  through border interdictions. CBP and the U.S. Immigration and Customs  Enforcement\u2019s (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) detain,  seize, and obtain forfeiture of suspected items; and ICE-HSI conducts  investigations, pursues prosecutions through state and federal courts,  and repatriates cultural property to rightful owners.

These officials said that CBP may refer cultural property items found  during its examinations to ICE-HSI for further investigation if they suspect  a violation. Additionally, in collaboration with ICE-HSI, CBP also provides  training to its officers at high-risk ports of entry.", "CBP monitoring activities have led to the discovery of smuggled cultural  property. For example, according to DHS officials, a CBP inspection of a  shipment exiting a Chicago mail facility led in December 2007 to the  discovery of a Babylonian clay foundation cone originating from Iraq from  2100 B.C. (see fig. 5). The person exporting the item had misclassified it  using a false country of origin. CBP detained the item and referred it to  ICE-HSI for further investigation.

DHS and  the FBI detain, seize, and take forfeiture actions on Iraqi and Syrian  cultural property items that are potentially in violation of U.S. law.", "Within DHS, CBP detains and, if appropriate, seizes Iraqi or Syrian  cultural property if that property was potentially imported into the United  States contrary to U.S. law, according to CBP officials. When CBP  identifies such an item, it detains the property and, if further investigation  is warranted, contacts ICE-HSI, which may conduct an investigation. ICE- HSI also receives leads regarding illegally imported cultural property  already within the United States from other sources, including auctions,  art galleries, and museums. Upon identification by CBP or found through  other means, ICE-HSI seeks forfeiture of items of Iraqi and Syrian cultural  property that have entered the United States in violation of U.S. customs  law. According to ICE-HSI officials, although the import restrictions on  Iraqi and Syrian cultural property are not criminal laws, the restrictions  provide a legal basis for seizure and forfeiture actions by CBP and ICE- HSI. DHS actions to detain, seize, and pursue forfeiture of items that are  suspected to be in violation of U.S. cultural property laws have led to the  rescue and return of cultural property to Iraq. For example, according to  DHS officials, in 2005 CBP discovered an inscribed stone tablet  originating from Iraq during an inspection at a FedEx facility at Newark  airport. After CBP detained the item, ICE-HSI consulted with local cultural  property experts to determine the authentication and origin of the item,  which, according to ICE-HSI officials, was imported using a false country  of origin.

For example, according to FBI officials,  the FBI opened an investigation after receiving a tip about an array of  ancient artifacts originating from Mesopotamia for sale online (see fig. 6).  Most of the items were cuneiform tablets used in Mesopotamia for record  keeping, and three of the seized artifacts were inscribed foundation  cones. According to an FBI document, the artifacts were looted from  present-day Iraq and smuggled into the United States unlawfully.

ICE has repatriated a  number of cultural property items to Iraq. For example, in 2008, ICE-HSI  opened an investigation into a pair of Neo-Assyrian gold earrings for sale  at an auction house in the United States (see fig. 8). ICE-HSI consulted  with a cultural property expert to determine the authentication and origin  of the item and worked with CBP to seize, obtain forfeiture, and ultimately  repatriate the item to Iraq in February 2010.", "According to FBI officials, when the FBI detains, seizes, or obtains  forfeiture of restricted cultural property items, its Art Crime Team works to  repatriate the items. The FBI has repatriated a number of cultural property  items to Iraq. For example, one FBI-led investigation involved a U.S.  soldier serving in Iraq who purchased eight stone seals and brought them  back to the United States (see fig. 9).

State and local prosecutors may also consider whether to  pursue prosecution for violations related to cultural property  investigations. DOJ has prosecuted criminal violations from investigations  involving items of cultural property from Iraq. For example, an FBI-led  investigation into a man suspected of selling forged art and fake items led  to the discovery of four Iraqi cylinder seals (see fig. 10).

The CHCC invited and included several entities as participants of  the committee and its working groups. For the first CHCC meeting in  November 2016, State invited nine federal entities to participate and  requested that these participants volunteer for the working groups.  Representatives of these nine federal entities all attended and, with the  exception of USAID, have attended at least one additional meeting since  the committee\u2019s inception. In July 2017, a USAID official informed us that  USAID does not expect to participate in the CHCC. Most CHCC  participants noted that they are confident that the members have the  appropriate knowledge and commitment to contribute and participate in  the committee.", "Most representatives who attended the first CHCC meeting also  participated in the committee\u2019s working groups. For instance, officials  from six of the nine U.S. federal entities attending the first formal CHCC  meeting also participated on a voluntary basis in the newly created  Technology and Partnerships and Public Awareness working groups.  These federal entities include State, DHS, DOJ, the Interior, the NEH,  and the Smithsonian. Officials representing three of the nine federal  entities\u2014the Treasury, DOD, and USAID\u2014stated that they did not  volunteer for and have not participated in the new working groups  because they did not clearly see how their entities could contribute to the  topics of focus. In the preexisting CATF working group, four of the nine  CHCC federal entities\u2014State, DHS, DOJ, and the Interior\u2014noted that  they would continue to participate. State officials explained that DOD  had been invited to CATF meetings in the past but had not participated  extensively. According to the DOD representative on the CHCC, DOD  had not participated in the CATF in years but attended the CATF meeting  in June 2017, the first CATF meeting since the formation of the CHCC,  after being asked to participate. Figure 11 depicts the participation of the  nine U.S. federal entities whose officials attended the first CHCC meeting.", "One of the CHCC working groups has included participation from  additional federal entities. Led by the Smithsonian, the participants in  CHCC\u2019s Partnerships and Public Awareness working group agreed to  invite other federal entities to the group. The second meeting of the  Partnerships and Public Awareness working group in May 2017 included  additional federal entities that had not attended prior CHCC meetings.  These federal entities included the National Endowment for the Arts, the  National Archives and Records Administration, and the President\u2019s  Committee on the Arts and Humanities. According to Smithsonian  officials, the Smithsonian also invited the Library of Congress, the  Institute of Museum and Library Services, the National Science  Foundation, DOD\u2019s National Defense University, and the Wilson Center to  participate in the working group.", "The CHCC and its working groups have also included the participation of  nonfederal stakeholders in their activities. The CHCC has invited external  stakeholders to participate in public events led by its Partnerships and  Public Awareness working group. For example, State and the  Smithsonian co-hosted an event to discuss cultural heritage protection  and stabilization in northern Iraq that was open to the public and included  a public panel discussion, led by U.S. Committee of the Blue Shield, a  nongovernmental organization. Other participants in this event included  those representing museums, educational institutions, and research  institutions. Smithsonian officials noted the importance of hearing the  perspectives of these nongovernmental organizations and participants in  the international art and cultural property market\u2014organizations  suggested in the sense of Congress in the International Cultural Property  Act.", "However, the full CHCC will not likely include nonfederal stakeholders in  its regular interagency meetings. As the lead of CHCC, State officials  commented that they intend to keep invitees to the full CHCC limited to  U.S. federal entities because this composition facilitates the discussion of  U.S. government law enforcement efforts related to cultural property  protection. Other CHCC participants also expressed concerns about  having nonfederal stakeholders participate in certain CHCC and its  working groups\u2019 discussions, particularly when law enforcement agencies  need to discuss sensitive matters. Therefore, State officials reported that  the CHCC may conduct periodic consultations with external stakeholders  without making these stakeholders members of the committee.", "Bridging organizational cultures. CHCC participants have bridged  different organizational cultures among the participating entities by  establishing ways to operate across agency boundaries, a key  collaboration practice that can involve developing common terminology  and sharing information. For example, CHCC participants have generally  agreed on common terminology in the cultural property area. Some  participants reported that federal entities agree on the definitions of  \u201ccultural property\u201d and the \u201cprotection and preservation\u201d of such items,  even though these terms could be interpreted differently by many in  academia and nongovernmental organizations.", "In addition, most participants stated that they have working relationships  with other members of the committee, which facilitates information  sharing on an ongoing basis. The missions and cultures of the nine  participating federal entities may differ, ranging from those focused on law  enforcement to those that fund grants to protect cultural property.  Nevertheless, many participants reported that CHCC members all share a  common commitment toward the goal of cultural property protection.  Furthermore, most participants reported that the committee was a helpful  forum for collaborating on international cultural property protection efforts.  According to State officials, the formation of CHCC facilitated  collaboration of different U.S. federal entities when cultural property  protection issues arose internationally. For example, in March 2017, State  led an interagency delegation that included DHS, DOJ, and Smithsonian  representatives to participate in an international culture ministerial  meeting devoted to the topic of cultural property protection. According to  a State report, various federal entities also contributed significantly to a  UN Security Council resolution to focus on cultural heritage preservation,  which the Security Council adopted unanimously in March 2017.", "Resources. Despite not having dedicated financial resources, the CHCC  and its working groups have identified human and technology resources  for their collaborative activities. We previously reported that collaborating  agencies should identify the human, information technology, physical, and  financial resources needed to initiate or sustain their collaborative effort.  The CHCC has identified nine U.S. federal entities as participants that  expect to participate in meetings of the committee and its working groups  without using designated funding. Some participants noted that not  having dedicated resources could present certain challenges to CHCC  activities. For example, one CHCC participant noted that cultural  preservation training programs are resource dependent and are,  therefore, difficult to plan without funding. However, this participant also  noted that collaborative efforts on the CHCC have helped participants  coordinate interagency training, which has helped to mitigate these  challenges. Moreover, participants generally noted that even without  dedicated financial resources, they were committed to participate in  CHCC activities as a collateral duty to their work.", "Another aspect of managing resources among interagency groups is the  development of technological systems and compatible tools. CHCC  participants have taken steps to explore the development of technological  resources to enhance collaboration. For instance, several Technology  working group participants noted that they have discussed the  possibilities involved in establishing compatible technological systems  among the CHCC\u2019s members. According to one participant, the working  group is in the process of obtaining the status of existing technological  systems of participants and is planning on vetting new technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CHCC Has Not Demonstrated Certain Collaborative Practices, Such as Developing Goals, Clarifying Participants\u2019 Roles, and Documenting Agreements", "paragraphs": ["Outcomes and accountability. The CHCC could benefit from  addressing the key collaboration practice of organizational outcomes and  accountability, which includes clearly defining short-term and long-term  goals, and developing a way to track and monitor progress toward these  goals. In the first formal meeting in November 2016, the chair of the  committee articulated that the CHCC\u2019s role was to coordinate  antitrafficking efforts and to tackle a wide range of cultural heritage  challenges worldwide. However, subsequent to that meeting, the CHCC  has not produced documents identifying specific CHCC outcomes or  goals. CHCC participants also indicated that no clear consensus on the  CHCC\u2019s stated goals has emerged from CHCC meetings. Many CHCC  participants noted that the CHCC had not developed short-term and long- term goals, with some adding that the CHCC was working on doing so.  Other officials had different views of the short-term and long-term goals.  For example, one participant stated that a short-term CHCC goal was to  establish working groups and understand the roles of the different  entities, while another participant said that a long-term goal was to solidify  information sharing among participants.", "The CHCC\u2019s three working groups varied in their development of goals.  One participant of the CHCC\u2019s Technology working group noted that the  working group has developed short-term, medium-term, and long-term  goals, including target time frames for achieving them. For example, the  Technology group has a short-term goal to evaluate the technological  strengths and weaknesses of the members relative to their mission.  However, not all of the participants in that working group were aware of  these goals. The other two CHCC working groups\u2014Partnerships and  Public Awareness, and Cultural Antiquities Task Force\u2014have not  developed goals. As the lead of the Partnerships and Public Awareness  working group, the Smithsonian has compiled an inventory list that  catalogues all of the programs, activities, and outreach that each of the  working group\u2019s participants worked on and planned to undertake.  Smithsonian officials noted that the working group could develop  outcomes based on the inventory list, such as support for other working  group members\u2019 training on cultural property protection. According to  State officials, the Senate Appropriations Committee directed the CATF to  train U.S. and foreign law enforcement and customs agents, and the  CATF continued to fund cultural property training. However, such training  has not been developed or documented as goals for the CATF.", "State officials explained that the full committee and its working groups  were still early in their formation. Participants have been focused on other  priorities and, therefore, have not yet developed goals. For example,  according to Smithsonian officials, the Partnerships and Public  Awareness working group has been working on creating goals as it  concentrates on holding actual public awareness campaigns, but it has  not established or documented any goals to share with other participants.  Without clearly developed goals, participants of the CHCC and its working  groups may not have the same overall interests and may even have  conflicting interests and disagreement among missions while working  toward the overall CHCC purpose of protecting and preserving  international cultural property. We previously reported that by developing  goals and outcomes based on what the group shares in common, a  collaborative group can shape its own vision and define its own purpose.  When articulated and understood by the members of a group, this shared  purpose provides people with a reason to participate in the process.", "Clarity of roles and responsibilities. While participants seemed to  understand each other\u2019s activities related to international cultural property  matters, CHCC participants have not clarified each participating entity\u2019s  roles and responsibilities on the committee and its working groups, a  practice we have identified as helpful in enhancing collaboration. CHCC  participants have discussed cultural property initiatives that each entity  was carrying out, and the Partnerships and Public Awareness working  group is maintaining a list of its participants\u2019 activities. However, we found  that there was no consensus and no clear delineation of the specific roles  and responsibilities of the entities on the CHCC and its working groups.  For example, representatives of one entity leading a working group  described their role in initiating working group meetings, and planning and  circulating meeting agendas. However, most CHCC participants said that  they are unclear about their specific roles and responsibilities for CHCC,  including DOD and USAID, whose representatives on the CHCC were  unable to describe their roles and responsibilities on the full committee  and its working groups.", "Furthermore, the CHCC has not clarified the roles and responsibilities of  the additional federal entities that participated in one of the CHCC\u2019s  working groups, including whether these entities would be members of  the full committee or participants of only one CHCC working group. The  CHCC\u2019s Partnerships and Public Awareness working group invited  several other federal entities to attend its May 2017 meeting, but these  entities\u2019 roles and responsibilities in the working group had not been  identified. As the lead entity of this working group, Smithsonian officials  said that they did not know whether the additional participants of or  invitees to the May 2017 Partnerships and Public Awareness meeting  would be included as members of the full committee. The CHCC full  committee meeting in June 2017 did not include these additional federal  entities as invitees.", "According to some CHCC participants, the CHCC and its working groups  spent their first year of operation working to set up CHCC meetings and  determining which invitees to ask to meetings. As a result of prioritizing  these activities and allowing the CHCC to take on a more fluid process,  some participants told us that the committee and its working groups have  yet to clarify the roles and responsibilities of its participants. However, the  CHCC and its working groups could benefit from defining and agreeing  upon participants\u2019 respective roles and responsibilities as well as steps for  decision making when working on protecting and preserving international  cultural property. Without such clarity, CHCC participants could encounter  barriers in organizing their joint and individual efforts on the committee  and its working groups as the CHCC continues to operate beyond its first  year of formation.", "Written guidance and agreements. Participants have not documented  their agreement regarding how the CHCC will be collaborating, including  the short-term and long-term goals of the committee and its working  groups, as well as members\u2019 roles and responsibilities on the committee  and its working groups. The CHCC and at least one of its working groups  have produced written notes after its meetings. For example, the  Smithsonian produced a document after the May 2017 Partnership and  Public Awareness working group meeting that provided details on the  activities of its participants, upcoming public events, and a list of task  assignments for its participants. However, these written documents did  not discuss any collaborative strategies within the CHCC and its working  group. State officials said that CHCC participants have not documented  written guidance and agreements for the committee and its working  groups because it was too early in the formation of the CHCC to make  these determinations. Our prior work on key practices for collaboration  found that the action of agencies articulating a common outcome and  roles and responsibilities into a written document is a powerful tool in  collaboration."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The destruction of international cultural property causes irreversible  damage to our shared heritage, and the trafficking of cultural property  could fund ISIS terrorist activities. To protect cultural property from Iraq  and Syria at risk of looting and smuggling, the U.S. government has  imposed import restrictions, and DHS and DOJ have taken a number of  actions to enforce the laws and regulations on restricted cultural property  from these countries. Further, a law passed to protect and preserve  international cultural property included a sense of Congress that the  President should establish an interagency coordinating committee to  coordinate the efforts of the executive branch. State has taken steps to  establish the CHCC, and the committee\u2019s efforts reflect several of the key  practices that can enhance and strengthen collaboration. However, the  CHCC could benefit from following additional practices as it moves  beyond its first year. These practices include developing goals for the  CHCC and all of its working groups, clarifying the roles and  responsibilities of the committee\u2019s and its working groups\u2019 participants,  and documenting these agreements among the participants. CHCC  participants have noted that the CHCC is still in the early stages of  establishment and have, therefore, yet to follow these additional  collaboration practices. Given participants\u2019 receptivity and commitment to  the committee\u2019s work, the CHCC could augment its current efforts as it  moves forward.
