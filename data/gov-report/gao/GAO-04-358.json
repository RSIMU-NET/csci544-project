A majority of all corporations reported no tax liabilities during these years, with a higher percentage of FCCs doing so than USCCs. However, the results were reversed for large corporations. A higher percentage of USCCs than FCCs reported tax liabilities of less than 5 percent of their total income, with similar results for large corporations. FCCs reported a lower amount of tax liability per $1,000 in gross receipts than USCCs. The relationship was similar for large corporations. FCCs and USCCs differ with respect to their age and industry concentrations. A greater percentage of FCCs than USCCs were new--incorporated for less than 3 years. FCCs were more concentrated in wholesale trade and financial services while USCC were more concentrated in nonfinancial services. Large FCCs and USCCs also differed in their age and industry concentrations. Age and industry concentration have been cited as possible explanations for the differences in tax liabilities reported by FCCs and USCCs. However, after controlling for age and industry concentration using a simple statistical model, the differences in taxes reported by FCCs and USCCs were not fully explained by these factors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to congressional requests, we have previously reported on the  tax liabilities reported by foreign- and U.S.-controlled corporations. Most  recently, in March 1999, we reported on differences in the percentages of  foreign-controlled corporations (FCC) and U.S.-controlled corporations  (USCC) reporting no income tax liability. We found that for each year from  1989 through 1995, FCCs were more likely to report zero tax liability than  USCCs, though for large corporations the distinction was not as clear-cut.  We said that transfer pricing abuses and other factors such as age and  industry concentration of corporations were possible explanations for the  differences in the percentages of FCCs and USCCs reporting zero tax  liabilities.", "You asked us to update our 1999 report. For the years 1996 through 2000  (the last year with data available), we agreed to compare (1) FCCs and  USCCs based on the tax liabilities they reported on their U.S. income tax  returns\u2014including the percentages reporting zero liabilities\u2014and (2) the  differences in FCCs and USCCs in terms of age and industry concentration  and the extent to which these differences might explain tax reporting  patterns.", "To meet these objectives, we analyzed data from the Internal Revenue  Service\u2019s (IRS) Statistics of Income (SOI) samples of corporate tax returns  for tax years 1996 through 2000. These samples were based on returns as  filed and did not reflect IRS audit results or any net operating loss  carrybacks from future years. The statistics in the report are estimates  based on the SOI sample. Sampling errors are reported in appendix I.  Caution should be used when comparing estimates because not all  differences between estimates are statistically significant. We also used  statistical modeling to estimate the likelihood of FCCs and USCCs  reporting little or no U.S. income tax liability, holding age and industry  sector constant.

Some of the reasons  why FCCs and USCCs may not report U.S. income tax include current-year  operating losses, losses carried forward from preceding tax years,  sufficient tax credits available to offset tax liabilities, and improper pricing  of intercompany transactions. Any company that has a related company  with which it transacts business needs to establish transfer prices for those  intercompany transactions. The pricing of intercompany transactions  affects the distribution of profits and ultimately the taxable income of the  companies. Transfer pricing abuse occurs when income and expenses are  improperly allocated among interrelated companies for the purpose of  reducing taxable income in a high-tax jurisdiction.", "As we noted in our two earlier reports, researchers have attempted to  explain why FCCs report lower tax liabilities than USCCs. Generally, the  research has recognized that some of the nontax characteristics of firms,  such as age and industry classification, may explain some of the  differences in reported tax liabilities. At the same time, researchers have  acknowledged that transfer pricing abuses may explain some of the  differences, but they have not been able to determine the extent to which  transfer pricing abuses explain the differences in the taxes reported by  FCCs and USCCs.", "For the purposes of this report, an FCC is either a foreign corporation or a  U.S. corporation with 50 percent or more of its voting stock owned by a  foreign person or entity. Foreign ownership or control of a U.S. corporation  exists when a foreign investor gains control of an existing U.S. company or  creates a new company and incorporates it in the United States. Both FCCs  and USCCs are subject to U.S. income tax laws although the tax treatment  of some income may differ."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["For both of our objectives, we used data from IRS\u2019s SOI files on corporate  tax returns for 1996 through 2000 to make estimates for the population of  FCCs and USCCs. The SOI corporation data we used for our analyses  included all types of corporations except for subchapter S corporations,  which are treated similarly to partnerships for federal income tax  purposes. The SOI data in this report are based on SOI\u2019s probability sample  of corporate tax returns and thus are subject to some imprecision owing to  sampling variability. Using SOI\u2019s sampling weights, we estimated sampling  errors for our estimates, which are reported in appendix I. Caution should  be used when comparing estimates because not all differences between  estimates are statistically significant. Differences between all FCCs and  USCCs, between FCCs and USCCs reporting no tax liability, between large  FCCs and USCCs, and between large FCCs and USCCs reporting no tax  liability are statistically significant unless noted at the bottom of each  figure or table. To ensure that the data were comparable across years, we  converted all dollar-based data to 2000 dollars. These data included tax  liabilities, total income, gross receipts, assets, cost of goods sold, interest,  and purchases reported.", "SOI is a data set widely used for research purposes. IRS performs a number  quality control steps to verify the internal consistency of SOI sample data.  For example, it performs computerized tests to verify the relationships  between values on the returns selected as part of the SOI sample, and  manually edits data items to correct for problems, such as missing items.  We conducted several reliability tests to ensure that the data excerpts we  used for this report were complete and accurate. For example, we  electronically tested the data and used published data as a comparison to  ensure that the data set was complete. To ensure accuracy, we reviewed  related documentation and electronically tested for obvious errors. We  concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report.", "To compare FCCs and USCCs based on the tax liabilities they reported on  their U.S. income tax returns, we made estimates for a variety of measures  of tax liability.", "We also used SOI data to analyze differences in FCCs and USCCs by age  and industry sector, the same factors we used in the 1999 report. We  defined new corporations as those for which income tax returns showed  incorporation dates within 3 years of the tax year date; all others were  considered old corporations. For example, for tax year 2000, new  corporations are those with incorporation dates no earlier than 1998. Next,  we used a simple logistic regression model to estimate the likelihood of  FCCs and USCCs reporting no tax liability or less than 5 percent in tax  liability relative to total income, after controlling for age and industry  sector. We also used the model to compare large FCCs and USCCs\u2014 corporations with at least $250 million in assets or $50 million in gross  receipts.

We looked at all of the corporations and separately at large  corporations in each tax year from 1996 through 2000, and calculated odds  ratios to estimate the difference between FCCs and USCCs. We used  USCCs as the reference category in our calculations, so the odds ratios  indicate how much more likely (when the ratios exceed 1.0) or less likely  (when they are less than 1.0) the odds were of FCCs reporting to have no  tax liability or tax liability of less than 5 percent compared with USCCs. We  show these odds ratios in the tables 21 and 22 both before and after  adjusting them to control for the age and industry sector of each  corporation. While the unadjusted odds ratios can be derived directly from  the unadjusted odds shown in these tables, the adjusted odds ratios are  from logistic regression models that were used in each year to estimate the  difference between FCCs and USSCs after the controls for age and industry  sector were introduced. The following explains how odds ratios are  calculated and elaborates on the tables in this appendix.", "The odds on whether FCCs and USCCs report no tax liability or tax liability  less than 5 percent are somewhat different from, but related to, the  percentage of each type of corporation reporting no tax liability or tax  liability of less than 5 percent. The odds of reporting no tax liability equal  the percentage reporting no tax liability divided by the percentage  reporting positive tax liability. For the sample of all FCCs and USCCs in  1996, for example, 67.6 percent of FCCs reported no tax liability. (See table  21.) The odds of an FCC reporting no tax liability in that year was 2.08,  which equals 67.6/32.4 and implies that 2.08 of FCCs reported no tax  liability for every FCC that reported some tax liability, or that 208 FCCs  reported no tax liability for every 100 FCCs that reported some tax liability.  Since 60.3 percent of USCCs reported no tax liability in 1996, the odds of  USCCs reporting no tax liability was 1.52, which equals 60.3/39.7. The  unadjusted ratio of these odds, which is 2.08/1.52 = 1.37, apart from  rounding, implies that FCCs were more likely than USCCs to have reported  no tax liability by a factor of 1.37. While odds are somewhat less familiar  than percentages, the use of odds and odds ratios are unlike percentages  and percentage differences, which are unaffected by whether we choose to  look at the likelihood of whether an outcome does or does not occur, and  by how likely or unlikely the outcome is across the subgroups we are  comparing.", "Table 21 shows how different all FCCs and USCCs were, using both  percentage differences and odds ratios in each year, in terms or reporting  no tax liability or tax liability of less than 5 percent of total income. Both  before (unadjusted) and after (adjusted) controlling for age and industry  sector, in every year FCCs were significantly more likely than USSCs to  have reported no tax liability, with odds ratios ranging from roughly 1.37 to  roughly 1.79. At the same time, FCCs were significantly less likely than  USCCs to have reported tax liability of less than 5 percent in all years, with  odds ratios ranging from roughly 0.49 to 0.78.", "Table 22 shows how different large FCCs and USCCs were in each year in  terms of reporting no tax liability or less than 5 percent of tax liability  relative to income. The unadjusted odds ratios reveal that before  controlling for age and industry sector, large FCCs were in every year  significantly less likely than large USSCs to have reported no tax, and in all  years except for 1996, they were significantly less likely to report less than  5 percent in tax liability. After adjusting for age and industry, however,  differences between large FCCs\u2019 and USCCs\u2019 likelihood of reporting no tax  liability or less than 5 percent in tax liability were smaller except for one  year (1996). Large FCCs were more likely than large USCCs to report no  tax liability in 2 of the 5 years (1996 and 1998), less likely than large USCCs  to report no tax liability in 1 year (2000), and no different than large USCCs  in the other 2 years (1997 and 1999). With respect to reporting tax liabilities  of less than 5 percent, large FCCs were significantly more likely than  USCCs to have reported less than 5 percent in tax liability, after adjusting  for age and industry sector, in 1 year (1996), significantly less likely in 2  years (1999 and 2000), and no different than USCCs in the other 2 years  (1997 and 1998).
