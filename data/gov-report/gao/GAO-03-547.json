The DOD-Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) demonstration was one of several demonstrations established to examine alternatives for addressing retirees' lack of Medicare supplemental coverage. The demonstration was mandated by the Strom Thurmond National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (NDAA 1999), which also required GAO to evaluate the demonstration. GAO assessed enrollment in the demonstration and the premiums set by demonstration plans. To do this, GAO, in collaboration with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and DOD, conducted a survey of enrollees and eligible nonenrollees. GAO also examined DOD enrollment data, Medicare and OPM claims data, and OPM premiums data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Enrollment in the DOD-FEHBP demonstration was low, peaking at 5.5 percent of eligible beneficiaries in 2001 (7,521 enrollees) and then falling to 3.2 percent in 2002, after the introduction of comprehensive health coverage for all Medicare-eligible military retirees. Enrollment was considerably greater in Puerto Rico, where it reached 30 percent in 2002. Most retirees who knew about the demonstration and did not enroll said they were satisfied with their current coverage, which had better benefits and lower costs than the coverage they could obtain from FEHBP. Some of these retirees cited, for example, not being able to continue getting prescriptions filled at military treatment facilities if they enrolled in the demonstration. For those who enrolled, the factors that encouraged them to do so included the view that FEHBP offered retirees better benefits, particularly prescription drugs, than were available from their current coverage, as well as the lack of any existing coverage. Monthly premiums charged to enrollees for individual policies in the demonstration varied widely--from $65 to $208 in 2000--with those plans that had lower premiums and were better known to eligible beneficiaries, capturing the most enrollees. In setting premiums initially, plans had little information about the health and probable cost of care for eligible beneficiaries. Demonstration enrollees proved to have lower average health care costs than either their counterparts in the civilian FEHBP or those eligible for the demonstration who did not enroll. Plans enrolled similar proportions of beneficiaries in poor health, regardless of whether they charged higher, lower, or the same premiums for the demonstration as for the civilian FEHBP. In commenting on a draft of the report, DOD concurred with the overall findings but disagreed with the description of the demonstration's impact on DOD's budget as small. As noted in the draft report, DOD's costs for the demonstration relative to its total health care budget were less than 0.1 percent of that budget. OPM declined to comment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Prior to 2001, military retirees who turned age 65 and became eligible for  Medicare lost most of their Department of Defense (DOD) health care  benefits. DOD did not offer its military retirees Medicare supplemental  coverage, which some private employers make available to their retirees.  Such coverage pays for Medicare deductibles and copayments as well as  certain items not covered by Medicare, including most outpatient  prescription drugs. Military retirees age 65 and over could obtain free care  from the more than 600 military treatment facilities (MTF), but only if  space was available after beneficiaries under age 65 had been treated.  Older retirees could also get prescription drugs at no charge from MTF  pharmacies if the drugs were stocked by the MTFs, although only about 40  percent of retirees age 65 and over lived close to an MTF.", "To gather information on alternative ways of addressing military retirees\u2019  lack of Medicare supplemental coverage, Congress established several  demonstrations that allowed Medicare-eligible military retirees to enroll in  DOD-sponsored health care programs. One of those demonstrations was  the DOD Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP)  demonstration (\u201cthe demonstration\u201d), which lasted from 2000 through  2002. Under the demonstration, military retirees and several smaller  groups of beneficiaries\u2014such as certain former spouses of active duty  military personnel and retirees\u2014could purchase coverage from one of the  private health plans that participate in FEHBP, the federal government\u2019s  health insurance program for civilian employees and retirees. DOD  subsidized this retiree health coverage, paying up to three-quarters of the  premium. Enrollees could no longer use MTFs or military pharmacies. The  demonstration was open to about 120,000 of the more than 1.5 million  military retirees and dependents age 65 and over. It initially included  retirees and other eligible beneficiaries in eight geographic areas and  expanded in 2001 to include two additional areas.", "The law establishing the demonstration (the Strom Thurmond National  Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1999 (NDAA 1999)) directed us  to examine a number of topics relating to enrollment and the  demonstration\u2019s effects on beneficiaries and DOD. Specifically, this report  addresses (1) enrollment in the demonstration and the factors that  influenced whether military retirees enrolled, (2) the premiums set by  FEHBP plans for the demonstration and their strategies for setting  premiums, and (3) any effects that the demonstration project had on DOD  and beneficiaries\u2014enrollees and nonenrollees.", "To address these topics, we, in cooperation with DOD and the Office of  Personnel Management (OPM), which administers FEHBP, surveyed  between May and August 2000 a representative sample of about 5,600  persons eligible for the demonstration, of whom 85 percent responded. To  analyze factors affecting enrollment, we obtained survey information from  both enrollees and nonenrollees on health status, insurance coverage, and  other factors potentially affecting their enrollment decisions. We also  obtained information from DOD on persons eligible for the demonstration  and their use of military health care. We obtained information from  Quotesmith Inc. on premiums for private Medigap insurance plans that  supplement Medicare and are sold directly to individuals. To assess the  premiums offered by FEHBP plans, we obtained information from OPM on  premiums in the demonstration and in the civilian FEHBP. To obtain  information on whether demonstration enrollees were sicker than others,  we used Medicare claims on the diagnoses and costs of enrollees, eligible  nonenrollees, and civilian FEHBP enrollees age 65 and over who lived  near the demonstration sites. To examine the costs of demonstration  enrollees, we obtained information from OPM and from Medicare claims.  We restricted some analyses to retirees age 65 and over for two reasons.  First, these retirees constituted 85 percent of all enrollees. Second, cost  and diagnostic information was available for these retirees but not for  beneficiaries under age 65. We also interviewed representatives of military  retiree associations as well as DOD and OPM officials. (See app. I for a  discussion of our survey methods and app. II for a discussion of our  methods of analyzing health status and factors affecting enrollment,  including tests of statistical significance.) We found that the size and  design of the demonstration were adequate for us to evaluate its effects  and answer the questions that Congress asked. We performed our work in  phases from November 1999 through May 2003. In 1999 and 2000, we  observed the initial planning and implementation of the demonstration,  and in 2000 we conducted the GAO-OPM-DOD survey. At the end of 2002  and in 2003, after the demonstration had ended, we conducted additional  analyses.

About one-quarter of Medicare\u2019s beneficiaries have Medigap, the  only supplemental coverage option available to all beneficiaries when they  initially enroll in Medicare. Prior to 1992, insurers were free to establish  the benefits for Medigap policies. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1990 (OBRA 1990) required that beginning in 1992, Medigap policies be  standardized, and OBRA authorized 10 different benefit packages, known  as plans A through J, that insurers could offer. The most popular Medigap  policy is plan F, which covers Medicare coinsurance and deductibles, but  not prescription drugs. It had an average annual premium per person of  about $1,200 in 1999, although in some cases plan F cost twice that  amount. Among the least popular Medigap policies are those offering  prescription drug coverage. These policies are the most expensive of the  10 standard policies\u2014they averaged about $1,600 in 1999, and some cost  over $5,000.

Civilian employees become eligible for FEHBP when hired by the federal  government. Employees and retirees can purchase health insurance from a  variety of private plans, including both managed care and fee-for-service  plans, that offer a broad range of benefits, including prescription drugs.  Insurers offer both self-only plans and family plans, which also cover the  policyholders\u2019 dependents. Some plans also offer two levels of benefits: a  standard option and a high option, which has more benefits, less cost  sharing, or both.

During this period, which runs from mid- November to mid-December, beneficiaries eligible for FEHBP can select  new plans for the forthcoming calendar year. To assist these beneficiaries  in selecting plans, OPM provides general information on FEHBP through  brochures and its Web site. Also, as part of this information campaign,  plans\u2019 representatives may visit government agencies to participate in  health fairs, where they provide detailed information about their specific  health plans to government employees.", "The premiums charged by these plans, which are negotiated annually  between OPM and the plans, depend on the benefits offered by the plan,  the type of plan\u2014fee-for-service or managed care\u2014and the plan\u2019s out-of- pocket costs for the enrollee. Plans may propose changes to benefits as  well as changes in out-of-pocket payments by enrollees. OPM and the  plans negotiate these changes and take them into account when  negotiating premiums. Fee-for-service plans must base their rates on the  claims experience of their FEHBP enrollees, while adjusting for changes in  benefits and out-of-pocket payments, and must provide OPM with data to  justify their proposed rates. Managed care plans must give FEHBP the best  rate that they offer to groups of similar size in the private sector under  similar conditions, with adjustments to account for differences in the  demographic characteristics of FEHBP enrollees and the benefits  provided. The government pays a maximum of 72 percent of the weighted  average premium of all plans and no more than 75 percent of any plan\u2019s  premium. Unlike most other plans, including employer-sponsored  insurance and Medigap, FEHBP plans charge the same premium to all  enrollees, regardless of age.

Controlling for other factors affecting  enrollment, those who did not use Medicare+Choice were much more  likely to enroll in a demonstration plan than those who did. (See fig. 3.)  Several reasons may account for this. First, in contrast to fee-for-service  Medicare, Medicare+Choice plans are often less costly out-of-pocket,  typically requiring no deductibles and lower cost sharing for physician  visits and other outpatient services. Second, unlike fee-for-service  Medicare, many Medicare+Choice plans offered a prescription drug  benefit. Third, while Medicare+Choice plan benefits were similar to those  offered by demonstration FEHBP plans, Medicare+Choice premiums were  typically less than those charged by the more popular demonstration  plans, including Blue Cross Blue Shield, the most popular demonstration  plan on the mainland.", "Lack of employer-sponsored coverage. Retirees who did not have  employer-sponsored health coverage were also more likely to join a  demonstration plan. Of those who did not have employer-sponsored  coverage, 8.6 percent enrolled in the demonstration, compared to 4.7  percent of those who had such coverage. Since benefits in employer- sponsored health plans often resemble FEHBP benefits, retirees with  employer-sponsored coverage would have been less likely to find FEHBP  plans attractive.", "Retirees with another type of alternative coverage, Medigap, responded  differently to the demonstration. Unlike the pattern with other types of  insurance coverage, more of those with a Medigap plan enrolled (9.3  percent) than did those without Medigap (5.6 percent).

At these  health fairs, plans set up tables at which their representatives distributed  brochures and answered questions. At one site, the military base refused  to allow the demonstration representatives to participate in its health fair  because of concern about an influx of large numbers of demonstration  beneficiaries. At another site, the turnout exceeded the capacity of the  plan representatives to deal with questions and DOD officials told us that  they accommodated more people by giving another presentation at a  different facility or at the same facility 1 month later.", "A DOD official discovered, however, that it was difficult to convey  information about the demonstration to large numbers of individuals at  the health fairs. DOD officials determined that the health fairs were not  working well, so by January 2000, DOD replaced them with 2-hour  briefings, which officials called town meetings. In these meetings, a DOD  representative explained the demonstration during the first hour and then  answered questions from the audience. A DOD official told us that these  town meetings were more effective than the health fairs.", "For the first year of the demonstration, just under 6 percent of those  eligible attended either a health fair or a town meeting.
