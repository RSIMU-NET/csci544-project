Further, according to a 2014 State memorandum,  the Office of Overseas Building Operations does not support LDPs for  any of its employees, citing a critical staffing shortage. Moreover,  a  December 2010 memorandum from State\u2019s M/DGHR acknowledged  that the designation of LDPs is often influenced by staffing realities  and stated that posts usually adjust language levels down on the  basis of the likelihood of finding language-qualified  bidders.", "Cost concerns.

For  example, a management official at a post where a super-hard  language is spoken said that the substantial amount of time and  money needed to train FSOs in hard and super-hard languages  influences decisions regarding numbers of LDPs and proficiency  levels requested.

Some post managers said that shifting the review  from an annual to a triennial process represented an improvement,  because the prior annual reviews were not taken seriously, and the 3- year cycle has allowed State to be more strategic in planning and  allocating resources. Some post officials also said that the 3-year cycle is  more structured and that the multiple levels of review and input have  brought greater stability and consistency to posts\u2019 request for LDPs.", "However, other officials at posts we visited said that State\u2019s language  designation process is insufficiently rigorous and systematic, describing it  as ad hoc. Some of the geographic bureau and post officials we met with  were unaware of State\u2019s criteria for establishing LDP designations as  outlined in the FAM.  Remarks by some officials also suggest that posts  tend to base LDP decisions on preexisting LDP numbers and levels. For  example, some embassy managers said that they generally review the  existing LDP numbers and levels and make minor adjustments. In  addition, some geographic bureau officials said that they provide limited  substantive review of posts\u2019 submissions of LDP numbers and levels.", "Further, comments from post officials suggest that posts have generally  applied a \u201cblanket\u201d approach in determining LDP proficiency  requirements, despite State guidance that instructs posts to conduct more  targeted assessments of their needs. State cables providing posts with  guidance for the 2017 and 2014 LDP reviews stated that posts should not  automatically assume that a 3/3 proficiency level is required for every  LDP in a particular section or embassy and instructed posts to examine  the specific language needs for each position. Post managers and staff  we interviewed also said that language needs vary by position and  portfolio within an embassy section. However, according to State data,  most generalist LDPs are designated at a 3/3 level.", "In a 2013 report examining State\u2019s LDP review process, the State OIG  identified deficiencies in State\u2019s process for developing language  requirements. For example, the report noted that State\u2019s oversight of  LDPs is insufficient to identify over- or underdesignation of language  requirements and that State does not review embassies\u2019 and geographic  bureaus\u2019 language requirements \u201cto facilitate consistent application of  language designation criteria and appropriate distribution given U.S.  policy priorities.\u201d The report indicates that the lack of high-level review  has led to anomalies, such as widely varying proficiency requirements for  officers performing similar functions at different missions. Specifically, the  OIG reported that State designated certain positions as LDPs for some  European posts, such as France and Italy, but did not designate similar  positions as LDPs in Haiti, Thailand, and Indonesia, where working  conditions are more difficult and English language speakers are fewer. In  response to an OIG recommendation to address this issue, State\u2019s  M/DGHR provided criteria to the geographic bureaus to use in the 2014  LDP review when determining whether language ability is necessary to  advance U.S. foreign policy objectives. In October 2016, State  headquarters sent out a cable to all posts, providing them with an  updated set of criteria to be used in the 2017 LDP review.", "We discussed the concerns expressed by FSOs concerning the LDP  process with State\u2019s M/DGHR. State M/DGHR officials responded that the  department has undertaken initiatives to align LDP levels more closely  with policy and operational requirements and intends to incorporate these  initiatives into its 2017 triennial LDP review process. For example,  according to State M/DGHR officials, M/DGHR has encouraged a  dialogue between the bureaus and their posts to ensure that their LDP  submissions reflect operational requirements and policy priorities and has  sent official messages to all posts and bureaus on the process and the  need for rigorous review. The officials also noted that State\u2019s M/DGHR  has asked participants to designate their requests for LDPs as high,  medium, and low priority, to encourage rigor in considering the real needs  of posts and to avoid any implication that all LDPs are of equal  importance."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "State Is Implementing Efforts Outlined in Foreign Language Strategic Plan but Has Not Evaluated Their Effectiveness", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "State\u2019s Foreign Language Strategic Plan Outlines Efforts to Address Language Proficiency Requirements", "paragraphs": ["State\u2019s 2011 \u201cStrategic Plan for Foreign Language Capabilities\u201d (foreign  language strategic plan), which it issued partly in response to a  recommendation in our 2009 report, outlines a number of efforts intended  to meet its current and projected needs for foreign language proficiency.

However, State is  implementing the following efforts to address the other four objectives:", "LDP reviews (objective 2). To improve the department\u2019s language  designation process, as discussed earlier, in 2010 State changed the  frequency of the LDP review process from annual to triennial and has  initiated its third triennial LDP review process, which it expects to  complete in 2017.", "RLP (objective 4). Initiated  in fiscal year 2004, the RLP aims to  expand the number of candidates entering the Foreign Service with  proficiency in languages in which State has current or projected  deficits. To enhance the RLP, according to a State document, State  has updated the list of recruitment languages to reflect those that are  of critical importance to U.S. foreign policy, those in which posts are  experiencing severe shortages or staffing gaps, and those that  present specific recruiting and training challenges. According to State  data, the percentage of entry-level officers hired through the RLP has  varied from a peak of 40 percent (221 of 547 officers) in fiscal year  2011 to 5 percent (16 of 353 officers) in fiscal year 2016.", "LIP program (objective 5). To make language incentives more  effective and maximize the impact of language and assignment  policies, according to State\u2019s M/DGHR, State reviewed the LIP in  2012, the first such review in over a decade, to clarify and streamline  the program by aligning the designated languages (i.e., those eligible  for incentives) with the department\u2019s current needs and incentivizing  employees to use and maintain proficiency in those languages. As a  result of the review, State reduced the number of incentive languages  from 52 to 34 to reflect the department\u2019s highest strategic priorities.  Also, according to information provided by State\u2019s M/DGHR, FSI  adjusts course offerings in priority languages, including some that are  included in the LIP program, as needed, to address the department\u2019s  strategic planning and performance goals.

One of  the mechanisms State uses to ensure a strong contingent of foreign  language speakers is the inclusion of sustained professional language  proficiency in the promotion precepts for Foreign Service generalists.  According to FSOs and other officials we spoke with, this policy may  be creating an incentive for FSOs to learn \u201cworld\u201d languages, such as  Spanish, which generally take 6 months to reach a 3/3, instead of  super-hard languages, which take 2 years to reach the same level of  proficiency. According to a 2013 State OIG report, promotion and  tenure policies tied to language skills influence the number and level  of LDP designations. An official from the OIG who worked on the 2013  report explained that the promotion policy may also contribute to the  discrepancy in the numbers of LDPs with proficiency in world and  super-hard languages as well as shortfalls in language-proficient  FSOs to fill LDPs in certain priority languages. Some FSOs told us  that taking 2 years to learn a super-hard language makes them less  competitive for promotion, expressing a perception that State\u2019s  promotion system undervalues language training. However, State\u2019s  M/DGHR said that overall, the promotion system does not  disadvantage FSOs who study hard or super-hard languages because  time spent in language training extends their years of promotion  eligibility.  We discussed this issue with State\u2019s M/DGHR and inquired  whether a review of this policy had been conducted to determine its  potential impact on learning super-hard languages. In response, State  informed us that the language proficiency requirement for promotion,  along with other related policies, is currently under review.", "Language-related technology (objective 6). We found that State\u2019s  FSI has implemented various language-related technologies to  improve the language acquisition process, such as the Smart  Notebook, which offers language instruction via the Internet, as well  as language learning applications and technology-enabled  classrooms with screen-sharing applications. FSI staff said that  technology has improved the language acquisition process by  allowing students to engage in lifelike scenarios in the classroom  while learning a language, giving students access to lessons that  were previously available only in language labs, and accommodating  students\u2019 schedules and needs. In addition, State officials told us that  they are using technology to complement language skills at the  operational level. For example, the embassy in China identified 48  positions for which it could adjust the speaking and reading level from  a 3/3 to a 3+/2, in part because the \u201cadvent  of  sophisticated translation technologies enables officers to access  information from written materials in multiple ways and on a scale  never before possible.\u201d A senior FSO in Mexico indicated that both  reading and speaking are important but that the reading requirement  could possibly be lowered, since translation technology can be used  to assist with reading. FSOs in countries we visited generally  indicated that they use online translation tools to translate documents.  However, some FSOs reported that they could not rely exclusively on  the translation provided by the online tool because it is generally not  entirely accurate.
