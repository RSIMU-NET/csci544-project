Although downsized 38 percent between fiscal years 1989 and 2002, this workforce has taken on greater roles as a result of DOD's restructuring and transformation. Responding to congressional concerns about the quality and quantity of, and the strategic planning for the civilian workforce, GAO determined the following for DOD, the military services, and selected defense agencies: (1) the extent of top-level leadership involvement in civilian strategic planning; (2) whether elements in civilian strategic plans are aligned to the overall mission, focused on results, and based on current and future civilian workforce data; and (3) whether civilian and military personnel strategic plans or sourcing initiatives were integrated."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Generally, civilian personnel issues appear to be an emerging priority among top leaders in DOD and the defense components. Although DOD began downsizing its civilian workforce more than a decade ago, it did not take action to strategically address challenges affecting the civilian workforce until it issued its civilian human capital strategic plan in April 2002. Top-level leaders in the Air Force, the Marine Corps, the Defense Contract Management Agency, and the Defense Finance Accounting Service have initiated planning efforts and are working in partnership with their civilian human capital professionals to develop and implement civilian strategic plans; such leadership, however, was increasing in the Army and not as evident in the Navy. Also, DOD has not provided guidance on how to integrate the components' plans with the department-level plan. High-level leadership is critical to directing reforms and obtaining resources for successful implementation. The human capital strategic plans GAO reviewed for the most part lacked key elements found in fully developed plans. Most of the civilian human capital goals, objectives, and initiatives were not explicitly aligned with the overarching missions of the organizations. Consequently, DOD and the components cannot be sure that strategic goals are properly focused on mission achievement. Also, none of the plans contained results-oriented performance measures to assess the impact of their civilian human capital initiatives (i.e., programs, policies, and processes). Thus, DOD and the components cannot gauge the extent to which their human capital initiatives contribute to achieving their organizations' mission. Finally, the plans did not contain data on the skills and competencies needed to successfully accomplish future missions; therefore, DOD and the components risk not being able to put the right people, in the right place, and at the right time, which can result in diminished accomplishment of the overall defense mission. Moreover, the civilian strategic plans did not address how the civilian workforce will be integrated with their military counterparts or sourcing initiatives. DOD's three human capital strategic plans--two military and one civilian--were prepared separately and were not integrated to form a seamless and comprehensive strategy and did not address how DOD plans to link its human capital initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to outsource non-core responsibilities. The components' civilian plans acknowledge a need to integrate planning for civilian and military personnel--taking into consideration contractors--but have not yet done so. Without an integrated strategy, DOD may not effectively and efficiently allocate its scarce resources for optimal readiness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With almost 700,000 civilian employees on its payroll, the Department of  Defense (DOD) is the second largest federal employer of civilians in the  nation.

Given the global war on terrorism, the role of DOD\u2019s civilian  workforce is expanding, such as participation in combat support functions  that free military personnel to focus on warfighting duties for which they  are uniquely qualified. Civilian personnel are also key to maintaining  DOD\u2019s institutional knowledge because of frequent military personnel  rotations. However, since the end of the cold war, the civilian workforce  has undergone substantial change, due primarily to downsizing, base  realignments and closures, competitive sourcing initiatives, and changing  missions. For example, between fiscal years 1989 and 2002, DOD reduced  its civilian workforce by about 38 percent, with an additional reduction of  about 55,000 personnel proposed through fiscal year 2007. Some DOD  officials have expressed concern about a possible shortfall of critical skills  because downsizing has resulted in a significant imbalance in the shape,  skills, and experience of its civilian workforce and more than 50 percent of  the civilian workforce becoming eligible to retire in the next 5 years.

We also stated that to build the right workforce to  achieve strategic goals, it is essential that organizations determine the  critical skills and competencies needed to successfully implement the  programs and processes associated with those goals. To do so, three types  of data are needed: (1) what is available\u2014both the current workforce  characteristics and future availability, (2) what is needed\u2014the critical  workforce characteristics needed in the future, and (3) what is the  difference between what will be available and what will be needed\u2014the  gap. Without this information, DOD cannot structure its future workforce  to support the Secretary of Defense\u2019s initiatives or mitigate the risk of  shortfalls in critical personnel when pending civilian retirements occur.", "Of the five organizations in our review that had civilian human capital  strategic plans, two\u2014the Air Force and DCMA\u2014included some  information about the future workforce and indicated the gaps to be  addressed by its civilian human capital initiatives. The Air Force\u2019s plan  includes a chart that illustrates, in terms of years of federal service, the  current workforce compared to a 1989 baseline (prior to the downsizing of  its civilian workforce) and a target workforce for fiscal year 2005. This  information was generally based on data that were readily available but  considered to be a less-than-adequate indicator for level of experience,  and it is not clear how the target workforce data were derived. According  to the Air Force, its analysis illustrated the shortfall in the number of  civilians with less than 10 years of service when compared to the Air  Force\u2019s long-term requirements. Using this and other analyses, the Air  Force initially developed workforce-shaping activities in four   areas\u2014accession planning, force development, retention/separation  management, and enabling activities, which included 27 separate  initiatives.", "DCMA\u2019s plan describes the agency\u2019s workforce planning methodology,  which focuses on identifying gaps between its current and future  workforce. DCMA\u2019s strategic workforce planning team analyzes  quantitative data on the current workforce and employs an interview  protocol to gather and analyze information from DCMA managers and  subject matter experts pertaining to future work and workforce  requirements. According to DCMA, this methodology allows it to link the  desired distribution of positions, occupational series, and skills to  organizational outcomes, processes, and customer requirements and to  DOD\u2019s transformation guidance, goals, and initiatives. Although DCMA has  not completely identified or quantified its future workforce requirements,  it identified the following: requirements for new technical skills, especially  software acquisition and integration; upgrading general skills and  maintaining the existing skill base; correcting imbalances in geographic  locations; requirements for hiring about 990 employees per year through  2009; and obtaining additional positions to support anticipated increasing  procurements.", "In contrast to the Air Force and DCMA plans, the DOD, Army, and Marine  Corps plans lack information about future workforce needs. For example,  DOD\u2019s civilian human capital plan contains data on those civilians eligible  for retirement by grade level and by job category. However, the plan does  not address key characteristics such as skills and competencies that will  be needed in the future workforce to support changes being undertaken by  DOD. Without this information and a methodology to analyze and identify  the gaps that exist between what will be available and what will be  needed, it is not clear that the human capital initiatives in DOD\u2019s plan will  result in the desired future workforce.", "All of the plans we reviewed acknowledge strategic workforce planning  shortfalls by setting goals or initiatives to improve in this area. For  example, DOD\u2019s plan includes a goal to obtain management systems and  tools that support total force planning and informed decision making.  DOD has begun adopting the Army\u2019s Civilian Forecasting System and the  Workforce Analysis Support System for departmentwide use, which will  enable it to project the future workforce by occupational series and grade  structure. However, the systems (which are based on a regression analysis  of historical data) are not capable of determining the size and skill  competencies of the civilian workforce needed in the future. Also, DOD  has not yet determined specifically how this new analytic capability will be  integrated into programmatic decision-making processes. DOD officials  stated that its first step was to purchase the equipment and software,  which was accomplished in 2002. DOD is now analyzing users\u2019 needs. As  of December 2002, DOD officials were testing the systems, but they  expressed concerns that the Army systems may not serve the needs of a  complex and diverse organization such as DOD."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Strategic Plans for Civilian Personnel Not Yet Integrated with Plans for Military Personnel or Sourcing Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The civilian human capital strategic plans we reviewed did not address  how the civilian workforce would be integrated with their military  counterparts or sourcing initiatives to accomplish DOD\u2019s mission. The  2001 QDR states that future operations will not only be joint but also  depend upon the total force\u2014including civilian personnel as well as active  duty and reserve personnel. The QDR also emphasizes that DOD will focus  its \u201cowned\u201d resources in areas that contribute directly to warfighting and  that it would continue to take steps to outsource and shed its non-core  responsibilities. The 2000 Defense Science Board Task Force report states  that DOD needs to undertake deliberate and integrated force shaping of  the civilian and military forces, address human capital challenges from a  total force perspective, and base decisions to convert functions from  military to civilian or to outsource functions to contractors on an  integrated human resource plan. In addition, the National Academy of  Public Administration, in its report on the Navy civilian workforce 2020,  notes that as more work is privatized and more traditionally military tasks  require support of civilian or contractor personnel, a more unified  approach to force planning and management will be necessary; serious  shortfalls in any one of the force elements will damage mission  accomplishment. The Academy\u2019s report also states that the trend towards  greater reliance on contractors necessitates a critical mass of civilian  personnel expertise to protect the government\u2019s interest and ensure  effective oversight of contractors\u2019 work. Further, the 2002 Commercial  Activities Panel final report indicates that sourcing and human capital  policies should be inextricably linked together, and it calls for federal  sourcing policies to be \u201cconsistent with human capital practices designed  to attract motivate, retain, and reward a high performing workforce.\u201d", "DOD\u2019s overall human capital strategy, however, consists of three separate  plans: one for civilians, one for military personnel, and one for quality of  life issues for servicemembers and their families. DOD has not integrated  the contractor workforce into these plans. Although DOD officials  maintain that these plans are intended to complement each other, the  plans are not integrated to form a seamless and comprehensive strategy.  The civilian plan was prepared separately from the other two military  plans with little direct involvement of key stakeholders, such as  representatives from military personnel and manpower requirements  communities.", "Although not reflected in its departmentwide civilian human capital  strategic plan, DOD acknowledged\u2014in its response to the President\u2019s  Management Agenda to accomplish workforce restructuring,  reorganizations, delayering, outsourcing, and reengineered and  streamlined processes\u2014that these efforts could only be accomplished  through coordinating and integrating civilian and military components.  The departmentwide civilian plan includes a longer-term objective to  assess the need for and the capabilities of automated information  management tools to primarily integrate civilian and military personnel  and transaction data. We believe these tools can also provide information  for planning and analysis, but they may not provide DOD with the  information needed to proactively shape the total DOD workforce in  response to current changes (i.e., the Secretary\u2019s transformation of the  department, increasing joint operations, and competitive sourcing  initiatives) because (1) contractor data are not included and (2) the  projected date for accomplishing this objective, September 2008, may be  too late to effect near-term decisions. In addition, officials in the Office of  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness recognize  that integration of the military and civilian plans is important and are  developing an umbrella document that will encompass all three  components of the human capital strategy, but it has not established a  time frame for completion.", "Furthermore, DOD\u2019s civilian human capital strategic plan does not address  the role of civilian vis-\u00e0-vis contractor personnel or how DOD plans to link  its human capital initiatives with its sourcing plans, such as efforts to  outsource non-core responsibilities. The plan notes that contractors are  part of the unique mix of DOD resources, but none of the goals and  objectives discusses how DOD will shape its future workforce in a total  force (civilian, military, and contractor) context. We believe that effective  civilian workforce planning cannot be accomplished in isolation from  planning for military personnel or sourcing initiatives. As the Commercial  Activities Panel report notes, it is particularly important that sourcing  strategies support, not inhibit, the government organization\u2019s efforts to  recruit and retain a high-performing in-house workforce. We also noted in  our High Risk report that careful and thoughtful workforce planning  efforts are critical to making intelligent competitive sourcing decisions.", "At the service level, the Air Force\u2019s strategic plans for civilian personnel  were not initially developed in a total force context, but the current plans  acknowledge the need to integrate strategic planning for civilians with  their military counterparts, as well as taking into account contractors. For  example, the Air Force has set a goal and taken steps to integrate planning  for active, reserve, civilian, and contractor personnel by 2004. Air Force  officials stated concerns about the significant budgetary consequences  when planning does not take place in a total force context. For example,  when civilian or contractor personnel perform functions previously  conducted by military personnel, the defense component involved must  obtain additional funds because payment for civilians and contractors  cannot come from military personnel funds. The Air Force estimates that  these costs could be $10 billion to $15 billion over the next 5 years.", "Although a proposed time frame is not provided, the Marine Corps\u2019 civilian  plan states the need to forecast military and civilian levels and workforce  requirements based on strategic mission drivers, stratified workload  demand, and business process changes; the requirements for its civilian  marines will take into account the appropriate redistribution of work  among the military, civilian, and contractor communities. The Army\u2019s  civilian human capital plan states that it will have to acquire, train, and  retain its total force in an operational environment that will place different  demands on human capital management. The Army\u2019s human capital  community has an objective to support the Army-wide \u201cThird Wave\u201d  initiative, which focuses on privatization of non-core functions to better  allocate scarce resources to core functions. (The Department of the Navy  does not yet have a civilian human capital strategic plan.)", "The defense agencies we reviewed, which have relatively few military  personnel compared to the military services, are taking or plan to take an  integrated approach to strategic planning for their civilian and military  workforces, but they do not indicate how they will integrate these efforts  with their sourcing initiatives. DCMA\u2019s human capital strategic plan  includes both civilian and military personnel. For example, the plan  includes a goal to address the underassignment of military personnel,  because their absence further compounds the difficulties caused by the  downsizing of civilian positions and the increasing workload. DFAS is  planning to include both civilian and military personnel in the human  capital strategic plan that it is developing. Like DCMA, military personnel  are a small but important part of the overall DFAS workforce, but they are  projected to be less available in the future. For example, the Air Force has  announced that it is reducing its military personnel presence at DFAS over  the next several years.", "Without integrated planning, goals for shaping and deploying military,  civilian, and contractor personnel may not be consistent with and support  each other.

We also determined whether the strategic  plans for civilian personnel are integrated with plans for military  personnel or sourcing initiatives. We focused primarily on civilian human  capital strategic planning undertaken since 1988, when DOD began  downsizing its civilian workforce. Our analyses were based on the  documents that each organization identified as its civilian human capital  strategic planning documents. Several documents had been published or  updated either just prior to or during the time of our review (May 2002 to  March 2003). Also, DOD and component strategic planning for civilian  personnel is a continuous process and involves ongoing efforts.

To understand how  civilian human capital strategic planning is being undertaken by other  defense organizations, which account for the other 15 percent of the DOD  civilian workforce, we determined the status of the human capital  strategic planning efforts of 21 other defense organizations through a  telephone survey. We judgmentally selected two defense agencies, DFAS  and DCMA, because of their large size and because they perform different  functions; therefore, they could offer different perspectives on strategic  planning for civilians. DFAS and DCMA account for about 26 percent of  the civilian personnel in other defense organizations. DFAS has about  15,274 civilian employees and more than 1,000 military personnel,  performs finance and accounting activities, and does not have a civilian  human capital strategic plan, although it does have an overall agency  strategic plan that includes human capital as a key element. DCMA has  about 11,770 civilian employees and about 480 military personnel,  performs acquisition functions, and has a civilian human capital strategic  plan.", "To assess the extent to which top-level leadership is involved in strategic  planning for civilian personnel, we reviewed the civilian human capital  strategic plans for discussions of the methodology used in developing  them that indicated leadership involvement.
