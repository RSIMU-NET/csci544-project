GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; analyzed VA data on GWI-related claim decisions from fiscal years 2010\u20132015 (the most recent data available); visited 4 of 58 regional offices, choosing those with high GWI caseloads; and interviewed headquarters and regional VA staff and key stakeholders.

GWI is a collective term for certain medical conditions among veterans who have served in Southwest Asia since 1990. Symptoms of GWI can include joint pain, gastrointestinal problems, fatigue, and neurological problems. On average, GWI claims have twice as many medical issues per claim as other disability claims, and take 4 months longer to complete. During fiscal years 2010 through 2015, the most recent data available at the time of our review, approval rates for GWI claims were about three times lower than for all other claimed disabilities. Several factors may contribute to lower approval rates, including that\u2014according to VA\u2014GWI claims are not always well understood by VA staff and veterans sometimes file for benefits without medical records to adequately support their claim.", "VA's ability to accurately process GWI claims is hampered by inadequate training, and its decision letters for denied claims do not communicate key information to veterans. VA claims rating staff often rely on VA medical examiners to assess a veteran's disability before a decision can be made on a claim. VA medical examiners told GAO that conducting Gulf War general medical exams is challenging because of the range of symptoms that could qualify as GWI. VA has developed elective GWI training for its medical examiners, but only 10 percent of examiners had taken the training as of February 2017. Federal internal control standards call for adequate training for staff so they can correctly carry out an agency's procedures. Medical examiners who do not take this GWI-specific training may not be able to provide information to VA staff to correctly decide whether to grant a veteran's claim. Once a determination is made, VA regulations also require clear explanations to veterans regarding claim decisions. GAO found that decision letters for GWI claims do not always include key information on why the claim was denied.", "VA considers research when adding to the list of conditions it associates with Gulf War service, but it does not have a plan to develop a uniformly used case definition of GWI. In 2010, VA added nine infectious diseases to the list of GWI-related conditions. VA advisory groups noted, however, that researchers face obstacles in conducting GWI research, including the lack of a single case definition of the illness for research and treatment purposes. In its 2015 Gulf War Research Strategic Plan, VA included an objective to develop a single case definition, but an official told GAO that VA had no action plan in place to achieve it. Without a plan to achieve a single case definition, research on and treatment for GWI may continue to progress slowly."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VA require GWI training for medical examiners, improve its decision letters, and develop a plan to establish a single GWI case definition.

According to VA, service members and veterans began reporting  symptoms after their return from service in the Persian Gulf War in 1991.  The exact cause of the symptoms was unknown, but according to the  Department of Defense, U.S. troops might have been exposed to a  variety of potentially hazardous substances, such as pesticides, smoke  from oil well fires, and depleted uranium that could be linked to their  medical conditions.

If there is no record of prior treatment in the medical  records and no other evidence in the claim file documenting symptoms  associated with undiagnosed illnesses or chronic multisymptom illnesses,  then there is no evidence of a chronic disability and no basis for granting  the claim.

According to our analysis  of VBA data, in fiscal year 2015, eight VBA regional offices had approval  rates of 5 percent or less for undiagnosed illness medical issues. For  additional data on regional office approval rates, see appendix II.", "According to several VBA claim rating staff we interviewed, VHA medical  examiners sometimes provide a medical opinion related to service  connection when one is not necessary because the veteran has a  presumptive condition, which fall into categories (1) and (2) and are  considered Gulf War illnesses. This opinion may include language that  indicates the veteran\u2019s presumptive condition may not be related to their  service. If VBA claim raters do not recognize that the medical examiner  has provided an unnecessary medical opinion about service connection  for a presumptive condition, they may inadvertently deny a claim that  should be presumptively granted. In our claim file review, we found two  cases where the VHA medical examiner provided a medical opinion  related to service connection for presumptive conditions.", "VHA developed specific training for medical examiners who may conduct  these exams, and since June 2015, VHA has offered this optional 90- minute web-based training course. We found this course on Gulf War  Illness exams covers topics some medical examiners said were  challenging. For example, the training course covers when a medical  opinion from VHA on potential service connection is not needed to  support these claims. However, only a few of the medical examiners we  spoke with recalled having completed this training. At the same time,  several VA staff noted the complexity of Gulf War Illness claims and some  medical examiners stated they would benefit from additional training on  Gulf War Illness and how to conduct these exams.", "According to a VHA official, as of February 2017, VHA\u2019s training data  shows that only about 10 percent of its medical examiners had completed  this optional Gulf War Illness course. According to a VHA official, the low  participation rate may be due to high workloads and the limited amount of  time medical examiners are allowed for elective training. VHA medical  examiners must complete several mandatory training courses when they  are first hired, before they are permitted to perform medical exams. In  addition, they must complete training courses before performing certain  specialty medical exams, such as for traumatic brain injury or post- traumatic stress disorder. VHA\u2019s Directive on Training and Certification of  Clinicians Performing VA Disability Examinations states that training is  critical to ensure clinicians who conduct medical examinations: (1)  understand that disability examination reports have legal ramifications  and (2) understand what VBA needs to know to make a valid  determination on disability claims. In addition, federal internal control  standards state that carrying out assigned responsibilities requires  knowledge, skills, and abilities, which are gained through training, among  other things. Without training, medical examiners may not be able to  reliably and consistently carry out their responsibilities with regard to  conducting and reporting on Gulf War general medical exams and provide  adequate information for decision-making to VBA\u2019s claim rating staff."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Decision Letters to Veterans Regarding Their Gulf War Illness Claims Do Not Always Include Important Information", "paragraphs": ["VBA guidance on preparing decisions on disability compensation claims  instructs staff to explain all methods of service connection considered  when denying a claim. If VBA determines that a veteran\u2019s Gulf War Illness  claim does not meet the requirements for either a direct or presumptive  service connection, a letter is sent to the veteran stating that the claim  was denied. However, VBA\u2019s decision letter denying benefits for Gulf War  Illness claims does not separately explain each method of service  connection that was considered. Rather, these letters simply include more  general language about service connection and explain that VA was not  able to link the veteran\u2019s medical condition to their military service.", "This may make it appear as if VBA is denying the claim without  considering it for service connection under a presumptive method. For  example, in one Gulf War Illness claim file we reviewed, nowhere in the  decision letter does VBA explain that the claim for sleep disorder\u2014one of  the symptoms of undiagnosed illness and medically unexplained chronic  multisymptom illness\u2014due to Gulf War Illness was evaluated for service  connection under both a direct and a presumptive method. See excerpt  from one denial letter we reviewed, below (emphasis added):  \u201cService connection for sleep disorder is denied since this condition  neither occurred in nor was caused by service.", "Service connection may be granted for any disease or injury that is considered to  have resulted in a period of war or service. To establish direct service connection  for a claimed disorder, objective evidence must show a diagnosis of a current  disability that is related to a disease or injury incurred in or aggravated during  \"active\" service; or that manifested itself to a compensable degree within one  year from the date of discharge. The evidence does not show an event,  disease or injury in service. Your service treatment records do not contain  complaints, treatment, or diagnosis for this condition. The evidence does not  show a current diagnosed disability. We received your medical evidence which  discusses the symptoms of your medical condition. We did not find a link  between your medical condition and military service.\u201d", "The language in the above letter could lead the veteran to conclude that  their claim was denied because VBA was unable to establish a link  between their medical condition and their service in the Gulf War and that  VBA had not considered it under the presumptive method of service  connection. Without also including clear language in the decision letter  about VBA\u2019s inability to grant service connection for their claim under the  presumptive method, veterans may be uncertain that this was the case  and may be unable to make a fully informed decision on whether to  appeal VBA\u2019s decision. VBA regulations state that claimants are entitled  to notice of a VA decision that affects their benefits, including a clear  statement of the reason, or reasons, for the decision. VA is currently  reviewing its decision letters as part of a broader review of the appeals  process, and it has noted that veterans need a clear and detailed notice  when a claim is decided. However, this effort does not include a review of  the decision letters for Gulf War Illness claims. In its draft framework for  the appeals process, VA identifies eight elements of an adequate notice  to veterans. These elements include language in plain English that  informs the veteran of VA\u2019s findings including an explanation of how the  evidence was considered."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "VA Considers Research When Identifying Additional Disabilities Related to Gulf War Service, but It Lacks a Plan to Guide Its Work on Key Research Goal", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "VA Has Used Research to Establish Presumptive Medical Conditions for Gulf War Veterans", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s research on Gulf War Illness is used in several ways including  identifying symptoms, diagnosing those with illnesses, developing  treatment, and finding methods to respond to similar illnesses that may  arise among veterans in the future. Some of this research is directly  relevant to the disability compensation program; for example, it has been  used to establish additional presumptive conditions. To determine if new  presumptive conditions should be established, VA contracts with the  National Academy of Medicine, which forms a committee, to review all  Gulf War Illness-related medical and scientific information. For each  topic VA would like to study, it gives to a committee of the National  Academy of Medicine a specific topic and the committee reviews current,  related peer-reviewed research and hears from relevant experts and  stakeholders in public meetings. The committee writes a report to the  VA Secretary that may include recommendations, such as adding  potential illnesses to the list of presumptive conditions, or suggested  areas for future Gulf War Illness research. Officials from VA\u2019s Office of  Research and Development and Post-Deployment Health review and  consider recommendations from the committee when determining if  research evidence warrants an expansion of the list of symptoms or  illnesses that are considered presumptively connected to Gulf War  service (see fig. 6). VA then adds new presumptive illnesses or other  medical issues that VA will provide disability compensation for through  regulations, and such illnesses can also be added through legislation.", "One recent example of using evidence-based research occurred in 2010  when VA amended its regulation to establish nine infectious diseases as  additional conditions presumed to be connected to Gulf War service. VA  officials told us the agency did so as a result of evidence presented in a  2006 National Academy of Medicine Gulf War and Health report on the  relationship between Gulf War service and the manifestation of certain  infectious diseases. VA follows a similar internal review process when it  considers recommendations or suggested presumptive conditions  brought to it from other stakeholders, such as veterans advocacy groups  or the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019 Illnesses.", "VA has not identified any new presumptive conditions that it associates  with Gulf War service since adding the nine infectious diseases in 2010,  but agency officials say they continue to review research, analyze  National Academy of Medicine report findings and recommendations, and  work with stakeholders to identify whether additional illnesses should be  added. For example, according to VA officials, a stakeholder group  recently worked with VA leadership to consider adding brain cancer to the  list of presumptive conditions associated with service in the Gulf War.  After further consideration, VA officials said the agency decided not to  proceed, citing limited scientific evidence from a 2016 National Academy  of Medicine report. To inform the potential inclusion of brain cancer on  the list of presumptive conditions in the future, VA officials told us that the  agency will ask the upcoming National Academy of Medicine committee  to include in its next review more recent research, including VA research,  that has been completed since the National Academy of Medicine\u2019s prior  study on brain cancer incidence in Gulf War veterans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of a Plan to Establish a Single Case Definition of Gulf War Illness Hinders VA\u2019s Progress toward Achieving This Goal", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s progress toward its goal of establishing a single case definition of  Gulf War Illness is hindered by the lack of a plan to undertake this work.  As noted earlier, to help inform its Gulf War Illness research activities, VA  relies on input from two key advisory groups\u2014the National Academy of  Medicine and VA\u2019s Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019  Illnesses. In 2014, these groups each recommended that VA take steps  to establish a single case definition of Gulf War Illness that can be  uniformly used to describe symptoms related to Gulf War service.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a case  definition is a set of uniform criteria used to define a disease for public  health surveillance. VA\u2019s advisory groups emphasized the importance of  a single case definition to improve the research, clinical diagnosis, and treatment of Gulf War Illness in veterans. In the past, researchers have  used multiple definitions to characterize symptoms in Gulf War veterans,  and VA currently uses two different definitions of Gulf War Illness for its  research. According to VA, this has limited the extent to which  researchers can compare findings between studies and identify similar  characteristics of the illness.", "Both the National Academy of Medicine and VA\u2019s Research Advisory  Committee on Gulf War Veterans\u2019 Illnesses noted that a single case  definition would help advance Gulf War Illness research activities by  ensuring they are more focused and their results more usable. To make  progress toward this goal, both groups recommended VA analyze data  from its existing datasets in the near-term to better understand how they  can be used to contribute to a case definition while also conducting future  research projects that contribute to this goal in the long term.  Specifically, VA has access to dozens of existing large-population  datasets from federally sponsored research studies, as well as data  contained in several federal Gulf War registries that include veterans\u2019  health information. According to VA, if these data were merged with its  administrative datasets, the information could be leveraged by VA  researchers to improve understanding of Gulf War Illness and, ultimately,  contribute to the development of a single case definition. These datasets  could provide researchers with additional information needed to develop a  case definition, including information on veterans\u2019 service and onset of  their symptoms. VA\u2019s research advisory groups also noted the long-term  need for VA to plan for future research that is likely to contribute to a  single case definition. In its Gulf War Research Strategic Plan, VA noted  that future research might include the application of new scientific  capabilities, such as biomarker identification and genome-wide  association studies that could not only significantly advance  understanding of an individual\u2019s genetic pre-disposition toward developing  symptoms of Gulf War Illness, but also help to inform the establishment of  a single case definition.", "In response to recommendations from its advisory groups to establish a  single case definition of Gulf War Illness, VA included this as a strategic  objective in its 2015 update to the Gulf War Research Strategic Plan.  However, according to a VA official, the agency has not developed a plan  to guide its review of existing medical datasets or integrate information  from recent and ongoing research to identify areas of future research and  establish a single case definition. Federal internal control standards call  for agencies to have documented plans that include specific action steps  associated with their objectives. VHA officials told us that they are  considering how to use existing federal datasets and ongoing research to  better understand Gulf War Illness but have not laid out specific actions,  such as what data to use and how using these data would contribute to  the development of a single case definition. VA officials attributed the lack  of a specific plan to challenges with developing a single case definition  and noted that it must be a slow and deliberate process.
