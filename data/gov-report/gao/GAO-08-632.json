These actions were aimed at problems in three main areas: (1) executive compensation, benefits, ethics, and operational policies and controls; (2) flow of information to the Board, transparency of Board operations, and relationship with stakeholders; and (3) the Board's responsibilities, structure, and performance. GAO was asked to assess the extent of the Board's progress in each of these areas. GAO obtained information and data from the Board's regents, Smithsonian executives, and other stakeholders and also analyzed other organizations whose boards had faced similar governance challenges."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Board has implemented several reforms related to executive compensation and benefits, but the development of policies for broader operational matters such as travel, event expenses, and contracting is still under way. Actions implemented include a revised salary range for the Smithsonian's Secretary-elect and a unified compensation policy for other executives. The Smithsonian is reviewing policies related to travel and other matters, including internal controls. Effectively implementing the new policies and procedures developed during these reviews is likely to depend on effectively training staff and establishing accountability, both of which may be challenging due to a level of standardization and requirements that did not exist before. The Board has completed the actions it proposed for improving its access to information and making its operations more transparent, but actions to improve communication and relationships with stakeholders are less far along. The Board now has avenues for obtaining information directly from senior officials rather than through the Office of the Secretary, and it has taken such steps as creating a Web page to better publicize its operations and decisions. The Board is studying how to improve links with its 30 advisory boards and has developed an overall strategy for communicating with the larger network of stakeholders, but neither action is far enough along to assess its potential for addressing past problems. The Board has largely completed the actions it proposed for clarifying regents' responsibilities and studying possible changes in its size and structure, but actions for assessing Board performance are still being developed. The Board altered its committee structure but decided that more fundamental changes in its size and composition were unnecessary. To provide further expertise where necessary under the existing structure, the Board is encouraging the addition of nonregents to committees. Thus far, however, the Board has not developed a process for assuring transparency and accountability in selecting nonregents and using them to enhance governance. The Board is also developing a self-assessment process, but it remains to be seen how the Board will hold regents accountable if they neglect their duties. Given the extensiveness of actions taken and still under way, it is likely that the effectiveness of some changes will only be evident over a longer time. The Board does not currently have plans to conduct a broader evaluation of its governance reform actions after such time has passed to determine if the actions taken have addressed governance and accountability problems which led to its reform actions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Smithsonian Institution (Smithsonian) has been referred to as  America\u2019s museum, as its museums hold and provide access to  irreplaceable national collections in American and natural history, art, and  other areas. In addition to its 19 museums, the Smithsonian includes nine  research centers, the National Zoological Park, and a number of other  programs. Since its establishment in 1846, the Smithsonian has evolved  into the world\u2019s largest museum complex and research organization; two  of its museums, on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., are the most  visited in the world. Congress established the Smithsonian in 1846. In  fiscal year 2007, about 70 percent of the Smithsonian\u2019s operating revenues  of approximately $1 billion came from federal sources, including direct  appropriations and government grants and contracts. The rest of its  operating revenues came from contributions, earnings from investments  and business operations, and other private sources. The act establishing  the Smithsonian in 1846 provided that, among other things, the business of  the Smithsonian be conducted by a board of regents. Currently, the Board  of Regents (Board) is comprised of 17 regents, including 2 ex-officio  regents\u2014the Chief Justice and the Vice President of the United States\u20146  congressional regents, and 9 citizen regents. As the Smithsonian\u2019s chief  decision-making body, the Board is responsible for the long-term  stewardship of the Smithsonian\u2019s mission.", "In 2007, serious governance challenges for the Board came to light.  Following a report from the Smithsonian\u2019s Inspector General to the Board  on the then- Secretary\u2019s compensation package and expenses, and related  inquiries, that Secretary resigned. Two subsequent studies were published  in June 2007, one by the Board\u2019s Governance Committee and the other by  an Independent Review Committee (IRC) created at the Board\u2019s request,  that identified such governance and accountability breakdowns as the  following:    Policies and internal controls were inadequate in such areas as conflicts of  interest, compensation, and travel.", "The Board did not routinely receive or request information necessary to  support vigorous deliberation, well-reasoned decision making, and  adequate oversight.", "The Board\u2019s roles and responsibilities were not clearly defined, leaving the  role of the regents subject to interpretation.", "The Board may have lacked sufficient expertise to conduct effective  oversight in some areas, and the size and structure of the Board itself may  be contributing to this problem.", "Both studies recommended changes to address these governance  challenges. The Board adopted all 25 of the Governance Committee\u2019s  recommendations and stated that the IRC\u2019s recommendations were, for  the most part, encompassed by the Governance Committee\u2019s  recommendations. The Board also created a scorecard to track the  implementation status of the Governance Committee recommendations,  which is posted on the Smithsonian\u2019s Web site and updated monthly.  Several other senior Smithsonian executives resigned over the past year,  including the Deputy Secretary and the Chief Executive Officer of  Smithsonian Business Ventures, a centralized business entity responsible  for the Smithsonian\u2019s various business activities.", "You asked us to assess the extent of the Board\u2019s progress in addressing the  areas of concern identified in the Governance Committee and IRC reports.  Specifically, we evaluated the Board\u2019s actions related to three broad areas  of concern: (1) executive compensation, benefits, and expenses, ethics,  and operational policies and internal controls; (2) the flow of information  to the Board, the transparency of Board operations, and the Board\u2019s  communication and relationships with stakeholders; and (3) the Board\u2019s  responsibilities, composition, and performance.", "To address these objectives we reviewed relevant laws and regulations  and Smithsonian policies, reports, and documents, including the new draft  compensation policies; Board meeting minutes; reports regarding  Smithsonian advisory boards; a recent consultant report on the size,  composition, and structure of the Board; and draft Board assessment  materials, among many other documents. To determine the adequacy of  proposed changes in Smithsonian policies and practices, we compared the  proposed changes to current governance practices in the private and  nonprofit sectors and also used GAO\u2019s internal control standards and  other GAO criteria as appropriate. We compiled current governance  practices from several sources, including previous GAO work on  governance challenges at several organizations, including the John F.  Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Legal Services Corporation,  and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation; as well as organizations  such as BoardSource, Independent Sector, Conference Board, the Museum  Trustee Association, the American Association of Museums, and the  Council on Foundations, that have compiled current practices in nonprofit  governance, and museum governance in particular. We also looked at  relevant governance documents and interviewed knowledgeable senior  officials from organizations that have recently undergone similar  governance reforms, including the American Red Cross, American  University, J. Paul Getty Trust, and United Way of America. We chose  these organizations because they have had similar governance problems,  have conducted a governance review, and have changed their practices or  structure; have a similar structure to the Smithsonian, such as consisting  of a central or national governing body with multiple programming units  and organizations; and face similar stewardship challenges. We did not  assess the effectiveness of governance reform efforts at these  organizations. We also collected and reviewed a variety of documentation  in order to validate that the changes to Smithsonian policies and  procedures were actually being carried out, such as reviewing Board  meeting minutes to validate that certain senior officials were in attendance  and provided input to the Board.", "In addition to reviewing relevant documentation, we interviewed current  and former regents, senior Smithsonian officials, directors of Smithsonian  museums, members of Smithsonian advisory boards, and selected  governance experts to discuss their views on the Smithsonian\u2019s  governance reforms and the appropriateness and potential effectiveness of  those reforms. Specifically, we interviewed all of the current citizen  regents, except the most recently appointed regent; three former citizen  regents; four congressional regents; and the primary staff liaisons to the  remaining two congressional regents. We also obtained a written response  from the Chief Justice to questions we provided. We also interviewed  senior Smithsonian officials\u2014such as the Acting Secretary, the Chief  Financial Officer (CFO), the General Counsel, and the Inspector General,  as well as several other members of Smithsonian\u2019s central management.  We interviewed the directors of all of the Smithsonian\u2019s museums,  including the National Zoological Park, as well as the chairpersons of the  advisory boards of several of these institutions. Finally, we interviewed  selected experts in nonprofit governance, including those experts that  were advisors to the Board in the governance reform process, and others  that we identified through a literature search or were referred to us by  other experts in the field.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 to May 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. Appendix I contains more information  about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Smithsonian Institution is a unique and complex organization.  Congress created the Smithsonian in 1846 as an independent trust  establishment of the United States. Congress did not establish the  Smithsonian within any branch of the federal government, and it is not a  federal agency unless Congress designates it as such for purposes of a  particular law or a federal court determines it to be. The Smithsonian Act  provided that the business of the Smithsonian be conducted by a board of  regents, and that the Board be drawn from all three branches of  government and the private sector. The Act delineates the structure and  composition of the Board. Table 1 provides more information on the  structure and current membership of the Board.", "The Board traditionally has elected the Chief Justice of the United States  to be the Chancellor of the Board. The Chancellor presides over Board  meetings and selected ceremonial occasions, and until recent changes to  the role of the Chancellor, had several other leadership responsibilities.", "The Board is vested with governing authorities over the Smithsonian and  considers matters such as the Smithsonian\u2019s budgets and planning  documents, new programs and construction proposals, appointments to  Smithsonian advisory boards, and a variety of other issues facing the  Smithsonian. The Board also has stewardship responsibilities, including  ensuring that the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities and collections are maintained,  and ensuring that the Smithsonian has a funding strategy that provides  sufficient funds to support these activities. In recent years, the National  Academy of Public Administration, the Smithsonian, and we have reported  on the deterioration of the Smithsonian\u2019s facilities and the threat posed by  this deterioration. For example, in September 2007, we reported that  funding challenges at the Smithsonian were affecting facilities\u2019 conditions  and security, and endangering collections, and that the Smithsonian\u2019s cost  estimate for facilities projects had increased to $2.5 billion from $2.3  billion in April 2005. In that report, we recommended that the Board  perform a comprehensive analysis of alternative funding strategies beyond  principally using federal funds to support facilities and submit a report to  Congress and the Office of Management and Budget describing a funding  strategy for current and future facilities needs.", "The Smithsonian manages two different types of funds\u2014federal  appropriations and trust funds\u2014which include revenue from donations,  grants, revenue-generating activities, interest on investments, and other  sources. In some cases, the Smithsonian\u2019s policies related to activities  involving the expenditure of federal funds has differed from its policies  related to the expenditure of trust funds. For example, in 2006, we  reported that the Smithsonian had elected to follow the Federal  Acquisition Regulation (FAR) provisions for contracts involving the  expenditure of federal funds, while for business contracts that involved  neither the expenditure nor receipt of federal funds and for which the FAR  is inapplicable, the Smithsonian had elected to follow commercial  business practices. About two-thirds of Smithsonian employees, including  executives, are paid with federal funds, while other employees are paid  with trust funds. Federal employees are subject to the laws, regulations,  and policies for federal employment, while trust employees are covered by  Smithsonian policies for trust fund employment.", "Adding to the complexity of the organization, in 1998, the Board  authorized the Secretary of the Smithsonian to reorganize the various  business activities within the Smithsonian into a centralized business  entity, Smithsonian Business Ventures (SBV). SBV\u2019s mission is to generate  revenue from business activities to support the Smithsonian\u2019s mission. The  Smithsonian\u2019s business activities include a magazine and museum retail  operations.", "The governance reform currently under way at the Smithsonian is not  unique among nonprofit organizations, or among other major arts and  educational institutions. In light of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and  governance reform in the corporate world, awareness has grown regarding  the need for improving governance practices in the nonprofit sector.  Several major nonprofit organizations, such as the American Red Cross,  the J. Paul Getty Trust, and the United Way of America, have recently  undergone major governance reform. These efforts were initiated in  response to similar problems that were identified at the Smithsonian  regarding controls over executive compensation and expenses, and  insufficient oversight and leadership by the boards of those institutions.  For example, the J. Paul Getty Trust initiated its governance reform in  response to similar criticism regarding executive compensation and  expenses, limited board oversight of those expenses, and similar issues  regarding weaknesses in conflicts-of-interest policies. We have found that  governance and accountability breakdowns can result in a lack of trust  from donors, grantors, and appropriators, which could ultimately put  funding and the organization\u2019s credibility at risk.", "Both the Smithsonian\u2019s Governance Committee report, and the IRC\u2019s  report highlighted several issues and areas of concern related to  governance of the Smithsonian and oversight of Smithsonian management.  While the Board accepted the IRC\u2019s report, it did not concur with all of the  report\u2019s findings. Both reports laid out recommendations to improve  governance which were adopted by the Board in June 2007. Specifically,  these reports highlighted:  inadequate policies in place and insufficient oversight of and knowledge  among regents concerning executive compensation, trust and federal pay  systems, leave for senior executives, conflicts of interest regarding service  on for-profit boards, travel expenses, event expenses, activities of SBV,  and internal financial controls;   a lack of critical information and relationships necessary to bring forward  important issues and concerns and to support vigorous deliberation and  well-reasoned decision making on the part of the Board, such as lack of  access for senior management to the Board, too much control within the  Secretary\u2019s office regarding the information available to the Board and the  Board\u2019s agenda, and a lack of transparency and connection to  stakeholders within the Smithsonian (such as museum directors and  advisory boards) and to the public at large; and IRC\u2019s finding that there was insufficient action on the part of the Board to  demand critical information needed to conduct adequate oversight of the  Smithsonian, which was linked to a number of issues, such as unclear  roles and expectations for citizen, congressional, and ex-officio regents; a  lack of engagement and participation by some regents; unclear  responsibilities of Board committees and a lack of critical committees; a  lack of diversity of skills and expertise needed to conduct adequate  oversight; inflexible size and structure of the Board; and a lack of  accountability of regents with regard to their performance and to fulfilling  their fiduciary duties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Board Has Implemented Some Executive and Ethics Reforms, and Has Begun a Review of Policies and Internal Controls, but Implementation Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["The Board has implemented several executive reforms to address  concerns about executive compensation, benefits, and expenses, and has  established an overarching code of ethics applicable to everyone  associated with the Smithsonian, but development of policies and internal  controls for broader operational matters such as travel, event expenses,  and contracting is still under way. Training and establishing accountability  remain challenges. The recommendations covered in this section are  shown in figure 1. Appendix II provides information on the status of all of  the Governance Committee\u2019s report recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Board Has Implemented Several Executive and Ethics Reforms", "paragraphs": ["The Board has implemented reforms related to the Secretary\u2019s  compensation, executives\u2019 compensation, executive leave policies, and  conflict-of-interest policies. Regarding the Secretary\u2019s compensation, the  Board revised the process it used to establish compensation for the  Secretary-elect (scheduled to assume office in July 2008). This reform was  implemented to address concerns about the former Secretary\u2019s  compensation. According to the IRC, the former Secretary\u2019s total  compensation equaled $915,698 in 2007 and was troubling for two reasons.  First, it included a housing allowance that reached $193,000 in 2007, which  the IRC concluded did not in fact serve as a housing allowance but as a  \u201cpackaging device\u201d to provide the Secretary with additional salary.  Second, the former Secretary\u2019s starting base salary of $330,000 in 2000 was  increased significantly in 2001\u2014and reached $617,672 in 2007\u2014based in  part on compensation studies that the IRC concluded were not objective  and were used primarily as a method of justifying substantial  compensation increases.", "On March 15, 2008, the Board announced that it had selected a new  Secretary of the Smithsonian. According to Smithsonian officials, the  Secretary-elect\u2019s base salary will be $490,000 as compared to the former  Secretary\u2019s 2007 base salary of $617,672. The Secretary-elect\u2019s total  compensation, including base salary and employer pension contributions,  will be $524,000, considerably lower than the former Secretary\u2019s 2007 total  compensation of $915,698. According to a Smithsonian official, the new  Secretary will not receive a housing allowance or any additional benefits  beyond those provided to all senior trust Smithsonian employees. In  setting this salary, the Board was guided by a compensation study that  used a methodology that addressed many of the concerns the IRC had had  about the previous compensation studies used to set the former  Secretary\u2019s salary.", "The Board also has reformed the Smithsonian\u2019s executive compensation  system by implementing what it refers to as a unified compensation  philosophy. This effort involved establishing clear criteria to determine  whether the compensation of each trust executive is market based or  equivalent to the federal system. This reform grew out of concerns that the  Smithsonian had separate employment systems governing its federal, trust,  and SBV employees, and that the trust salaries for some positions\u2014in  areas such as finance and administration\u2014were unnecessarily higher than  those paid in much larger federal agencies.", "The Board determined that the Smithsonian should follow the federal  guidelines for pay for senior-level positions except for limited instances  where the job functions do not exist in the federal sector or there is not a  candidate pool in the federal sector\u2014in which case, compensation for the  position should be market based. The Board also approved a plan to  address the effects of applying the criteria. After applying the criteria, the  Smithsonian determined that 38 of its executives were in positions that  should follow a federal compensation approach. Of those 38, 19 had  salaries above the federal pay cap. According to the plan, the salaries for  these 19 positions will be brought in line with the federal pay cap within 5  years. A Smithsonian official stated that the implementation of this  recommendation was extensively debated. According to a Smithsonian  official, the 5-year transition plan was chosen to avoid the risk of having  all of the affected executives leave immediately, which could hurt the  Smithsonian; however, a Smithsonian official predicted that some of the  affected executives may leave the Smithsonian due to the change in their  salaries.", "The Board also implemented a recommendation to place all Smithsonian  executives on the Smithsonian\u2019s existing leave policy. This effectively  addressed a concern that some Smithsonian executives were exempt from  the generally applicable leave accrual system, and that as a result, the  former Secretary and former Deputy Secretary were absent from the  Smithsonian for about 400 and 550 workdays, respectively, between 2000  and 2006. On September 30, 2007, the Smithsonian transitioned all these  executives to the existing trust leave policy that is equivalent to the federal  leave policy for senior executives. The affected executives were provided  with opening leave balances for annual and sick leave according to a  formula. According to National Finance Center data, since the leave policy  went into effect on September 30, 2007, 33 of the 34 executives had  recorded some leave by February 16, 2008.", "The Board strengthened its policies related to conflicts of interest by  prohibiting for-profit board service by its senior executives and requiring  prior approval for service on nonprofit boards by any senior executives.  The previous policy resulted in two senior executives, including the  former Secretary, serving on for-profit boards, one of which had a contract  with the Smithsonian; some regents were unaware of this board service.  The Board took action on this issue by creating a conflicts-of-interest  policy applicable to senior executives. In addition, the General Counsel  now reports to the Board\u2019s Audit and Review Committee on senior  executives\u2019 outside activities. Also, although the Smithsonian has  individual codes of ethics for employees, volunteers, regents, and advisory  board members, until the governance reform, it had no overarching code  for the entire institution. The Board approved a Statement of Values and  Code of Ethics in January 2008, which applies to everyone in the  Smithsonian community. A few additional efforts to improve the ethics  policy are planned, but not yet complete\u2014for example, the creation of a  conflicts database. However, after reviewing the new policies and ethics  code and comparing them to current industry practices, we believe that  the new policies and ethics code follow current industry practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smithsonian Established Some New Policies and Initiated Reviews of Policies and Internal Controls, but Implementation of These Efforts Is Likely to Include Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The Board has established some new policies related to travel and event  expenses, and has initiated reviews to consider how to strengthen and  improve the Smithsonian\u2019s travel and event expense policies and  contracting policies, including for SBV.

In addition, the IRC  pointed out that the former Secretary\u2019s expenses were not reviewed for  reasonableness and raised concerns about his chartering of a private jet, at  a cost of $14,000, to travel to San Antonio, Texas, to receive an award and  return to Washington, D.C., the next day to attend a Board committee  meeting.", "The Board adopted interim policies on travel expenses in April 2007 and  adopted them as standing policies in June 2007.

The issue  of event expenses also was raised in late 2007 and early 2008, when the  media and some members of Congress expressed concern about the  reasonableness of the event expenses surrounding the departure of the  former Director of the National Museum of the American Indian. The  Board adopted policies that attempted to clarify this issue by stating that  Smithsonian funds, including for trust events, should only be used for  reasonable expenses in accordance with Smithsonian policies.", "In its ongoing review, a Smithsonian team has developed an approach to  event expense policies that will divide Smithsonian events into three  categories, from the most formal to the least formal, with clearly identified  requirements for approvals and authorizations.

When SBV was created in 1999 to  consolidate and improve Smithsonian business activities, it was not  subject to all Smithsonian policies.

The Smithsonian has defined internal control as a  process designed to provide reasonable assurance of the Smithsonian\u2019s  ability to achieve and sustain effective and efficient operations, reliable  financial reporting, and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and  policies. To implement this review of internal controls, the team  identified a core set of 16 critical processes where there is financial risk\u2014 including processes related to travel and event expenses, contracting,  SBV, and other areas such as financial reporting and federal and trust  funds control\u2014and developed a framework with which to analyze each  process.

Smithsonian officials emphasized that the teams undertaking the reviews  of Smithsonian policies are considering how to best establish  accountability processes and mechanisms to ensure compliance with new  policies.

Prior to the reforms, the Secretary\u2019s  anticipated travel expenses were not reviewed prior to travel. Under this  change, the Secretary\u2019s travel is being approved by a subordinate\u2014the  CFO. According Smithsonian officials, the Smithsonian decided on this  policy because the CFO has direct access to the Board, and through  informal benchmarking it found that some other federal agencies either  provided the agency head with blanket travel authorizations, which the  Smithsonian did not want to do, or had the agency head\u2019s travel approved  by the executive secretary, a position that does not exist at the  Smithsonian. The CFO stated that to supplement this process, she is  planning to hire someone to support posttravel audits of the Secretary,  executives, and the entire Smithsonian.", "The Smithsonian has not yet determined the extent to which the Board  will review the travel expenses of the Secretary and other executives.  Although the Governance Committee\u2019s recommendation in this area calls  for the Audit and Review Committee to review the Secretary\u2019s travel  expenses and to report to the full Board at least annually on these  expenses, the process by which this will occur on an ongoing basis has not  yet been established. According to Smithsonian officials, the Board did  review the Secretary\u2019s travel in January 2008, and a team is considering a  posttravel audit approach that would include 100 percent travel voucher  audits for all senior executives with vouchers greater than $2,500. The  team working on this issue also will recommend how much information  from travel reviews or audits is to be provided to the Audit and Review  Committee. The new processes are scheduled to be implemented by the  end of the third quarter of 2008. According to officials at the J. Paul Getty  Trust, who told us that the Trust faced some similar governance issues  over the expenses of a previous chief executive officer, the Chair of the J.  Paul Getty Trust\u2019s Board now reviews the chief executive officer\u2019s travel  expenses on a quarterly basis. In addition, its audit committee receives  quarterly reports on the travel expenses of the chief executive officer and  nine senior directors.", "Another ongoing challenge for the Smithsonian is implementing effective  accountability measures within limited resources. For example, the CFO  stated that while the Smithsonian had a long-standing practice of quarterly  posttravel compliance reviews of a sample of travel activity, the  Smithsonian has not been able to complete these reviews on a quarterly  basis since the second quarter of 2004\u2014well prior to the governance  problems identified by the Governance Committee. While the Smithsonian  has completed assorted travel-related reviews, including checks for  duplicative payments and senior executive travel reviews, it has not  renewed its post-travel voucher audits. As described above, the outside  auditor\u2019s management letter that accompanied the Smithsonian\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 financial statement audit cited inadequate accounting resources  and staff as a reportable condition, and a team is working to address this  through hiring more accountants. Establishing accountability is especially  important because among the governance problems identified by the IRC  were that the Smithsonian did not comply with its existing policies and  procedures with respect to accounting for expenses, and the former  Smithsonian Secretary interpreted a Smithsonian policy authorizing his  first-class air travel to qualify him for first class accommodations as well\u2014 despite Smithsonian policies to the contrary. The fact that the Inspector  General found that the former Director of the Smithsonian\u2019s Latino Center  had violated Smithsonian policies related to contracting, acceptance of  gifts from outside sources, and travel expenses, among other things, also  illustrates the importance of establishing effective accountability  mechanisms in these and other areas."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Board Has Implemented Reforms to Improve Information and Transparency; Efforts to Enhance Communication Are Not Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The Board has completed the actions it proposed for improving its access  to information and making its operations more transparent, but actions to  improve communication and relationships with stakeholders are not fully  implemented.

Also,  the reporting relationship for the Inspector General was changed from the  Secretary to the Board, and the Audit and Review Committee\u2019s charter was  amended to reflect this change. These changes were in response to  concerns that the Board was not developing relationships necessary to  allow Smithsonian senior officials or staff to bring forward information of  concern to them. Our review of Board meeting minutes shows that the  General Counsel, CFO, and Inspector General have attended all full Board  meetings since the changes were made and have provided information and  raised concerns to the Board. Based on our interviews with the General  Counsel, CFO, and Inspector General, as well as regents and other officials  both before and after the changes were initiated, the changes have  generally improved access and communication and strengthened reporting  relationships and governance reform efforts. For example, the General  Counsel and CFO have been working with the Board\u2019s committees in  carrying out governance reforms related to ethics and contracting policies,  respectively.", "The Board also created an independent Office of the Regents with staff  dedicated and reporting to the Board in order to better control the agenda  of the Board and the level of information available to the Board. The  regents now have a greater role in determining which matters warrant the  Board\u2019s time and attention, decisions that were previously largely made  within the office of the former Secretary. This is an important change in  the Board\u2019s practice because it will serve to help prevent any future  Secretary from attempting to control the level of information provided to  the Board as the Governance Committee\u2019s and IRC\u2019s reports indicated the  previous Secretary had done.", "The Acting Secretary designated the General Counsel as corporate  secretary who, among other duties, officially records the minutes of all  Board meetings\u2014similar to practices of other nonprofit organizations.  Since November 2007, minutes of most Board meetings, including  committees, have generally been recorded by the corporate secretary or  his staff and are more thorough than they were previously and include  more context about information presented to the Board during the  meeting. For example, the reports of Board committees are more detailed  than previously. We also found that Board meeting minutes have been  improved to capture more deliberation than they did previously, which  will likely serve to help improve transparency of the Board\u2019s actions.", "Although the Smithsonian is not subject to the Freedom of Information  Act (FOIA), Smithsonian officials told us they follow the principles of  FOIA when fielding the public\u2019s requests for access to records. The  Smithsonian created a FOIA policy in November 2007 to formalize and  clarify its records access policy. This change came about in response to  criticism that there was confusion as to which FOIA principles applied to  the Smithsonian. According to the General Counsel, the Board adopted a  FOIA policy to formally articulate and clarify the Smithsonian\u2019s policy on  public access to Smithsonian records. We compared the Smithsonian\u2019s  FOIA policy with FOIA itself and found that the Smithsonian\u2019s policy is  consistent. The Smithsonian articulates its public records\u2019 policy and  establishes exceptions or cases in which documentation would likely not  be provided, for example, certain commercial or personal data. According  to the General Counsel, contracts negotiated since this policy was created  no longer contain blanket confidentiality provisions. Furthermore, the  Smithsonian intends to remove its FOIA policy provision authorizing the  Secretary to carve out additional exceptions. The formulation of this  policy should result in less confusion regarding the public\u2019s access to  records and provide greater transparency.", "Finally, the Board created a Web page dedicated to governance to increase  the public\u2019s access to information and improve transparency. Information  posted by the Board relates to its structure, membership, and functions.  For example, the Board has posted minutes, committee assignments,  reports to the Board, and a document tracking the governance reform  efforts, which is updated monthly. These changes were made in response  to criticisms about the lack of transparency regarding governance at the  Smithsonian following the recent governance problems. The Smithsonian  has improved the amount of governance information available to the  public, and by comparison, generally has more governance content  available to the public than some other nonprofit organizations\u2019 Web sites.  The Board also is planning to post additional information in an effort to  improve the transparency of the Board\u2019s policies and actions. For  example, according to a Smithsonian official, the executive compensation  study which describes the benchmarking used to determine the salary  range for the new Secretary, committee meeting minutes, and information  regarding criteria for regent nomination, eventually will be posted to the  Web page."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Board Has a Study Under Way on How to Improve Its Relationship with Advisory Boards", "paragraphs": ["In one effort to improve governance through strengthened stakeholder  relationships, the Board is studying how to improve the link between the  Board and the Smithsonian\u2019s 30 advisory boards, which include a national  advisory board as well as advisory boards that focus on individual  museums, research centers, or programs. As the Board\u2019s study and  recommendations on this issue have not yet occurred, it is too soon to  fully evaluate the Board\u2019s efforts or conclusions. Past efforts to enhance  this relationship have been limited, and some directors and advisory board  chairs expressed ongoing concerns about the relationship.", "Most advisory boards (except for those with mandated statutory  authority) have no independent governance function, and all are subject to  the authority of the Board. There is considerable variability among  advisory boards, reflecting the differences in how the boards came into  being, their missions, their bylaws, and the entities they serve. Their  primary purpose is to provide advice, support, and expertise to the  directors of museums, research centers, and programs, as well as to the  Board and Secretary. For example, some advisory board chairs we spoke  with assist their museums, research centers, or programs with  acquisitions, program development, strategic planning, or fundraising,  among other things. According to the Governance Committee\u2019s report, the  advisory boards provide a key link between the Board and the public and a  direct connection to the museums. Some advisory boards include a regent,  while most do not.", "The Board has not always fully implemented past recommendations to  enhance the relationship between the Board and advisory boards. A 2002  internal Smithsonian study found that the advisory boards were an  underutilized asset and recommended, among other things, that each  advisory board should submit a report to the regents every 3 years on its  museum or facility on a rotating basis, and the Board should respond in  writing to these reports. In response to this recommendation, the  Smithsonian implemented the practice of having a subset of advisory  boards submit a paper to the Board for its meetings starting in September  2003, with the idea that each advisory board would report every 3 years.  However, the second half of the internal recommendation, that the regents  should respond in writing to the papers, was never implemented. The  practice was discontinued after January 2007.", "Our work suggests a continued broad level of concern over the lack of  engagement of the regents with advisory boards. Nine of the 10 advisory  board chairs we spoke with stated that they had had little to no direct  contact with the Board. Although 2 of the 10 advisory board chairs we  spoke with were generally satisfied with the current level of interaction  between the Board of Regents and the advisory boards, 6 of the advisory  board chairs we spoke with were not. Some of the museum directors  with whom we spoke also raised concerns about the current relationship  between the advisory boards and the Board, and the majority of the  museum directors see additional value in enhancing the relationship  between the Board and the advisory boards. Negative effects of the  current relationship described by several advisory board chairs or  museum directors included concerns that the Board\u2019s lack of  understanding of individual museums, research centers, and programs  reduces the Board\u2019s ability to effectively oversee the prioritizing of the  Smithsonian\u2019s budget, limits the effectiveness of the Smithsonian\u2019s  fundraising efforts, and limits the Board\u2019s ability to articulate a unifying  vision for the Smithsonian to strengthen its mission and better leverage its  future potential. According to Smithsonian officials, the Chair of  Smithsonian\u2019s National Board, which is a Smithsonian-wide advisory  board, attends all Board meetings and to the extent that advisory boards  interact with the National Board, is therefore an existing vehicle for  communication between advisory boards and regents. However, most of  the advisory board chairs we spoke with did not think that the National  Board Chair served as a liaison between the advisory boards and the  Board of Regents.", "The Smithsonian has taken some steps to rethink this relationship. In  January 2008, the National Board changed the agenda of an annual  meeting to which it invites all advisory board chairs to include roundtable  discussions, a luncheon with the Acting Secretary, and a presentation by a  regent. According to Smithsonian officials and the two advisory board  chairs we spoke with about this meeting, the meeting was positive.  However, the two advisory board chairs we spoke to stated that the  meeting focused on enhancing the relationship among advisory boards  rather than on what they saw as a remaining need to enhance the  engagement of the regents with the advisory boards and the museums,  research centers, or programs they represent. Going forward, according to  a Smithsonian official, Office of the Regents\u2019 staff will attend business  meetings of the advisory boards to serve as direct liaisons to those boards  and the regents.", "Four organizations we spoke with that have undergone governance  reforms and that, like the Smithsonian, have a structure that includes a  number of units, described to us various models they have developed to  engage their advisory boards and obtain their input. For example, the  United Way of America, which in reforming its governance in 2000 moved  away from having members of a number of local affiliates as board  members, now has a council of its chapter boards that provides advice to  the chief executive officer and whose concerns are communicated to the  board at an annual meeting. The American Red Cross holds an annual  convention at which its chapter boards may interact with its governing  board. American University has representatives from different  constituents provide input to board committees. These representatives  also may attend board meetings. After its governance reforms, the J. Paul  Getty Trust, a much smaller organization, increased communication  between its board and the four unit heads by inviting them to attend and  participate in board meetings. A noticeable similarity of the way that these  four organizations engage and obtain input from their constituent parts is  that they all have a mechanism whereby the governing board engages in  personal interaction with these constituent representatives on a regular  basis.", "Directors and advisory board chairs we spoke with had a variety of  suggestions for improving the relationship between the advisory boards  and the Board. Some suggestions sought to help regents thoroughly  understand each museum, research center, or program\u2014for example, by  having a regent serve on each advisory board or having a regent hold  regular discussions with the director or advisory board chair. Other  suggestions included inviting advisory board chairs to the Board\u2019s  meetings or having advisory board representation on the Board. Any  actions taken to improve the relationship between the Board and the  advisory boards will involve balancing the regents\u2019 time demands with  ensuring that the Board has a strong enough understanding and  relationship with the museums, research facilities, and programs it  governs to effectively prioritize the Smithsonian\u2019s budget, encourage  fundraising efforts, and strengthen the Smithsonian\u2019s mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Plans for Annual Public Meeting and Communication Strategy Are Not Fully Implemented", "paragraphs": ["The Board is currently developing a plan for an annual public meeting to  enable interested stakeholders to address information and make inquiries  directly to the Board.

Originally planned for June 2008, the Board\u2019s Chief of Staff told us that, as  of May 2008, plans have not yet been fully developed and, because the new  Secretary\u2019s term begins on July 1, the Board plans to hold the public  meeting after the new Secretary has begun his service, at either the  Board\u2019s September 2008 or November 2008 meeting.

The Governance Committee\u2019s report  directed that the communication strategy be modeled after best practices  in the federal government, nonprofit organizations, and universities. The  Governance Committee\u2019s recommendations for the communication  strategy appear to be in line with practices we have identified for federal  agencies undergoing major transformations. For example, the  Governance Committee recommended that the strategy include (1)  mechanisms to foster communication between and among senior  management and regents, staff, and other stakeholders; (2) a framework to  ensure effective congressional outreach and information; and (3) a plan to  ensure all stakeholder constituencies are routinely informed of important  decisions and have opportunity to provide comments or information to the  Board and management. Our work similarly suggests that an effective  communication plan should reach out to all employees, customers, and  stakeholders and seek to genuinely engage them; communication should  facilitate a two-way exchange of information; and it is important for  feedback from stakeholders to be considered, and appropriate actions  made in response and progress reported.", "Originally scheduled to be complete in December 2007, the Smithsonian\u2019s  communication strategy was finalized and approved by the Board on May  5, 2008. Because this effort is not yet fully implemented, we were not able  to assess the communication strategy in its entirety, and it remains to be  seen how effective the communication strategy will be. However, the team  has taken a number of steps thus far. For example, the team has defined  stakeholders, analyzed existing communication processes, performed  broad stakeholder surveys and analyses, and developed a communication  plan. Officials told us that among issues the team is still considering is  what information stakeholders most need. The team also is seeking to  avoid duplication of efforts; for example, where there are already multiple  avenues for receiving information, the team will consider whether tools  such as a hotline or a public ombudsman are necessary.

While we did not  evaluate the effectiveness of governance reforms at comparable  organizations, many have highlighted the importance of clearly delineating  roles and expectations of regents and of holding regents accountable for  their individual performance. For instance, American Red Cross  emphasized how this process of clarification has helped to create a culture  of accountability among its board members, resulting in greater vigilance  in their oversight activities.

Congressional regents have not been  expected to chair committees, and some have not served on committees in  the past. Furthermore, the Vice President, an ex-officio regent, has not  participated in any Board meetings. However, according to the General  Counsel, the regents are charged with a sole trust responsibility: to  increase and diffuse knowledge among mankind. In discharging that  responsibility, all regents are subject to the same fiduciary duties as other  trustees: loyalty, prudence, and due care. The IRC recommended that  congressional and citizen regents should accept a fiduciary relationship  with the institution and devote the requisite time to carry out those duties.

In creating this expanded  role for liaisons in the functioning of the Board, it will be important for the  Board to clearly delineate what is expected of regent liaisons. The Board  has not changed the role or expectations of the Vice President as a  member of the Board, but sees value in retaining representation from the  executive branch.", "Once the Board finalizes the expectations regarding the duties and  responsibilities of its regents, a revised set of written roles and  responsibilities will be included in the orientation program that is still  under development.

The  BoardSource report also noted the need and potential for adding  additional committees, and suggested enhancing the current committee  structure by creating a committee on resource development to  demonstrate the Board\u2019s commitment to obtaining appropriate resources  beyond federal allocations. The report also suggested establishing a  strategic planning committee to lead the Smithsonian through the strategic  planning process that would identify programmatic and fundraising goals.

Nonregents are currently recruited and vetted through informal channels.  For example, regents may reach out within their particular field or  professional network for recommendations or referrals for experts in a  particular discipline. The full Board then approves the appointment of  nonregents. According to the Chief of Staff to the Board, the Governance  and Nominating Committee is considering policies and processes  regarding the use of nonregents.

The BoardSource report  reinforced these concerns and found that the statutorily required structure  and composition of the Board can, in fact, create limitations for the Board  with regard to evenly spreading its workload, and adding a diversity of  skills and expertise. Furthermore, the Board has no authority in recruiting  and appointing congressional and ex-officio regents, which can limit its  ability to add needed expertise within its current structure. Our analysis of  the criteria developed for citizen regents finds that the criteria are  consistent with current accepted practices, and include such things as  whether individuals can serve in leadership roles, whether they have well- rounded experience in multiple fields, and whether they have specific  expertise needed on the Board and are appropriate for the Smithsonian\u2019s  specific needs.

In theory, boards with ex-officio and other  governmental members can still be effective, but their effectiveness  depends on having clear and specific expectations of the level of  commitment and contribution board members can realistically make.  Moreover, some experts we interviewed held the view that major  structural changes may not be the most effective approach when  considering governance reform, and that there is some evidence\u2014though  not conclusive\u2014that reforms aimed at changing the \u201cculture\u201d of a board to  be more participatory and accountable are ultimately more effective at  improving governance. The J. Paul Getty Trust, which, according to  officials, faced many of the same issues regarding inadequate oversight of  executive compensation and expenses, did not make significant structural  changes to its board, but rather focused on instilling a culture of  accountability. Although we did not assess the effectiveness of their  reforms, officials involved with the board indicated that these changes  resulted in major improvements from their perspective with regard to their  board\u2019s engagement and accountability.", "According to the Chief of Staff to the Board, the Board expects that  further clarification of duties and expectations of all regents\u2014such as  increasing the participation level of congressional regents in committees  and distributing the workload equally among the citizen and congressional  regents\u2014and increased use of nonregents to address the need for diverse  expertise and skills in committees will adequately address the major  governance issues regarding size and structure facing the Board.  Furthermore, as previously mentioned in this report, staff liaisons for  congressional regents\u2014who, according to the BoardSource report and to  regents we interviewed, have been viewed as an important conduit for the  congressional regents to keep them abreast of the activities of the Board\u2014 also are envisioned to play a greater role in assisting congressional  members in taking on more responsibilities. However, these changes have  just been instituted, and thus it remains to be seen whether the Board\u2019s  actions will be sufficient to ensure that all regents are fully engaged and  held accountable for fulfilling their roles and expectations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Assessment Process Needed to Ensure Accountability of Board Members and Committees Is Under Development", "paragraphs": ["The Board is in the process of developing a self-assessment process to  examine its performance, which is not expected to be finalized and  implemented until June 2008. Previously, the Board lacked a formal and  regular assessment of its performance to determine its effectiveness in  governance and oversight of Smithsonian management. Our review of  standards of practice for nonprofit boards indicates that implementing a  regular and consistent self-assessment process is critical to improving  individual performance and contribution to a governing board. If a board  does not assess its performance, it is missing a key opportunity for input  from its own members for improving its operations and governance  policies. A self-assessment of the board, committees, and individual  members enables a board to identify areas for improvement in the board\u2019s  operating procedures, its committee structure, and its governance  practices.", "The Board has drafted a self-assessment questionnaire to facilitate the  evaluation process and help the Board understand what it does well and  what needs to improve. However, the draft questionnaire does not fully  address evaluation of performance against the full range of regent  expectations, such as the Board\u2019s role in the Smithsonian\u2019s strategic  planning process. The self-assessment process will need to be further  developed to reflect changes to expectations for congressional regents and  their liaisons. According to the Chief of Staff to the Board, the Board is  currently considering changes to the draft assessment tool to reflect these  concerns.", "Other organizations go beyond self-assessments and can remove board  members whose performance is inadequate or not up to expectations. For  instance, American University told us that its Board of Trustees conducts  an individual and peer assessment every 3 years (board members have 3- year terms), at the conclusion of a member\u2019s term, before reappointment.  Board members whose terms are up for renewal complete a self-  assessment form, and their colleagues on the board also assess the board  members\u2019 performance, using a different assessment form. If a board  member has not performed up to expectations, he or she will not be  nominated for re-election. A similar practice was instituted at the United  Way of America in its governance reform, where officials told us there  have been cases where a board member was removed because the  member was not attending meetings and fulfilling board duties and  obligations. In other organizations, boards retain the authority to remove  board members for cause. For example, the board of the Legal Services  Corporation, which is a federally chartered nonprofit organization  consisting of 11 bipartisan board members, has the authority to remove its  members for cause, such as persistent neglect of duties, by a vote of at  least 7 members. While board members are appointed by the President  with the advice and consent of the Senate, neither the President nor the  Senate has the power to remove the Legal Services Corporation board  members.", "Although the Smithsonian Governance and Nominating Committee can  examine and determine the level of interest of a regent in continuing his or  her service and weigh the interest of other regents before calling on a vote  for the regent\u2019s renomination, the Board has no authority to remove  regents for cause, such as persistent neglect of duties during a regent\u2019s  term. The Smithsonian\u2019s General Counsel told us that the Board itself  cannot remove regents\u2014only Congress can take action to remove a  regent. In our interviews with Smithsonian officials, it is unclear what  actions the Board could or would take in the event of persistent neglect of  duties by any of its regents. Removal of a regent has occurred at least once  in the history of the Smithsonian, but not in recent memory. It remains to  be seen how the Board will proceed with its self-assessment process, and  a key challenge for the Board will be how to hold all regents accountable  for individual performance. Moreover, no mechanism is planned to  evaluate the implementation and effectiveness of the governance reforms  after enough time has passed for the Smithsonian to operate in a fully  reformed environment.", "Literature we reviewed indicated that while self assessments are valuable  and important, they are limited to the views of those being surveyed, and a  governing board should occasionally solicit the viewpoints of stakeholders  and others close to the governance process to continuously search for  ways to improve. Another approach to performance assessment is bringing  in outside consultants to interview board members and present results.  Current practices include appointing an independent task force or  commission to interview board officers and others in an institution every  few years concerning the board\u2019s strengths and weaknesses, and what the  board could do to empower staff and advisory boards to fulfill their  responsibilities more effectively. One governance expert we interviewed  commented that boards undergoing governance reform should undertake  a thorough, independent, postgovernance reform review to evaluate the  effectiveness of governance changes. Although most of the organizations  we spoke with that have recently undergone governance reform have not  yet performed a comprehensive, postgovernance reform assessment,  American University officials told us that the university is planning to  conduct a review of its governance reform in a 5-year period to assess  whether its governance practices and structure are effective. Given the  extent and pace of changes occurring at the Smithsonian, as well as other  transformations of the institution, including the hiring of a new Secretary  and significant reforms to SBV, among other things, it is likely that many  governance reforms will not be completely implemented for some time,  and the effectiveness of some reforms will only be evident over a longer  period of implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Smithsonian Institution relies significantly on funding from taxpayers  and donors, and as such, effective governance and accountability are key  to maintaining trust and credibility. Governance and accountability  breakdowns can result in a lack of trust from donors, grantors, and  appropriators, which could ultimately put funding and the organization\u2019s  credibility at risk. The Smithsonian\u2019s Board of Regents has taken many  steps to implement governance reforms since June 2007 to address several  of the problems that led to the incidents that caused concern about  governance and accountability. The Board has reformed executive  compensation and benefits, initiated reviews of the Smithsonian\u2019s policies  and internal controls, enhanced the access of key stakeholders to the  Board, increased transparency, and clarified the roles and responsibilities  of regents.", "We acknowledge and recognize the efforts that have been made by the  Board and Smithsonian staff in confronting these governance issues.  However, we also note that there are some areas where reforms have yet  to be developed, or where improvements to the transparency and  accountability mechanisms of the Board could be taken further. For  example, reforms related to enhancing the Board\u2019s relationships with  important stakeholders, including museum advisory boards and the public,  remain under consideration, and current efforts have yet to fully develop  mechanisms by which the Board can receive and consider unfiltered,  needed information from these stakeholders on a regular basis. Without  such mechanisms, these efforts may not have the desired impact of  creating an environment for governance that is inclusive of the broad  diversity of activities and viewpoints of stakeholders within and outside of  the Smithsonian. Furthermore, while the Board is still considering how it  can best recruit and use nonregent experts\u2014potentially using advisory  board members\u2014there is currently little transparency as to how  nonregent experts on committees are to be selected, used, or evaluated.  Moreover, while the Board has made strides in defining and refining the  roles and responsibilities of regents, it remains unclear what actions the  Board can take to hold its regents and their liaisons accountable in the  event that they do not fulfill their roles and expectations. Finally, while the  Board and the Smithsonian as a whole are currently focused on extensive  governance reforms, and the Board is tracking the implementation of  these reforms through a scorecard that is posted on the Smithsonian\u2019s  Web site and updated monthly, no mechanism is planned to evaluate the  implementation and effectiveness of these reforms after enough time has  passed for the Smithsonian to operate in a fully reformed environment.
