Moreover, to gauge and ensure the success of these programs, the Congress and agencies need several kinds of information. First, they need to know which specific program approaches or models are most effective and the circumstances in which they are effective. They also need to know if individual programs are working nationwide. In addition, they need to be able to look across all programs that are designed to help a given target group to see if individual programs are working efficiently together and whether the federal effort is working effectively overall. We believe closely examining these multiple education programs is definitely needed. The current situation has created the potential for inefficient service and reduced overall effectiveness. Basic information about programs and program results is lacking, and we face many challenges in obtaining this important information.

Thirteen federal departments and agencies administered these programs and received about $2.3 billion. In addition, the same department or agency administered many programs providing similar services.

Furthermore, many individual programs funded multiple services: about 63 percent of the programs funded four or more services each in 1996, according to our review.", "We also examined programs that provide teacher training. For this target group, multiple federal programs exist in a number of federal agencies. For example, the federal government funded at least 86 teacher training programs in fiscal year 1993 in nine federal agencies and offices.

Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act is the largest federal elementary and secondary education grant program. It has received much attention recently because of an Education Department report showing that, overall, title I programs do not ultimately reduce the effect of poverty on a student\u2019s achievement. For example, children in high-poverty schools began school academically behind their peers in low-poverty schools and could not close this gap as they progressed through school. In addition, when assessed according to high academic standards, most title I students failed to exhibit the reading and mathematics skills expected for their respective grade levels. The study concluded that students in high-poverty schools were the least able to demonstrate the expected levels of academic proficiency. strategies in several areas: school violence, substance abuse prevention,and school-to-work transition.

Although the number of schools is too small for conclusive generalizations, the study described the characteristics of these schools as \u201cfood for thought\u201d for future research on successful programs. These schools had an experienced principal; low teacher and pupil turnover; an emphasis on schoolwide efforts that seek to raise the achievement of every student; a greater use of tracking by student ability; a balanced emphasis on remedial and higher order thinking in classroom involvement; and higher parent support and expectations than low-performing, high-poverty schools."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significant Information Gaps", "paragraphs": ["Significant information gaps exist, however, about both programs and their outcomes.

Agencies face the challenge of balancing the flexibility block grants afford states to set priorities on the basis of local need with their own need to hold states accountable for achieving federal goals. For example, the Safe and Drug-Free Schools program allows a wide range of activities and permits states to define the information they collect on program activities and effectiveness. With no requirement that states use consistent measures, the Department faces a difficult challenge in assembling the triennial state reports to develop a nationwide picture of the program\u2019s effectiveness.", "One promising strategy as an alternative to traditional block grants is the use of Performance Partnership Grants (PPG).

Towards this end, in fiscal year 1997, the Department of Education was appropriated about $400 million for educational research and improvement. Education estimates an additional $367 million was obligated by the Department for information technology for Department operations.", "In addition, evaluation research is costly. For example, in fiscal year 1993, the Department awarded 38 contracts totaling more than $20 million for evaluating elementary and secondary education programs. Contract amounts ranged from $38,000 to fund a program improvement conference to $6.8 million for implementing the chapter 1 longitudinal study (Prospects). But this accounted for only 1 year of this multiyear study: this longitudinal study to assess the impact of significant participation in title I programs on student and young adult outcomes cost about $25 million over a 4-year period. The median cost for an evaluation contract was about $180,000 in fiscal year 1993.", "In our testimony last spring on challenges facing the Department of Education, we noted that the Department needed more information to determine how its programs are working and that additional departmental resources may be needed to manage funds and provide information and technical assistance. For example, title I is intended to promote access to and equity in education for low-income students. The Congress modified the program in 1994, strengthening its accountability provisions and encouraging the concentration of funds to serve more disadvantaged children. At this time, however, the Department does not have the information it needs to determine whether the funding is being targeted as intended. Although the Department has asked for $10 million in its fiscal year 1998 budget request to evaluate the impact of title I, it has only just begun a small study of selected school districts to examine targeting to identify any necessary mid-course modifications.

Each of the tasks involved\u2014measuring outcomes, ensuring the consistency and quality of data collected at various sites, establishing the causal connection between outcomes and program activities, and distinguishing the influence of extraneous factors\u2014raises formidable technical or logistical problems. Thus, evaluating program impact generally requires a planned study and, often, considerable time and expense. Program features affect the relative difficulty of getting reliable impact information. The more varied the program activities and the less direct the connection between the provider and the federal agency, the greater the difficulty of getting comparable, reliable data on clients and services. For example, a federal agency whose own employees deliver a specified service can probably obtain impact data more easily than one that administers grants that states then pass on to several local entities to be used different ways. Also, due to the absence of contrasting comparison groups, it is extremely difficult to estimate the impact of a long-standing program that covers all eligible participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Federal Programs Managed by Different Agencies", "paragraphs": ["The sheer number of departments and agencies that spend federal education dollars makes it hard to aggregate existing information among federal programs for certain issues or target groups.

Yet this is just 1 of the 127 programs administered by 15 agencies that target at-risk and delinquent youth.

Other elements are the expanded Chief Financial Officers Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. These laws each responded to a need for accurate, reliable information for executive branch and congressional decision-making. In combination, they provide a framework for developing (1) fully integrated information about an agency\u2019s mission and strategic priorities, (2) performance data for evaluating the achievement of these goals, (3) the relationship of information technology investments to meeting performance goals, and (4) accurate and audited financial information about the costs of meeting the goals.", "GPRA requires that agencies clearly define their missions, establish long-term strategic goals as well as annual goals linked to them, measure their performance according to the goals they have set, and report on their progress. In addition to ongoing performance monitoring, agencies are also expected to perform discrete evaluations of their programs and to use information obtained from these evaluations to improve their programs. Agencies are also expected to closely coordinate with other federal agencies whose programs contribute to similar results to ensure that goals are consistent and, as appropriate, that program efforts are mutually reinforcing. Each agency was required to submit to OMB and the Congress a strategic plan explaining its mission, long-term goals, and strategies for meeting these goals by September 30, 1997, and the Department of Education did so. needed to meet any unmet goals.

GPRA provides an incentive for agency and program personnel to systematically assess their programs and identify and adapt successful practices of similar programs. The act also provides an early warning system for identifying goals and objectives that are not being met so that agency and program staff can replace ineffective practices with effective ones.", "The act\u2019s emphasis on coordination among similar programs and linking results to funding also provides a way to better understand the overall effect of federal activities and to identify programs that might be abolished, expanded, or consolidated with others. If agencies and OMB use the annual planning process to highlight crosscutting program issues, the individual agency performance plans and the governmentwide performance plan should provide the Congress with the information needed to identify agencies and programs addressing similar missions. Once these programs are identified, the Congress can consider the associated policy, management, and performance implications of crosscutting program issues. This information should also help identify the performance and cost consequences of program fragmentation and the implications of alternative policy and service delivery options. These options, in turn, can lead to decisions about department and agency missions and allocating resources among those missions.", "Achieving the full potential of GPRA is a particularly difficult challenge because of the multiple programs and many departments involved in the federal effort to improve public K-12 education. Meanwhile, this challenge\u2014combined with the current limited data available about the programs and their effectiveness\u2014is precisely why GPRA is needed.
