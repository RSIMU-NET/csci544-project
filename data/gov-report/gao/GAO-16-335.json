Ore is the principal  raw material from which tantalum is derived, and can be mined through  industrial operations which may be mechanized or through artisanal  mining operations, which are characterized by a lack of mechanization.  The ore is further processed into tantalum concentrate by physically  removing unwanted materials. Tantalum is also derived from synthetic  concentrates, where tantalum is extracted from slags, for example, from  processing tin concentrates or other forms of industrial processing.", "These concentrates can be chemically processed into tantalum salts,  tantalum oxides, or other marketable tantalum materials such as tantalum  powder, metal, and alloys, which are then further manufactured into end- products.

USGS country  and mineral commodity specialists annually survey foreign governments  on the production of tantalum from mining, gather data and information  from in-country visits, and review mineral reporting provided by  embassies and industry sources to estimate tantalum production. USGS  officials told us that while the quality of the data provided by foreign  governments can vary widely, its specialists use their expertise with a  mineral commodity or country to estimate production even if the data are  incomplete or questionable.

As discussed previously, USGS has  documented procedures to validate its data and DLA-Strategic Materials  officials identified additional steps they take to ensure that data are  reliable, consistent with Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government and other guidelines. For example, DLA-Strategic  Materials officials said that their material specialists coordinate closely  with USGS commodity and country specialists to verify data sources,  such as whether production data are from USGS surveys or mining  publications, and to determine how missing or incomplete data have been  accounted for in its reports. Moreover, DLA-Strategic Materials officials  told us they check USGS calculations and unit conversions to ensure  accuracy prior to sending the data to the Institute for Defense Analyses,  the federally funded research center responsible for the model used to  perform the stockpile analysis.

In accordance with the Stockpiling Act, DLA- Strategic Materials reports its findings of potential shortfalls of materials in  the Stockpile Report every two years. In its 2015 report, tantalum was  among over 90 materials assessed for a potential shortfall. Additionally,  from 2011 through 2015 DLA-Strategic Materials identified potential  shortfalls for tantalum. Since 2013, it has recommended stockpiling  various amounts of tantalum. For example, in its 2013 Stockpile Report,  DLA-Strategic Materials reported a shortfall for tantalum of 623,307  pounds, and DLA-Strategic Materials subsequently recommended  stockpiling 187,000 pounds of tantalum divided evenly over a four-year  period along with other mitigation strategies to address the estimated  shortfall. In May 2015, subsequent to issuing the 2015 Stockpile Report,  DLA-Strategic Materials was provided with updated primary tantalum  production data from USGS that revised the supply of tantalum upward,  reducing the estimated shortfall. However, based on historical and  consistent shortfalls as well as the United States\u2019 reliance on foreign  sources, DLA-Strategic Materials officials told us they plan to continue to  seek legislative authority to stockpile tantalum. Table 3 identifies the  reported tantalum shortfalls in DOD\u2019s Stockpile Report from 2011 to 2015  and recommended stockpiling actions.", "DLA-Strategic Materials uses a repeatable three-step process to identify  potential shortfalls for materials during national emergency scenarios.", "In the first step, DLA-Strategic Materials identifies materials to assess  and establishes data requirements needed for the shortfall  assessments. DLA-Strategic Materials monitors a \u201cwatch list\u201d of over  160 materials, which includes tantalum, that are of interest to the  defense community. DLA-Strategic Materials then narrows the watch  list to a smaller number of materials using an internal ranking system  where additional weight is given to risks associated with heavy  reliance on foreign sources of supply and single points of failure along  the supply chain, among others.  In the second step, DLA-Strategic Materials determines whether  material shortfalls exist in the context of national emergency  scenarios. A component of this step is to estimate the global supply of  tantalum available for United States civilian and defense needs. To  estimate available supply, DLA-Strategic Materials and the Institute  for Defense Analyses rely on country reliability assessments, as well  as the specific assumptions of the national emergency scenarios, to  decrement foreign production during a conflict. DLA-Strategic  Materials receives inputs from the intelligence community for the  country reliability assessments and officials told us they may \u201czero  out\u201d a country\u2019s supply as part of their analyses if that country is  deemed to be unreliable under the assumptions of the national  emergency scenario. Because USGS production data is country- based, DLA-Strategic Materials can apply the assumptions of the  national emergency scenario and country reliability assessments to  decrement those amounts.  In the third step of the process, DLA-Strategic Materials decides what  mitigation strategies are appropriate to reduce any identified  shortfalls, which may include recommendations to stockpile the  material. For example, when a shortfall estimate is initially generated,  DLA-Strategic Materials will determine whether mitigating options,  such as substitution, reducing exports, or additional purchases of a  material are sufficient to eliminate the shortfall. If mitigating options  are not sufficient to eliminate the shortfall, the result is a net shortfall  and DLA-Strategic Materials may decide to recommend a stockpiling  action for that material.

For example, the USGS reported that unlike  other materials and precious metals, tantalum concentrates are not  publicly traded through commodities exchanges. Rather the material is  bought and sold through networks of dealers and on contract between  producers and consumers, some of whom may not provide accurate  statistical data. Further, according to industry officials, artisanal mining,  which is difficult to quantify in USGS reporting, may account for a  significant portion of global tantalum production. In addition, industry  officials commented that some artisanal mining production may enter the  supply chain labeled as scrap to disguise its origin. While DLA-Strategic  Materials officials told us that some of these concerns are not unique to  tantalum, they said the lack of transparent tantalum supply data affects  their ability to collect complete information to inform the stockpile  analysis. Given the above challenges, officials from DOD, USGS, and  industry acknowledged that tantalum has an \u201copaque\u201d supply chain,  making it difficult to collect more accurate data.", "Recognizing these challenges, DLA-Strategic Materials is taking  additional steps to inform its analysis of tantalum availability. For  example, DLA-Strategic Materials has requested that the Institute for  Defense Analyses perform additional work on materials of interest. In  2013, the Institute for Defense Analyses completed a review that  identified weaknesses in the supply chain for processed tantalum used in  some defense applications. Further the Stockpiling Act permits DOD to  identify materials requiring further study. According to the 2015  Stockpile Report, significant reliance on foreign sources or a single point  of failure is the main basis for additional study, but other reasons, such as  a net shortfall or the potential for supply chain disruption can also result in  additional research into a material. Under this authority, DLA-Strategic  Materials said they are conducting research into whether certain  materials, such as tantalum, could be recovered through recycling of  manufactured materials.", "Moreover, citing concerns about differences in tantalum data reported by  USGS and industry sources, DOD\u2019s 2015 Stockpile Report noted that  DLA-Strategic Materials will be comparing data and performing additional  analyses on these two sources in advance of their 2017 report. DOD\u2019s  efforts to review industry data were ongoing during our review, but  officials noted several limitations to TIC data. For example, as discussed  above, the TIC\u2019s data is not reported by country, which limits its use in  support of the National Defense Stockpile analyses. Further, DLA- Strategic Materials officials told us they are uncertain about what portion  of the industry is covered by TIC\u2019s reporting members, or how accurate  the data are since there may be incentives for members to over- or under- report. Given these concerns, DLA-Strategic Materials officials identified  several potential next steps they are considering upon completing their  review of the TIC data. For example, officials said they could use the data  as a complementary source to inform their review of USGS mine  production data, similar to DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 use of Roskill  Information Services market report data. Additionally, officials told us  that given the challenges of collecting accurate and reliable tantalum  data, they may consider running two sets of analyses for tantalum in  future stockpile reports\u2014one using only USGS data and another that  includes industry data estimates. In addition to their review of TIC\u2019s data,  DLA-Strategic Materials is also in the process of compiling its own  estimates for the supply of tantalum derived from slag, scrap, and  recycled tantalum based on data and interviews with various sources,  including USGS, Roskill Information Services, and tantalum processing  companies.

We assessed the reliability of USGS  data by (1) reviewing existing information about the data and the system  that produced them, and (2) interviewing agency officials knowledgeable  about the data. USGS takes steps to collect and confirm production  estimates for use in their publications such as the Mineral Commodity  Summaries and the Minerals Yearbook. Based on our review of the data  and interviews with USGS and DOD we determined that USGS data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To assess the processes used by  USGS to ensure the reliability of its data, we obtained USGS  Fundamental Science Practices and Statistical Standards and discussed  how those practices are implemented in the reviews of data to be  published in USGS publications. In addition, due to differences in data  collection and reporting methods, USGS and industry tantalum data are  not directly comparable and, therefore, we do not compare supply  estimates from these sources for the purpose of this report. We use the  information to demonstrate differences between industry and USGS data  and collection methods.", "For industry, we met with officials from the TIC, Roskill Information  Services Ltd., Commerce Resources Corporation, and Global Advanced  Metals. To the extent possible we confirmed types of information  provided by the TIC by comparing it to published reports. We examined  quarterly reports showing tantalum supply and discussed the types of  data collected and reported and the processes used to assess reliability.  However, based on our review of the process for collecting the data and  assessing the reliability of the data provided by the members and on  interviews with industry officials, we determined that the industry supply  numbers were self-reported, but not verified, and, therefore, not  sufficiently reliable for direct comparison to USGS data. Therefore, we did  not compare USGS and industry figures for this report.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has evaluated the availability of  tantalum during national defense emergency planning scenarios, we  obtained and analyzed information in reports prepared by DLA-Strategic  Materials for DOD\u2019s Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics including the Stockpile Reports  from 2011 through 2015 and the Annual Industrial Capabilities Reports to  Congress. We met with officials from DLA-Strategic Materials and the  Institute for Defense Analyses, the federally funded research center that  assists with the stockpile analysis, to determine what steps were taken to  assess the reliability of data used in the assessment process and mitigate  risk. We obtained and examined DLA-Strategic Materials\u2019 proposed  Annual Materials Plans for fiscal years 2015 through 2017. We reviewed  relevant legislation, regulations, and policy including:  the Strategic and Critical Materials Stock Piling Act (50 U.S.C. \u00a7 98 et  seq.); provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer  Protection Act (Pub. L. No. 111-203 \u00a71502; policy documents from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics concerning determining  potential shortfalls and the organizational structure for executing the  provisions of the Stockpiling Act.", "We reviewed DLA-Strategic Materials data used in the assessments and  documentation of the steps they took to assure data reliability. To  determine the extent to which DOD has assessed the availability of  tantalum during specific national defense emergency scenarios as part of  the National Defense Stockpile\u2019s biennial requirements assessment  process, we reviewed the interagency support agreement between USGS  and DLA-Strategic Materials. To understand the data and support USGS  provides DLA-Strategic Materials, we reviewed the worldwide USGS  production data provided to DLA-Strategic Materials for its assessment.  We reviewed DOD reports to understand the analyses DOD had  conducted to identify risks related to the availability of tantalum. Further,  we met with officials from USGS, DLA-Strategic Materials, and with  analysts from the Institute for Defense Analyses. We discussed sources  of tantalum supply with industry representatives to determine what other  sources of tantalum supply data are available and the general reliability of  such data. We obtained documentation on the model DLA-Strategic  Materials uses to conduct its stockpile analysis including the categories of  information considered by the model to determine potential shortfalls and  provide support for recommending stockpiling amounts.", "In addition, we interviewed DOD officials from the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics and DLA-Strategic  Materials about actions underway to increase the accuracy of the data  reported in the Stockpile Report. We obtained and analyzed such  documentation as was available about proposed and ongoing actions to  improve the reliability and accuracy of tantalum data. We assessed  DOD\u2019s policies, procedures, and practices against criteria in applicable  statutes, Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, and  GAO\u2019s Framework for Assessing the Acquisition Functions at Federal  Agencies.", "We determined whether or not documentation for the determination of  reliability of the data used in the DLA-Strategic Materials model was  provided but did not assess the adequacy of the information provided. We  interviewed officials from USGS and DLA-Strategic Materials to clarify the  issues. We concluded that the data had been collected and used in  accordance with principles developed by USGS and DLA-Strategic  Materials and were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of obtaining an  understanding of the process used to collect the data, the model for  determining potential shortfalls of material, and the reports produced by  DLA-Strategic Materials.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2015 to March 2016 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Penny Berrier, Assistant Director;  Marie Ahearn; Pedro Almoguera; John Beauchamp; Stephanie  Gustafson; Jeffrey Harner; Mathew Jacobs; Carol Mebane; Jean  McSween; Meghan Perez; Katrina Pekar-Carpenter; and Roxanna Sun  made significant contributions to this review."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
