In their most recent grant competitions, states awarded 21st Century funds to nearly 2,400 organizations\u2014including school districts and community-based organizations\u2014based on a variety of criteria, such as the quality of their proposed program designs. Relevant research we reviewed that compared program participants to those of non-participants suggests that the 21st Century program is effective in improving students' behavioral outcomes, such as school-day attendance and reduced disciplinary incidents, more often than their academic outcomes. However, because Education's current 21st Century performance measures primarily focus on students' reading and math scores on state tests, Education lacks useful data about whether the program is achieving its objectives to improve students' behavioral outcomes such as attendance and discipline\u2014the areas where the program most frequently has a positive effect.

About a third of states reported in GAO's 50-state survey that they face challenges in evaluating program performance, such as difficulty designing evaluations that shed light on program effects. Further, the 21st Century program was reauthorized twice, which resulted in significant changes to state requirements for evaluating programs. However, Education has not provided states written guidance on developing and conducting high-quality evaluations since 1999. Federal standards for internal control state that when significant changes occur agencies should periodically review policies for continued relevance and effectiveness in achieving their objectives.

To answer all four  research questions, we reviewed Education documents, including annual  performance reports, studies, and budget justifications; and federal laws,  regulations, and policies. We also interviewed Education officials and  other researchers on the 21st Century program. To assess the reliability  of federal 21st Century program data underlying Education\u2019s annual  performance reports and studies, we conducted electronic data tests, reviewed relevant documents, and interviewed agency officials. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also conducted a Web-based survey of 21st Century state coordinators  from the 50 states and the District of Columbia and received responses  from 100 percent of the coordinators. We analyzed responses to survey  questions as well as additional comments state coordinators provided in  response to open-ended questions. In addition, we interviewed state  officials responsible for administering the 21st Century program in four  states: Idaho, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Texas; and we  observed activities and interviewed staff at two to four 21st Century  centers in each of those states.

To identify relevant state-level evaluations, we took a two- pronged approach. First, we reviewed state evaluations that Education  determined in a 2012 report on 21st Century program state evaluation  practices (the most recent available Education report on this topic) to  have used quasi-experimental methods or statistical controls, such as a  comparison group, to account for other plausible influences on the  outcomes reported. We then interviewed researchers to identify other  quasi-experimental state evaluations published since 2012, and we  reviewed them for the soundness of their methodology and data.  Ultimately, we determined that four state evaluations were appropriate to  address our research objective about the 21st Century program\u2019s  effectiveness. Second, we conducted a comprehensive literature review  of 104 other studies of afterschool programs, including the 21st Century  program. We ultimately determined that six studies were sufficiently  rigorous and appropriately scoped to include in our review, including three  meta-analyses that synthesized a broad array of studies on the outcomes  of afterschool programs in general, including the 21st Century program.

According to Education\u2019s 2003 guidance, academic  enrichment can include tutoring in core academic subjects and providing  extra learning opportunities so that students can practice their academic  skills through hands-on activities. The 2014 annual report also found that  many centers supported building students\u2019 academic skills in reading and  math as well as in the arts, science, technology, cultural activities, and  health. Further, at least two states gathered information on the time spent  on specific activities as part of their state 21st Century program  evaluations. In New Jersey, for example, a 2015 state evaluation  examined time spent by students on specific 21st Century activities,  including academic improvement/remediation, tutoring, academic  enrichment, community service, and recreation. Of these, academic  improvement/remediation was the activity on which students spent the  most time.

In  addition, they said they were reluctant to revise the measures given the  costs to states of tracking and reporting on new measures, as well as  concerns about maintaining the continuity of data collected over time.  Education officials told us they may revise the program\u2019s performance  measures when they implement program changes pursuant to ESSA and  that in doing so, they will consider including additional behavioral  performance measures as well as socio-emotional measures.", "Education\u2019s lack of 21st Century performance measures for some key  program objectives, however, has limited the usefulness of its  performance data. Specifically, without measures for student behavioral  and socio-emotional outcomes, Education lacks useful data on the extent  to which the program is achieving its stated objectives, especially in areas  where the program is likely to have positive effects on student outcomes.  While about half of states reported they already measure at least one  behavioral or socio-emotional outcome, absent measures for all states,  Education will continue to report incomplete program results to Congress  and the public.

Although existing research on  effectiveness points to greater positive behavioral effects than academic  effects, Education\u2019s current performance measures do not address some  key behavioral outcomes. The lack of performances for behavioral  outcomes makes it difficult to determine whether the program is achieving  some of its stated objectives\u2014especially in areas where research has  shown that the program is likely to have the greatest effect on student  outcomes. Specifically, Education does not measure socio-emotional  outcomes or two other behavioral outcomes included in program  objectives: improved school-day attendance and discipline in the  classroom. Absent these performance measures, Education is missing an  opportunity to assess the full range of benefits of this program.", "In addition, Education has not sufficiently assessed the quality of its  program data, further limiting its ability to assess program effectiveness.  Another factor hindering the agency\u2019s ability to determine program  effectiveness is the significant difficulty that states are experiencing in  evaluating their programs.

Specifically, the  department stated that it is in the process of re-examining whether  additional or revised measures should be developed to align more  significantly with the program\u2019s statutory objectives under ESSA.   Education also acknowledged the need to develop measures that provide  sufficient information and data on program outcomes. As stated in our  draft report, the Department currently measures some student behavioral  outcomes; in its response, Education described one measure as: the  percentage of all program participants with teacher-reported  improvements in behavior. Therefore, we modified our recommendation  to focus on measuring the program\u2019s key behavioral outcomes. In its  response, Education also expressed concern about collecting data on  student attendance and disciplinary measures, noting that it will require  effective collaboration between states, districts, and other eligible entities.  However, as we stated in our report, about half of states already collect  data on at least one of these two measures. Further, as we stated,  research has shown that 21st Century programs more often have positive  effects on student attendance and reducing disciplinary incidents than on  improving students\u2019 academic outcomes.

Specifically, Education anticipates that new technology  enhancements in the data system will be designed to flag for  inconsistencies in data reporting. For example, the system may send a  \u201cflag\u201d that participation data is significantly lower or higher than previously  reported participation data.
