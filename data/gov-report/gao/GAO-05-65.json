The Veterans Millennium Health Care and Benefits Act (Millennium Act) of 1999 and VA policy require that VA provide nursing home care to veterans with a certain eligibility. Congress has expressed a need for additional data to conduct oversight of VA's nursing home program. Specifically, for all VA nursing home settings in fiscal year 2003, GAO was asked to report on (1) VA spending to provide or pay for nursing home care, (2) VA workload provided or paid for, (3) the percentage of nursing home care that is long and short stay, and (4) the percentage of veterans receiving care required by the Millennium Act or VA policy."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2003, VA spent 73 percent of its nursing home resources on VA nursing homes--almost $1.7 billion of about $2.3 billion--and the remaining 27 percent on community and state veterans' nursing homes. Half of VA's average daily nursing home workload of 33,214 in fiscal year 2003 was for state veterans' nursing homes, even though this setting accounted for 15 percent of VA's overall nursing home expenditures. In large part, this is because VA pays about one-third of the cost of care in state veterans' nursing homes. Community nursing homes and VA nursing homes accounted for 13 and 37 percent of the workload, respectively. About one-third of nursing home care in VA nursing homes in fiscal year 2003 was long-stay care (90 days or more). Long-stay services include those needed by veterans who cannot be cared for at home because of severe, chronic physical or mental impairments such as the inability to independently eat or the need for supervision because of dementia. The other two-thirds was short-stay care (less than 90 days), which includes services such as postacute care needed for recuperation from a stroke. VA lacks similar data for community and state veterans' nursing homes. About one-fourth of veterans who received care in VA nursing homes in fiscal year 2003 were served because the Millennium Act or VA policy requires that VA provide or pay for nursing home care of veterans with a certain eligibility. All other veterans received care at VA's discretion. VA lacks data on comparable eligibility status for community and state veterans' nursing homes even though these settings combined accounted for 63 percent of VA's overall workload.

Meeting veterans\u2019 nursing home care needs is a key issue  for VA because it has a large elderly veteran population, many of whom  are in need of such care. In 2003, 38 percent of the veteran population was  over the age of 65 compared to 12 percent for the overall population. VA  provides or pays for veterans\u2019 care in three nursing home settings. VA  operates its own nursing homes and also pays for nursing home care  under contract in non-VA nursing homes\u2014referred to as community  nursing homes. In addition, VA pays part of the cost of care for veterans at  state veterans\u2019 nursing homes and also pays a portion of the construction  costs for some state veterans\u2019 nursing homes. To enhance access to  veterans needing nursing home care across VA\u2019s health care system, an  independent commission recommended in February 2004 that VA develop  a strategic plan for long-term care that includes policies and strategies for  the delivery of nursing home care.", "In November 1999, the Congress passed the Veterans Millennium Health  Care and Benefits Act (Millennium Act), which required that through  December 31, 2003, VA provide nursing home care to those veterans with a  service-connected disability rated at 70 percent or greater, those requiring  nursing home care because of a condition related to their military service  who do not have a service-connected disability rating of 70 percent or  greater, and those who were admitted to VA nursing homes on or before  the effective date of the act. Subsequent law extended these provisions  through December 31, 2008. In addition, VA\u2019s policy on nursing home  eligibility required that networks provide nursing home care to veterans  with 60 percent service-connected disability ratings who also meet other  criteria. For all other veterans enrolled in its system, VA\u2019s policy on  nursing home eligibility is to provide nursing home care in VA nursing  homes and contract community nursing homes on a discretionary basis  depending on available resources, with certain patients having higher  priority, including veterans who require postacute care after a hospital  episode. Veterans can also choose to seek care in state veterans\u2019 nursing  homes and if admitted, VA pays a portion of the cost to treat them.", "The Committee has expressed a need for additional data in order to  conduct oversight of VA\u2019s nursing home program, especially in light of the  large elderly veteran population. These data needs have focused on the  total amount of resources spent to deliver nursing home care in VA  nursing homes, community nursing homes, and state veterans\u2019 nursing  homes and the amount of nursing home care provided with these  resources. The Committee has also expressed a need for data on the  percentage of veterans in VA\u2019s nursing home program that received long-  and short-stay nursing home care. Long-stay care patients cannot be cared  for at home because of severe, chronic physical or mental limitations. In  addition, the Committee has expressed a need for data on the percentage  of veterans in VA\u2019s nursing home program that are required to be served  based on the Millennium Act or VA policy.", "For all nursing home settings in VA\u2019s program in fiscal year 2003, this  report provides information on (1) VA spending to provide or pay for  nursing home care, (2) VA workload provided or paid for, (3) the  percentage of nursing home care that is long and short stay, and (4) the  percentage of veterans receiving care that are required to be served by the  Millennium Act or VA policy. To place this information in context, we  supplement our findings with information for fiscal year 1998.", "To perform our work, we reviewed documents and analyzed VA data on  the amount of nursing home expenditures and workload, the percentage of  long- and short-stay care, and the eligibility status of veterans based on the  Millennium Act or VA\u2019s policy on nursing home eligibility. In our  calculation of expenditures, we included direct expenditures by VA to  provide or pay for nursing home care plus costs to administer the program  at the VA medical center. For this review, we measured nursing home  workload as defined by average daily census, which reflects the average  number of veterans receiving nursing home care on any given day during  the course of the year. We used VA data to estimate the number of VA  nursing home long stays, defined as 90 days or more, and short stays,  defined as less than 90 days. To determine the eligibility status of veterans  we used VA data to estimate veterans\u2019 eligibility for VA nursing home care  based on the Millennium Act or VA policy. In doing our work, we tested  the reliability of the data and determined they were adequate for our  purposes. For a complete description of our scope and methodology, see  appendix I.

Almost all of these nursing  homes are attached or in close proximity to a VA medical center.  According to VA policy, VA staff at these facilities determine whether the  veteran has a clinical need for nursing home care based on a  comprehensive interdisciplinary clinical assessment. The interdisciplinary  teams determining clinical need for nursing home care could include  personnel such as the nursing home director, a social worker, nurse,  physical therapist, and gerontologist. The care provided to veterans at a  VA nursing home could include a range of services, including short-term  postacute care needed to recover from a condition such as a stroke to  longer-term care required by veterans who cannot be cared for at home  because of severe, chronic physical or mental limitations.", "VA may also refer patients to receive nursing home care under contract  from non-VA nursing homes located in the community\u2014referred to as  community nursing homes. In fiscal year 2003, VA purchased care from  community nursing homes in one of two ways. VA contracted with most  nursing homes through the local VA medical center. In addition, VA also  contracted with some community nursing homes under its Regional  Community Nursing Home initiative, in which nursing home chains in  single or multiple states contract directly with VA headquarters for  services at their nursing homes. In fiscal year 2003, VA contracted with  1,723 nursing homes through its medical centers and with 508 more  nursing homes under its Regional Community Nursing Home initiative.", "Veterans may also choose to seek care in state veterans\u2019 nursing homes. In  fiscal year 2003, 109 state veterans\u2019 nursing homes located in 44 states and  Puerto Rico received VA payment to provide care. VA may refer patients to  these nursing homes for care, but does not control the admission process.  Veterans are admitted based on eligibility criteria established by the states.  For state veterans\u2019 nursing homes to participate in VA\u2019s program, however,  VA requires that at least 75 percent of the residents be veterans in most  cases. State veterans\u2019 nursing homes may also provide nursing home care  to certain nonveterans, such as spouses of residents who are veterans. VA  is authorized to pay for about two-thirds of the costs of construction of  state veterans\u2019 nursing homes and pays about a third of the costs per day  to provide care to veterans in these homes. In fiscal year 2003, VA paid  $56.24 per day for veterans in these state veterans\u2019 nursing homes and  awarded $174 million in grants to 16 states for renovations of existing  facilities or construction of new state veterans\u2019 homes.", "Veterans can also receive nursing home care financed by sources other  than VA, including Medicaid and Medicare, private health or long-term  care insurance, or self-financed. States design and administer Medicaid  programs that include coverage for long-term nursing home care to assist  with daily activities such as eating and bathing. Medicare primarily covers  acute care health costs and therefore limits its nursing home coverage to  short stays requiring skilled nursing home care following hospitalization.  State Medicaid programs are the principal funders of nursing homes,  besides patients self-financing their care. Private health insurance pays for  about 11 percent of nursing home and home health care expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Spent Almost Three-Quarters of Its Nursing Home Resources on Care for Veterans in VA Nursing Homes, but Expenditures Varied Widely by Network", "paragraphs": ["VA nursing homes accounted for almost three-quarters of VA\u2019s overall  nursing home expenditures, or about $1.7 billion, in fiscal year 2003.

In large  part this is because VA pays a per-diem rate for care in state veterans\u2019  nursing homes that, on average, accounts for about one-third of the cost to  provide veterans nursing home care in this setting. The remaining  payments made to state veterans\u2019 nursing homes come from a number of  other sources including Medicaid, Medicare, private health insurance, and  patients self-financing their care. VA nursing homes provided the next  largest percentage of nursing home workload, 37 percent in fiscal year  2003. Community nursing homes provided 13 percent of overall nursing  home workload.

In contrast, the  percentage of workload provided in VA nursing homes and community  nursing homes declined. (See fig. 3.)", "The increase in the percentage of nursing home workload provided in  state veterans\u2019 nursing homes resulted from a number of factors. States,  with the assistance of construction grants from VA, built 17 new state  veterans\u2019 nursing homes, increasing the number of beds available during  this period. The increasing percentage of state veterans\u2019 nursing home  workload also occurred as a result of declines in workload in VA nursing  homes and community nursing homes due to changes in VA\u2019s use of these  settings. In VA nursing homes, VA officials attributed some of the  decreases in nursing home workload to an increased emphasis on  postacute patients with short lengths of stay. Moreover, VA officials told  us that they are providing contract community nursing home care to fewer  veterans and paying for shorter contracts than in the past. The number of  patients VA served in this setting declined from 28,893 to 14,032 during this  period. Network officials also told us that contracts for community  nursing home care are often now 30 days or less and are used primarily to  transition veterans to nursing home care, which is paid for by other payers  such as Medicaid.", "Although state veterans\u2019 nursing homes predominate overall, networks  vary widely in the percentage of workload met in different nursing home  settings.

(See fig. 4.) This  variation is due, in part, to the available bed capacity of state veterans\u2019  nursing homes in these networks. In 2003, Network 15 (Kansas City) had  1,509 state veterans\u2019 nursing home beds compared to 420 beds in Network  8 (Bay Pines).

For example, veterans needing  long-stay care may have difficulty performing some activities of daily living  without assistance, such as bathing, dressing, toileting, eating, and moving  from one location to another. They may have mental impairments, such as  Alzheimer\u2019s disease or dementia, that necessitate supervision to avoid  harm to themselves or others or require assistance with tasks such as  taking medications. The remainder, or two-thirds of VA nursing home care,  was short-stay care (less than 90 days) in this setting. VA\u2019s use of short- stay care includes nursing home services such as postacute care required  for recuperation from a stroke or hip replacement.

To place this information in  context, you asked us to supplement our findings with information for  fiscal year 1998.", "To address the first two objectives, we obtained data on nursing home  workload and expenditures at the network level for fiscal years 1998 and  2003 from several VA headquarters offices. VA\u2019s Geriatrics and Extended  Care Strategic Healthcare Group provided us workload data for VA  nursing homes and community nursing homes, as reported in VA\u2019s  Automated Management Information System. This group also gave us  workload data from monthly reports completed by state veterans\u2019 nursing  homes that were maintained at the VA medical centers. These data are  used by the Geriatrics and Extended Care office to provide per diem  grants to state veterans\u2019 homes. The Office of the Chief Financial Officer  for the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provided us expenditure  data from VA\u2019s Cost Distribution Report for the nursing home care  provided or paid for by VA.", "To do our analysis, we used average daily census as a measure of  workload. Average daily census is the total number of days of nursing  home care provided in a year divided by the number of days in the year.  For VA nursing home expenditures, we included the direct costs used to  provide nursing home care plus other facility costs associated with  operating the nursing home. VA nursing home expenditures excluded  depreciation as well as VA headquarters and network administrative costs.  To calculate community nursing home expenditures, we included all  contract payments made to community nursing homes plus additional  facility expenditures required to directly support the program at the local  VA medical center. To calculate state veterans\u2019 home expenditures, we  included per diem payments made to state veterans\u2019 nursing homes plus  additional facility expenditures required to directly support the program at  local VA medical centers. Expenditures for state veterans\u2019 homes did not  include construction grants.", "To determine the percentage of long and short stays in VA nursing homes  in fiscal years 1998 and 2003, we obtained data on length of stay from  VHA\u2019s Extended Care Patient Treatment Files. The Patient Treatment Files  include nursing home discharges for veterans who were discharged from a  VA nursing home during a fiscal year, and current resident files for  veterans who were not discharged by the end of a fiscal year. Using length  of nursing home stay, we classified stays of 90 days or more as long stays  and stays of less than 90 days as short stays. Length of stay is calculated as  the number of days in a nursing home between the admission and  discharge days and was given a minimum value of 1. The number of days  absent from the nursing home, such as for a hospital stay, was subtracted  from the length of stay. Because current residents were not discharged  within the fiscal year, we calculated their lengths of stay by looking ahead  into the next fiscal year. That is, we matched current residents with  discharges in the next fiscal year to determine whether their stays were  short or long. A current resident who was admitted on the last day of the  fiscal year, for example, but was discharged after 90 days into the next  fiscal year, was classified as having a long stay. If the same resident was  discharged within 90 days of the next fiscal year, then the stay was  classified as short. We classified nursing home stays as long for current  residents who were not discharged in the next fiscal year. Our analysis for  long- and short-stay care was based on nursing home stays rather than  individual veterans because some veterans had multiple nursing home  stays.", "To determine the percentage of veterans in VA nursing homes receiving  care that are required to be served by the Millennium Act or VA policy, we  obtained individual data on eligibility for veterans enrolled in VA\u2019s health  care system. VHA\u2019s Office of Policy and Planning provided us these data in  an enrollment file for fiscal year 2003. We merged these data with the  discharge and current resident files from VHA\u2019s Extended Care Patient  Treatment Files in order to calculate the percentage of veterans receiving  nursing home care that are required to be served in fiscal year 2003. Our  analyses on eligibility are based on individual veterans rather than nursing  home stays; because some veterans had multiple nursing home stays in a  given year, we retained veterans\u2019 first nursing home stay and eliminated  other stays in that year. We used a variable from VA\u2019s enrollment file that  measures service-connected disability rating. In addition, we used  variables from the file that measure whether the veteran is unemployable  and whether the veteran is considered permanent and total disabled,  based on disabilities not related to military service.", "We included the following categories of veterans in our calculation to  determine the percentage of veterans receiving nursing home care  required to be served by the Millennium Act or VA\u2019s policy on nursing  home eligibility: (1) veterans who had a service-connected disability rating  of 70 percent or more; (2) veterans who were admitted to a VA nursing  home on or before November 30, 1999; and (3) veterans who had a service- connected disability rating of 60 percent and who were also unemployable  or permanent and total disabled. We did not include in our estimate  veterans VA is required to serve who need nursing home care because of a  service-connected disability, but who do not have a service-connected  disability rating of 70 percent or more. VA did not have data on these  veterans, but a VA official estimated that this group is very small based on  conversations with facility staff.", "To supplement our knowledge of the type of nursing home care provided  in VA networks, we visited two networks and five nursing homes. In  Network 5 (Baltimore) we visited Washington, D.C.; Martinsburg, West  Virginia; and Baltimore, Maryland. In Network 23 (Minneapolis) we visited  St. Cloud, Minnesota; and Minneapolis, Minnesota. We selected these two  networks because they were in different geographic regions and had  variation in the types of care offered in their facilities. Within each  network, we chose one nursing home that provided more long-stay nursing  home care and another that provided more short-stay care.", "We assessed the reliability of workload and expenditure data in VA\u2019s  nursing home program, VHA\u2019s enrollment data file, and VHA\u2019s Extended  Care Patient Treatment Files in several ways. First, we performed tests of  data elements. For example, we examined the range of values for length of  stay to determine whether these data were complete and reasonable.  Second, we reviewed existing information about the data elements. For  example, we obtained and reviewed information from VHA on data  elements we used from VHA\u2019s Extended Care Patient Treatment Files.  Third, we interviewed agency officials knowledgeable about the data in  our analyses and knowledgeable about VA\u2019s nursing home program. For  example, we sent network-specific nursing home workload and  expenditure data provided to us by VA headquarters to each of VA\u2019s 21  health care networks through electronic mail in December 2003. Network  officials reported whether these data were accurate and indicated where  they found discrepancies. Through discussions with VA headquarters and  network officials we resolved the discrepancies. We determined that the  data we used in our analyses were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  this report.", "We performed our review from January 2003 to November 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Changes in Percentage of Nursing Home Expenditures by Setting and Network, Fiscal Years 1998 and 2003", "paragraphs": ["Increase was less than 1 percent.", "Decrease was less than 1 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal year 2003 percentage of total", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Changes in Percentage of Nursing Home Workload by Setting and Network, Fiscal Years 1998 and 2003", "paragraphs": ["Decrease was less than 1 percent.", "Increase was less than 1 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fiscal year 2003 percentage of total", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Cheryl A.
