(1) Leadership: One of the strengths of the effort to transform the culture of organizations going into DHS has been the on-going commitment of both DHS and Office of Personnel Management (OPM) leaders to stimulate and support the effort to design a human capital system. (2) Strategic Goals: DHS is currently developing a strategic plan. Although DHS human resource leaders are included on the strategic planning team, it will not be complete until the end of September 2003. Consequently, DHS will need to ensure that the development of the human capital policy options is integrated with the accomplishment of DHS programmatic goals as defined in the forthcoming strategic plan. Such integration is important to ensure that the human capital system enables the department to acquire, develop, and retain the core competencies necessary for DHS to accomplish its programmatic goals. (3) Key Principles: The DHS Secretary and OPM Director outlined four principles to serve as a critical framework for the human capital system. These principles appropriately identify the need to support the mission and employees of the department, protect basic civil service principles, and hold employees accountable for performance. (4) Timeline: Agency officials established an ambitious 9- to 10-month timeline for completing the design process, aiming to issue final regulations in early 2004. Some DHS stakeholders we interviewed expressed concerns about the compressed schedule. Officials leading the design effort report the aggressive schedule is necessary to relieve employee anxiety and maximize the time available for implementation. (5) Design Team: The design team includes staff from multiple organizational units within DHS, OPM, and the three major unions. (6) Communication: DHS recently finalized a communication plan that provides a structured and planned approach to communicate with DHS stakeholders regarding the human capital system. Moving forward, DHS will need to provide adequate opportunities for feedback once the options are released. (7) Employee Involvement: Employees are provided multiple opportunities to be included in the design process, including participation in the Core Design Team, the Town Hall meetings, the field team, the focus groups, and an e-mail mailbox for employee comments. Experience has shown that in making major changes in the cultures of organizations, how it is done, when it is done, and the basis on which it is done can make all the difference in whether it is ultimately successful. The analysis of DHS's effort to design a human capital system can be particularly instructive in light of legislative requests for agency-specific human capital flexibilities at the Department of Defense and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) represents an  historic moment for the federal government to fundamentally transform  how the nation will protect itself from terrorism.  DHS now has an  opportunity\u2014and a responsibility\u2014to transform and integrate a disparate  group of agencies with multiple missions, values, and cultures into a strong  and effective cabinet department.  Together with this unique opportunity,  however, also comes significant risk to the nation that could occur if this  transformation is not implemented successfully.  In fact, we designated this  implementation and transformation as high risk in January 2003.", "We convened a forum in September 2002 to identify useful practices and  lessons learned from major public and private transformations that DHS  and other federal agencies could use to inform transformation efforts.While no two mergers or transformation efforts are exactly alike and the  \u201cbest\u201d approach depends on a variety of factors specific to each context,  there was general agreement on a number of key practices.  These  practices include:  1.\t Ensure top leadership drives the transformation.  Leadership  must set the direction, pace, and tone and provide a clear, consistent  rationale that brings everyone together behind a single mission.  2.\t Establish a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to  guide the transformation.  Together, these define the culture and  serve as a vehicle for employees to unite and rally around.  3.\t Focus on a key set of principles and priorities at the outset of  the transformation.  A clear set of principles and priorities serves as a  framework to help the organization create a new culture and drive  employee behaviors.  4.\t Set implementation goals and a timeline to build momentum and  show progress from day one.  Goals and a timeline are essential  because the transformation could take years to complete.  5.\t Dedicate an implementation team to manage the transformation  process.  A strong and stable team is important to ensure that the  transformation receives the needed attention to be sustained and  successful.  6.\t Use the performance management system to define  responsibility and assure accountability for change. A \u201cline of  sight\u201d shows how team, unit, and individual performance can  contribute to overall organizational results.  7.\t Establish a communication strategy to create shared  expectations and report related progress.  The strategy must reach  out to employees, customers, and stakeholders and engage them in a  two-way exchange.  8.\t Involve employees to obtain their ideas and gain their  ownership for the transformation.  Employee involvement  strengthens the process and allows them to share their experiences and  shape policies.  9.\t Build a world-class organization.  Building on a vision of improved  performance, the organization adopts the most efficient, effective, and  economical personnel, system, and process changes and continually  seeks to implement best practices.", "Building on the forum, we recently identified specific implementation steps  for these key practices. (See app. I).  Many mergers do not live up to their  potential.  Research suggests that the failure to adequately address a wide  variety of people and cultural issues is at the heart of unsuccessful mergers  and transformations. Therefore, strategic human capital management  must be at the center of a successful transformation effort.  The legislation  creating DHS provided it with significant flexibility to design a modern  human capital management system. Specifically, the department may  deviate from requirements contained in Title 5 of the United States Code  relating to performance appraisals, classification, pay rates and systems,and adverse actions and appeals.  However, the department may not  deviate from other Title 5 provisions including the merit system principles,  prohibited personnel practices, equal employment opportunity, civil  service examination and selection, and pay administration.In addition, for  hiring employees, the department may take advantage of the  governmentwide personnel reform measures contained in the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, including using a category rating system when  evaluating applicants for employment and selecting qualified applicants for  positions using direct hiring procedures. Regulations for the DHS human  capital system are to be prescribed jointly by the Secretary of DHS and the  Director of the Office of Personnel Management (OPM).  The legislation  also noted that it is the sense of the Congress that employees be involved in  the creation of the new human capital system.", "In light of the challenge to transform the organizations joining the  department and establish a modern human capital management system,  you asked that we undertake a series of human capital engagements to  assist DHS in its implementation efforts.  As agreed with your office, this is  one of several reports we will issue that will track how DHS begins to make  use of its new human capital authorities.  Specifically, this report  (1) describes the process DHS has in place to design its human capital  system and involve employees and (2) analyzes the extent to which this  process reflects what we have found to be important elements of  successful transformations.", "To address our objectives, we reviewed documents relevant to DHS\u2019s  transformation and personnel system design effort and applicable laws and  regulations.  These included the April 2003 Human Resources Systems  Design Team Resource Book, the weekly DHS newsletter, OPM data on  DHS employees and unions, the June 2003 Communications Plan, and  others.  We interviewed officials from DHS and OPM headquarters who are  involved in the effort to design the new human capital system.  Human  resource leaders from the five largest components within DHS were also  interviewed \u2013 the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the organizations formerly  known as the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and the U.S.  Customs Service, and the U.S. Coast Guard \u2013 to learn their impressions of  the design process.  Interviews with officials from the three largest  employee unions at DHS \u2013 the American Federation of Government  Employees (AFGE), the National Treasury Employees Union (NTEU), and  the National Association of Agricultural Employees (NAAE) \u2013 provided  additional insights.  We then analyzed the information gathered in light of  seven of the nine transformation practices.  Practice 6 was excluded from  the analysis because the effort to design a human capital system includes  the development of a performance management system and Practice 9 was  excluded because developing an effective human capital system is one of  many efforts required to become a world-class organization.  We conducted  our work in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards between March and September 2003.", "The description and analysis of DHS\u2019s effort to design a strategic human  capital management system can be particularly instructive in light of  legislation that requests additional authority for human capital  management at the Department of Defense (DOD) and the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).  We have consistently  supported the need for government transformation and the concept of  modernizing federal human capital policies, as underscored in recent  testimonies and our January 2003 report which described why we find that  strategic human capital management remains a governmentwide high-risk  area. This effort can also prove instructive for future human capital  management and reorganization efforts within specific units of DHS as the  new department is implemented and transformed over time into a cohesive  organization.", "Importantly, while the design process used to develop the human capital  system is significant, effective implementation of the system is similarly  crucial to effective human capital management in the new department.

The feedback mechanisms identified in the communications  plan focus on gathering employee feedback prior to the options being  released.  For example, two of the three feedback mechanisms outlined in  the communications plan will be completed before the system options are  publicized.  DHS also needs to ensure effective communication to  employees and stakeholders after the options are released.  For example,  DHS should consider describing to employees how the comments collected  during the Town Hall meetings and focus groups informed the design  process.

This reflects the Congress\u2019 desire that employees be allowed to participate  in a meaningful way in the creation of the new human capital system.  Involving employees in planning helps to develop agency goals and  objectives that incorporate insights about operations from a front-line  perspective.  It can also serve to increase employees\u2019 understanding and  acceptance of organizational goals and improve motivation and morale.", "The design process attempts to include employees by creating multiple  opportunities for employees to provide feedback.  While activity updates  were provided in the DHS weekly newsletter and an e-mail mailbox for  employees to submit their suggestions and comments was used, multiple  Town Hall meetings and focus groups conducted between the end of May  and the beginning of July 2003 were held in ten cities across the United  States. According to DHS and OPM officials, these cities were chosen to  ensure adequate representation of major DHS components and geographic  diversity.  The goal of the events was to promote two-way communication  between management and employees and to gather employee perspectives  on the personnel practices that exist in their agency and any proposed  changes they would like to see.  Each meeting hosted up to 200 DHS  employees from the surrounding cities.", "At a typical Town Hall meeting, there was a general question and answer  segment in which local employees had the opportunity to ask questions  about the new system and express their overall concerns about DHS.  If  participants\u2019 questions could not be addressed during the meeting due to  time constraints, they could write their questions on note cards and give  them to cognizant DHS and OPM officials in attendance.  After the meeting,  the Core Design Team held a series of six focus group sessions in each city  to obtain their input and suggestions for the new human resource system.  In most cities, five of the six sessions were devoted to hear employees\u2019  views while the remaining session heard the views of supervisors and  managers.  Participants in the focus groups included both Town Hall  meeting attendees and those who were not able to attend the Town Hall  session.", "The degree to which the information gathered in these sessions was used to  inform the design process is not yet evident.  On one hand, the Town Hall  meetings and focus groups gathered suggestions and concerns from large  numbers of employees from multiple organizational components in  geographically diverse locations.  However, once options for the human  capital system are proposed it will be particularly important that  employees have adequate opportunities to make a worthwhile  contribution.", "In addition to the Town Hall meetings and focus groups, a field team made  of 32 front-line DHS managers and staff, some of whom were selected by  the major unions, was formed.  During the design process, the field team  provided insights about the department\u2019s human capital challenges from a  front-line perspective.  These insights were gathered during the three  meetings of the group -- the field team was convened during the first week  of the 2-week April leadership conference, 2 days in July to react to the  subgroups\u2019 research, and for 2 days again in mid-September to react to the  draft personnel system options before their submission to the Senior  Review Advisory Committee in late September.", "According to documents drafted before the April leadership conference,  provided by AFGE and NAAE, it was originally expected that the field team  would review the work of the Core Design Team on a \u201cregular basis\u201d and  then be used to \u201ctest the options against workplace realities.\u201d  One  stakeholder added that it was his initial impression that the field team  would serve as an \u201cextension of the Core Design Team,\u201d empowered to  provide input throughout the entire design process.  However, over time,  the expected role of the field team evolved to that of a recurring focus  group that had no formal decision-making role in the design process.  Likewise, as the role for the field team evolved, so did its membership \u2013  additional nonunionized DHS employees were added to the team.  One  DHS official acknowledged that the field team has not had a great deal of  involvement in the process, and that the expected role of the team changed  over time.  Officials in NTEU, AFGE, and NAAE additionally confirmed that  the role of the field team changed over time.  One union president  described the diminished role as a \u201cmissed opportunity.\u201d  This official  added that the lack of involvement and minimal communication with the  Core Design Team has made it difficult for the field team to make a  worthwhile contribution."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DHS and OPM have developed a process to design the new personnel  system that is stimulated and supported by top leadership in both  organizations and is generally inclusive, both in terms of the membership  of the Core Design Team and multiple opportunities to provide input.  The  process is also guided by core principles and an ambitious timeline.  Our  research shows that these key attributes are indispensable to successful  transformations.  This design process provides a model for DHS to  consider as it makes other important decisions about the implementation  and transformation of the department.", "Building on this progress, DHS will need to ensure that the development of  the human capital policy options by the Core Design Team is integrated  with the accomplishment of DHS programmatic goals as defined in the  forthcoming strategic plan.  Such a linkage can ensure that the new human  capital approaches support and facilitate the accomplishment of DHS\u2019s  goals and objectives \u2013 a fundamental principle of the human capital idea.  It  will also assist the Core Design Team in identifying human capital  programs that support the DHS mission, including the development of a  performance management system which creates a \u201cline of sight\u201d that shows  how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute to overall  organizational goals.", "Additionally, DHS has acknowledged that work lies ahead for implementing  better, more effective ways to communicate with and receive feedback  from its employees.  The development of the communications plan is an  important and positive step.  As DHS implements this plan it will need to  provide information on areas of confusion that were identified during our  interviews, including clarifying the role of DHS versus OPM in the system  development.  DHS will also need to ensure that a consistent message is  communicated across DHS components.  Finally, effective communication,  characterized by a two-way dialogue, will be central to engaging employees  in the remainder of the design process and ensuring it is transparent.  Ultimately, an effective two-way communication strategy can ease  implementation efforts.  Once options for the human capital system are  proposed it will be particularly important that employees have adequate  opportunities to make a worthwhile contribution.  Substantial involvement  of field staff in the development and implementation of the new human  capital system is essential given that over 90 percent of DHS civilian  employees are in the field.  Continued employee involvement will help to  strengthen employee buy-in to the new human capital system.
