The Navy's goal is to cut personnel on the DD(X) by about 70 percent from that of the previous destroyer class--a reduction GAO estimated could eventually save about $18 billion over the life of a 32-ship class. The goal was included in key program documents to which program managers are held accountable. Although the Navy did not set specific crew reduction goals for the T-AKE cargo ship, it made some use of human systems integration principles and expects to require a somewhat smaller crew than similar legacy ships. The two other ships--the recently cancelled JCC(X) command ship and the LHA(R) amphibious assault ship--did not establish human systems integration plans early in the acquisition programs, and did not establish ambitious crew size reduction goals. Unless the Navy more consistently applies human systems integration early in the acquisition process and establishes meaningful goals for crew size reduction, the Navy may miss opportunities to lower total ownership costs for new ships, which are determined by decisions made early in the acquisition process. For example, the Navy has not clearly defined the human systems integration certification standards for new ships. Several factors may impede the Navy's consistent application of human systems integration principles and its use of innovations to optimize crew size: (1) DOD acquisition policies and discretionary Navy guidance that allow program managers latitude in optimizing crew size and using human systems integration, (2) funding challenges that encourage the use of legacy systems to save near-term costs and discourage research and investment in labor-saving technology that could reduce long-term costs, (3) unclear Navy organizational authority to require human systems integration's use in acquisition programs, and (4) the Navy's lack of cultural acceptance of new concepts to optimize crew size and its layers of personnel policies that require consensus from numerous stakeholders to revise."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The cost of a ship\u2019s crew is the single largest expense incurred over  a ship\u2019s life cycle.

The first to be generated is a  mission need statement that describes a warfighting deficiency, or  opportunity to provide new capabilities, in broad operational terms and  identifies constraints such as crewing, personnel, and training that may  affect satisfying the need. These capabilities and constraints are examined  during the initial phase of the program in a second key document, a study  called the analysis of alternatives. This study assesses the operational  effectiveness and estimated costs of alternative systems to meet the  mission need. The analysis assesses the pros and cons of each alternative  and their sensitivity to possible changes in key assumptions. The analysis  should consider personnel as both a life-cycle cost and a design driver.

According to human systems  integration experts, for Navy ship acquisitions, human systems integration  may begin with a top-down requirements analysis that examines the ship\u2019s  functions and mission requirements and determines whether human or  machine performance is required for each task.

This goal represents a  greater than 70 percent reduction in crew size from that of the Arleigh  Burke-class destroyers developed in the 1980s.  In 1997, the DD(X) operational requirements document specified a crew  size goal of between 95 and 150 as a key performance parameter. It also  required that human systems integration be used to minimize life-cycle  costs and maximize performance effectiveness, reliability, readiness, and  safety of the ship and crew.  In 1997, the program also established a ship crewing/human systems  integration integrated process team whose charter requires a top-down  functional analysis, the analytical centerpiece of the Navy\u2019s human  systems integration approach, in the early phases to obtain a major  reduction in personnel.  In 1998, the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology  continued to hold DD(X) destroyer program managers accountable for  achieving an aggressive crew size reduction when he required validation  that the DD(X) crew size will meet the key performance parameter  threshold before ship construction begins.", "The Phase 1 solicitation issued in 1998 for trade studies and analyses and  development of two competitive system concept designs required that  both contractors provide a human systems integration plan.", "The design agent contract awarded in 2002 requires the contractor to  develop and demonstrate a human systems integration engineering effort  that addresses the crewing, personnel, training, human performance,  sailor survivability, and quality of life aspects of the DD(X) design.

For example, cleaning requirements are expected to be reduced by a ship  design that capitalizes on commercial shipping practices such as  cornerless spaces and maintenance-free deck coverings. The ship will also  rely on an integrated bridge system that provides computer-based  navigation, planning and monitoring, automated radar plotting, and  automated ship control.", "DD(X) program officials stated that their experience in using the human  systems integration engineering approach, establishing an aggressive  crew size reduction goal early in the acquisition process, and including  this goal as a key performance parameter in the operational requirements  document has been critical in maintaining a focus on reducing crew size.  Moreover, these practices led to examining innovative approaches from  the beginning and holding program managers accountable during program  reviews. Program officials anticipate that the emphasis on reducing crew  size will help to minimize DD(X) operating and support and total  ownership costs once the ship is built and enters the fleet. For illustrative  purposes, we calculated that the Navy could avoid personnel-related costs  of about $600 million per ship over a 35-year service life if it achieves a  crew of 150 sailors rather than requiring the 365 sailors needed to operate  its legacy ship, the Arleigh Burke-class destroyer. This could potentially  save more than $18 billion for a class of 32 ships (both amounts are in  fiscal year 2002 dollars).

Program officials stated that  informal goals or those established later in the acquisition process would  not have been nearly as effective in getting the program to focus on  achieving significant personnel reductions. However, in recognition of the  technological challenge of achieving the crew size goal and several other  technological challenges, the Navy restructured the DD(X) program in  November 2001 to better manage the program\u2019s risk. As such, it adopted  an acquisition strategy consisting of multiple capability increments, or  \u201cflights.\u201d The newly restructured program relaxed the crew size goals to  between 125 and 175, which still represents a greater than 50 percent  reduction below legacy ship levels, for the first of three planned DD(X)  flights.

Moreover, early acquisition documents for the T-AKE cargo  ship program did not establish specific goals for reducing crew size,  although they required the use of civilian mariners or Merchant Marines  instead of active-duty Navy personnel and mandated the examination of  cargo handling innovations to reduce crew workload. Use of Merchant  Marines or Military Sealift Command personnel generally results in a  smaller crew because these organizations employ more experienced  seamen, have reduced watchstanding requirements, and use a different  maintenance and training philosophy.

As a result, human systems integration was  not applied to one of the main drivers of crew size\u2014the number of  crewmembers required to perform connected replenishment at each  replenishment station.", "Program officials indicated that, because intership underway  replenishment involves the interface between the T-AKE cargo ship and all  other ship classes requiring replenishment at sea, redesign of the Navy\u2019s  process of underway replenishment was not within their purview and,  therefore, was not addressed in the program\u2019s human systems integration  analyses. Instead, the program\u2019s focus was to ensure that the T-AKE cargo  ship\u2019s design met the current requirements for performing underway  replenishment and had the flexibility for future equipment modification.  To address underway replenishment across ship platforms, in 2000 the  Navy established a naval operational logistics integrated product team  whose mission is to establish policy and doctrine for future operational  systems and ensure the integration of operational logistics systems  across ships.", "Since reexamining intership underway replenishment was beyond the  scope of the ship program, program personnel said they focused on  identifying ways to reduce crew workload. In the first acquisition phase,  four contractors prepared trade studies on the integration of cargo  handling functions on the ship. In the second acquisition phase, one of  the contractors, National Steel and Shipbuilding Company, was awarded  the contract to design and construct the ship. Ultimately, labor-saving  innovations such as item scanners; an automated, rather than paper-based,  warehouse management inventory system; and safer and easier to operate  elevator doors were adopted.", "Although the T-AKE cargo ship is expected to require fewer personnel  than its legacy ships, early acquisition documents did not establish a  specific crew size goal as a key performance parameter and thus did not  hold the program manager accountable for specific reductions. Rather, the  operational requirements document required that the T-AKE be crewed  largely by U.S. Merchant Marines or Military Sealift Command civilian  mariners. The Navy currently estimates that the T-AKE will be crewed by  172 individuals: 123 civilian mariners, 13 active-duty sailors in the military  department who perform cargo management/inventory functions, and  36 active-duty sailors in the aviation detachment who perform intership  cargo transfer using a helicopter (vertical replenishment).", "The T-AKE cargo ship\u2019s projected crew size of 172 personnel will be  somewhat smaller than that of its Military Sealift Command legacy ships,  the T-AE 26 Kilauea-class ammunition ships and the T-AFS 1/8 Mars-class  and Sirius-class combat stores ships, which have crews of 182-215  personnel and also use civilian mariners. The T-AKE\u2019s crew size is  significantly smaller than when these legacy ships were crewed by  active-duty personnel.

In August 2002, the Chief of Naval Operations  commented on the size of the LHA-1 (the legacy ship that the LHA(R) is  replacing) saying, \u201cI don\u2019t want any more ships like that.

Program  officials plan to conduct human systems integration efforts during the  system development and demonstration acquisition phase when the  program begins preliminary design efforts. Some of these efforts,  scheduled to begin in February 2003, are to include a top-down  requirements analysis and a total ship manpower assessment.", "In contrast to the opinions of LHA(R) program officials, the Navy\u2019s human  systems integration experts stated that human systems integration is a  critical part of planning and design in the early stages of acquisition,  including the concept and technology development phase. In addition,  experience with the DD(X) program shows that the potential personnel- related cost savings resulting from the application of human systems  integration early on in a program can be significant.

As a result, some programs we examined set goals not  to exceed the crew size of 30-year old ships, waited until preliminary  design in the second acquisition phase to begin human systems integration  efforts, and excluded primary and secondary ship functions from a  rigorous analysis.

Compliance with the Defense Acquisition memorandum is  mandatory; compliance with the Interim Defense Acquisition Guidebook  is discretionary. Both documents state that program managers will  develop a human systems integration strategy early in the acquisition  process to minimize total ownership cost. Neither document, however,  specifies how early in the process these efforts should begin or requires  that human systems integration analyses be performed on the various  alternatives considered in the formal analysis of alternatives.", "The Navy\u2019s main acquisition instruction requires that human systems  integration costs and impacts be adequately considered along with other  engineering and logistics elements beginning at program initiation but  does not provide for specific procedures. The Navy\u2019s section of the  acquisition deskbook provides more detailed guidance on human  systems integration (such as providing a format for the human systems  integration plan and discussing the contents of a human systems  integration program). However, because these sources provide only broad  guidelines or are discretionary, a program manger can decide when, how,  and to what extent they will use human systems integration in their  acquisition program.", "The Navy also has developed other guidance on using human systems  integration, but its use is also discretionary. For example, human systems  integration experts developed a guide for the Office of the Chief Naval  Operations, which states that a human systems integration assessment  and trade-off of design alternatives should be conducted during the first  acquisition phase.

The  program plans to capitalize, where appropriate, on systems already in  development for other ships such as the DD(X) destroyer and the CVN(X)  aircraft carrier but has not yet identified any labor-saving technologies or  processes that might be adapted from these programs. Program officials  said the program was not resourced to develop new technologies, having  received only $20 million in research and development funds from  program initiation through fiscal year 2002. However, the up-front savings  of not investing in research and development and human systems  integration activities must be weighed against the higher operating and  support costs incurred over the life of the ship and the foregone capability  and quality of life improvements that can accompany new technology and  human-centered design. For illustrative purposes, we calculated that a  nominal 25 percent reduction in a 1,245-person crew could provide a  personnel cost avoidance of nearly $1 billion over the service life of a ship,  or nearly $4 billion for a 4-ship class. In addition, DD(X) destroyer  program officials were uncertain about the extent to which programs now  in development outside the DD(X) destroyer family of ships will be able to  leverage its new technology, citing the costs associated with adapting  technology to new platforms that perform different missions.

In addition, new ways of  doing business, such as those envisioned for the DD(X) destroyer, will  affect and require modifications to Navy doctrine, tactics, and operational  requirements. Furthermore, proposed changes must be evaluated for  compliance with governing statutes in such areas as compensation,  occupational safety and health, and aviation.

Applying human systems integration principles to optimize  crew size has the potential to result in a host of cost and operational  benefits, including saving billions of dollars by reducing total ownership  costs and increasing operational performance and ship maintainability.  The experience to date in the DD(X) destroyer program shows that  requiring human systems integration from the earliest stages of a program  (during concept and technology development) and using the results to  establish a crew size reduction goal as a key performance parameter are  effective strategies to holding program managers accountable during  program reviews for making significant progress toward reducing crew  size. The DD(X) experience also shows that even when these practices are  followed, the program will still face challenges to achieving these  goals and encounter pressures to relax the goals as the system design  progresses, thereby supporting human systems integration experts\u2019 view  that human systems integration plans and activities should receive  continued review and focus throughout the acquisition process. In  contrast, programs such as the JCC(X) and LHA (R) that do not use human  systems integration early and do not hold program managers accountable  during program reviews for crew size reduction are less likely to achieve  the meaningful reduction in crew size. Unless the Navy more consistently  applies human systems integration early in the acquisition process and  establishes meaningful goals for crew size reduction, the Navy may miss  opportunities to lower total ownership costs for new ships, which are  determined by decisions made early in the acquisition process.", "The Navy\u2019s varied approach to applying human systems integration has  occurred partly because Navy guidance allows program managers  considerable discretion in determining the extent to which they apply  human systems integration principles in developing new systems. In the  absence of clear requirements that human systems integration programs  will be a key feature of all future acquisition programs, efforts to optimize  crew size will continue to vary due to the competing pressures placed on  program managers, and the Navy is likely to continue to miss  opportunities to reduce personnel requirements for future ships. As a  result, the Navy\u2019s funding challenges may be exacerbated, and it may not  be able to build or support the number of ships it believes are necessary to  support the new defense strategy. Although the Navy\u2019s recent efforts to  establish a focal point for human systems integration policy within the  Naval Sea Systems Command is a positive step, the success of this office  will depend on its authority to influence acquisition programs in their  initial stages. Because the instruction establishing this office does not  clearly explain the process this office will use to certify that ships  delivered to the fleet will have optimized crews, there is a risk that the  office may not have sufficient leverage to influence new programs in their  early stages and that this may result in missed opportunities to reduce  crew size and achieve long-term cost savings.", "Even when the Navy uses a disciplined human systems integration process  early in an acquisition program to identify ways to optimize crew size,  implementation of new technologies and procedures is often hindered by  the Navy\u2019s culture and traditions, which are institutionalized in a wide  array of policies and procedures affecting personnel levels, maintenance  requirements, and training. In recognition of these barriers, the DD(X)  program and the operational logistics community have established  processes to address these barriers for their particular ship or community.

Logistics ships in the Military Sealift Command have fewer  missions and therefore can operate with smaller crews. For example,  unlike Navy ships, Military Sealift Command logistics ships do not carry  weapons and therefore their crews do not require weapon operators.  Military Sealift Command ships also incorporate several other crew  reduction practices, including an unattended engine room, minimal bridge  watch by use of integrated bridge system technology, self-service laundry  facilities and food service initiatives. Command officials also said that  because of their personnel policies, civilian mariners are more  experienced than their Navy counterparts. Specifically, because there are  no personnel policies requiring job rotation or that individuals leave the  service if they are not promoted (\u201cup or out\u201d), civilian mariners are more  likely to have been in their current job longer than active-duty Navy  personnel. Command officials said that these personnel policies result in a  workforce that is more experienced than their Navy counterparts.", "The Military Sealift Command\u2019s operating policies also enable it to operate  cargo ships with smaller crews than the Navy. For example, command  officials said that their policy requires 9 crewmembers per underway  replenishment station and that the Navy requires 20 per station.
