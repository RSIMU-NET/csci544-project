Because of the significance of these issues and the problems associated with them, GAO has included them on its list of high-risk areas and has made numerous recommendations to correct pervasive management and technical weaknesses.

Our July 1995 report made specific recommendations that were intended to correct many of these weaknesses by December 31, 1995. IRS has initiated some activities to address these weaknesses. However, these weaknesses have not been corrected and ongoing efforts provide little assurance that weaknesses will be corrected. IRS has continued with plans to spend billions more on TSM solutions with little confidence of successfully delivering effective systems within established TSM time frames and cost figures. Inaccurate data and IRS\u2019 antiquated and rigid collection process continue to hinder its efforts to stem the growth of its accounts receivable and improve collection of delinquent debts. Little progress has been made in resolving the underlying causes of these problems since 1988, when IRS\u2019 accounts receivable was first identified as a high-risk area.

The inventory also includes accounts that have been established for compliance reasons and that may not be valid receivables. According to IRS estimates, the net result is that only about 20 percent of the inventory, or about $35 billion, is potentially collectible.", "According to IRS data, collections of delinquent taxes, while increasing to $25.1 billion in fiscal year 1995, are still below the high of $25.5 billion collected in fiscal year 1990.

For example, IRS has created the executive-level Investment Review Board for selecting, controlling, and evaluating all information technology investments; developed initial and revised sets of decision criteria that it used last summer to rank and prioritize TSM projects and used in November 1995 to recommend additional changes to information systems resource allocations, respectively; developed its Investment Evaluation Handbook and Business Case Handbook to strengthen management decision-making on systems investments; and is using the Investment Evaluation Handbook to review operational TSM projects.", "Although these steps represent some progress in responding to our concerns, none of them to date\u2014individually or collectively\u2014has fully satisfied our recommendations.

The purpose of an off-line test site is to provide a safe, controlled environment for testing that realistically simulates the production environment. This permits new hardware and software to be thoroughly tested without putting IRS operations and service to taxpayers at risk.

Primary among these is the fact that this figure includes an IRS estimated $97 billion in potential taxes that have been assessed but which may not be valid receivables. in the full or partial abatement of the tax debt, the amount recorded is not a valid receivable for financial reporting purposes.", "In the past, IRS used a statistical sampling methodology to estimate the compliance and financial portions of the inventory for financial statement purposes. Using this methodology, IRS estimated that, of the $166 billion tax debt inventory, about $69.2 billion represented financial receivables.

However, we found that the data upon which the analysis was based was flawed.", "IRS\u2019 inventory of tax debt also includes delinquent debt that may be up to 10 years old. This is because there is a 10-year statutory collection period and IRS generally does not write off uncollectible delinquencies until the 10 years is over. As a result, the receivables inventory includes accounts up to 10 years old that may be impossible to collect because the taxpayers are deceased or the corporations are defunct. Of the $166 billion total receivables inventory, IRS data show that $1.7 billion was owed by deceased taxpayers and $19.1 billion was owed by defunct corporations.", "During a review of accounts receivable cases greater than $10 million as of September 30, 1995, we identified several examples that illustrate problems with IRS\u2019 accounts receivable inventory. For example, out of a total of 460 accounts receivable cases that we reviewed, IRS identified 258 as currently not collectible: 198 of these represented defunct corporations, while the remaining 60 cases represented entities that either could not pay or could not be located. These cases represented $12 billion of the $26 billion included in accounts greater than $10 million.", "The age of the receivable also does not reflect the additional time it took for IRS to actually assess the taxes in the first place. In many cases, IRS\u2019 processing and use of certain taxpayer-related information to identify delinquent debt is a significant factor in determining the ultimate collectibility of the debt. Enforcement tools, such as its matching programs and tax examinations, may take up to 5 years from the date the tax return is due, thus reducing the likelihood that the outstanding amounts will be collected. these and other factors, IRS considers many of the accounts in the inventory to be uncollectible.", "IRS estimated that only about $35 billion of the $166 billion inventory of tax debt was collectible. However, for 3 of the 4 years we audited IRS\u2019 financial statements, we could not determine the reliability of IRS\u2019 estimate of accounts receivable and the related estimated collectable amount. We were only able to do so for fiscal year 1992, the first year we audited IRS. That year, we tested the validity of amounts IRS reported using a statistical sample. This resulted in an estimate of $28 billion in collectable accounts receivable. For the subsequent 2 years (fiscal years 1993 and 1994), IRS performed its own statistical sample to determine the collectability of its accounts receivable. As part of our audit, we assessed the reasonableness of these samples and found that we could not validate IRS\u2019 estimates.

For example, the failure of returns processing to correctly account for a taxpayer\u2019s payment may result in the creation of an invalid account receivable; the failure of taxpayer service to promptly resolve a taxpayer\u2019s inquiry about a delinquent account may perpetuate the receivable; and an IRS compliance effort that overstates a taxpayer\u2019s liability also inflates the inventory, makes additional work for collection personnel, and offers little guarantee of revenue generation. is available, IRS will continue to waste time and resources pursuing debts that are not real and thus do not generate revenue. Improving data accuracy and reliability is a key objective of TSM, but progress has been slow and the future success of TSM is uncertain.", "In addition, until IRS can effectively identify who owes the tax receivables and successfully implements a financial management system that ties its collection results to its operations, it is difficult, if not impossible, to gauge the return achieved from its collection efforts or how effective IRS or anyone could be in collecting outstanding tax receivables.", "Second, IRS\u2019 collection process was introduced several decades ago and, although some changes have been made, the process generally is rigid, costly, and inefficient. The three-stage collection process\u2014computer-generated notices and bills, telephone calls, and personal visits by collection employees\u2014takes longer and is more costly than collection processes in the private sector.", "While the private sector emphasizes the use of telephone collection calls, a significant portion of IRS\u2019 collection resources are devoted to personal visits made by revenue officers. IRS has initiated programs and made procedural changes to speed up the collection process, but historically it has been reluctant to reallocate resources from the field to the earlier, more productive collection activities. Due to budget cuts, however, IRS is in the process of temporarily reassigning about 300 field staff to telephone collection sites to replace temporary employees who were terminated.", "In addition to IRS\u2019 problems with identifying who currently owes taxes and the amount it can expect to collect, it has lacked the capability to accurately track the revenues realized from its various collection efforts. To address this problem, IRS has been developing the Enforcement Revenue Information System (ERIS). ERIS was designed to account for actual collections resulting from IRS\u2019 enforcement efforts and to enable IRS to more accurately measure and predict enforcement costs and revenues. However, its implementation was delayed because of inaccuracies found in the system\u2019s data; we are currently reviewing the system to assess its reliability. planning to implement a reengineering project that will involve all IRS activities that enable taxpayers to fulfill their tax obligations.", "Third, while Congress has given IRS strong tools, such as levies and seizures, to collect delinquent taxes, it has also established a number of statutory safeguards to prevent their unwarranted use. An unintended result of these safeguards has been to hamper collections. For example, the 1988 Taxpayer Bill of Rights prohibits IRS from evaluating the performance of its staff on the basis of dollars collected. Without the use of this measure, which is used by most private-sector collectors, IRS staff have less incentive to collect taxes. Their performance evaluations do not distinguish between collection actions that essentially write off a tax debt and actions that result in the collection of taxes owed\u2014both are considered case closings. This practice may be one reason why IRS field collection staff have been declaring more tax debts \u201ccurrently not collectible\u201d each year than they collect.", "We understand the importance of balancing the need to protect the rights of taxpayers against the need to collect tax debts. While IRS must be fair and follow appropriate laws and regulations, taxpayers must also accept their lawful tax obligations. Those who evade this obligation cause all other taxpayers to bear a disproportionate share of the overall tax burden.", "Fourth, IRS\u2019 organizational structure, with its considerable sharing of responsibility for collecting tax debts, provides little accountability for results. IRS is in the process of rethinking and restructuring its organization, including reducing the number of employees and the number of regional and district offices and service centers, but the impact of these changes, if any, on the accounts receivable problems will not be felt for several years.", "Fifth and finally, staffing imbalances among IRS field offices have resulted in staff being available in some offices to pursue both small and large debts, while in other offices even large debts might go uncollected because of staff shortages.", "In addition, as mentioned earlier, IRS historically has allocated two-thirds of its collection staff to the field, which comprises the last and least productive stage of the collection process. This is in contrast to private-sector collectors, who devote most of their resources to the earlier telephone stage.", "Several staffing-related projects have been affected by IRS\u2019 actions taken in response to its reduced appropriations for fiscal year 1996. One of these projects was focused on redesigning the operation of collection groups in the field to improve productivity and reduce costs. Although preliminary results appeared to IRS to be positive, IRS decided to stop the project in October 1995 for budgetary reasons.", "This Subcommittee\u2019s concern of several years\u2019 duration about IRS\u2019 delinquent tax collection efforts led to the provisions contained in IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1996 appropriations bill that earmark $13 million for a pilot program to test the use of private law firms and debt collection agencies to help collect delinquent tax debts. IRS issued a request for proposals from prospective participants in the pilot program on March 5, 1996. If done successfully, this program may open a new avenue for addressing some of IRS\u2019 collection problems.", "We recognize that IRS has many initiatives under way that could help to resolve the accounts receivable problem. But, we also recognize that IRS has pursued many initiatives over the years without bringing about the desired change. IRS is in the process of rescoping many of its planned modernization and operational initiatives because of changed budget priorities. However, a comprehensive strategy to guide IRS\u2019 efforts to improve collections and accounts receivable has not been developed. This strategy, which is critical to the successful resolution of IRS\u2019 accounts receivable problems, must recognize and address the five underlying causes of the problem\u2014causes that cut across the agency and across lines of managerial authority and responsibility."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Return-Free Filing", "paragraphs": ["Almost 100 million American taxpayers currently must file tax returns, even though most have fully paid their taxes through the withholding system. Given its potential for reducing taxpayer burden and IRS paper processing, we have been studying return-free filing systems and the potential impact they would have on the federal income tax system.", "While we are still in the process of finalizing our results, we can provide some preliminary information on (1) the two most common types of return-free filing, (2) the number of American taxpayers that could be affected by return-free filing, and (3) some of the issues that would need to be addressed before such a system could be used.", "In countries with return-free filing, the most common type of system we identified was that termed \u201cfinal withholding.\u201d Under this system, the withholder of income taxes determines the taxpayer\u2019s liability and withholds the correct tax liability from the taxpayer. With the final year-end payment to the taxpayer, the withholder makes a final reconciliation of taxes and adjusts the withholding for that period to equal the year\u2019s taxes.", "Another type of return-free filing\u2014known as \u201cagency reconciliation\u201d\u2014depends entirely on information reporting and allows the tax agency to determine the taxpayer\u2019s taxes based on these information documents. The tax agency then sends the taxpayer either a refund or a tax bill based on the tax liability and the amount of withholding. We identified 36 countries that use some form of return-free filing\u201434 with final withholding and 2 with tax agency reconciliation.", "Given the extent of withholding and information reporting that exists under our current tax system, we estimated that about 18.5 million American taxpayers whose incomes derive from only one employer could be covered under a final withholding system. Alternatively, an estimated 51 million taxpayers could be covered under the agency reconciliation system.", "We estimate that taxpayers could save 52 million hours in preparation time and millions of dollars in tax preparation costs under the final withholding system, and 170 million hours and millions of dollars in preparation time and costs under the tax agency reconciliation system. IRS would also save an estimated $45 million in processing costs under the final withholding system, and about $36 million under the tax agency reconciliation system, in processing and compliance costs. Employers would face additional burden and costs under the final withholding system, but we were unable to determine how much. system so that tax liabilities could be determined before April 15, which is also the tax filing deadline for some states.", "IRS\u2019 own 1987 study of return-free filing recognized this processing problem and recommended against return-free filing for that reason. However, given the many processing changes envisioned with the modernization of IRS\u2019 computer systems, this problem may be less of an obstacle than it was in 1987.", "Given the current tax system, a tax agency reconciliation system has the potential to reduce the filing burden on more taxpayers and also put less burden on payors than a final withholding system.", "In summary, IRS\u2019 TSM and delinquent debt collection efforts remain a serious concern to us. Although IRS is attempting to address some of the problems, their underlying causes remain and continue to hinder the potential for significant improvement. TSM, in particular, is at serious risk, and until the weaknesses are corrected, we believe that IRS\u2019 ability to successfully complete the program will remain highly questionable.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
