However, TSA is taking steps to collect additional data, including developing a 5-year performance plan detailing numerous performance measures, as well as fielding the Threat Image Projection system and increasing screener testing. In addition to collecting performance data, TSA could further strengthen passenger screening by fully deploying recurrent and supervisory training programs, determining the appropriate levels of screeners at the nation's airports, and improving oversight of the contract screener pilot program. Although TSA has developed and deployed basic and remedial training programs, it has not fully developed or deployed recurrent or supervisory training programs. In addition, TSA acknowledged that its initial staffing efforts created imbalances at the nation's airports, and that it has taken limited action to assess the performance of the pilot airports using private, versus federal, screeners. TSA is undertaking a number of actions to address these concerns, including strengthening its training program and awarding contracts to assess its staffing model and the performance of the contract pilot airports. TSA faces a number of other challenges as it continues to enhance aviation security. Significant challenges include implementing the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening System (CAPPS II), as well as strengthening baggage screening, airport perimeter and access controls, and air cargo and general aviation security. In implementing CAPPS II, TSA must ensure it addresses concerns surrounding travelers' privacy rights, the accuracy of databases used by CAPPS II, and obtaining international cooperation needed for the system to be fully operational. Additional challenges include integrating explosive detection systems into airport's in-line baggage handling systems, identifying cost-effective perimeter security technologies, effectively targeting air cargo for screening, and improving security at general aviation airports.

Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, billions of dollars have  been spent, and a wide variety of programs and initiatives have been  implemented to enhance aviation security. However, recent reviews and  covert testing conducted by GAO and the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General, as well as recent media reports,  indicate that weaknesses and vulnerabilities in commercial aviation  continue to exist. For example, the incident involving a college student  who placed box cutters, clay resembling plastic explosives, and bleach on  commercial aircraft show that aviation security can still be compromised.", "My testimony today highlights three key areas that TSA must focus on to  enhance aviation security. These areas include (1) measuring the  effectiveness of TSA\u2019s aviation security initiatives that have already been  implemented, (2) strengthening its passenger screening program, and   (3) addressing key programmatic and management challenges to further  enhance aviation security.

The Aviation and Transportation  Security Act (ATSA), which was established with the primary goal of  strengthening aviation security, requires that TSA establish acceptable  levels of performance for security initiatives and develop annual  performance plans and reports to measure and document the effectiveness  of those initiatives. Although TSA has developed an annual performance  plan and report as required by ATSA, to date these tools have focused on  TSA\u2019s progress in meeting deadlines to implement programs and initiatives  mandated by ATSA rather than on the effectiveness of these programs and  initiatives.

As demonstrated by the 1988 bombing of a U.S. airliner  over Lockerbie, Scotland, and the 1995 plot to blow up 12 U.S. aircraft in  the Pacific region discovered by Philippine authorities, U.S. commercial  aircraft have long been a target for terrorist attacks. Over the years,  numerous initiatives have been undertaken to improve aviation security.  However, as we and others have documented in numerous reports and  studies, weaknesses continue to exist. It was because of these weaknesses  that terrorists were able to hijack four commercial aircraft on September  11, 2001, with tragic results.", "In an effort to strengthen the security of commercial aviation, the  President signed into law the Aviation and Transportation Security Act  (ATSA) on November 19, 2001. ATSA created TSA as an agency within the  Department of Transportation with the responsibility for securing all  modes of transportation, including aviation. ATSA mandated specific  improvements to aviation security and established deadlines for  completing many of these initiatives. Consequently, TSA\u2019s main focus  during its first year of operation was on meeting these deadlines,  particularly federalizing the screener workforce at commercial airports  nationwide by November 19, 2002, while at the same time establishing a  new federal organization from the ground up. On March 1, 2003, pursuant  to the Homeland Security Act, TSA was transferred from the Department  of Transportation to the new Department of Homeland Security.", "Virtually all aviation security responsibilities now reside with TSA. One of  the most substantial of these is passenger screening. Passenger screening  involves the use of metal detectors, X-ray machines, explosive trace  detection machines, and physical searches to examine passengers and  their baggage to identify threat objects. Passenger screening has  historically been an area of concern. As we reported in 1987, and again in  2000, passenger screeners who conducted these examinations have had  difficultly in detecting weapons and other dangerous objects. At the time  we issued these reports, air carriers were responsible for performing  passenger screening. With the passage of ATSA, this responsibility has  now become the responsibility of TSA. TSA is also responsible for  ensuring the security of air cargo, limiting access to restricted areas of  airports to authorized personnel, securing airport perimeters, and  conducting background checks for airport personnel, among other  responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Information Exists on the Effectiveness of Aviation Security Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["TSA has implemented numerous initiatives designed to enhance aviation  security, but it has collected limited information on the effectiveness of  these initiatives, particularly its passenger screening program.

As we reported in September 2003, the primary source of  information collected on screeners\u2019 ability to detect threat objects is  covert testing conducted by TSA\u2019s Office of Internal Affairs and Program  Review. However, TSA does not consider the results of these covert tests  as a measure of performance, but rather a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a screener\u2019s  ability to detect threat objects at a particular point in time and as a system- wide performance indicator. At the time we issued our report, the Office of  Internal Affairs and Program Review had conducted 733 covert tests of  passenger screeners at 92 airports. As a result, only a small percentage of  TSA\u2019s passenger screeners had been subject to a covert test.", "In addition to conducting covert tests at screening checkpoints, TSA  conducts tests to determine whether the current Computer-Assisted  Passenger Screening System is working as designed; threat objects are  detected during the screening of checked baggage; and access to restricted  areas of the airport is limited only to authorized personnel. While the  Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review has conducted about 2,000  access tests, it has conducted only 168 Computer-Assisted Passenger  Screening System and checked baggage tests. Based on an anticipated  increase in staff from about 100 in fiscal year 2003 to 200 in fiscal year  2004, the Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review plans to conduct  twice as many covert tests next year.", "Another key source of data on screener performance in detecting threat  objects is the Threat Image Projection (TIP) system, which places images  of threat objects on the X-ray screen during actual operations and records  whether screeners identify the threat object. The Federal Aviation  Administration began deploying TIP in late 1999 to continually measure  screener performance and to train screeners in becoming more adept at  detecting hard-to-spot threat objects. However, TIP was shut down  immediately following the September 11 terrorist attacks because of  concerns that it would result in screening delays and panic, as screeners  might have thought that they were actually viewing a threat object.  Although TSA officials recognized that TIP is a key tool in measuring,  maintaining, and enhancing screener performance, they only recently  began reactivating TIP on a wide-scale basis because of competing  priorities, a lack of training, and a lack of resources needed to deploy TIP  activation teams. As TIP becomes operational at each airport, TSA  headquarters and federal security directors will have the capability to  query and analyze performance data in a number of ways, including by  individual screeners, checkpoints, terminals, and airports. TIP is expected  to be fully deployed and operational by April 2004.", "When fully deployed, the annual screener recertification test results will  provide another source of data on screener performance. ATSA requires  that TSA collect performance information on each screener through  conducting an annual proficiency review to ensure he or she continues to  meet all qualifications and standards required to perform the screening  function. Although TSA began deploying federal screeners to airports in  April 2002, TSA only recently began implementing the annual  recertification program and does not expect to complete testing at all  airports until March 2004. The recertification testing is comprised of three  components: (1) image recognition; (2) knowledge of standard operating  procedures; and (3) practical demonstration of skills, to be administered  by a contractor. TSA officials consider 28,000 screeners as having  completed the first two components because they successfully passed  competency tests TSA administered at many airports as part of a screener  workforce reduction effort. However, these competency tests did not  include the third component of TSA\u2019s planned annual screener  recertification program\u2014the practical demonstration of skills. TSA  officials awarded a contract for this component of the annual proficiency  reviews in September 2003.", "TSA\u2019s Performance Management Information System for passenger and  baggage screening operations is also designed to collect performance data,  but currently it contains limited information on screener performance in  detecting threat objects. The Performance Management Information  System collects a wide variety of metrics on workload, staffing, and  equipment and is used to identify some performance indicators, such as  the level of absenteeism, the average time for equipment repairs, and the  status of TSA\u2019s efforts to meet goals for 100 percent electronic baggage  screening. However, the system does not contain any performance  metrics related to the effectiveness of passenger screening. TSA is  planning to integrate performance information from various systems into  the Performance Management Information System to assist the agency in  making strategic decisions. TSA further plans to continuously enhance the  system as it learns what data are needed to best manage the agency. In  addition to making improvements to the Performance Management  Information System, TSA is currently developing performance indexes for  both individual screeners and the screening system as a whole. The  screener performance index will be based on data such as the results of  training and recertification tests, and the index for the screening system  will be based on information such as TIP results.

The Department of Homeland Security plans to  issue its strategic plan by the end of the year.", "In addition to developing a strategic plan, TSA is developing a  performance plan to help it evaluate the current effectiveness and levels of  improvement in its programs, based on established performance  measures. TSA submitted to the Congress a short-term performance plan  in May 2003, as required by ATSA, that included performance goals and  objectives. The plan also included an initial set of 32 performance  measures, including the percentage of bags screened by explosive  detection systems and the percentage of screeners in compliance with  training standards. However, these measures were primarily output-based  (measuring whether specific activities were achieved) and did not  measure the effectiveness of TSA\u2019s security initiatives.

Basic screener training consists of 40 hours of classroom  instruction and 60 hours of on-the-job training that screeners must  successfully complete prior to making independent screening decisions.  Additionally, TSA requires remedial training for any screener who fails an  operational test and prohibits screeners from performing the screening  function related to the test they failed until they successfully complete  remedial training. TSA screening supervisors may also require remedial  training for screeners they observe needing strengthening of their skills.", "Although TSA has deployed basic and remedial training programs, it has  not fully developed or deployed recurrent or supervisory training  programs to ensure that screeners are effectively trained and supervised.  Recurrent training\u2014the ongoing training of screeners on a frequent  basis\u2014is critical in maintaining and enhancing screener skills.

This has  led to staffing imbalances, and concern by federal security directors that  they had limited authority to respond to airport-specific staffing needs,  such as reacting to fluctuations in daily and seasonal passenger flow. TSA  officials acknowledged that their initial staffing efforts created imbalances  in the screener workforce, and reported that as they work to further  reduce the screener workforce, they will solicit input from the Federal  Security Directors as well as airport and air carrier officials. TSA has also  taken steps such as authorizing the hiring of part-time screeners at over  200 airports\u2014the first of whom began working in September 2003.", "To better address airport-specific staffing needs and accomplish  workforce reduction goals, TSA developed its current screener staffing  levels using a computer-based modeling process that took into account the  number of screening checkpoints and lanes at an airport; originating  passengers; the number of airport workers requiring screening; projected  air carrier service increases and decreases during the year; and hours  needed to accommodate screener training, leave, and breaks. TSA recently  hired an outside consultant to conduct a study of screener staffing levels  at various airports. TSA officials stated that they will continue to review  the staffing allocation process through the modeling efforts to assess air  carrier and airport growth patterns, and adjustments will be made as  appropriate.

The purpose of the 2-year pilot  program is to determine the feasibility of using private screening  companies rather than federal screeners. TSA initially required private  screening companies to adhere to all of the procedures and protocols used  by federal screeners. As a result, these airports had limited flexibility in  running screening operations. However, TSA recently provided the  contractors with some flexibility, such as allowing them to determine and  maintain their own staffing levels and to make independent hiring  decisions. ATSA gives all airport operators the option of applying to  change from using federal screeners to using private screeners beginning  in November 2004.", "TSA has not yet determined how to evaluate and measure the performance  of the pilot program airports or determine the feasibility of using contract  screening companies.

The evaluation is scheduled to  be completed by March 31, 2004. TSA has acknowledged that designing  an effective evaluation of the screeners at the pilot airports will be  challenging because key operational areas, including training, assessment,  compensation, and equipment, have to a large extent been held constant  across all airports, and therefore are not within the control of the private  screening companies. In its request for proposal for the pilot airport  evaluation, TSA identified several data sources for the evaluation,  including the Performance Management Information System and the  Office of Internal Affairs and Program Review\u2019s covert testing of passenger  screeners.

For  example, although the characteristics used to identify passengers for  additional screening are classified, several have become public knowledge  through the press or on the Internet. Although enhancements have been  made to address some of these weaknesses, the behavioral traits used in  the system may not reflect current intelligence information. It is also  difficult to quickly modify the system to respond to real-time changes in  threats. Additionally, because the current system operates independently  within each air carrier reservation system, changes to each air carrier\u2019s  system to modify the prescreening system can be costly and time- consuming.", "In contrast, CAPPS II is planned to be a government-run program that will  provide real-time risk assessment for all airline passengers. Unlike the  current system, TSA is designing CAPPS II to identify and compare  personal information with commercially available data to confirm a  passenger\u2019s identity. The system will then run the identifying information  against government databases and generate a \u201crisk\u201d score for the  passenger.

According to TSA, electronic screening can  be accomplished by bulk explosives detection systems (EDS) or  explosives trace detection (ETD) systems. However, TSA faced  challenges in meeting the mandated implementation date. First, the  production capabilities of EDS manufacturers were insufficient to produce  the number of units needed. Additionally, according to TSA, it was not  possible to undertake all of the airport modifications necessary to  accommodate the EDS equipment in each airport\u2019s baggage-handling area.", "In order to ensure that all checked baggage is screened, TSA established a  program that uses alternative measures, including explosives-sniffing  dogs, positive passenger bag match, and physical hand searches at  airports where sufficient EDS or ETD technology was not available.  Section 425 of the Homeland Security Act allowed the Under Secretary for  Transportation Security to grant airports unable to meet the December 31,  2002, 100 percent screening deadline an extension until December 31,  2003. Although TSA has made progress in implementing EDS technology at  more airports, it has reported that it will not meet the revised mandate for  100 percent electronic screening of all checked baggage. Specifically, as of  October 2003, TSA reported that it will not meet the deadline for  electronic screening by December 31, 2003, at five airports. Airport  representatives with whom we spoke expressed concern that there has not  been enough time to produce, install, and integrate all of the systems  required to meet the deadline.", "In addition to fielding the EDS systems at airports, difficulties exist in  integrating these systems into airport baggage-handling systems. For those  airports that have installed EDS equipment, many have been located in  airport lobbies as stand-alone systems. The chief drawback of stand-alone  systems is that because of their size and weight there is a limit to the  number of units that can be placed in airport lobbies, and numerous  screeners are required to handle the checked bags because each bag must  be physically conveyed to the EDS machines and then moved back to the  conveyor system for transport to the baggage-handling room in the air  terminal. Some airports are in the process of integrating the EDS  equipment inline with the conveyor belts that transport baggage from the  ticket counter to the baggage-handling area. However, the reconfiguring of  airports for in-line checked baggage screening can be extensive and  costly. TSA has reported that in-line EDS equipment installation costs  range from $1 million to $3 million per piece of equipment. In February  2003, we identified letters of intent as a funding option that has been  successfully used to leverage private sources of funding. TSA has since  written letters of intent covering seven airports promising multiyear  financial support totaling over $770 million for in-line integration of EDS  equipment. Further, TSA officials have stated that they have identified 25  to 35 airports as candidates for further letters of intent pending  Congressional authorization of funding. We are examining TSA\u2019s baggage  screening program, including its issuance of letters of intent, in an ongoing  assignment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Perimeter and Access Controls", "paragraphs": ["Prior to September 2001, work performed by GAO and others highlighted  the vulnerabilities in controls for limiting access to secure airport areas. In  one report, we noted that GAO special agents were able to use fictitious  law enforcement badges and credentials to gain access to secure areas,  bypass security checkpoints, and walk unescorted to aircraft departure  gates. The agents, who had been issued tickets and boarding passes,  could have carried weapons, explosives, or other dangerous objects onto  aircraft. Concerns over the adequacy of the vetting process for airport  workers who have unescorted access to secure airport areas have also  arisen, in part as a result of federal agency airport security sweeps that  uncovered hundreds of instances in which airport workers lied about their  criminal history, or immigration status, or provided false or inaccurate  Social Security numbers on their application for security clearances to  obtain employment.", "ATSA contains provisions to improve perimeter access security at the  nation\u2019s airports and strengthen background checks for employees  working in secure airport areas, and TSA has made some progress in this  area. For example, federal mandates were issued to strengthen airport  perimeter security by limiting the number of airport access points, and  they require random screening of individuals, vehicles, and property  before entry at the remaining perimeter access points. Further, TSA made  criminal history checks mandatory for employees with access to secure or  sterile airport areas. To date, criminal history checks have been conducted  on approximately 1 million of these employees. TSA also has plans to  develop a pilot airport security program and is reviewing security  technologies in the areas of biometrics access control identification  systems (i.e., fingerprints or iris scans), anti-piggybacking technologies (to  prevent more than one employee from entering a secure area at a time),  and video monitoring systems for perimeter security. TSA solicited  commercial airport participation in the program. It is currently reviewing  information from interested airports and plans to select 20 airports for the  program.", "Although progress has been made, challenges remain with perimeter  security and access controls at commercial airports. Specifically, ATSA  contains numerous requirements for strengthening perimeter security and  access controls, some of which contained deadlines, which TSA is  working to meet. In addition, a significant concern is the possibility of  terrorists using shoulder-fired portable missiles from locations near the  airport. We reported in June 2003 that airport operators have increased  their patrols of airport perimeters since September 2001, but industry  officials stated that they do not have enough resources to completely  protect against missile attacks. A number of technologies could be used  to secure and monitor airport perimeters, including barriers, motion  sensors, and closed-circuit television. Airport representatives have  cautioned that as security enhancements are made to airport perimeters, it  will be important for TSA to coordinate with the Federal Aviation  Administration and the airport operators to ensure that any enhancements  do not pose safety risks for aircraft. To further examine these threats and  challenges, we have ongoing work assessing TSA\u2019s progress in meeting  ATSA provisions related to improving perimeter security, access controls,  and background checks for airport employees and other individuals with  access to secure areas of the airport, as well as the nature and extent of  the threat from shoulder-fired missiles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Cargo Security", "paragraphs": ["As we and the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General have  reported, vulnerabilities exist in ensuring the security of cargo carried  aboard commercial passenger and all-cargo aircraft. TSA has reported that  an estimated 12.5 million tons of cargo are transported each year\u20149.7  million tons on all-cargo planes and 2.8 million tons on passenger planes.  Potential security risks are associated with the transport of air cargo\u2014 including the introduction of undetected explosive and incendiary devices  in cargo placed aboard aircraft. To reduce these risks, ATSA requires that  all cargo carried aboard commercial passenger aircraft be screened and  that TSA have a system in place as soon as practicable to screen, inspect,  or otherwise ensure the security of cargo on all-cargo aircraft. Despite  these requirements, it has been reported that less than 5 percent of cargo  placed on passenger airplanes is physically screened. TSA\u2019s primary  approach to ensuring air cargo security and safety is to ensure compliance  with the \u201cknown shipper\u201d program\u2014which allows shippers that have  established business histories with air carriers or freight forwarders to  ship cargo on planes. However, we and the Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General have identified weaknesses in the  known shipper program and in TSA\u2019s procedures for approving freight  forwarders, such as possible tampering with freight at various handoff  points before it is loaded into an aircraft.", "Since September 2001, TSA has taken a number of actions to enhance  cargo security, such as implementing a database of known shippers in  October 2002. The database is the first phase in developing a cargo  profiling system similar to the Computer-Assisted Passenger Prescreening  System. However, in December 2002, we reported that additional  operational and technological measures, such as checking the identity of  individuals making cargo deliveries, have the potential to improve air  cargo security in the near term. We further reported that TSA lacks a  comprehensive plan with long-term goals and performance targets for  cargo security, time frames for completing security improvements, and  risk-based criteria for prioritizing actions to achieve those goals.  Accordingly, we recommended that TSA develop a comprehensive plan for  air cargo security that incorporates a risk management approach, includes  a list of security priorities, and sets deadlines for completing actions. TSA  agreed with this recommendation and expects to develop such a plan by  the end of 2003. It will be important that this plan include a timetable for  implementation to help ensure that vulnerabilities in this area are reduced."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "General Aviation Security", "paragraphs": ["Since September 2001, TSA has taken limited action to improve general  aviation security, leaving general aviation far more open and potentially  vulnerable than commercial aviation. General aviation is vulnerable  because general aviation pilots and passengers are not screened before  takeoff and the contents of general aviation planes are not screened at any  point. General aviation includes more than 200,000 privately owned  airplanes, which are located in every state at more than 19,000 airports.  More than 550 of these airports also provide commercial service. In the  last 5 years, about 70 aircraft have been stolen from general aviation  airports, indicating a potential weakness that could be exploited by  terrorists. This vulnerability was demonstrated in January 2002, when a  teenage flight student stole and crashed a single-engine airplane into a  Tampa, Florida skyscraper. Moreover, general aviation aircraft could be  used in other types of terrorist acts. It was reported that the September  11th hijackers researched the use of crop dusters to spread biological or  chemical agents.", "We reported in September 2003 that TSA had chartered a working group  on general aviation within the existing Aviation Security Advisory  Committee. The working group consists of industry stakeholders and is  designed to identify and recommend actions to close potential security  gaps in general aviation. On October 1, 2003, the working group issued a  report that included a number of recommendations for general aviation  airport operators\u2019 voluntary use in evaluating airports\u2019 security  requirements. These recommendations are both broad in scope and  generic in their application, with the intent that every general aviation  airport and landing facility operators may use them to evaluate that  facility\u2019s physical security, procedures, infrastructure, and resources. TSA  is taking some additional action to strengthen security at general aviation  airports, including developing a risk-based self-assessment tool for general  aviation airports to use in identifying security concerns. We have ongoing  work that is examining general aviation security in further detail."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation Security Funding", "paragraphs": ["TSA faces two key funding and accountability challenges in securing the  commercial aviation system: (1) paying for increased aviation security,  and (2) ensuring that these costs are controlled. These challenges are  particularly critical due to the government incurring large and increasing  deficits. The rapid rise in needed funding for aviation security  enhancements further exacerbates budget challenges. The costs  associated with aviation security are huge. The Department of Homeland  Security appropriation includes $3.7 billion for aviation security for fiscal  year 2004. The passenger and baggage screening functions alone account  for most of this funding, with about $1.8 billion appropriated for passenger  screening and $1.3 billion for baggage screening. ATSA created passenger  and air carrier security fees to pay for the costs of aviation security, but  the fees have not generated enough money to do so. The Department of  Transportation\u2019s Inspector General reported that the security fees are  estimated to generate only about $1.7 billion during fiscal year 2004.", "A major funding challenge is paying for the purchase and installation of  the remaining explosives detection systems, including integration into  airport baggage-handling systems. Integrating the equipment with the  baggage-handling systems is expected to be costly because it will require  major facility modifications. For example, modifications needed to  integrate the equipment at Boston\u2019s Logan International Airport are  estimated to cost $146 million. Modifications for Dallas/Fort Worth  International Airport are estimated to cost $193 million. According to TSA  and the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General, the cost of  integrating the equipment nationwide could be $3 billion.", "A key question that must be addressed is how to pay for these installation  costs. The Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s Airport Improvement  Program (AIP) and passenger facility charges have been eligible sources  for funding this work. During fiscal year 2002, AIP grant funds totaling  $561 million were used for terminal modifications to enhance security.  However, using these funds for security reduced the funding available for  other airport development and rehabilitation projects. To provide financial  assistance to airports for security-related capital investments, such as the  installation of explosives detection equipment, proposed aviation  reauthorization legislation would establish an aviation security capital  fund that would authorize $2 billion over the next 4 years.", "In February 2003, we identified letters of intent as a funding option that  has been successfully used to leverage private sources of funding. TSA  has since signed letters of intent covering seven airports\u2014Boston Logan,  Dallas/Fort Worth, Denver, Los Angeles, McCarran (Las Vegas), Ontario  (California), and Seattle/Tacoma international airports. Under the  agreements, TSA will pay 75 percent of the cost of integrating the  explosives detection equipment into the baggage-handling systems. The  payments will stretch out over 3 to 4 years. TSA officials have identified  more airports that would be candidates for similar agreements.", "Another challenge is ensuring continued investment in transportation  research and development. For fiscal year 2003, TSA was appropriated  about $110 million for research and development, of which $75 million  was designated for the next-generation explosives detection systems.  However, TSA proposed to reprogram $61.2 million of these funds to be  used for other purposes, leaving about $12.7 million to be spent on  research and development in that year. This proposed reprogramming  could limit TSA\u2019s ability to sustain and strengthen aviation security by  continuing to invest in research and development for more effective  equipment to screen passengers, their carry-on and checked baggage, and  cargo. In ongoing work, we are examining the nature and scope of  research and development work by TSA and the Department of Homeland  Security, including their strategy for accelerating the development of  transportation security technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Management", "paragraphs": ["As it organizes itself to protect the nation\u2019s transportation system, TSA  faces the challenge of strategically managing its workforce of about 60,000  people\u2014more than 80 percent of whom are passenger and baggage  screeners. Additionally, over the next several years, TSA faces the  challenge of sizing and managing this workforce as efficiency is improved  with new security-enhancing technologies, processes, and procedures. For  example, as explosives detection systems are integrated with baggage- handling systems, the use of more labor-intensive screening methods, such  as trace detection techniques and manual bag searches, can be reduced.  Other planned security enhancements, such as CAPPS II and a registered  traveler program, also have the potential to make screening more efficient.  Further, if airports opt out of the federal screener program and use their  own or contract employees to provide screening instead of TSA screeners,  a significant impact on TSA staffing could occur.", "To assist agencies in managing their human capital more strategically, we  have developed a model that identifies cornerstones and related critical  success factors that agencies should apply and steps they can take. Our  model is designed to help agency leaders effectively lead and manage their  people and integrate human capital considerations into daily decision  making and the program results they seek to achieve. In January 2003, we  reported that TSA was addressing some critical human capital success  factors by using a wide range of tools available for hiring, and beginning to  link individual performance to organizational goals. However, concerns  remain about the size and training of that workforce, the adequacy of the  initial background checks for screeners, and TSA\u2019s progress in setting up a  performance management system. TSA is currently developing a human  capital strategy, which it expects to be completed by the end of this year.", "TSA has proposed cutting the screener workforce by an additional 3,000  during fiscal year 2004. This planned reduction has raised concerns about  passenger delays at airports and has led TSA to begin hiring part-time  screeners to make more flexible and efficient use of its workforce. In  addition, TSA used an abbreviated background check process to hire and  deploy enough screeners to meet ATSA\u2019s screening deadlines during 2002.  After obtaining additional background information, TSA terminated the  employment of some of these screeners. TSA reported 1,208 terminations  as of May 31, 2003, that it ascribed to a variety of reasons, including  criminal offenses and failures to pass alcohol and drug tests. Furthermore,  the national media have reported allegations of operational and  management control problems that emerged with the expansion of the  Federal Air Marshal Service, including inadequate background checks and  training, uneven scheduling, and inadequate policies and procedures. We  reported in January 2003 that TSA had taken the initial steps in  establishing a performance management system linked to organizational  goals. Such a system will be critical for TSA to motivate and manage staff,  ensure the quality of screeners\u2019 performance, and, ultimately, restore  public confidence in air travel. In ongoing work, we are examining the  effectiveness of TSA\u2019s efforts to train, equip, and supervise passenger  screeners, and we are assessing the effects of expansion on the Federal  Air Marshal Service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["TSA faces many challenges in strengthening its passenger screening and  other security programs.
