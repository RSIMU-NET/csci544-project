The number of veterans authorized to use community care increased from 1.3 million to 1.8 million during this period.

These services include outpatient and inpatient care, among others. For the remainder of its community care budget estimate, which includes nursing care in state-operated homes, VA uses other methods based on historical utilization.

The majority of veterans utilizing VA health care  services receive care in VA-operated medical facilities, including 170 VA  medical centers and over 1,000 outpatient facilities. However, veterans  may also obtain services from non-VA providers in the community\u2014 known as community care\u2014through one of several community care  programs aimed at helping ensure veterans receive timely and accessible  care.", "In the last 5 years, Congress has taken steps to expand the availability of  community care for veterans.

Implemented in fiscal  year 2015, the temporary authority and funding of the Choice Program  was separate from that of other previously existing programs through  which VA has the option to purchase care from community providers. In  2018, the VA MISSION Act was enacted requiring VA to implement within  one year a permanent community care program\u2014the Veterans  Community Care Program\u2014that consolidates the Choice Program along  with several other community care programs. The act, among other  things, requires VA to ensure veterans can receive timely and accessible  community care when certain criteria are met.

This budget estimate is one step in a complex, multistep  budget formulation process that culminates in an appropriations request  for VA health care in the President\u2019s annual budget request to Congress.  Developing this estimate is inherently complex, as assumptions and  imperfect information are used to project the likely quantity and cost of the  health care services VA expects to provide.

VA uses the EHCPM to make projections 3 and 4 years into  the future for budget purposes based on data from the most recent fiscal  year.

In addition, after  this adjustment, VA made additional changes to the community care  budget estimate, which resulted in a net increase of $2.5 billion. Nearly all  of this increase reflected an anticipated impact of the expanded access  under the Choice Program, according to VA officials.

According to VA officials, VA was able to continue using these other  methods, because the services under these programs have been  provided through community providers and not VA medical facilities.  While methods for each program vary, in general, these methods are  based on each program\u2019s historical utilization and costs.

These health care  services were grouped into seven service types and include outpatient  care, inpatient care, and long-term care. (See app. III for a list of the  health care services). Of these services, outpatient services typically  accounted for the largest share of VA\u2019s community care budget estimate.  For the remainder of community care services\u2014including services  provided under the state home per diem program and benefit programs\u2014 VA did not use the EHCPM and instead continued to use the other  methods it has historically used to develop budget estimates for these  services. (See fig. 6.)", "VA made several changes to the EHCPM to develop most of its  community care budget estimate. Historically, the EHCPM estimated  resources needed to meet the total expected demand for VA health  care\u2014a combination of care provided in VA medical facilities and through  community care programs. VA updated the EHCPM to determine the  proportion of demand met by community care by projecting enrolled  veterans\u2019 expected utilization of community care and the expected costs  of purchasing these services. In what follows, we describe five major  changes made to the EHCPM allowing VA to estimate the budgetary  resources needed for community care.  1.  Reliance on community care services. The EHCPM has historically  accounted for the extent to which enrolled veterans would be  projected to obtain health care services through the VA as opposed to  other health care programs or insurers\u2014referred to as reliance on VA  health care. VA updated the EHCPM so that it can further account  for the extent to which enrolled veterans would be expected to use  VA\u2019s community care programs as opposed to using care in VA\u2019s  medical facilities. Each year, the EHCPM determines reliance on VA  community care based on a combination of historical experience\u2014or  the extent to which community care was used in prior fiscal years\u2014 and on the projected impact of new VA policies and operational  guidance. For example, for the fiscal year 2019 budget estimates, the  EHCPM projected reliance on VA care to be about 38 percent, of  which 14 percent would be met through community care. Thus, the  EHCPM projected reliance on VA\u2019s community care programs to be  about 5.3 percent for all care enrolled veterans are projected to use in  fiscal year 2019.  2.  Accounting for difference in community providers\u2019 efficiency  delivering inpatient services. VA also updated the EHCPM so that  community care utilization projections account for the fact that  veterans receiving inpatient care through community providers  generally have relatively shorter lengths of inpatient stays compared  with veterans receiving care at VA medical facilities. According to  officials from VA and its actuarial consultant, community providers on  average have historically performed better than VA providers on  national benchmarks measuring how well providers manage the  length of inpatient stays, while not affecting quality of care. To account  for this difference, VA uses an adjustment factor when projecting  utilization of inpatient services based on potentially avoidable days of  care for community providers.  3.  Comparing projected utilization with actual utilization for  community care services. VA developed an adjustment factor for  the EHCPM\u2019s utilization estimates to account specifically for the  differences between projected utilization and actual utilization of  community care for the most recently completed fiscal year of data.  According to VA officials, the difference typically reflects utilization  behavior among providers or patients that are difficult to estimate  based solely on historical data\u2014such as changes in local practice  patterns (e.g., providers choosing to use magnetic resonance imaging  versus x-rays). To account for this behavior, VA compares projected  and actual utilization and creates an \u201cactual-to-expected\u201d adjustment  factor for each health care service to account for the difference.  4.  Projecting unit costs for community care services. VA updated  the EHCPM so that it could estimate what are known as the unit costs  of purchasing community care services for veterans. In general, the  unit cost of a community care service comprises the payment made to  the provider (known as direct patient costs), as well as the indirect  costs associated with administration and overhead. Indirect costs  include (1) the fees paid to the contractors for administrative  responsibilities for the Choice Program, (2) VA billing and processing  costs and care coordination costs associated community care  programs, and (3) certain costs associated with the VA Central Office  that support community care (e.g., the salaries for officials from the  Office of Community Care and other VA Central Office officials).  5.
