GAO investigators created fictitious companies, used counterfeit documents, and invented a fictitious medical device to investigate three key aspects of the IRB system. These are the results: Establishing an IRB. GAO created a Web site for a bogus IRB and advertised the bogus IRB's services in newspapers and online. A real medical research company contacted the bogus IRB to get approval to join ongoing human trials involving invasive surgery--even though GAO's investigators had no medical expertise whatsoever. Since the transaction involved privately funded human subjects research and did not involve any FDA-regulated drugs or devices, GAO's bogus IRB could have authorized this testing to begin without needing to register with any federal agency. Obtaining an HHS-approved assurance. GAO also registered its bogus IRB with HHS, and used this registration to apply for an HHS-approved assurance for GAO's fictitious medical device company. An assurance is a statement by researchers to HHS that their human subjects research will follow ethical principles and federal regulations, which is required before researchers can receive federal funding for the research. On its assurance application, GAO designated its bogus IRB as the IRB that would review the research covered by the assurance. Even though the entire process was done online or by fax--without any human interaction--HHS approved the assurance for GAO's fictitious device company. With an HHS-approved assurance, GAO's device company could have applied for federal funding for human subjects research. Obtaining IRB approval for human testing. GAO succeeded in getting approval from an actual IRB to test a fictitious medical device on human subjects. GAO's fictitious device had fake specifications and matched several examples of \"significant risk\" devices from FDA guidance. The IRB did not verify the information submitted by GAO, which included false information that FDA had already cleared GAO's device for marketing. Although records from this IRB indicated that it believed GAO's bogus device was \"probably very safe,\" two other IRBs that rejected GAO's protocol cited safety concerns with GAO's device. No human interaction with these IRBs was necessary as the entire process was done through e-mail or fax. GAO's bogus IRB mentioned above also could have approved the fictitious protocol, which shows the potential for unethical manipulation in the IRB system. GAO briefed HHS officials on the results of its investigation. The director of OHRP stated that, when reviewing assurance applications, HHS does not consider whether IRBs listed on the applications are adequate--even though HHS is required to do so by law. In addition, HHS officials stated that the department does not review assurance applications to determine whether the information submitted by applicants is factual."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation of  vulnerabilities in the institutional review board (IRB) system. An IRB is an  entity formally designated to review and monitor biomedical and  behavioral research in clinical trials involving human subjects, with the  intended purpose of protecting the rights and welfare of the research  subjects. Each year, millions of Americans enroll in clinical trials of  experimental drugs and medical devices conducted in over 350,000  locations throughout the United States. Many of these clinical trials are  meant to demonstrate that products are safe and effective, and are  sometimes conducted or sponsored by private pharmaceutical and  medical device manufacturers. Although research subjects are required to  give consent prior to their participation in these studies, a patient has the  expectation that the product being tested presents a risk that is reasonable  in relation to any anticipated benefits, and that all risks are fully disclosed.  The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office for Human  Research Protections (OHRP) and the Food and Drug Administration  (FDA) are responsible for overseeing aspects of the system of IRBs.", "Unfortunately the IRB system sometimes fails to protect research subjects.  For example, in 2002, a 47-year-old man died after his heart stopped  beating while participating in an experimental trial of antipsychotic  medication at a Texas research center. Before his death, the man spent 22  days suffering from fever, severe diarrhea, a rapid heartbeat, and kidney  failure while under the care of researchers. The warning label for the  experimental medication listed some of these serious side-effects and  other signs of heart failure, but the IRB failed to ensure the risks were  communicated to participants at the outset of the trial. During the clinical  trial, the lead researcher continually delegated control of the clinical trial  to a man who was unlicensed to practice medicine in the United States. In  its follow-up investigation after the death, the FDA noted that the IRB  repeatedly violated regulations governing the proper conduct of clinical  trials and did not adequately supervise the clinical trial.", "Most IRBs were historically located at academic institutions. However,  independent IRBs are playing an increasingly prominent role in the  protection of human research subjects. Questions have been raised as to  whether all of these independent IRBs exercise effective due diligence in  reviewing research protocols. Given the importance of IRBs in protecting  human health and safety, you asked us to perform undercover tests to find  out whether the IRB system is vulnerable to unethical manipulation.  Specifically, we investigated three key aspects of the IRB system: (1) the  process for establishing an IRB, (2) the process through which researchers  who wish to apply for federal funding assure HHS that their activities  related to human subjects are guided by ethical principles and federal  regulations, and (3) the process that medical research companies follow to  get approval for conducting research on human subjects.", "To investigate the process for establishing an IRB, we created a fictitious  IRB with phony company officials and only a mailbox for a business  location. We then registered our fictitious IRB with HHS using its online  registration form. We created a Web site that resembled those of other  actual IRBs. We also advertised the services of our bogus IRB in various  media, such as Web sites dedicated to the clinical trials industry and  newspapers, in an attempt to persuade legitimate medical researchers to  send protocols to our bogus IRB. In our advertisements, we stated that we  were \u201cHHS approved,\u201d in reference to our bogus IRB\u2019s registration with  HHS. In addition, we emphasized the speed of our review process (\u201cFast  Approval!\u201d), customer service, and flexibility to customer needs in order  to make our IRB look as attractive as possible.", "To investigate the process through which human subjects researchers who  wish to apply for federal funding assure HHS that their activities related to  human subjects are guided by ethical principles and federal regulations,  we attempted to file a Federalwide Assurance for the Protection of Human  Subjects for Institutions Within the United States (assurance) application  using HHS\u2019s online application form, under the guise of a fictitious medical  device company. We created a fictitious medical device company with  phony company officials and only a mailbox for a business location,  claiming that this mailbox was the facility where we intended to conduct  our human subjects testing. As part of filing for an assurance, we were  required to submit information about the IRB that would be reviewing our  research protocol, for which we listed our fictitious IRB.", "To investigate the process that medical research companies follow to get  approval for conducting research on human subjects, we created a  research protocol for a fictitious medical device with no proven test  history and bogus specifications, using information publicly available on  the Internet. We designed our protocol so that it would contain vague  information about certain aspects of our proposed study. Our fictitious  device was a post-surgical healing device for women that matched  multiple examples of \u201csignificant risk\u201d devices provided in publicly  available FDA guidance. Our bogus medical device company then  approached three actual, independent IRBs with information about our  device and indicated that we wanted to submit our protocol for review and  approval to conduct human testing. We selected these three IRBs by  conducting a search online to identify independent IRBs, and then  choosing three that we determined had less burdensome initial paperwork  requirements than other IRBs for protocol submission. We fabricated  additional documents requested by the IRBs for their initial review of our  protocol, such as a curriculum vitae (CV) detailing our fictitious  researcher\u2019s educational and professional experience, and a medical  license for our fictitious researcher. We created these counterfeit  documents by using information found online and with commercially  available hardware, software, and materials. After concluding the  undercover portion of our investigation, we contacted two of the three  IRBs to obtain information about their review process.", "We performed this investigation from January 2008 to March 2009 in  accordance with quality standards for investigations prescribed by the  President\u2019s Council for Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of HHS has issued regulations that form the \u201cFederal Policy  for the Protection of Human Subjects.\u201d This policy is often referred to as  the \u201cCommon Rule\u201d because 17 other federal agencies that conduct,  support, or regulate human subjects testing now follow some form of the  policy. The Common Rule lays out the basic policies that should govern  any research involving human subjects that is approved, funded, or  conducted by the agencies that follow the Common Rule, as well as by all  entities that need these agencies\u2019 approval of their human subjects  research.", "Much of the Common Rule focuses on the role of IRBs in the testing  process, as IRBs are the primary oversight mechanism for human testing.  For example, the policy specifies that there must be at least five members  of an IRB, with varying backgrounds, who are sufficiently qualified  through experience, expertise, and diversity. The IRB must include  members who have the professional competence to review the specific  research activities being considered, as well as members with an  understanding of a testing entity\u2019s internal protocols, the applicable law,  and standards of professional conduct. Furthermore, among other  requirements, the IRB should have members of mixed gender and mixed  professions; should include at least one member with a scientific  background and one with a nonscientific background; and should not have  any members with a conflict of interest with the project being reviewed.", "The IRB review process is intended to assure, both in advance and by  periodic review, that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and  welfare of humans participating as subjects in the research. IRBs have the  authority to approve, require modifications in, or disapprove proposed  research. Figure 1 below provides a simplified illustration of the IRB  approval process for human subjects research protocols. By law, clinical  trials of experimental medical devices and drugs involving human subjects  cannot begin until an IRB has approved the research protocol and any  changes requested by the IRB have been made. To approve a research  proposal, IRBs must determine that the following requirements are  satisfied:  risks to research participants are minimized;  risks to research participants are reasonable in relation to any  anticipated benefits, and to the importance of the knowledge that the  research might produce;  informed consent will be sought from each prospective study  participant or the participant\u2019s authorized representative; and  there are adequate provisions in place to protect research participants\u2019  privacy and to maintain the confidentiality of research data.", "When seeking to obtain research participants\u2019 informed consent to  participate in a study, researchers must make sure they offer the potential  participants sufficient opportunity to consider whether or not to  participate without undue influence or possibility of coercion. In addition,  consent forms must contain language that is easily understood, and cannot  contain any language that causes or appears to cause the participants to  waive their legal rights, or that minimizes or appears to minimize the  liability for negligence of the researcher and the sponsors of the research.  In addition to reviewing proposed research protocols, IRBs are  responsible for conducting continuing review of research at least once a  year, or more frequently if the research represents a higher degree of risk  to the human research subjects.", "IRBs also play a central role in the process by which entities apply for  federal funding for human subjects research. An entity must have an  approved assurance in order to receive federal funding for research  involving human subjects testing from HHS and other federal agencies. An  assurance is basically a declaration submitted by an entity engaged in  human subjects research that it will comply with the requirements for the  protection of human subjects under 45 C.F.R. Part 46. HHS has jurisdiction  over human subjects research that is supported through federal funding,  and approves assurances for federalwide use. As such, other federal  agencies that have adopted the Common Rule may rely on an assurance  from HHS for any human subjects research they sponsor. To obtain an  assurance, HHS requires an entity to declare to HHS that its activities  related to human subjects are guided by ethical principles and federal  regulations\u2014the Common Rule\u2014and to designate one or more IRBs to  review the research covered by the assurance. In order for the application  for assurance to be approved by HHS, all IRBs listed on the application are  required to be registered with HHS. IRB registration involves providing  HHS with basic information about the IRB, such as the name and contact  information for the organization operating the IRB and for its head official,  and the names and qualifications of its board members. In evaluating an  application to determine whether or not to approve an assurance, HHS is  required to consider, among other things, the adequacy of the proposed  IRB in relation to the research activities of the entity that submitted the  assurance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Results of Investigation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Establishing an IRB", "paragraphs": ["We succeeded in getting a real company to send a research protocol and  related materials to our bogus IRB for its review.

For  example, we provided IRB 1 with bogus information that FDA had already  cleared our device for marketing because our device was found to be  substantially equivalent to an existing, legally marketed device. IRB 1 did  not attempt to verify this information even though a quick check of FDA\u2019s  online database would have shown no evidence that FDA had ever cleared  our device. By taking advantage of this lapse, our investigators\u2014who  lacked technical expertise in this subject\u2014bypassed any requirement to  develop a risk assessment for a device that, under normal circumstances,  would be considered \u201csignificant risk\u201d according to FDA guidance.

The extensive nature of  the feedback IRB 2 and IRB 3 provided on our initial submission materials  indicated that they follow a much more thorough review process than   IRB 1, which approved our protocol. For example, IRB 2 noticed that our  fictitious protocol mentioned previous testing of the device performed on  animals, and requested that we provide a copy of the results from the  fictitious animal testing. In addition, IRB 3 requested that we send it a  copy of the diagram that our bogus researcher would use to record  incision lines he made as part of the surgery involved in our study, and  raised a number of questions about the timing and locations involved in  our fictitious testing. The documents and information that IRB 2 and IRB 3  requested would have taken extensive time and research to fabricate, and  demanded a level of technical expertise that we did not possess. IRB 1  approved our protocol without obtaining any of the additional information  requested by IRB 2 and IRB 3.

Representatives from both IRBs expressed concern that our protocol did  not contain adequate information about the safety of our fictitious medical  device. For example, the manager of IRB 2 said that she worried that our  device could cause infection in patients, or possibly even cause patients to  develop sepsis. In addition, a board member from IRB 3, who claimed to  have 15 years of experience reviewing research protocols with this IRB,  stated that our protocol lacked any evidence that our bogus medical  device was actually safe for implantation into a human body.
