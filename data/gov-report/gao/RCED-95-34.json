Nearly 50 percent of this trade, by value, was transported by sea. Throughout much of this century, however, the U.S. merchant marine industry has struggled to compete effectively in the international market. The U.S. ocean-going fleet is the ninth largest fleet in the world by deadweight tonnage, comprising about 3 percent of the world fleet\u2019s tonnage. The U.S. fleet, as of September 1993, comprised 371 privately owned vessels.", "U.S.-flag vessels are not competitive in international trade\u2014cargo carried between U.S. and foreign ports or between foreign ports\u2014because they generally have higher operating and capital costs than foreign-flag vessels. (Foreign-flag vessels are restricted from carrying cargo between domestic ports.) According to Maritime Administration (MARAD) officials, crew costs account for the largest portion of the difference between the operating costs of U.S.- and foreign-flag vessels. U.S. crews receive higher wages and other benefits, and U.S.-flag vessels have higher manning level requirements than comparable foreign-flag vessels. Also, because U.S. shipyards generally charge more to build and maintain vessels than foreign shipyards, U.S.-flag vessels have higher capital and maintenance costs.", "To help the U.S. merchant marine industry compete, the Congress has enacted a number of laws supporting the industry, including cargo preference laws, which require that most government-owned or -financed cargo that is shipped internationally be carried aboard U.S.-flag vessels. This cargo is known as preference cargo. Cargo preference laws guarantee a minimum amount of business for the U.S. merchant fleet; this additional business, in turn, promotes the remainder of the maritime industry because U.S.-flag vessels are required by law to be crewed by U.S. mariners, are generally required to be built in U.S. shipyards, and are encouraged to be maintained and repaired in U.S. shipyards. However, because U.S.-flag vessels often charge higher rates to transport cargo than foreign-flag vessels, cargo preference laws increase the government\u2019s transportation costs.", "Cargo preference laws have long been controversial both from an economic and a political point of view. The proponents of cargo preference laws point to this nation\u2019s economic dependence on waterborne transportation for international trade and the role that merchant vessels play in transporting military supplies during wartime. They maintain that a strong merchant marine industry is vital to the nation\u2019s economic and military security and that cargo preference laws help to counter the subsidies that many foreign countries provide to their merchant fleets.", "The opponents of cargo preference laws, on the other hand, argue that cargo preference laws cost the government money, have not been successful in maintaining a strong merchant marine industry, and do not always support the most militarily useful vessels. They also point out that the additional transportation costs hamper federal efforts to provide humanitarian aid overseas because the available funds are diverted to the transportation of that aid, instead of being used to purchase farm commodities and other types of aid."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The U.S. Merchant Marine Fleet", "paragraphs": ["Recently, MARAD reported that U.S. citizens, corporations, or the federal government owns about 893 ocean-going vessels weighing 1,000 gross tons or more.

Of the 586 U.S.-flag vessels, MARAD reported that 371 were privately owned and 215 were owned by the federal government. Most of the privately owned vessels are actively engaged in commerce, while most of the federally owned vessels are in long-term storage\u2014held in MARAD\u2019s custody in case they are needed during a national emergency.", "Foreign-flagged vessels owned by U.S. citizens or corporations, like all foreign-flagged vessels, are subject to the laws of the foreign country whose flag they fly, not the laws to which U.S.-flag vessels are subject. Sometimes, the laws of foreign countries include significant obstacles to the requisition of the vessels by the United States during national emergencies. Of the 307 U.S.-owned but foreign-flagged vessels, 219 are flagged in countries that do not have policies disallowing the U.S. government from requisitioning these vessels during national emergencies. The countries are the Bahamas, Honduras, Liberia, the Marshall Islands, and Panama. U.S.-flag vessels registered in these countries are said to be under \u201cEffective U.S. Control\u201d (EUSC). But according to MARAD officials, there is no guarantee, should requisitioning be necessary, that these nations will actually permit their vessels to be taken by the United States. And even if the United States is able to take foreign-flag EUSC vessels, the foreign crews cannot be compelled to operate the vessels, and the operators are not obligated to return the vessels to the United States. In addition, EUSC vessels are not subject to any of the other laws or regulations that apply specifically to U.S.-flag vessels.", "As of January 1993, the privately owned U.S.-flag vessels constituted the ninth largest fleet in the world by deadweight tons (DWT). These vessels have a carrying capacity of 18.8 million DWTs, which comprises about 3 percent of the world fleet\u2019s tonnage. Of the 371 privately owned U.S.-flag vessels, MARAD reported that 23 were inactive, 49 were chartered by the Department of Defense (DOD), 134 were engaged in domestic trade, and 165 were engaged in international trade.

As a result, U.S.-flag vessels generally have higher capital and maintenance costs. Although not all U.S.-flag ships were built in U.S. shipyards, the Tariff Act of 1930 (P.L. 361) imposes a 50-percent tariff on the cost of maintenance and nonemergency repairs performed on U.S.-flag vessels in foreign shipyards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Requirements and Purposes of Cargo Preference Laws", "paragraphs": ["Since the passage of the first cargo preference law\u2014the Cargo Preference Act of 1904 (P.L. 198)\u2014the Congress has, in response to general downturns in the maritime industry, repeatedly reaffirmed its intent to support the U.S. merchant marine industry. Following the 1904 act, several major cargo preference laws were passed that guarantee cargo to U.S.-flag vessels; this guarantee was intended to promote the merchant marine industry. The 1904 act generally requires that only U.S.-flag vessels be used to transport supplies for the U.S. armed forces by sea. However, if the President finds that the rate charged by those vessels is excessive or otherwise unreasonable, contracts for transportation may be made as otherwise provided by law.", "In 1934, the Congress passed Public Resolution 17, which requires that all cargo financed by the Export-Import Bank be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels, unless granted a waiver. In 1936, the Congress passed the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (P.L. 835), which required that a \u201csubstantial portion\u201d of internationally shipped cargo be transported on U.S.-flag vessels. In 1954, the Congress passed the Cargo Preference Act of 1954, which amended the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 to require that at least 50 percent of any government-controlled cargo shipped by sea be carried on privately owned U.S.-flag vessels. However, the 50-percent provision can be waived if U.S.-flag vessels are not available at \u201cfair and reasonable\u201d rates and in certain emergency situations. And finally, the Congress passed the Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198), which increased from 50 to 75 percent the percentage of food aid cargo that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Agency for International Development (AID) must ship on U.S.-flag vessels (however, the act exempted other USDA cargo)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Support of the U.S. Merchant Marine by Other Federal Programs", "paragraphs": ["Besides cargo preference laws, a number of other programs were designed to promote the U.S. merchant marine industry. To help offset some of the higher operating and capital costs faced by U.S.-flag carriers engaged in international trade, the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 authorizes MARAD to pay operating-differential subsidies (ODS) and construction-differential subsidies (CDS) to operators of vessels in international trade. Additionally, the Jones Act restricts foreign-built U.S.-flag vessels from engaging in domestic trade.", "ODS payments support the portion of the U.S. fleet engaged in international trade by offsetting the higher costs to operate U.S.-flag vessels. ODS recipients normally enter into 20-year contracts with MARAD, during which time they may not engage in domestic trade or reflag the vessel to another country, and their subsidy will be reduced if they carry cargo between U.S. ports as part of a voyage involving foreign ports. In fiscal year 1993, the federal government provided 75 vessels with a total of $215.5 million in ODS payments. No new ODS contracts have been awarded since 1981.", "CDS are payments based on the difference in cost to construct vessels in U.S shipyards and foreign shipyards. Vessels built with CDS payments may not reflag for 25 years (20 years for tankers), may not enter into domestic trade (voyages with stops exclusively at U.S. ports), and must pay back a portion of the CDS if they carry cargo between U.S. ports as part of a voyage involving foreign ports. Although the program has not been eliminated, the last vessel built under this program was contracted for in 1981 and delivered in 1984. Currently, 79 vessels are under CDS restrictions.", "All vessels in international trade provide either charter or liner services.Charter-service vessels do not have regularly scheduled sailings, fixed routes, or fixed freight rates. They typically carry a shipload worth of cargo for only one or a few customers at the same time. Conversely, liner-service vessels have regularly scheduled sailings on fixed routes at fixed freight rates. They typically carry small amounts of cargo for many customers at one time and will sail even if not completely full. Vessels providing charter service cannot receive ODS payments while carrying preference cargo; vessels providing liner service can. Freight rates on liner-service vessels typically are higher than those on charter-service vessels. In addition, most liner-service vessels, whether U.S.-flagged or foreign-flagged, belong to shipping conferences.

In both instances, this growth was followed by extended periods of decline.

The relative decline in the U.S. fleet since 1948 can be attributed in large part to the 460-percent increase in the size of the world fleet, even though the size of the U.S. fleet decreased about 42 percent during this time. The decline in the relative size of the U.S. fleet also corresponds to the decline in the percentage of international trade carried on U.S. ships.

Most of the increase has been in privately owned cargo, which is not subject to cargo preference laws and is often shipped on less expensive foreign-flag vessels. The amount of cargo reserved for U.S.-flag vessels is a very small portion of total international cargo and therefore has not contributed substantially to the total share of cargo carried by U.S.-flag vessels.

Most of these vessels are ineligible to enter domestic trade because they were built in foreign shipyards or built with construction-differential subsidies.

We believe between 38 and 45 percent of these vessels, by tonnage, would leave the U.S. active fleet if cargo preference laws and policy were eliminated. Generally, steam-powered tankers would likely be scrapped because they are not competitive in international trade and are either ineligible to enter the domestic trade or would not find sufficient business in the domestic trade to remain in operation. However, there are several notable exceptions to potential scrapping. We believe the LNG tankers would remain U.S.-flagged because they do not receive ODS subsidies and do not carry preference cargo. Also, some of the double-bottom tankers may be competitive in the domestic trade because the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (P.L. 101-380) phases out these tankers at a slower rate than tankers with a single bottom. However, the double-bottom tankers will likely displace tankers of similar size that are already operating in the domestic trade. Additionally, we believe it likely that the diesel-powered tankers that operate without ODS subsidies and generally do not carry preference cargo would be unaffected by changes to cargo preference laws and would remain U.S.-flagged. Also, several tankers would continue operating for international political reasons having to do with the Persian Gulf War. Finally, several diesel-powered tankers are or will soon be eligible to enter the domestic trade but could be competitive internationally; consequently, we are unsure of what would happen with them."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Intermodal Vessels", "paragraphs": ["MARAD reported that 85 intermodal vessels with a total of 2,804,000 DWTs are employed in international trade.

We believe that many of the steam-powered intermodal vessels not already engaged in domestic trade would be scrapped because they would not be competitive in international trade and the domestic trade has no room for substantial additional tonnage, although it is uncertain whether none would enter the domestic trade.

This is approximately 71 percent of the 8,500 mariners employed on the 165 U.S.-flag vessels that MARAD reported are engaged in international trade. Our estimate of the impact on the maritime industry resulting from the elimination of cargo preference laws and policy stems from our analysis of the number of vessels we believe would have valid reasons to either reflag or leave service entirely if cargo preference laws were eliminated. On the basis of the size of the crews on the vessels we believe would leave the U.S. fleet, we estimated the number of seafaring jobs that would be lost. On the basis of the information provided to us by MARAD, the vessels associated with the 4.4 million to 5 million DWTs we believe might leave the fleet if cargo preference laws were eliminated support 2,600 to 3,000 billets (crew positions aboard a vessel). Since most mariners work aboard ship for 6 months of the year, and taking into account sick leave and other reasons for their not working full time, we estimate that 2.1 mariners are employed for every billet."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Impact of Cargo Preference Laws on Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["We do not anticipate that the elimination of cargo preference laws and policy will significantly affect the number of vessels built in U.S. shipyards. The workload at U.S. shipyards is dominated by federal contracts. Fourteen privately owned U.S. shipyards are engaged in or seeking contracts for the construction of ocean-going or Great Lakes vessels of over 1,000 gross tons. Since 1983, 90 percent of the production workers employed by these shipyards, on average, were engaged in Navy or Coast Guard ship construction or repair. Additionally, the number and deadweight tonnage of private ocean-going merchant vessels built in U.S. shipyards has declined dramatically over the last 20 years. (See fig. 3.6.) U.S. shipyards have delivered only one privately owned ocean-going merchant vessels of 1,000 gross tons or larger in fiscal years 1988-93.", "We did not evaluate the effect of eliminating cargo preference laws and policy on the amount of maintenance and repair performed at U.S. shipyards.

Cargo preference laws appear to have had little impact on maintaining the share of U.S. oceanborne cargo carried aboard U.S.-flag vessels, since most internationally shipped cargo is owned by private citizens, not subject to cargo preference laws, and thus shipped on less expensive foreign-flag vessels. Nevertheless, the U.S. fleet is dependent on preference cargo for a significant portion of the international cargo it carries. While we cannot estimate with precision the effects that eliminating cargo preference laws would have on the merchant marine industry, we believe the equivalent of up to two-thirds of the U.S.-flag vessels engaged in international trade, by tonnage, would leave the U.S. fleet. This would likely result in the elimination of about 6,000 U.S. shipboard jobs but would have a minimal impact on the U.S. shipbuilding industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We discussed the contents of this report with the Chief, Transportation Division of the Office of Procurement, AID; cognizant officials of the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Technology, DOD; the Director, Operations and Readiness Division, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, DOE; and the Deputy Administrator for Commodity Operations, USDA.
