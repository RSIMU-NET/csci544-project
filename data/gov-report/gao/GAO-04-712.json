IRS's ability to penalize employers for submitting inaccurate SSNs on wage statements is intended to promote SSN accuracy. Items GAO was asked to describe included: (1) the statutory provisions authorizing IRS to penalize employers who file wage statements with inaccurate SSNs; (2) IRS's program to penalize such employers; and (3) the extent IRS's program meets legislative requirements, the likelihood of any penalties, and any program changes being considered."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS is authorized to penalize employers who fail to file information returns or fail to include complete and correct information on them. Prior to 1986, IRS was authorized to assess penalties for failure to file information returns. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 added penalties for failure to include complete and correct information, established penalty amounts, and had two provisions limiting those penalties--the \"reasonable cause waiver\" and a maximum of $20,000 in penalties per filer per calendar year. The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) of 1989 increased the penalty amounts and the maximum total penalty amounts, ranging from $25,000 to $250,000 per filer per calendar year and added a third limit--a \"de minimis provision\" limiting the number of penalties that can be assessed. These statutes apply to employers who submit wage statements with inaccurate SSNs. Both acts authorize penalties as a tool to help ensure that information returns include complete and accurate information. According to IRS officials, IRS has the capability to identify employers who file wage statements with inaccurate SSNs but does not have a dedicated compliance program for penalizing them. Currently employers may be penalized based on an employment tax examination. IRS regulations define the steps an employer needs to take to demonstrate that any filing of wage statements with inaccurate SSNs was due to reasonable cause. If reasonable cause exists, any potential penalty will be waived. To qualify for the reasonable cause waiver, employers must be able to demonstrate they solicited an SSN from each employee one to three times, depending on the circumstances, and that they used this information to complete the wage statements. Employers are not responsible for verifying the accuracy of an SSN. IRS is conducting a review of 100 \"egregious\" employers who filed large numbers or percentages of wage statements with inaccurate SSNs to determine whether and how to implement a penalty program. IRS's regulations that implement the penalty provisions meet the statutory requirements; however, the criteria for meeting the reasonable cause waiver is such that few if any employers are likely to be penalized for filing inaccurate SSNs. IRS has no record of ever penalizing an employer, including the employers who were contacted during IRS's review of \"egregious\" employers. IRS officials said they would consider changes, including requiring employers to verify SSNs provided by employees, as part of the \"egregious\" employer study. Requiring SSN verification, however, may affect employers and other federal agencies with roles related to federal immigration policy since some portion of inaccurate SSNs on wage statements is attributable to illegal aliens using invalid SSNs. IRS officials said they would likely take the views of other agencies into account after drafting regulations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Inaccurate social security numbers (SSN) on wage statements contribute  to growth in the Social Security Administration\u2019s (SSA) Earnings Suspense  File, increase the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) workload to ensure that  wages are properly identified for the individual earning them, and burden  individuals who must work with SSA and IRS to resolve disputes that may  affect their social security benefits and tax obligations.  For example, one  of SSA\u2019s goals is to ensure that individuals receive the social security  benefits to which they are entitled.  To do so, SSA uses annual earnings  information recorded in each person\u2019s social security account that is  established in the individual\u2019s name with a unique social security number to  calculate their benefits.  Employers use IRS Form W-2 (Wage and Tax  Statements) to report this information to SSA.   Due to name and SSN  inaccuracies on the Forms W-2 (hereafter referred to as wage statements),  SSA has been unable to assign billions of dollars of social security wages  earned each year to the individuals who earned them.   The IRS, as well as  others, has responsibility for taking steps to assure information submitted  on wage statements is accurate.  One tool that IRS can use to do this, which  is authorized by legislation, is penalizing employers who file wage  statements with inaccurate information; such penalties were established to  help ensure employers would report accurate information.", "Because of your interest, this report describes:   the statutory provisions authorizing IRS to penalize employers who file  wage statements with inaccurate SSNs;  IRS\u2019s current program for identifying and penalizing employers who file  wage statements with inaccurate SSNs;  whether the current program meets legislative requirements, the  likelihood that employers will be penalized for filing wage statements  with inaccurate SSNs, and  any program changes being considered; and  how IRS is evaluating or planning to evaluate the effectiveness of its  program on curtailing the filing of wage statements with inaccurate  SSNs.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed pertinent legislation, regulations,  legal files, penalty assessment records, and Treasury Inspector General for  Tax Administration (TIGTA) and IRS\u2019s Large and Mid-Size Business (LMSB)  Division reports.  We interviewed IRS officials including those in the Office  of Chief Counsel, the National Program for Penalties and Interest office,  the Small Business/Self Employed (SBSE) Division, and the LMSB Division.  We also examined the design of IRS\u2019s study for determining whether and  how to implement a program for penalizing employers who file wage  statements with inaccurate SSNs by reviewing documents and interviewing  officials.  In addition, we interviewed SSA officials to obtain information  about the number of wage statements filed by employers with names and  SSNs that do not match SSA\u2019s records, the relationship between wage  statements with inaccurate SSNs and social security benefits, and the tools  SSA makes available to employers to verify SSNs.  We also reviewed  literature and reports related to the use of SSNs by the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) and discussed this use with knowledgeable GAO  staff.  We did not conduct a data reliability assessment because IRS does  not collect data on penalties related to wage statements filed with  inaccurate SSNs.

Wage statements include the  employee\u2019s name, SSN, and the amount of wages earned, among other  things and generally, employers use the employee names and SSNs on the  Forms W-4 to prepare them.", "Wage statements are the critical documents used by SSA for assigning  social security benefits. When an employer submits a wage statement to  SSA, SSA posts the employee\u2019s earnings to the employee\u2019s earnings record,  which is then used to determine an individual\u2019s eligibility for, and amount  of, retirement, disability, or survivor benefits administered by the agency.   When the wage statement contains a name/SSN combination that does not  match SSA\u2019s records, SSA conducts a series of procedures to try and match  them to its records.  If these procedures do not result in a match, then SSA  is unable to post the employee\u2019s earnings to the employee\u2019s earnings record  and instead, the wage statement and the associated wages are placed in the  Earnings Suspense File (ESF).", "The ESF represents the cumulative amount of wage statements for 1937  through 2003 for which SSA does not have a matching name/SSN.  Through  tax year 2001, which is the most recent year for which complete data are  available, the ESF included over 244 million records involving wages of  over $421 billion.  Since 1990, this file has been increasing by an average of  5 million records and at least $17 billion annually.  These records and their  associated earnings are only removed from the ESF when the wages can be  matched and posted to an individual\u2019s earnings record.  Items can be  removed through SSA efforts to match names and SSNs or when a person  provides an accurate name/SSN combination and information that proves  he or she earned the wages.  If they are not removed, employees will not  receive benefits based on these wages.", "Besides affecting SSA\u2019s workload and burdening individuals with trying to  work with SSA to prove they earned certain wages, errors in SSNs on wage  statements also affect IRS and individual taxpayers.  For example, an  individual may give an employer someone else\u2019s name and SSN.  The  employer then files a wage statement with the SSN.  The person to whom  the SSN belongs will not claim the wages on his or her tax return.  IRS will  then send a notice to the individual about the unclaimed wages.  IRS and  the individual must then work together to resolve the problem, adding to  both IRS\u2019s workload and the burden on the taxpayer to comply with the tax  laws.

The first  provision, which was included in previous legislation, is the reasonable  cause waiver.  IRS regulations, which are discussed later in this report,  provide guidance for determining if someone acted with reasonable cause  rather than with willful neglect.", "The second provision limits total penalties assessed against an employer to  a maximum dollar amount in any calendar year.

The maximum penalty amounts, which are  presented in table 1, are the total maximum penalty amounts that can be  assessed against an entity regardless of how many information returns it  must file and for any of the three reasons for which a penalty can be  assessed.  For example, if a large business could be assessed a $200,000  penalty for failing to file dividend information returns and a $100,000  penalty for failing to file wage statements with accurate SSNs, the  maximum penalty that could be assessed is not $300,000 but rather  $250,000.

IRS  officials said that the non-reporting of Form 1099 income by taxpayers had  a greater effect on tax revenues since no taxes had been withheld from  income reported on Forms 1099, whereas, in most cases, some taxes had  been withheld from income reported on wage statements.  IRS started  assessing penalties related to some Forms 1099 in the early 1990s and has  gradually added other types of Forms 1099 to the penalty program.

IRS officials then said that they would  consider a range of changes to improve the accuracy of SSNs on wage  statements.  Regarding the part of the review related to small and self- employed businesses, IRS\u2019s SBSE Division concluded that for the  employers reviewed to date, many of their employees for whom inaccurate  SSNs had been filed appeared to be aliens.  If IRS takes steps to improve  the accuracy of SSNs reported on wage statements, there could be  implications for thousands of illegal immigrants and their employers, and  in turn, on other federal programs which specifically deal with federal  immigration policy.

However, the criteria for meeting the reasonable cause waiver  included in the regulations are easy to meet making penalization of  employers very unlikely. This reduces or eliminates the potential  effectiveness of penalties in encouraging more accurate filing of SSNs on  wage statements.", "As previously described, to qualify for a reasonable cause waiver, an  employer is responsible only for soliciting an SSN from each employee  from one to three times depending on when the employer has been  contacted by the IRS and told that the SSN provided on the wage statement  is inaccurate.  The current regulations do not hold employers to more  stringent requirements, such as verifying the accuracy of an SSN provided  by an employee, or ensuring that an employee provides an alternative SSN  when their reported SSN was determined to be inaccurate.", "If employers voluntarily wish to verify SSNs, their options are limited.  IRS  maintains a system for verifying the taxpayer identification numbers in its  records, of which individual SSNs are one type.  However, IRS is prohibited  by law from verifying SSNs for employers.  Pending legislation would  allow IRS to do so.  Employers can voluntarily use SSA\u2019s Employee  Verification Service (EVS) prior to filing wage statements to determine if  SSNs are valid.  Under EVS, employers can call an 800 number to verify  SSNs for up to five employees, submit a paper request for up to 50  employees, or submit requests for larger numbers using tapes or discs.   Paper requests can take up to 30 days to process.  SSA is also pilot-testing  another system\u2014the social security number verification service (SSNVS)-- for voluntary use by employers to verify SSNs and, according to SSA  officials, hopes to roll out the program nationwide in January 2005.  When  using SSNVS, employers can verify up to ten SSNs via computer and  receive an instant response and for larger requests, can upload a file to SSA  and receive a response within 1 business day.", "Our attempt to determine if IRS has ever penalized employers for filing a  wage statement with an inaccurate SSN found no evidence of any penalties  being assessed.

As of May 2004, IRS concluded that none of the 78  employers examined should be assessed a penalty.  This includes 50  employers reviewed by the LMSB Division for which IRS officials could not  find any evidence that they had ever been penalized.  This does not mean,  however, that the employers filed wage statements free of inaccurate SSNs.   It simply means that they solicited and used the SSNs provided by the  employees to prepare the wage statements regardless of whether the SSNs  provided by the employees were accurate.  Again, under the regulations  implementing the reasonable cause waiver, as long as the employers solicit  SSNs from employees and use those SSNs to prepare wage statements,  they will meet the reasonable cause waiver and will not be penalized.", "The LMSB Division prepared a report in April 2003 summarizing the results  of its review of the 50 \u201cegregious\u201d employers who filed large numbers of  wage statements with inaccurate SSNs.  The report includes five barriers  identified by employers to filing wage statements with accurate SSNs and  13 recommendations that LMSB officials and employers think may reduce  or eliminate the filing of wage statements with inaccurate SSNs.  The  recommendations fall into four general areas: legislative and regulatory  changes, SSA changes, employer changes, and IRS changes.  All would  represent substantive changes to the current requirements for employers.   For example, one recommendation is that employers use SSA\u2019s EVS to  verify the SSN of all new hires. Another recommendation is to require  employers to review and obtain a copy of the employee\u2019s social security  card prior to hiring the new employee.  A third recommendation is that if  re-solicitations of SSNs are required, employers would verify new SSNs  provided by employees using the SSA EVS system.  These initiatives would  require legislative and regulatory changes and might result in changes to  the reasonable cause standard.  The division also pointed out that several  employers have taken innovative steps to address the compliance problem.   One such initiative is using a service that will conduct a background check  on each employee, including verifying the SSNs, for a minimal fee.   Assessing the viability of these recommendations was not within the scope  of our evaluation.", "Regarding the small and self-employed businesses review, after completing  the reviews of 28 employers, SBSE preliminarily concluded that (a)  employers\u2019 acceptance of an employee\u2019s information without any  verification by the employer is common practice, (b) employers have no  responsibility to verify the accuracy of an employee\u2019s SSN, and (c) many of  the employees whose SSNs were identified in the review as inaccurate  appeared to be aliens.", "Although the options for improving the accuracy of SSNs on wage  statements have not yet been developed, IRS officials said they would  consider a range of changes including, as LMSB\u2019s report suggests, requiring  employers to verify SSNs provided by employees on Forms W-4.  In judging  how to proceed, the officials said that a number of factors would need to be  weighed. For example, the regulations for information returns currently  apply uniformly to all providers of such returns.  To the extent that  addressing the problem of inaccurate SSNs on wage statements might  adversely affect other providers of information returns, IRS may need to  consider separate regulations only applying to entities in their capacity as  employers.  IRS officials indicated that one initiative they have discussed is  changing the criteria employers must meet to qualify for the reasonable  cause waiver if they file inaccurate SSNs on wage statements.  They added  the Department of the Treasury would have to agree to this change.  In  addition, in crafting changes to encourage more accurate wage statements,  officials said that they would need to assess any increased burden placed  upon employers, such as increases in cost.   The Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, in testimony before Congress, has raised the issue of whether a  more rigorous program could drive employers into underreporting wages  paid to employees, which could result in more employees not participating  in the federal tax system. This would be contrary to what IRS sees as part  of its basic mission:  to assure that all appropriate taxpayers are part of the  system.  In addition, the Commissioner of IRS recently testified that any  increase in IRS\u2019s compliance activities in this area may place an increased  demand on resources and that \u201cabsent added funding for such activities,  this would likely come at the expense of other compliance activities.\u201d   Finally, some options for addressing the issue of inaccurate SSNs may  require legislative changes, such as authorizing IRS to make its taxpayer  identification number verification system available to employers for  purposes of verifying employees\u2019 SSNs.", "Although IRS officials did not focus on them in discussing their review with  us, certain other issues likely would be relevant when considering changes  in employers\u2019 responsibilities.  SBSE\u2019s preliminary conclusion that many of  the employees whose SSNs were identified as invalid in its review  appeared to be aliens raises the question of whether addressing the  accuracy of SSNs has immigration-related implications for employers and  other federal agencies.  Even though incorrect SSNs may result from such  things as inadvertent errors on employees\u2019 or employers\u2019 part or from  individuals not reporting a name change to SSA, some portion of inaccurate  SSNs likely are due to illegal aliens using false or stolen SSNs when  completing Forms W-4 for employers.  TIGTA estimated, for example, that  353,000 taxpayers could be identified as illegal aliens from IRS tax year  2000 data and that of these at least 265,000 had wage statements with  invalid SSNs. Since significant numbers of individuals with inaccurate  SSNs on Forms W-4 may be illegal aliens, some employers have raised  concerns about whether being required to verify employees\u2019 SSNs would  trigger obligations to other federal agencies, such as DHS.  In general, if  questions arise about an employee\u2019s work authorization, DHS guidance  provides that an employer might need to take certain actions, such as  providing the employee another opportunity to provide proper DHS Form I- 9 documentation.", "An earlier pilot test of a voluntary employment verification system  illustrates other issues that may affect employers and other federal  agencies if IRS requires SSN verification.  The Illegal Immigration Reform  and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 directed the Attorney General to  conduct a pilot program of an employment verification system intended to  prevent employers from hiring unauthorized aliens.  The voluntary  participants in this system agreed to electronically check newly hired  employees\u2019 SSNs against SSA\u2019s SSN records and, if the SSNs did not match  and the employees were unable to resolve the mismatch, to terminate their  employment.   This pilot program includes the employer contacting DHS to  verify employment eligibility of a potential employee.  The basic pilot of the  program is operating in six states (California, Florida, Illinois, Nebraska,  New York, and Texas) and can be expanded to all 50 states by December  2004.  In evaluating the basic pilot program, researchers found that the  system confirmed that 87 percent of the employees were authorized to  work but that some employers took adverse actions against employees on  the basis of a tentative nonconfirmation (e.g., the employee\u2019s name and  SSN did not match SSA\u2019s records) although they were prohibited from  doing so under the program.  Federal law protects certain individuals from  unfair immigration-related employment practices of a U.S. employer.  The  federal government entity charged with oversight of the laws protecting  against unfair immigration-related employment practices is the Office of  Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices,  which is part of the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.", "IRS officials are aware that changes to the reasonable cause standard could  have consequences for other federal agencies.  For example, when TIGTA  recommended that IRS initiate a regularly scheduled penalty program to  penalize employers for submitting inaccurate SSNs on wage statements,  IRS was contacted by the Departments of Labor, Justice and Homeland  Security, seeking information. Regarding coordinating any initiatives with  other federal agencies, IRS officials said that they would take other  agencies\u2019 views into account most likely through their formal comments on  any regulatory proposal IRS and Treasury would make."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IRS Plans to Design an Evaluation of Its Penalty Program if a Program Is Adopted", "paragraphs": ["If IRS implements a program to assess penalties against employers who file  wage statements with inaccurate SSNs, IRS plans to evaluate the  effectiveness of its program on curtailing the filing of such wage  statements.  IRS officials said they will design the evaluation after a penalty  program is adopted.  In its September 2002 report, TIGTA recommended  that the Program Director for Penalties and Interest develop a methodology  for monitoring and analyzing the results of the penalty program and that  the data collected should include the number and amount of penalties  proposed, assessed, waived (and the reason for the waiver), and  collected.  TIGTA also said the data should include the number of wage  statements corrected in response to penalty actions.  Developing and  implementing a design for evaluating whatever program IRS moves ahead  with will be important so that IRS can understand how well the new  program succeeds in increasing SSN accuracy on wage statements while  minimizing potential adverse effects like decreased participation of wage  earners in the tax system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Inaccurate SSNs on wage statements contribute to growth in the SSA  Earnings Suspense File, increase IRS\u2019s workload to ensure that wages are  properly identified for the individual earning them, and burden individuals  who must work with SSA and IRS to resolve disputes that may affect their  tax obligations and social security benefits.  Under the Tax Reform Act of  1986 and OBRA of 1989, Congress provided IRS authority to penalize  employers who submit wage statements with inaccurate SSNs to help  assure the accurate reporting of wages.  Both Acts emphasize the use of  penalties as a tool to help ensure that employers file information returns  with complete and accurate information but also include a reasonable  cause provision under which penalties can be waived.", "However, the reasonable cause standard is not difficult for employers to  meet.  IRS has no record of penalties having been levied against employers  and none have been levied to date as part of IRS\u2019s study of employers with  substantial numbers or percentages of wage statements with inaccurate  SSNs.", "Because little or no likelihood exists for penalties to be levied, the potential  of the statutory penalty tool to encourage greater accuracy of wage  statements is compromised.  Further, because employers have no  responsibility to verify SSNs, opportunities to detect and correct SSN  inaccuracies before SSA and IRS need to react to them and possibly  consider penalizing employers are lost.  Accordingly, thoroughly exploring  options to change the reasonable cause standard, including possibly  requiring that employers take steps to verify the accuracy of SSNs provided  by employees, must be a critical part of IRS\u2019s consideration of how to make  their penalty program more effective.", "Nevertheless, because a change to the reasonable cause standard could  have consequences for IRS, employers, and other federal agencies,  determining whether and how to modify the standard will require balancing  numerous, sometimes conflicting, issues.  Accordingly, in considering  options for revising the standard, IRS would benefit from understanding  these potential consequences.  Although IRS officials anticipate receiving  formal comments from other federal agencies on any regulatory proposal  they may publish, they do not have plans to work with representatives of  these agencies as they initially consider what options may best address  inaccurate SSNs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We have two recommendations.

Then, if an employee provided an  inaccurate SSN, the employer could take timely actions to obtain a valid  SSN.  In agreeing that IRS should work with other agencies, the  Commissioner did not indicate when or how IRS planned to do so.

To address the second  objective, we reviewed IRS\u2019s current penalty program with various IRS  officials including the Program Director for Penalties and Interest and  reviewed a Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA)  report addressing the same subject.  We interviewed Small Business/Self  Employed (SBSE) Division and Large and Mid-Size Business (LMSB)  Division Employment Tax officials to determine how employment tax  examinations can be used to identify employers who should possibly be  assessed a penalty for filing wage statements with inaccurate SSNs.  We  also sought from the Program Director for Penalties and Interest, the SBSE  Office of Employment Tax Director, and the LMSB National Program  Manager for the Employment Tax Program any data collected by IRS that  would show the number of employers who had been assessed penalties for  filing wage statements with inaccurate SSNs.
