Under this authority, sponsors are to pay their full agreed-upon cost share of the repair.", "The Corps applied its Dam Safety Assurance authority at 5 of the 16 dam safety repair projects GAO reviewed for repairs that resulted from the availability of new hydrologic or seismic data. Under this authority, sponsors' agreed-upon cost share is reduced by 85 percent.", "The Corps did not apply one provision of its Dam Safety Assurance authority\u2014related to repairs needed due to changes in state-of-the-art design or construction criteria (state-of-the-art provision)\u2014since the enactment of the enabling legislation in 1986. Since that time, the Corps has not provided guidance on the types of circumstances under which the state-of-the-art provision applies and has not had a consistent policy position regarding the provision. For example, the Corps' latest regulation states in one section that the state-of-the-art provision will not be applied because of the difficulty in defining terminology, while another section allows for consideration on a case-by-case basis. Without clarifying the circumstances under which the state-of-the-art provision applies, and implementing the policy consistently, the Corps is at risk of not applying the full range of statutory authorities provided to it, contributing to conditions under which, as discussed below, sponsors have taken actions opposing the Corps.", "In GAO's review of 9 dams with sponsors, the Corps did not communicate with or effectively engage all sponsors. For example, a federal sponsor that markets hydropower generated at two dams disagreed with the Corps' decision to not apply the state-of-the-art provision of its Dam Safety Assurance authority, which, if used, would reduce this sponsor's cost share by about $410 million. This sponsor has proceeded to set its power rates in anticipation of paying the reduced cost share, creating uncertainty for the recovery of federal outlays for repairs. In addition, GAO found the Corps was not effective in reaching agreement with other sponsors on cost-sharing responsibilities at three dams because it did not have clear guidance for effectively communicating with sponsors. For example, the Corps did not engage a sponsor to ensure cost share payment at one dam and, at another dam, delayed executing agreements that would ensure sponsors' cost shares. Because the Corps did not effectively engage these sponsors, some are deriving benefits absent agreements with the Corps, while others that have agreements have not been notified of their final cost-sharing responsibility. As a result, these sponsors' cost share payments (about $3.1 million) are uncertain."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Corps clarify policy guidance on (1) usage of the state-of-the-art provision and (2) effective communication with sponsors to establish and implement cost sharing agreements for all dams, including the three named in this report.

We interviewed Department of  Defense and Corps headquarters officials about how the Corps  determined and communicated with sponsors about cost sharing for dam  safety repairs. In particular, we interviewed officials about the Corps\u2019  process for dam safety repairs, key decision points for determining cost  sharing, communication with sponsors, and tracking of cost share  payments. We interviewed Corps officials at the 11 district offices where  the 16 dams are located about their decisions associated with cost  sharing and about their communication with sponsors. We also  interviewed the federal, state, local, and private sponsors identified by the  Corps about their cost sharing in these dam safety repair projects (see  app. I for the list of sponsors we interviewed). We asked the sponsors  about the terms of their agreements with the Corps, their history of being  a sponsor, the financial impacts of cost sharing for dam safety repair  projects, and the Corps\u2019 communication with them regarding the projects  and cost sharing. We compared communications between sponsors and  the Corps against requirements for such communications described in the  Corps\u2019 latest Safety of Dams regulation. Additionally, we conducted site  visits to a non-generalizable sample of 3 dams in the Corps\u2019 Nashville,  TN, and Tulsa, OK, districts based on the Corps\u2019 cost sharing  determinations and the range of project sponsors (e.g., hydropower,  water supply).

While integrating traditional engineering  analyses and standards, the risk-informed approach aims to identify and  prioritize the most critical dam safety risks rather than eliminate all  potential risks. To that end, the Corps has developed the Dam Safety  Action Classification (DSAC) system, based on a 5-point scale, to help  guide key decisions for dam safety repairs. This risk classification system  reflects the probability of a dam\u2019s failure and resulting potential  consequences due to failure. As of July 2015, the Corps has placed 309  dams (about 44 percent) in actionable categories (DSAC 1, 2, and 3)  because the dams were determined to be at moderate to very high risk of  failure. In particular, the Corps has classified 17 dams as DSAC 1 (very  high urgency), 76 dams as DSAC 2 (high urgency), and 216 dams as  DSAC 3 (moderate urgency). From fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2016,  the Corps selected 16 of these DSAC 1 and 2 dams for repairs.", "According to the Corps\u2019 Safety of Dams regulation, once a dam has  been selected as needing repair according to its DSAC designation, the  Corps is to take the following steps to study, design, and construct a dam  safety repair project.", "Study: Corps district officials are to conduct a dam safety modification  study to determine a long-term solution. This study is to involve risk  analyses, determination of potential failure modes, evaluation of  alternatives to address potential failures, and development of a  recommended technical solution with its estimated cost. The study  also is to identify cost share sponsors and to recommend an  applicable authority for cost sharing purposes (discussed later in this  report) under which to implement the repair work. The results of the  study are published in a dam safety modification report, which is  forwarded to division and headquarters officials, including the DSO,  for review and approval of recommended repairs. The Corps districts  are to communicate to sponsors and the public about dam failure risks  and potential repairs during the study phase.

In addition, further risk analyses are  to be conducted as well as expert reviews of the design. During the  project\u2019s design, the Corps districts are also to communicate to  sponsors and the public about their plans for conducting repairs.", "Construction: Project construction, managed by district officials, is  typically carried out through contracts with private companies.

Once potential failure modes, among other things, are determined, Corps  district officials are to generate a dam safety modification report that  reviews alternatives and recommends a technical solution to address the  potential failure modes.", "For cost sharing purposes, the regulation requires the district to  recommend in the report one of the two types of cost sharing  arrangements or authorities: Major Rehabilitation authority or Dam Safety  Assurance authority. The potential failure mode is the primary factor in  determining the applicable authority, in addition to consideration of policy  and statutory requirements:  Major Rehabilitation: According to Corps officials, this authority applies to  dam safety repairs associated with typical degradation of dams over time.  Under this authority, sponsors are to pay their full cost share. For  example, if a sponsor\u2019s agreed cost share is 10 percent, then the sponsor  is responsible for 10 percent of the total cost of the dam safety repair  project. (See table 2.)

This authority, based on Section 1203 of the  Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1986, applies to safety- related dam modifications needed as a result of new hydrologic or  seismic data or changes in state-of-the-art design or construction criteria  deemed necessary for safety purposes (state-of-the-art provision). This  authority reflects, in part, the availability of new information\u2014such as  current hydrologic models or seismic studies\u2014that could indicate a dam\u2019s  increased vulnerability and greater risk of failure.

(See fig. 2.) SEPA has asserted that the Dam Safety Assurance  authority should apply to these projects. SEPA has taken this position,  in part, because while dam safety repairs at Wolf Creek were originally  determined to be under the Major Rehabilitation authority, Corps district  officials had subsequently recommended using the Dam Safety  Assurance authority based on application of the state-of-the-art  provision.

According to SEPA officials, current repairs based on state-of- the-art practices are being made at these two dams, in part, because  previous repair efforts did not adequately address site conditions  contributing to seepage. Conversely, Corps officials told us that  seepage naturally occurs at all dams and periodically needs to be  addressed, such as through implementation of repair projects. Moreover,  according to Corps officials, the \u201ckarst\u201d limestone upon which the Center  Hill and Wolf Creek dams are built is prone to increasing seepage over  time because of the dissolution of soluble rock foundation. Concrete cut- off walls put in place at Center Hill and Wolf Creek dams under current  projects were designed to consider these effects and, according to Corps  officials, constructed as permanent seepage control measures.", "Because of the high cost of repairs to these two dams\u2014estimated at  about $958 million, for which SEPA\u2019s share under its original  congressional authorization is about 50 percent\u2014SEPA officials have  expressed concern about the agency\u2019s ability to recover costs if the  projects are considered under the Major Rehabilitation authority. Under  this authority, SEPA\u2019s cost to recover for both dams is estimated at about  $482 million. Officials said that if SEPA were obligated to recover this  amount, its hydropower rates could become prohibitively expensive. As a  result, according to these officials, SEPA\u2019s customers might terminate  their contracts and acquire energy via more economical options, such as  energy derived from natural gas or coal. If the Corps were to apply its  Dam Safety Assurance authority to these repairs under, for example, the  state-of-the-art provision, SEPA\u2019s cost to recover would be reduced to  about $72 million (85 percent reduction).", "The outcome related to the disagreement between the Corps and SEPA  has significant implications given that mitigating the effects of seepage,  as evidenced by our review, is a common reason for making safety- related repairs. In recent rate-making notices, SEPA has based its  proposed rates on the Dam Safety Assurance authority for dam safety  repairs at Center Hill and Wolf Creek dams. This action signals SEPA\u2019s  position that it should pay the reduced cost share (about $72 million)  provided under this authority, and without resolution, recovering federal  outlays for funding the majority of project costs (about $410 million)  remains uncertain. In moving forward to resolve this disagreement, it is  important that potential impacts on aging dam infrastructure, hydropower  rates, and the federal budget are considered in a coordinated, strategic  approach.", "SEPA\u2019s rate actions could set precedent and create uncertainty for the  federal government if sponsors at other dams also assert that the state- of-the-art provision applies to projects that mitigate the effects of  seepage. For example, the Corps determined that repairs to mitigate the  effects of seepage were needed at 9 of the 16 dams we reviewed, with a  total estimated cost of about $4 billion. If other sponsors at these dams  were to follow SEPA\u2019s example, the federal government could potentially  receive reduced cost share payments from these sponsors. Further, in  light of its aging infrastructure, more Corps dams could require seepage- related repairs in the future.

Of the 16 dam safety  repair projects we reviewed, 9 had sponsors, and\u2014as discussed  below\u2014at 3 of the 9 dams the Corps did not communicate with the  sponsors in a manner that would ensure their meaningful involvement  and willingness to be cost sharing partners, as required by its regulation.  According to the agreements, these sponsors are to pay their cost share  to the Corps, which remits these funds to the U.S. Treasury. However, at  least three sponsors have expressed concerns and indicated resistance  about paying their determined cost shares, estimated to be about $3.1  million. Because the Corps does not have clear guidance to ensure  effective communications with sponsors, it did not adequately  communicate or reach agreements on cost sharing responsibilities with  these sponsors. As a result, these sponsors\u2019 plans for paying their cost  shares are uncertain, leaving the recovery of federal outlays from these  sponsors similarly uncertain.", "Tuttle Creek Dam:  At Tuttle Creek dam (Kansas), the Corps identified  and contacted one water supply sponsor during the study phase  (2000\u20132002) of a dam stabilization project as well as notified the  sponsor of its estimated cost share, but otherwise did not effectively  engage the sponsor throughout the project to ensure the sponsor\u2019s  cost share payment. In a 2002 letter to the Corps, the sponsor  asserted its position that it should not be required to pay for repairs to  stabilize the dam, a repair that would enable the dam to withstand the  expected maximum earthquake. In the sponsor\u2019s opinion, the sponsor  was not responsible for sharing costs related to changes in the Corps\u2019  design standards or to address what the sponsor felt were design  flaws. In 2003, the Corps responded to the sponsor reiterating the  sponsor\u2019s responsibility for sharing in the costs of the project. The  Corps\u2019 written response included its estimate of the sponsor\u2019s cost  share, approximately $770,000, and described payment options: pay- as-you-go or lump sum at the end of construction. According to the  sponsor, it did not raise any further objections and, in a subsequent  telephone conversation with Corps district officials, indicated its  preference to use the pay-as-you-go option because it would be  unable to afford a lump sum payment. Since 2003, the sponsor  received briefings on the status of the project; however, the Corps did  not follow up or otherwise engage the sponsor to pay incrementally  while construction was ongoing. Construction was completed in 2010,  but as of October 2015, the Corps had not requested payment or  notified the sponsor of its final cost share. Corps officials told us that  they are preparing a billing letter to send to the sponsor.", "Rough River Dam:  At Rough River dam (Kentucky), the Corps\u2019 2012  dam safety modification report stated that the project to grout and  construct a 1,700-foot cutoff wall would be completed at full federal  expense with no cost sharing sponsors. However, subsequent  reviews by Corps headquarters identified water supply contract  holders, and in 2013, the Corps notified three water supply sponsors  of their cost sharing responsibilities for the dam safety repair. Due to  uncertainty in identifying sponsors and delays in executing  agreements with them, as discussed below, the Corps may  experience challenges collecting these sponsors\u2019 cost shares when  the project is finally complete, estimated to be no later than 2021.  Specifically:", "One sponsor has had a water use agreement with the Corps since  1978, but has not been drawing water from the reservoir since 2007.  In 2013, the Corps requested that the sponsor remove its water intake  structure from the reservoir. However, in the same year, as mentioned  previously, the Corps notified this sponsor of its cost sharing  responsibilities for the dam safety repair project. In May 2015, the  Corps signed a termination agreement with the sponsor under which  the sponsor will not share the costs of the project. While the Corps is  not expecting to collect a cost share, its interaction with the sponsor  indicates a lack of effective communication.", "Although the Corps notified a second sponsor of its cost sharing  responsibilities in 2013, this sponsor currently does not have a cost  sharing responsibility for the dam safety repair project because the  sponsor paid upfront for \u201cmajor capital replacement\u201d as part of its  1966 agreement with the Corps. This provision of the agreement is  to expire in April 2016, and according to Corps officials, a supplement  to the agreement is being developed. The supplement would include  this sponsor\u2019s cost sharing responsibility in the current project.  However, we were not able to reach this sponsor to confirm its  intention to be a cost sharing sponsor, and it remains uncertain  whether the Corps should expect a future agreement to cover current  project costs.", "The third sponsor has been drawing water from the reservoir since  2002, when the sponsor negotiated terms of its water use with the  Corps under a draft contract. Despite drawing up to 1.6 million gallons  per day from the reservoir, the sponsor has not paid the Corps for  water use and operations and maintenance expenses because a  contract between the parties has not been executed. As a result,  despite notifying the sponsor of its cost sharing responsibilities in the  dam safety repair project in 2013, the Corps has no mechanism to  compel payment from this sponsor. According to the sponsor, it has  tried to finalize the 2002 contract numerous times, but the Corps did  not finalize the agreement in any of these instances. In July 2015, a  Corps district official told us that Corps headquarters is reviewing the  negotiated agreement; however, uncertainty about cost sharing exists  until all parties execute a contract.", "Center Hill Dam: At Center Hill Dam (Tennessee), the Corps identified  three water supply sponsors during the study phase but generally had  minimal interactions with them to communicate cost sharing estimates  and responsibilities. While two sponsors accept their cost sharing  responsibilities and estimated cost sharing amounts, one sponsor  disagrees with the Corps\u2019 application of the Major Rehabilitation  authority. Similar to the argument made by SEPA, which is also a  sponsor at this dam, this water supply sponsor stated that the repairs  being made to address the effects of seepage at the dam incorporate  state-of-the-art design and construction practices and that the Corps  should apply the state-of-the-art provision, thereby reducing this  sponsor\u2019s cost share. Under the Major Rehabilitation authority, this  sponsor has a $1.9 million cost share. According to this sponsor, a  municipal water utility, covering this cost would require raising water  rates approximately 50 cents per household per month. The sponsor  is contemplating a legal challenge if the Corps does not apply the  state-of-the-art provision to lower this sponsor\u2019s cost share according  to a sponsor official. The Corps has maintained its position that  application of its Major Rehabilitation authority is appropriate for this  dam safety repair."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Considering the significant cost of dam safety repair projects, and the  number of dams that could need repairs in the future, implementing a  dam safety program as effectively as possible is important. This  implementation would include adequately defining conditions for key  policy determinations to ensure the appropriate allocation of federal  versus non-federal funds for dam safety repairs.", "However, the fact that the Corps has not developed policy guidance on  the types of circumstances under which the state-of-the-art provision of its  Dam Safety Assurance authority might apply, and has not had a  consistent policy position, limits the Corps\u2019 ability to ensure the effective  implementation of the dam safety program. Without clarifying the  circumstances under which the state-of-the-art provision applies and  implementing the policy consistently, the Corps is at risk of not applying  the full range of statutory authorities provided to it. Moreover, because of  the financial implications of its authority determinations for sponsors, the  Corps\u2019 inaction in setting a clear policy for this provision contributes to  conditions under which it is potentially exposed to adverse actions of  these sponsors.", "The Corps\u2019 engagement of project sponsors is critical to the successful  implementation of dam safety repair projects not only to ensure the  continued provision of benefits, such as water supply and hydropower  generation, but also to recover federal outlays used to fund projects  upfront. Because the Corps has not always effectively communicated with  or engaged sponsors, some are deriving benefits from dams absent an  agreement with the Corps while other sponsors that have agreements  either have not been notified by the Corps of their final cost share  responsibility or dispute the Corps\u2019 cost sharing determination and may  raise a legal challenge. While the Corps\u2019 Safety of Dams regulation  provides guidance to district offices for communicating with sponsors,  greater clarity about effective communication requirements to establish  and implement agreements with sponsors would help the Corps ensure  equity in its treatment of sponsors and make certain that the federal  government receives expected cost share payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To improve cost sharing for dam safety repairs, we recommend that the  Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Army to direct the Chief  of Engineers and Commanding General of the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers to clarify policy guidance: on the types of circumstances under which the state-of-the-art  provision of the Dam Safety Assurance authority might apply to dam  safety repair projects.  for district offices to effectively communicate with sponsors to  establish and implement cost sharing agreements during dam safety  repair projects.
