These weaknesses were more glaring in light of the sustained increase in mobilized Guard soldiers following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. To its credit, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) hired over 200 new personnel to address travel voucher processing backlogs and recently upgraded their training. However, Guard soldiers in our case study units reported a number of problems they and their families endured due to delayed or unpaid travel reimbursements, including debts on their personal credit cards, trouble paying their monthly bills, and inability to make child support payments. The soldier bears primary responsibility for travel voucher preparation, including obtaining paper copies of various types of authorizations. DFAS data indicate that it rejected and asked soldiers to resubmit about 18 percent of vouchers during fiscal year 2004--a churning process that added to delays and frustration. Also, existing guidance did not clearly address the sometimes complex travel situations of mobilized Army Guard soldiers, who were often housed off-post due to overcrowding on military installations. Further, DOD continued to be noncompliant with a law that requires payment of late payment interest and fees when soldiers' travel reimbursements are not timely. With respect to human capital, GAO found a lack of oversight and accountability and inadequate training. Automated systems problems, such as nonintegration of key systems involved in authorizing and paying travel expenses and failure to automate key processes, also contributed to the inefficient, error-prone process. DOD has been developing and implementing the Defense Travel System (DTS) to resolve travel-related deficiencies. However, DTS will not address some of the key systems flaws. For example, DTS is currently not able to process mobilized soldier travel authorizations and vouchers and identify and calculate late payment interest and fees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the operational tempo for  the military services has greatly increased, with corresponding increases in  the basic administrative tasks necessary to keep soldiers paid, fed, and  housed.  Over 186,500 Army National Guard (Army Guard) soldiers were  mobilized from September 14, 2001, through September 30, 2004, to serve  in Operations Noble Eagle, Enduring Freedom, and Iraqi Freedom.  Some  mobilized Army Guard soldiers have incurred significant travel expenses in  conjunction with their roles in carrying out critical national security  missions.  Army Guard soldiers called to active service are entitled to be  reimbursed for authorized travel expenses incurred.  The Department of  Defense (DOD) is to provide a Guard soldier traveling on official business  with transportation, lodging, and food, or to reimburse the soldier for  reasonable and necessary authorized expenses if the soldier purchases  them.  In short, the soldier is to be made whole for authorized out-of- pocket expenses, with timely and accurate reimbursements for travel  expenses.", "Within the United States, Army Guard soldiers have guarded the Pentagon,  airports, nuclear power plants, and domestic water supplies as part of the  homeland security effort.  Overseas, they continue to perform highly  dangerous peacekeeping missions and force protection operations in Iraq,  Afghanistan, and other countries.  When government-provided meals and  housing were not available to some Guard soldiers, they lived off the local  economy\u2014purchased food at restaurants and groceries, and housing at  hotels\u2014and later submitted requests to the Army for reimbursement of  their out-of-pocket expenses.", "In October 2002, we reported that the Defense Finance and Accounting  Service (DFAS) did not have systems in place to identify late travel  reimbursements and therefore could not identify the soldiers who were not  paid within 30 days of submission of an approved travel voucher and who  therefore should have been paid late payment interest and fees required  pursuant to Section 2 of the Travel and Transportation Reform Act of 1998  (TTRA).  This affected numerous soldiers whose vouchers were paid late.   For example, at one California National Guard unit, we estimated that  about 60 percent of travel vouchers were not paid within 30 days of  submission to an approving official.  In March 2003, the DFAS Headquarters  Internal Review Office also reported concern over management\u2019s inability  to properly measure the timeliness of travel voucher reimbursements.   According to the DFAS report, 39 percent of approximately 1 million travel  vouchers paid during the period May 2002 through October 2002 did not  have the date the voucher was received or the date the voucher was  approved recorded in an automated system, both of which are key dates for  determining payment timeliness.  The report also stated that available data  showed 18 percent of the vouchers were not paid within 35 calendar days  of the completion of travel.  Further, during our audits of Army Guard and  Army Reserve military payroll controls, soldiers told us about problems  with delayed and inaccurate travel cost reimbursements and meal cost  authorizations and entitlements.", "You asked us to determine (1) the impact of the recent increased  operational tempo on the effectiveness of the process used to reimburse  Army Guard soldiers for travel expenses and the effect that travel  reimbursement problems have had on soldiers and their families and   (2) the adequacy of the overall design of controls over the processes,  human capital, and automated systems relied on to provide timely travel  cost reimbursements and accurate meal authorizations and entitlements to  mobilized Army Guard soldiers.

The lack of accurate and complete  centralized data on Army Guard travel also precluded statistical testing of  related transactions.  Instead, we systematically assessed the effectiveness  of the overall design of controls at work in the key areas of processes,  people (human capital), and automated systems.  Further, we used case  studies and individual voucher data mining to identify Army Guard units  with a variety of travel reimbursement problems, including disputes over  authorizations for meal reimbursements, and individual soldiers who had  been reimbursed late.  We used this approach to provide a more detailed  perspective on the design of controls and the nature of deficiencies in the  three phases of the travel and reimbursement process: (1) authorization;  (2) travel voucher preparation, unit review, and transmission; and   (3) computation office review and payment.", "Specifically, we gathered available data and analyzed the travel  reimbursement experiences of 10 selected Army Guard units mobilized to  active service in support of Operations Iraqi Freedom, Noble Eagle, and  Enduring Freedom during the period from October 2001 through November  2003.  We selected four military police and four special forces units, which  we determined from a preliminary assessment were experiencing travel  reimbursement problems.  The remaining two were selected based on our  review of complaints to United States senators and representatives.

During peacetime, each Army Guard  unit reports to the adjutant general of its state or territory, or in the case of  the District of Columbia, to the Commanding General.  Each adjutant  general reports to the governor of the state or territory, or in the case of the  District of Columbia, to the mayor.", "At the state level, the governors have the ability, under the Constitution of  the United States, to call up members of the Army Guard in times of  domestic emergency or need. The Army Guard\u2019s state mission is perhaps  the most visible and well known.  Army Guard units battle fires or help  communities deal with floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, snowstorms, or other  emergency situations.  In times of civil unrest, the citizens of a state rely on  the Army Guard to respond, if needed.  During national emergencies, the  President has the authority to activate the Army Guard, putting them in  federal duty status.  When ordered to federal active duty by the President in  accordance with the provisions of Title 10, United States Code, the units  answer to the Combatant Commander of the theatre in which they are  operating and, ultimately, to the President.  When called to perform duty in  accordance with the provisions of Title 32, United States Code, units  answer to the adjutant generals and ultimately to the governors.  When  Army Guard units are performing duty under Title 10 or Title 32, the federal  government provides funds for reimbursement of authorized travel  expenses.", "The Army Guard is a partner with the active Army and the Army Reserve in  fulfilling the country\u2019s military needs.

As military activity increased  for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Army Guard, Army Reserve, and active  Army soldiers were preparing for duty, not all of the installations to which  Army Guard soldiers were assigned had available government housing.  As  a result, the soldiers were housed off-post in commercial hotels or  apartments.  This created a number of novel situations that were not  specifically addressed in regulations, as discussed later.", "For example, the Virginia 20th Special Forces Army National Guard unit was  mobilized to Fort Bragg, North Carolina, in January 2002.  The unit was  initially housed in World War II era barracks\u2014with free meals in the mess  hall\u2014that were in such poor condition that the company commander  requested and received off-post housing.  The hotel was over 10 miles from  the nearest Fort Bragg dining facility, and with many of the soldiers  assigned to duties that required odd or extended hours that precluded use  of the dining facility, the soldiers found that they were paying for at least  two meals per day out of their own pockets.  When members of the Virginia  20th Special Forces eventually submitted their proportional meal per diem  vouchers to DFAS CTO, some were paid over $2,000 for 4 months of meal  expenses and some were not, due in part to confusion over the meal per  diem entitlements in this situation.  As a result, some soldiers had to obtain  additional documentation and resubmit their vouchers, further adding to  the volume of vouchers.  As of May 2004, 14 soldiers still had not received  the majority of their proportional meal per diem entitlements, ranging from  about $1,600 to over $3,500 per soldier for a mobilization that occurred  over 2 years ago.

In one case, an Army Guard specialist  prepared a voucher on December 8, 2002, and his supervisor approved it  the same day.  It took 124 days before the voucher was stamped as received  by DFAS CTO and another 66 days for DFAS to pay the soldier.

As discussed in detail later in this  report, these issues were caused by weaknesses in the process used to pay  Army Guard travel reimbursements; the human capital practices in this  area, including the lack of adequate training; and nonintegrated automated  systems.  Table 2 summarizes the experiences of Army Guard soldiers in 10  units.  We referred 8 of these units that at the end of our audit included  soldiers who were unpaid, partially paid, or in debt to appropriate DOD  officials to resolve any amounts owed to the Army Guard soldiers or to the  government.", "The following provides more details on the experiences of several of these  units.", "The 114th Military Police Company, Clinton, Mississippi, mobilized the  first time in January 2002 and performed around-the-clock shift work at  Fort Campbell, Kentucky, for approximately 5 months before being sent  to Cuba.  While at Fort Campbell, the soldiers could not always avail  themselves of the base dining facilities and therefore had to pay out-of- pocket for some of their meals.  The soldiers were not informed that  they were eligible for a proportional meal rate until they returned from  Cuba in November 2002.  Due to various other delays, it took over 14  months for the soldiers to be reimbursed about $2,700 each based upon  the proportional meal rate for Fort Campbell.  The unit commander  informed us that the delays put considerable strain on the finances of  some of his lower graded soldiers.", "This unit\u2019s problems were compounded when its soldiers were  mobilized a second time in February 2003 and went to Fort Hood, Texas.   Even though they experienced the same conditions, they were denied  compensation for their out-of-pocket expenses.  Soldiers told us their  duty hours were similar to those they worked at Fort Campbell.  Using  the information from their experiences with the reimbursement process  at Fort Campbell, the unit commander contacted Fort Hood officials to  obtain authorization for reimbursement for costs his soldiers were  incurring due to the inability to use the dining facilities at Fort Hood for  all meals.  The unit commander\u2019s attempts to get authorization for the  proportional meal rate were unsuccessful.  At the time of our audit, we  estimated that none of the 76 soldiers in the unit had been reimbursed  for about 10 months, totaling approximately $6,000 per soldier.", "The Pennsylvania 876th Engineer Battalion was mobilized in support of  Operation Enduring Freedom to perform installation security and force  protection duties at Bad Aibling Station, Germany, from July 2002 to  February 2003.  All deployed members were entitled to the identical per  diem for meals and incidental expenses applicable to their location.   Although the unit\u2019s administrative officer submitted identical vouchers  for each soldier at the end of each month as required, the soldiers  received varying reimbursement amounts each month.   For example,  following the August 2002 submission, 4 soldiers in the unit received  what they believed to be the correct reimbursement of $1,718.  The  remaining 33 soldiers received payments ranging from $371.20 to  $1,485.00.  These types of inconsistencies occurred month after month.", "The commanding officer indicated in a memorandum that \u201cThis is a  hugely demoralizing and frustrating action.\u201d  The administrative officer,  who sent detailed spreadsheets to DFAS CTO, wrote in one e-mail to  DFAS officials, \u201cI have E3\u2019s  who are owed over  $2,000.  These soldiers deserve better....

Travel computation offices routinely returned  improperly prepared and inadequately reviewed vouchers that did not  contain basic required signatures, dates, and travel orders.  Further, DFAS  staffing shortfalls contributed to some of the delays that we noted.  Table 3  shows examples of the extent of delays experienced by soldiers in  obtaining payment for travel expenses.", "The following provides more details for the experiences of some of the  soldiers with payment delays.", "A corporal with the California 49th Military Police Company was  frustrated by the repeated recycling of his voucher eight times through  the travel reimbursement process, which caused his reimbursement of  travel expenses to be delayed for about 17 months.  His story  exemplifies process and human capital flaws.  For example, (1) the  reviewing official approved the voucher even though it lacked  supporting documentation, (2) DFAS CTO did not know that faxed  vouchers were not being printed, and (3) customer service was weak as  evidenced by piecemeal requests for information.  According to the  California unit\u2019s reviewing official, the voucher, along with others, was  initially faxed to DFAS CTO in August 2002.  When not all soldiers  received notification that DFAS CTO had received the vouchers, the unit  official again faxed the vouchers.  The corporal told us that he later  received an e-mail from DFAS CTO requesting his DD Form 214,  Certificate of Release or Discharge from Active Duty.  He submitted the  DD Form 214, but he then received his whole travel voucher package  back from DFAS CTO with a note saying that the DD Form 214 was  missing.  He checked the package and found that the DD Form 214 he  had previously sent was in the materials returned by DFAS CTO.  DFAS  CTO returned the voucher in February 2003 because it was incorrectly  completed and again in October 2003 because it lacked mobilization  orders.  DFAS eventually paid the corporal $779 in December 2003.", "A sergeant with the Utah 142nd Military Intelligence Battalion  experienced an approximate 22-month delay in receiving full  reimbursement for his travel expenses.  Delays for this voucher were  caused by (1) fax problems, (2) missing documents, and (3) DFAS CTO  errors in reimbursing the sergeant for properly supported expenditures.   The sergeant told us that he faxed his voucher to DFAS CTO soon after  his travel ended in October 2002.  When DFAS CTO claimed it had not  received the voucher, he refaxed it in January 2003.  Because he  remobilized in January 2003, he did not learn until he returned in May  2003 that DFAS CTO did not have a record of his January resubmission.   He resubmitted his voucher in May 2003, and DFAS CTO returned it  because he had not attached his DD Form 214, documenting his  discharge from active duty.  After he resubmitted the paperwork in  August 2003, DFAS paid him only $1,269, which did not include all of his  lodging costs or any of his meal expenses while at the TDY location.  He  told us that DFAS CTO could not explain why his meal expenses were  not paid.  Following his resubmission in March 2004, DFAS paid him  $189.78, which was the outstanding balance on his lodging receipts.", "DFAS did not pay the remaining balance of $572.00 for his meals until  after GAO inquired about payment of the voucher in August 2004.", "A sergeant with the Texas 141st Infantry Company had to wait 6 \u00bd  months for reimbursement of his travel expenses because of   (1) miscommunication about his unit\u2019s responsibilities and   (2) subsequent inadequate unit supervisory review.  The sergeant told us  he had been informed that his unit in Guantonamo, Cuba, would prepare  and submit his voucher when his tour of duty ended in December 2002.   About 113 days elapsed before he discovered that his unit in Cuba did  not prepare a voucher on his behalf.  At that point, he asked his home  unit administrator in Texas to help him prepare and submit his voucher  to DFAS CTO.  However, DFAS CTO returned that voucher because it  lacked supervisory signature.  The sergeant believed he needed  supervisory approval from his unit and sent the voucher back to Cuba  for approval.  After it was returned from Cuba, he resubmitted it to  DFAS CTO, but for some reason unknown to him he still did not get  paid.

Not since World War II had  so many Army Guard soldiers been mobilized for extended periods and  essentially placed in travel status for as long as 2 years.  Prior to   September 11, 2001, most travel guidance addressed relatively routine  travel for brief periods and was not always clearly applicable to situations  Army Guard soldiers encountered, particularly when they could not avail  themselves of government-provided meals due to the nature of their duty  assignments.  In October 2001, the Army issued new guidance that was  intended to address travel entitlements unique to Army and Army Guard  soldiers mobilized for the war on terrorism.  However, the lack of clarity in  this guidance created problems not only for Army Guard soldiers but for  numerous other personnel involved with authorizing travel entitlements  and contributed to inaccurate, delayed, and denied travel reimbursements.   Furthermore, inappropriate policy and guidance on how to identify and pay  soldiers entitled to late payment interest and fees because of late travel  reimbursement meant that DOD continued to be noncompliant with TTRA.    As a result, as discussed in the next section, although DOD paid no late  payment interest or fees to Army Guard soldiers through April 2004, we  found a number of cases in which soldiers should have been paid late  payment interest and indications that thousands more may be entitled to  late payment interest.

We noted that the existing guidance (1) provided  unclear eligibility criteria for reimbursement of out-of-pocket meal  expenses, (2) lacked instructions for including meal entitlements on  mobilization orders, and (3) contained inadequate instructions for  preparing and issuing SNAs.", "Two primary sources of guidance used by both Army Guard soldiers and  travel computation office personnel for information on travel entitlements  were the Army\u2019s personnel policy guidance (PPG) for military personnel  mobilized for Operations Iraqi Freedom, Enduring Freedom and Noble  Eagle and DOD\u2019s Joint Federal Travel Regulation (JFTR).  We found that  both Army Guard soldiers and travel computation personnel had difficulty  using these sources to find the information necessary about the rules  regarding travel-related entitlements.  A DFAS CTO official and users told  us that the guidance was legalistic and not user friendly.  Army Guard  soldiers and DFAS CTO examiners had trouble at times interpreting the  guidance, and as a result, soldiers experienced travel reimbursement  problems.", "Table 4 shows the sources of common problems related to meal expense  reimbursements experienced by soldiers in our case studies.", "Unclear eligibility criteria. We found that guidance did not adequately  address some significant conditions that entitled a soldier to  reimbursement of authorized meal expenses.  For example, although the  JFTR entitled soldiers to reimbursement for meal expenses when  transportation was not reasonably available between government meal  facilities and place of lodging, the term \u201creasonably available\u201d was not  defined.  The PPG directed the maximum use of installation facilities, and if  not feasible, then \u201cmulti-passenger vehicles should be used\u201d to transport  soldiers to installation facilities.  However, the PPG is silent regarding what  constitutes adequate transportation, particularly when transportation to  government meal facilities is necessary for Army Guard soldiers who  cannot be housed in government facilities.   As discussed in one of our case  studies, we found disagreements between the soldiers and their command  officials about the adequacy of transportation to government meal facilities  and their entitlement to get reimbursed for eating at commercial facilities  closer to their lodgings.  Without clear guidance on these issues, Army  decisions will continue to appear arbitrary and unfair to soldiers.", "The following illustrates the experiences of the Army Guard soldiers with  the Maryland 115th Military Police Headquarters/Headquarters Company,  their perceptions of unfair and inconsistent treatment, and apparent  confusion between basic allowance for subsistence (BAS) compensation  entitlements and meal entitlements while in TCS status.

As shown in figure 5, the 107 soldiers in the unit were housed in a government-  contracted hotel approximately 3 to 4 miles from the base because the on-base housing  was overcrowded. Soldiers told us that transportation from the hotels to the government  dining facilities was inadequate. They explained that while military buses and vans took  soldiers to and from the base for their shift work duties, the soldiers not on shift,  including those on their days off, had to find their own transportation to the government  dining facilities.", "Approximately 3 weeks into the unit\u2019s mobilization, the battalion commander allowed  some soldiers (E-7 and above) to use their privately owned vehicles, but many other  soldiers were still without vehicles or other means to get to the dining facility. Two  soldiers told us that they purchased bicycles to get to the base. Several soldiers claimed  that because they could not get to the dining facilities, they either walked to local  restaurants, or bought groceries and cookware and cooked meals in their rooms using  hot plates. The soldiers told us they were also aware that other soldiers at Fort Stewart  were similarly housed in hotels, but were paid per diem for meals based on the locality  rate for the area. We confirmed that Florida\u2019s 3220th U.S. Army Reserve Garrison  Support Unit was housed in hotels and was paid per diem for meals. Several soldiers  told us they discussed several issues with their chain of command and company  commanders, including inadequate transportation, having to eat on the economy, the  inconsistencies in their treatment compared to other soldiers, and their eligibility for per  diem. The company commanders discussed these issues with the battalion commander.  The battalion commander told us, \u201cThe soldiers had a contracted hotel and laundry  services and didn\u2019t need per diem. In addition to that, they had access to the mess hall  and were getting BAS.\u201d  When a battalion personnel officer incorrectly told one soldier  that he was not entitled to per diem because he was receiving BAS he stated, \u201cThen  take away my $8 in BAS and give me per diem because I can\u2019t live on $8 a day.\u201d", "The garrison commander told us that he was unaware of the unit\u2019s transportation  problems, and had he known of the problems, he would have issued more vehicles to  the unit.", "Using the proportional meal rate, we estimated that the soldiers could be due  approximately $1,260 each for a total of approximately $135,000 for the period October  2001 to January 2002.

While at Fort Campbell, the 114th performed 24-hour, 7-day shift work  providing force protection services for the 101st Airborne Division and Fort Campbell and  could not always avail themselves of the free meals at the mess hall.  Consequently,  these Army Guard soldiers purchased their meals from commercial sources.  After  soldiers learned of their potential eligibility for reimbursement of meal costs, they  requested and received authorization from the division commander for reimbursement  and, although considerably late, were eventually reimbursed.", "However, while at Fort Hood, the location of their second active duty tour beginning in  February 2003, installation command officials did not authorize reimbursement of their  out-of-pocket costs for meals.  According to the Army Guard soldiers, the conditions at  Fort Hood\u201424-hour shift work and the lack of 24-hour mess halls\u2014were similar to what  they encountered at Fort Campbell.  Fort Hood officials told us that they justified their  decision because free meals were available from the mess hall and noncommissioned  officers could get this food to soldiers who were having problems and by stating that the  basic allowance for subsistence was adequate compensation for any of the soldiers\u2019 out- of-pocket expenditures for meals.  Fort Hood officials did not document their unfavorable  decision or justification for that decision.  Because an official from the Mississippi Guard  Finance Office told them it was a \u201cdead issue,\u201d the unit chose not to contact the  Inspector General\u2019s office. The official told us that he informed the soldiers that they  could not get reimbursed without the approval of the Fort Hood officials.  As a result, we  estimated, based on the proportional meal rate for Fort Hood, that these 76 Army Guard  soldiers were not reimbursed for approximately $6,000 each, totaling about $456,000,  for their meals from February 2003 to January 2004, when they were demobilized.", "In another case, Georgia Army Guard soldiers were frustrated by large  debts when DFAS CTO retroactively disallowed the locality meal rate  authorized by command officials.", "Case Study Illustration: Decisions on Meals Eligibility Result in Overpayments  and Large Debts The soldiers from Georgia\u2019s 190th Military Police Company reported to Fort Benning,  Georgia, in October 2001 for mobilization processing. The unit of 101 soldiers  experienced problems regarding per diem for meals when they were subsequently  deployed from October 2001 through March 2002 to Fort McPherson, Georgia, which  was near the homes of many of the soldiers.  Soldiers told us there was confusion over  who would be entitled to per diem for meals because Fort McPherson had not  established a local commuting area.  Certain soldiers were granted SNAs, signifying  their eligibility for per diem for meals, based on the locality meal rate for the area.   Relying on the determinations, soldiers requested and received per diem for meals,  some in excess of $10,000, for the period they were at Fort McPherson.", "In August 2002, Fort McPherson established a local commuting area.  When DFAS CTO  processed the soldiers\u2019 final settlement vouchers at the end of the deployment, DFAS  CTO used the newly established commuting area to determine eligibility for per diem for  the whole period.  This resulted in DFAS CTO retroactively disallowing per diem and  creating debts totaling approximately $200,000 for 32 soldiers, several in excess of  $10,000.  Debt collections were initiated against the soldiers\u2019 pay while they were in Iraq  on a second mobilization in 2003, creating adverse financial impacts on the soldiers and  their families.  The 190th unit commander was able to get the debt collections suspended  until they returned from Iraq.  Following demobilization, debt collections were reinstituted  and are currently being made against the soldiers\u2019 monthly drill pay.  During our audit,  many of these soldiers still had unresolved and unpaid debts on their records, two in  excess of $10,000.", "We requested that DFAS CTO review all of the records to determine whether the  soldiers were properly reimbursed for travel entitlements, and whether the debt amounts  were correct. DFAS CTO officials agreed and at the conclusion of our audit were in the  process of determining who was entitled to per diem while at Fort McPherson.", "These cases illustrate the effects of guidance that does not clearly identify  eligibility criteria and leaves meal eligibility determinations to the  interpretation of individual commands.  Although it would not be practical  to develop guidance for every possible travel scenario, we noted that the  JFTR included useful situational examples to assist decision makers in  determining nonavailability related to lodging and meals, while the PPG  lacked similar specific contingency travel examples.", "Lack of specific entitlements on orders.   Army and Army Guard  policies and procedures do not provide for mobilization orders issued to  Army Guard soldiers to clearly state that these soldiers should not be  required to pay for meals provided to them at government dining facilities.

As a result, unless the orders contain the appropriate  statements about meal entitlements, installations sometimes  inappropriately charge Army Guard soldiers for their meals.", "In response to questions we posed to officials representing the Mississippi  Adjutant General\u2019s office regarding why mobilization orders did not include  adequate provisions about food entitlements, they explained that the  individual mobilization orders that are prepared by the Adjutant General\u2019s  staff are very basic and include only the travel allowances and actions that  are necessary to get the individual from the home station to the  mobilization station.  The Adjutant General\u2019s office received no guidance  on what should be stated in the orders with respect to soldiers eating free  of charge at government installations or any other conditions that may  entitle Army Guard soldiers to per diem to compensate them for their out- of-pocket meal costs.", "We discussed the problem of unclear mobilization orders with Army  officials during our audit.

They were told that the government  dining facility nearest to their lodging was approximately 1 mile away.  When the soldiers  went to eat at the dining facility, they were told that they had to pay for their meals  because their orders did not indicate they could eat free.  Consequently, the soldiers  either (1) continued to pay for their meals at the government dining facility, (2) purchased  groceries and cooked in their rooms, or (3) ate at local restaurants.  The dining facility  manager told us that if the soldier\u2019s orders did not specifically indicate government  meals at no cost, then his staff was instructed to charge the soldier for meals.", "The administrative noncommissioned officer for the Mississippi 20th SFG learned from a  soldier in a different group, that he was being reimbursed the locality rate (which at that  time was $36 per day) for meals purchased at his own expense.

The orders retroactively authorized meal per  diem of $11 per day to the soldiers of the 20th SFG, allowing them to be partially  reimbursed for their out-of-pocket expenses from January 2002 to October 2002.  The  orders also authorized the soldiers to eat in the dining facility at no charge beginning in  October 2002.  As of the end of our audit, the administrative noncommissioned officer  estimated that $150,000 was still to be paid to 75 soldiers.", "In another instance, Army Guard soldiers called to federal duty under the  authority of Title 32 for security missions in late 2001 and early 2002  experienced significant delays in getting reimbursed for travel  expenditures.

For example, one soldier told us his government travel card  was canceled due to nonpayment, another soldier\u2019s family had to rely on the spouse\u2019s  salary to pay bills, and another\u2019s child support payments were late or less than the  minimum required payments.", "Confusing, nonstandard SNAs.  Lack of standardization and changing  guidance has resulted in SNAs of various form and content, signed by  officials at different levels of authority.  Consequently, travel computation  office reviewers were unable to consistently determine the validity of  SNAs.  Our case studies identified travel computation reviewers who have  rejected soldiers\u2019 requests for reimbursements even though they were  supported by valid SNAs.", "The most recent PPG guidance authorizes the installation commander to  determine whether to issue an SNA based on each unit\u2019s situation and the  availability of government housing.   The guidance states that when  government or government-contracted quarters are not available, soldiers  will be provided certificates or statements of non-availability for both  lodging and meals to authorize per diem.  However, the guidance does not  specify the form and content of the SNAs.  Consequently, at several case  study units, we found that the form of the SNA and the content of the  information on the form varied at the discretion of the issuing command.   For example, one installation stamped the soldiers\u2019 orders and handwrote  an SNA identification number in a block provided by the stamp.  Another  location provided a written memo that stated that the meal component of  per diem was authorized because there were no food facilities at the  government installation.  Another provided a single SNA with a roster  attached that listed the names of the soldiers who were authorized per  diem.  The variety of SNA formats can cause confusion for the soldier, who  does not know what documentation is needed for reimbursement and  whether the travel computation office will accept it.  The travel  computation office personnel can also be confused about the criteria for a  valid SNA, as illustrated by the following case study.", "Case Study Illustration:  SNAs for Meal Reimbursement Not Consistently  Accepted  Sixty-five soldiers in B Company, 20th Special Forces of the Virginia Army National  Guard received orders to mobilize to Fort Bragg, North Carolina in early 2002.  After  about 3 weeks, the unit moved to government contracted quarters off-post and soldiers  were authorized proportional per diem for two meals a day during their Fort Bragg duty  period.  After returning from overseas duty, 51 soldiers prepared and submitted their  final travel vouchers, with identical SNA documents attached, to DFAS CTO in  November and December 2002.  Some of the soldiers\u2019 meal component per diem claims  were approved and paid by DFAS; others were not.  Inconsistent recognition and  acceptance of identical SNAs resulted in 24 soldiers receiving timely reimbursements  and 12 soldiers receiving late reimbursements after having to resubmit their vouchers  with additional documentation to receive their proportional per diem.  Furthermore, at  the time we completed our audit of B Company\u2019s travel vouchers in May 2004,  approximately 22 percent of the soldiers (14 of 65) still had not received the majority of  their proportional per diem entitlement.  Travel reimbursements, ranging from about  $1,600 to over $3,500, had not been made to these 14 soldiers.  In June 2004, DFAS  CTO processed vouchers for 10 of the 14 soldiers and made final payments for meal  expenses they incurred during their Fort Bragg duty.  The remaining 4 soldiers had not  been paid at the completion of our audit.", "Our work found instances in which installation commands denied soldiers\u2019  requests for SNAs.  In response to our inquiries, we found that commands  do not generally document their rationale for denying SNAs and there is no  requirement for them to do so.  This lack of documentation can leave  soldiers even more confused and frustrated when seeking answers as to  why their requests for per diem were denied.

If  the dates on these vouchers were correct, the soldiers who submitted  proper vouchers within 5 days of the date travel ended would be entitled to  late payment interest if they were not paid within the 30-day limit.", "TTRA and federal travel regulations require the payment of a late payment  fee consisting of (1) late payment interest, generally equivalent to the  Prompt Payment Act Interest Rate, plus (2) a late payment fee equivalent to  the late payment charge, which could have been charged by the  government travel card contractor.  Late payment interest and fees are to  be paid to soldiers if their reimbursements are not paid within 30 days of  the submission of a proper voucher.", "In our 2002 report on Army travel cards we reported DFAS  noncompliance with TTRA due to the lack of procedures and necessary  systems and data to make the required computations.  In response to our  recommendations in that report, DFAS revised its procedures in April 2003.    Until that time, DFAS required individual soldiers to submit requests for  late payment interest and fees if they believed their vouchers were paid  late.  According to DOD\u2019s FMR, the traveler was required to submit a  supplemental voucher through his or her supervisor/approving official  requesting the payment.", "The 2003 guidance issued by DFAS Indianapolis stated that Army travel  computation offices would identify vouchers for late payment interest and  fees rather than require individual soldiers to take the initiative to file  claims for late payment interest and fees.  However, DFAS\u2019s interpretation  of the guidance limited the payment of late payment interest and fees to  only the final settlement travel voucher for all travel under a particular  travel order.  This practice contributed to continued noncompliance with  the law because it effectively excluded large numbers of monthly or  accrual vouchers from consideration of late payment interest and fees.  In  response to our inquiries, DFAS officials told us that as of April 2004, they  had not paid any late payment interest or fees to soldiers because no final  settlement vouchers were paid late.", "We questioned DFAS officials about their decision to exclude accrual  vouchers from potential payment of late payment interest and fees.  As a  result, DFAS issued new guidance dated May 2004 to clarify that all travel  voucher reimbursements are subject to late payment interest and fees.   However, the provision in DOD\u2019s FMR pertaining to this issue continues to  require that individual soldiers request the late payment interest and fees.   Furthermore, due to automated systems issues discussed later, DFAS does  not have the capability to automatically identify late vouchers or calculate  the late payment interest and fees. Consequently, travel computation  offices have to use manual procedures to identify late vouchers and make  manual calculations.  Additionally, the new guidance directs reviewers to  sign travel vouchers on the same day that they are submitted and then  establishes the reviewers\u2019 signature date as the date of submission of a  proper voucher.  We are unaware of any control procedure to monitor that  reviewers are complying with the requirement.", "Subsequent to DFAS\u2019s dissemination of the new guidance, we found  numerous late vouchers for which DFAS did not pay late payment interest  and fees.  For example, the final vouchers for 63 soldiers with the Georgia  Army National Guard\u2019s 190th Military Police Company were processed late  in April 2004 without payment of late payment interest or fees, even though  they were covered by DFAS guidance issued in 2003.  The vouchers were  approved by unit reviewers on February 6, 2004, and were submitted to the  Georgia USPFO on February 10, 2004, for additional review to identify any  deficiencies that may cause the vouchers to be rejected.  Due to the  USPFO\u2019s workload and the unavailability of appropriate personnel to  review the vouchers, the vouchers remained at the USPFO from   February 10, 2004 until April 2, 2004.  DFAS CTO eventually received the  vouchers on April 9, 2004, and paid them on April 27, 2004.  The payments  were made a total of 81 days after the supervisory signatures, thus making  the payments 51 days over the 30 days allowed for payment.  According to a  DFAS official, DFAS\u2019s manual procedures did not detect the vouchers as  needing late payment interest and fees.  Travel clerks were supposed to  review dates of supervisory signatures to determine if the 30-day limit was  exceeded and thus require the payment of late payment interest and fees.   We notified DFAS officials of the oversight and they subsequently made the  interest payments.  A DFAS official also informed us that additional  changes to DFAS\u2019s manual procedures were being made to ensure that late  vouchers are properly identified and late payment interest and fees paid.

However, neither DOD  management officials nor we could determine the root cause of all  instances of missing information.  Some soldiers told us that DFAS CTO  lost documentation that they had submitted.  DFAS CTO also experienced  problems with faxed vouchers, which caused vouchers and supporting  documentation not to be printed and processed in some cases.  According  to a DFAS CTO official, DFAS was unaware that faxed vouchers were not  printing until a soldier complained that DFAS was not receiving his faxes.   DFAS did not monitor incoming faxes, even though it reported that faxed  travel vouchers account for approximately 60 percent of the total mobilized  Army Guard and Reserve travel vouchers it received. These problems  obstructed the normal handling of a number of those vouchers.  In an effort  to resolve this problem, DFAS CTO, in March 2004, ceased relying on an  automatic print function of the fax system software and began manually  printing vouchers.", "As shown in figure 7, our audit of a nonrepresentative selection of 139  travel vouchers (69 computed by DFAS CTO and 70 by USPFOs) found  significant delays occurred between the date of the reviewer\u2019s signature  and the date that the travel computation office accepted the voucher.

The soldier prepared and submitted a travel voucher for $765 and  signed it on August 28, 2002.  His unit supervisor signed the voucher as  reviewed on the same day.  The travel computation office rejected the  voucher and sent it back to the soldier because the proper documentation  was not attached.  The travel computation office returned the voucher to  the soldier a second time because it did not have the necessary signatures.   A complete travel voucher was finally received and accepted by the travel  computation office on April 25, 2003, 240 days after the unit\u2019s initial review  and was not paid until mid-June 2003.", "The Army\u2019s lack of processwide oversight, including monitoring of the  rejection and return of vouchers by DFAS CTO and other travel  computation offices, resulted in undetected delays in reimbursement,  leading to unnecessary frustration with the Army\u2019s travel and  reimbursement process and potential financial difficulty for the soldier.   Further, without establishing and monitoring program metrics,  management had no assurance that it had identified where the breakdowns  were occurring and could not take the appropriate steps to resolve any  identified problems.  For example, although the Army relied on the  individual unit reviewer for assurance that travel vouchers were properly  reviewed and transmitted promptly to the travel computation offices, the  Army did not establish and monitor performance metrics to hold these  reviewers accountable for their critical role in the process.", "DFAS CTO officials told us that they have taken several steps to reduce the  number of vouchers being returned to the soldiers due to missing  signatures and missing mobilization orders.  DFAS and the National Guard  Financial Services Center\u2014a field operating agency of the Chief, National  Guard Bureau, that performs selected financial services\u2014entered into a  Memorandum of Agreement effective February 2004 whereby DFAS will  obtain the assistance of the National Guard to address problems with  certain vouchers that would otherwise be returned to soldiers.  According  to DFAS CTO data, since the implementation of the agreement through the  end of fiscal year 2004, 13,523 travel vouchers were coordinated with the  National Guard in this manner rather than initially being sent back to the  soldiers for correction.  However, we did not assess the effectiveness of  these changes in reducing the number of vouchers that ultimately are  returned to soldiers or in reducing the time necessary to process and pay  vouchers.", "Although metrics were available on the average time DFAS CTO took to  pay travel vouchers after receipt, the Army did not have statistical data on  supplemental vouchers that could help provide additional insight into the  extent and cause of processing errors or omissions by voucher examiners,  unit reviewers, or Army Guard soldiers.  Several of our case studies  indicate that accuracy may be an important issue.  For example, one  method DFAS CTO uses to correct a voucher error or omission is to  process a supplemental voucher.  According to DFAS data, DFAS CTO  processed about 251,000 vouchers related to Army Guard soldiers  mobilized during the period October 1, 2001, through November 30, 2003, of  which over 10,600 were supplemental vouchers.  However, DFAS CTO  officials could not tell us how many of these were due to errors or  omissions by DFAS examiners or other factors.  Our audit of 69  supplemental vouchers for the California 185th case study unit showed that  41 were due to DFAS CTO errors and the remaining 28 were due to errors  or omissions on the part of the soldiers.

For example, DFAS did not systematically record the nature of the calls to  the toll-free number.  According to DFAS data, this number, staffed by 30  DFAS employees, received over 15,000 calls in June 2004.  By monitoring  the types of calls and the nature of the problems reported, important  information could have been developed to help target areas where training  or improved guidance may be warranted.

He explained that there was only one block on the travel  voucher form to insert a single order number.  He attached the TCS order, incorrectly  assuming that the DFAS CTO examiner would know that the soldiers, being in an Army  Guard unit, could not have been on TCS duty in Germany performing installation  security and force protection duties without having been mobilized.  As a result, he was  concerned when he and other soldiers were reimbursed for the 1 week of their travel  expenditures incurred in Germany, but not for the 3 weeks of expenses incurred during  their initial duty at Fort Dix, New Jersey, where soldiers participated in mobilization  training and other activities prior to overseas deployment.  These expenses included  transportation to Fort Dix, New Jersey, and daily incidental expenses. DFAS CTO asked  him to submit new travel vouchers for this 3-week period with the mobilization order  attached, which he did.  The soldiers in this unit were collectively paid $7,400 about 4  weeks later, which represented the balance due on their initial travel vouchers.", "DFAS CTO personnel.  DFAS CTO also had challenges training its  examiner staff.  The increase in mobilizations since September 11, 2001,  and resulting increase in travel voucher submissions put a strain on DFAS  CTO\u2019s ability to make prompt and accurate travel reimbursements to Army  Guard soldiers.  As discussed previously, DFAS CTO hired more than 200  staff from October 2001 through July 2003, which brought the total number  of staff to approximately 240.  The training of these new employees was  delivered on-the-job.  Training time depended on the individual and type of  work.  For example, according to a DFAS CTO official, it took from 1 to 3  months for a voucher examiner to reach established standards.  The DFAS  CTO official told us that, in some cases, on-the-job training proved to be  inadequate and contributed to travel reimbursement errors during this  period.", "Two of our case studies indicated that mistakes by DFAS CTO contributed  to reimbursement problems.  For example, our California case study  indicated that 33 soldiers were initially underpaid a total of almost $25,000  for meals, lodging, and incidental expenses when personnel at DFAS CTO  selected an incorrect duty location and a corresponding incorrect per diem  rate.  Although these soldiers eventually received the amounts they were  due, the corrections took months to resolve. Another example, described  next, shows inconsistencies and errors in the payment of meal and  incidental expense per diem to soldiers in a Pennsylvania Guard unit.", "Pennsylvania Army National Guard soldiers from Company C, 876th Engineer Battalion  were deployed to Bad Aibling Station, Germany, in late July 2002, to augment active  duty forces that were providing enhanced security at this installation.  The 37 soldiers in  Company C were authorized to purchase their meals because mess facilities were not  available.  Each month, the unit administrator prepared and submitted vouchers to DFAS  CTO for reimbursement of meal and incidental expenses.  Although each of the 37  soldiers should have received, in any given month, the same reimbursement amount,  the actual payments to soldiers were not identical.  For the first 3 months of their  deployment, soldiers\u2019 travel reimbursements varied significantly.  For example, for the  September 2002 vouchers, payments ranged from $105 up to $1,655.  Additionally, 3  soldiers did not receive payment on their September vouchers for several months.  The  unit administrator told us he contacted DFAS CTO numerous times to discuss the  inconsistencies with soldiers\u2019 reimbursements, and DFAS CTO representatives provided  specific payment amounts that soldiers should expect to receive.  However, when  incorrect payments continued, he said he was not sure that DFAS CTO knew what to  pay the soldiers.

Of the 36, 12 soldiers experienced at least one payment error and the  remaining 24 soldiers experienced multiple payment errors.  When DFAS CTO  attempted to correct payment errors to soldiers by processing additional payments, the  additional payments resulted in overpayments to 35 soldiers because DFAS CTO  examiners made errors in determining the daily meal and incidental expense per diem  rate.  DFAS CTO caught some of these overpayments and processed collections on  final vouchers.  Fifteen soldiers received collection notices from DFAS on their final  vouchers and, although most of these soldiers had debt amounts ranging from $200 to  $300 dollars each, 1 soldier had almost $1,350 deducted from his final voucher  payment.", "Although overpayments were collected from 15 soldiers in this unit, most of the  remaining soldiers also received overpayments that have yet to be addressed.

In January  1995, the DOD Task Force to Reengineer Travel issued a report stating  that this was a principal cause of the inefficient travel system. As we have  reported and testified, decades-old financial management problems  related to the proliferation of systems, due in part to DOD components  receiving and controlling their own information technology investment  funding, result in the current fragmented, nonstandardized systems.  Lacking either an integrated or effectively interfaced set of travel  authorization, voucher preparation, and reimbursement systems, the Army  Guard must rely on a time-consuming collection of source documents and  error-prone manual entry of data into a travel voucher computation system,  as shown in figure 9.", "With an effectively integrated system, changes to personnel records, such  as mobilization orders, would automatically transfer to the travel pay  system. While not as efficient as an integrated system, an automatic  personnel-to-travel pay system interface can reduce delays caused by the  return of vouchers for missing travel authorizations. Without an effective  interface between the personnel and travel pay systems, we found  instances in which travel vouchers were returned to soldiers due to missing  travel authorizations, causing significant time delays. For example, DOD  took almost 500 days to pay a California Army Guard soldier his travel pay.  This extensive delay was due in part to the soldier not submitting a paper  copy of his mobilization order.  If the system that created the mobilization  order had interfaced with the travel voucher computation system, a portion  of Army Guard and Army Reserve vouchers returned by DFAS CTO\u2014a  significant problem as discussed previously\u2014could have been eliminated.  This, in turn, would increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the process  by reducing paper, reducing the return voucher workload at DFAS CTO,  and decreasing the time to reimburse the soldiers.", "Further, the lack of an integrated travel system and consequent  \u201cworkarounds\u201d increase the risk of errors and create the current inefficient  process. As noted previously, several separate WINIATS systems at DFAS  and the USPFOs can process travel vouchers for mobilized Army Guard  soldiers. These databases operate on separate local area networks that do  not exchange or share data with other travel computation offices to ensure  travel reimbursements have not already been paid. Instead, as shown in  figure 9, multiple WINIATS systems transmit data to the DFAS Operational  Data Store (ODS)\u2014a separate database that stores disbursement  transactions.  As a result, when a soldier submits a voucher, voucher  examiners must resort to extraction and manual review of data from ODS.  Next, voucher examiners research and calculate previous payments\u2014 advances or interim payments\u2014made by other Army WINIATS systems.  This information is then manually entered into WINIATS for it to compute  the correct travel reimbursement for the current claim.  In addition to being  time consuming, this manual workaround can also lead to mistakes.  For  example, a Michigan soldier was overpaid $1,384 when two travel  computation offices paid him for travel expenses incurred during the same  period in August and September 2002.  This overpayment was detected by  DFAS CTO when the soldier filed his final voucher in August 2003.", "Lack of Automated Systems  DOD lacks an automated system for preparing travel vouchers, which  hinders the travel reimbursement process.  As shown in figure 9, soldiers  manually prepare their paper travel vouchers and attach many paper travel  authorizations and receipts and distribute them via mail, fax, or e-mail to  one of the travel computation offices.  The lack of an automated system  increases the risk of missing documents in voucher submissions, which  results in an increased number of vouchers rejected and returned by DFAS  CTO.  Another consequence of this inefficient process is the need for  additional staff to process the vouchers, as discussed earlier in this report.    In addition, the Army currently lacks a centralized system to issue uniquely  numbered and standard formatted SNAs regarding housing and dining  facilities for mobilized soldiers. The lack of centralized standard data  precludes electronic linking with any voucher computation system and the  reduction of paperwork for individual soldiers, as they must obtain and  accumulate various paper authorizations to submit with their vouchers.", "Further, the Army lacks an automated system for producing TCS orders. As  illustrated at the top of figure 9, the various mobilization stations use a  word processing program to type and print each individual TCS order to  move a soldier to such places as Afghanistan and Iraq. Similar to the  process for SNAs, mobilization stations maintain separate document files  for each TCS order issued. The absence of a standard automated system  used by each of the mobilization stations prevents the Army from  electronically sharing TCS data with other systems, such as a voucher  computation system. Consequently, the process will remain vulnerable to  delays for returned voucher submissions as mobilized Army Guard soldiers  continue to receive paper SNAs and TCS orders. Finally, even if the Army  automates the TCS, SNA, and voucher preparation processes, as discussed  previously, these new automated systems would need to be either  integrated or interfaced with a voucher computation system to decrease  the amount of time from initiation of travel to final settlement of travel  expenses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other System Problems", "paragraphs": ["In addition to being stand-alone, nonintegrated systems that do not have  the capability to exchange/share information, the over 60 separate  WINIATS systems at DFAS and the USPFOs that can process travel  vouchers for mobilized Army Guard soldiers do not consistently capture  critical dates useful for management oversight and tracking.  As a result,  complete and accurate information is not transmitted to ODS\u2014the  separate DFAS database that stores disbursement transactions\u2014and is not  available for a variety of management needs.  Specifically, many Army  Guard USPFOs were not populating key data fields in WINIATS, such as the  voucher preparation date, supervisor review date, and the travel  computation office receipt date.

However, DTS is currently not able to process  mobilized travel authorizations (e.g., mobilization orders, TCS orders, and  SNAs) and vouchers and, therefore, does not provide an end-to-end  solution for paying mobilized Army Guard soldiers for travel entitlements.   According to DOD, DTS will provide this capability when the Defense  Integrated Military Human Resources System (DIMHRS) is implemented.   Currently, DOD plans to deploy DIMHRS to the Army Guard in March 2006.   In addition, DTS does not identify and calculate late payment interest and  fees required by law.

Given DOD\u2019s past failed attempts at developing and  implementing systems on time, within budget, and with the promised  capability, and that the effort has already been under way for about 8 years,  it is likely that the department will be relying on the existing paper- intensive, manual system for the foreseeable future.", "In July 1994, the DOD Task Force to Reengineer Travel was formed to study  the existing travel system. In January 1995, this task force concluded that  the existing travel system was fragmented, inefficient, expensive to  administer, and occasionally impeded mission accomplishment. It  recommended new travel policies and procedures, simplified entitlements,  and recommended the travel process take advantage of automation to  become traveler friendly and efficient. In December 1995, the Program  Management Office-Defense Travel System (PMO-DTS) was established to  implement these recommendations and acquire reengineered travel  services from commercial vendors.", "At the end of fiscal year 2003, DOD reported investing nearly 8 years and  about $288 million in DTS.  In 2003, PMO-DTS estimated an additional   $251 million was needed for DTS to be fully operational at the end of fiscal  year 2006, resulting in an estimated total development and production cost  of over 10 years and $539 million. This cost estimate does not include  deploying DTS to the majority of the Army Guard USPFOs.  Although the  Army Guard supplies most of the mobilized soldiers in support of the global  war on terrorism, DTS deployment to the 54 USPFOs is not scheduled to  begin until fiscal year 2006.

DOD\u2019s current strategy is for DTS to electronically  capture the travel authorization information from DIMHRS, after which a  soldier would use DTS to prepare and submit a travel voucher.

The process, human capital, and automated systems  problems we identified related to Army Guard travel reimbursement are  additional examples of the broader, long-standing financial management  and business transformation challenges faced by DOD.  Similar to our  previously reported findings for numerous other DOD business operations,  the travel reimbursement process has evolved over years into the stove- piped, paper-intensive process that exists today and was ill-prepared to  respond to the current large and sustained mobilizations.  Without  systematic oversight of key program metrics, breakdowns in the process  remain unidentified and effective controls cannot be established and  monitored.  Finally, DOD\u2019s long-standing inability to develop and  implement systems solutions on time, within budget, and with the  promised capability appears to be a critical impediment in this area.

DOD  partially concurred with our recommendations regarding (1) development  of an automated, centralized system for SNAs, covering potential  nonavailability of government meals or lodging for mobilized Army Guard  soldiers, and (2) incorporation into requirements development for DTS a  complete understanding of the Army Guard travel reimbursement  problems including late payment interest and fees pursuant to TTRA.  The  actions proposed by DOD to these two recommendations do not ensure  that SNA problems we identified will be corrected or that DOD will have a  travel system in place that will comply with TTRA, thus continuing the risk  that soldiers will not receive all payments they are entitled to receive.  The  department also requested the inclusion of additional responsible DOD  officials in the recommendations section of this report, which we have  added as appropriate.", "Concerning our recommendation that DOD develop an automated,  centralized system for SNAs, DOD responded that the Office of the Under  Secretary of Defense (Personnel and Readiness) (OUSD (P&R)) and the  DTS Program Management Office are working closely to ensure that  functional requirements for military travel processes are incorporated in  the development of DTS and DIMHRS.  DOD also pointed out that DIMHRS  is tentatively scheduled to be deployed to the Army National Guard in  March 2006, and that therefore, it is not feasible to develop an \u201cinterim\u201d  automated, centralized system for SNAs.  DOD also stated that in the  interim, OUSD (P&R) will work with the military services\u2019 lodging  communities to establish a standard SNA, and that a centralized process  will be developed for all military services.", "Based on our understanding of the planned and existing functionalities of  DTS and DIHMRS and the problems identified during our audit, we do not  agree with DOD\u2019s reasons for not resolving the stated weaknesses.   Specifically, according to a DOD OUSD (P&R) official in the Requirements  and Reengineering Division, Joint Requirements and Integration Office,  DIMHRS is not currently being designed to issue SNAs.  Further, although  DOD stated that it plans to develop a standard SNA form and centralized  SNA process, this response does not provide for the development of an  automated system, which could be incorporated into the development of  DIMHRS or DTS either as an integrated capability or an interoperable  interface.  By planning to work with lodging communities to establish a  standard SNA, it appears that DOD is taking an initial step toward  addressing the plight of mobilized Army Guard soldiers who have had  problems regarding SNAs.  However, DOD needs to ensure that all  information regarding nonavailability of both lodging and meals is available  to appropriate decision-makers in the SNA approval process.", "The majority of problems experienced by Army Guard soldiers in our case  studies related to whether meals were determined to be adequately  available to soldiers in various circumstances such as the irregular hours  required by guard duty, distance to meal facilities, inadequate  transportation to meal facilities, lack of 24-hour mess halls, or other  circumstances.  Proper consideration of these meal issues in addition to  those related to lodging, generally includes review through the soldier\u2019s  chain of command and installation commander and should result in timely  decisions to either (1) issue SNAs that authorize per diem for meals,  enabling Army Guard soldiers to be reimbursed for food from commercial  locations or (2) ensure that Army Guard soldiers receive government- provided meals free of charge.  Because DOD\u2019s comments do not provide  solutions to the range of problems we observed with the SNA process, we  continue to recommend that an automated, centralized system for SNAs be  developed, which addresses the variety of nonavailability issues  experienced by mobilized Army Guard soldiers.", "In regard to DOD\u2019s partial concurrence with our recommendation related  to DTS and TTRA compliance, DOD stated that this programming feature  was not required because the travel reimbursement process is completed  within 5 days of the traveler entering pertinent data into DTS.  DOD\u2019s  internal processes stipulate that before a travel voucher entered into DTS  can be paid, it must be reviewed and approved.  However, our report  documented significant delays in the review and approval process in the  current paper intensive system, and DOD did not provide any support for  its claim that DTS reimbursements will be made within a 5-day period.  We  continue to see the need for full DOD implementation of this  recommendation because the review and approval process is a human  capital function that DTS will not replace.  Further, the likelihood of late  payment of travel vouchers processed through DTS remains because of  potential factors such as (1) excessive work loads, (2) questions during  document reviews, (3) inadequate attention to reviewer responsibilities,  and (4) other unforeseen delays in the process.   To ensure that Army  Guard soldiers and others are paid late payment interest and fees required  pursuant to TTRA, DTS would need to include capabilities to identify,  calculate, and pay such late payment interest and fees.  Such capability  would also allow DOD to conduct ongoing monitoring of the timeliness of  travel reimbursements made through DTS.", "Finally, regarding the 21 recommendations with which DOD concurred,  DOD indicated that the stated action(s) taken were complete with respect  to the need for (1) mobilization and related travel orders to clearly state  meal entitlements, (2) standardization of the form and content of SNAs for  contingency operations, (3) development and monitoring of late payment  interest and fee metrics, (4) appointment of an agencywide leadership  position or ombudsman, (5) identification of root causes for untimely and  improperly prepared and submitted travel vouchers, and (6) evaluation of  the adequacy and frequency of travel voucher preparation training  provided to mobilized Army Guard soldiers.

The data contained approximately 6 million  civilian, Army, Army Reserve, and Army Guard travel voucher transactions  paid through the DFAS-IN disbursing station symbol number 5570.

TTRA requires the  payment of a late payment fee as prescribed by 41 C.F.R. \u00a7 301-71.210  requiring the payment of a late payment fee consisting of (1) late payment  interest, generally equivalent to the Prompt Payment Act Interest Rate, plus  (2) a late payment charge equivalent to the late payment charge, which  could have been charged by the government travel card contractor.  This  late payment penalty and interest is to be paid to soldiers if their  reimbursements are not paid within 30 days of the submission of proper  vouchers.  As part of our audit, we determined if any of the 139 individual  vouchers we selected were timely and properly submitted by Army Guard  soldiers and whether they had received late payment interest owed to  them.
