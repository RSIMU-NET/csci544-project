IRCA required employers to comply with an employment verification process intended to provide employers with a means to avoid hiring unauthorized aliens. Generally, IRCA requires employers to verify the identity and eligibility of all new employees hired after November 6, 1986.", "Under IRCA, employers must request newly hired employees to present a document or documents that establish their identity and eligibility to work. As of February 1999, INS rules allowed employees to present 27 different documents\u20148 that establish both identity and eligibility to work (e.g., a U.S. passport or INS permanent resident card, which is also called a \u201cgreen card\u201d); 12 that establish identity (e.g., a driver\u2019s license); and 7 that establish eligibility to work (e.g., a Social Security card, other than one containing the following legend: \u201cNot Valid for Employment\u201d). The employment verification process that INS established pursuant to IRCA requires employers to complete the Employment Eligibility Verification Form, INS Form I-9, certifying that they have reviewed the documents and that the documents appear genuine and relate to the individual. In making their certifications, employers are expected to judge whether the documents presented are obviously counterfeit or fraudulent. Unless INS has evidence that the employer knew the employee was unauthorized to work, employers are deemed in compliance with the law if they have followed the verification procedures, even though an unauthorized alien may have presented fraudulent documents that appeared genuine.", "IRCA provides penalties or sanctions against employers who violate the law. Employers who fail to properly complete, retain, or present for inspection a Form I-9 may face civil fines ranging from $100 to $1,000 for each employee for whom the form was not completed, retained, or presented. Employers who knowingly hire or continue to employ unauthorized aliens may be fined from $250 to $10,000, depending upon whether the violation is a first or subsequent offense. Employers who engage in a pattern or practice of knowingly hiring or continuing to employ unauthorized aliens are subject to criminal penalties consisting of fines up to $3,000 per employee and/or up to 6-months imprisonment.", "During the legislative debate on IRCA, concerns were expressed that employers fearing sanctions would not hire \u201cforeign-looking or foreign- sounding\u201d citizens and aliens authorized to work. As a result, IRCA prohibits employers with four or more employees from discriminating against any authorized worker on the basis of citizenship or national origin. IRCA established Justice\u2019s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices (OSC) to investigate certain charges of discrimination.", "INS has a worksite enforcement program that is responsible for checking employer compliance with IRCA\u2019s verification requirements and enforcing IRCA\u2019s employer sanctions provisions.

As a result, unauthorized aliens\u2019 use of fraudulent documents was undermining IRCA\u2019s employment verification process and improvements were needed. On the basis of responses from about 4,400 employers who responded to our survey, we also concluded that, while about 65 percent of employers were complying with the Form I-9 verification requirements, most employers wanted a simpler or better verification system. A majority of the employers we surveyed indicated that the federal government should consider such things as reducing the number of work authorization documents INS issued and establishing systems for employers to contact INS and SSA to verify INS documents and Social Security numbers (SSN).", "We also concluded that there was widespread discrimination against eligible workers as a result of IRCA. We stated that many employers appeared confused over the variety of documents that could be used to verify employment and uncertain about how to comply with IRCA\u2019s verification system. For example, some employers did not accept valid work authorization documents, and some employers said they only asked alien employees, rather than all employees, to show documents.

INS is then to hold a seminar for these employers to educate them on such things as how to properly prepare the Form I-9 and how to detect fraudulent documents. The employers are then to be given a list of aliens INS believes are unauthorized to work. The employer must either re-verify that the alien is authorized to work or dismiss the alien. INS could then inform the employer that it intended to arrest any unauthorized aliens.

As a result, unauthorized aliens have been able to circumvent the current employment verification process, thereby making it difficult for employers who are willing to comply with the law by hiring only authorized workers to do so.", "Various studies have pointed out that fraudulent documents are largely responsible for the ineffectiveness of the employment verification process. For example, we reported in 1990 that the prevalence of fraudulent documents threatened to undermine the employment verification process and the system needed improvement. In its 1997 report to Congress, the Commission on Immigration Reform reiterated its 1994 conclusion that the single most important step that could be taken to reduce unlawful migration was the development of a more effective system for verifying work authorization. It noted that the widespread availability of fraudulent documents makes it easy for unauthorized aliens to obtain jobs. Similarly, INS has noted that the proliferation of inexpensive fraudulent documents makes it almost impossible for employers to ensure employment to only authorized workers.", "Our analysis of INS data showed that large numbers of unauthorized aliens have used fraudulent documents to obtain employment. Between October 1, 1996, and May 29, 1998, INS completed about 9,600 employer investigations that were based on leads from various sources, such as the public or other agencies. In about 3,500 investigations (or 36 percent) INS reported that about 78,000 fraudulent documents pertaining to about 50,000 unauthorized aliens were used to obtain employment. In about 2,100 (or 60 percent) of the 3,500 investigations in which INS found fraudulent documents, INS determined that the employer had complied with the employment verification process and did not knowingly hire unauthorized aliens, but that unauthorized aliens\u2019 use of fraudulent documents circumvented the process. In the other 1,400 (or 40 percent) of the 3,500 investigations involving fraudulent documents, INS decided to fine the employer, take no action against the employer for various reasons (e.g., the employer went out of business), or issue the employer a warning notice. Of the 78,000 fraudulent documents identified, about 60 percent were INS documents, such as permanent resident cards; about 36 percent were Social Security cards; and about 4 percent were other documents, such as drivers\u2019 licenses. These documents were either counterfeit documents or genuine documents used fraudulently to obtain employment.", "Large-scale counterfeiting of employment eligibility documents has reportedly made such documents widely available. According to a January 1997 Justice Office of Inspector General (OIG) audit report, on the basis of a review of 30 INS fraud cases in 5 INS district offices, INS confiscated nearly 300,000 counterfeit documents. Nearly all of these counterfeited documents were confiscated in Los Angeles. In May 1998, INS seized more than 24,000 counterfeit Social Security cards in Los Angeles after undercover agents purchased 10,000 counterfeit INS permanent resident cards from a counterfeit document ring.

Also, in accordance with the 1996 Act, INS has removed some documents from the list of those that can be considered by employers, but this still leaves 27 acceptable documents that employees can use for employment verification purposes. To give employers confidence in the integrity of certain INS documents, INS has begun issuing documents more resistant to tampering and counterfeiting to lessen the potential of fraudulent document use.

Under the first pilot, called the Basic Pilot, the employer is to verify the employment eligibility of all new hires, regardless of citizenship status, by querying an SSA database containing the names of all individuals with Social Security numbers. If the SSA database cannot confirm employment eligibility and the employee indicated that he or she is not a citizen or national of the United States, an employer would then query INS\u2019 database containing the names of all of those individuals to whom INS has issued alien numbers. Employers in the five states with the highest estimated numbers of illegal aliens\u2014California, New York, Texas, Florida, and Illinois\u2014are eligible to participate in the Basic Pilot.

However, INS has had difficulty in meeting this enrollment goal. As of November 1998, INS had enrolled 2,519 employers, or about 16 percent of its goal. Some employers are reportedly reluctant to participate in the pilots because of concern that participation may have a negative economic impact on their businesses. According to officials with whom we spoke from INS, Labor, and SSA, employers in some industries believe that in the current tight labor market, they would not have enough authorized workers applying for jobs if they participated in a verification pilot. The employers reportedly fear that they could be put at a competitive disadvantage because employees rejected by the verification system might go to work for competitors who are not enrolled in a pilot. In addition, according to INS officials, some employers are reluctant to participate because (1) they do little hiring, (2) illegal alien employment is not a problem in their industry, or (3) they fear participating will bring additional INS scrutiny (e.g., a Form I-9 inspection). Also, INS believes some multistate employers that want to consolidate verification operations to one location are reluctant to participate because they cannot comply with the 1996 Act\u2019s statutory requirement that verification be completed within 3 days after an employee is hired.", "According to INS officials, INS\u2019 failure to meet its enrollment goal was affected primarily by employer reluctance to participate in the pilots and not by the fact that two pilot programs have not yet been implemented.

This means that existing versions, which are more susceptible to counterfeiting, could still be used fraudulently to obtain employment.

In fiscal year 1998, INS\u2019 worksite investigators completed about 6,100 lead-driven investigations and about 400 compliance audits for a total of about 6,500 investigations, which equated to about 3 percent of the estimated number of employers of unauthorized aliens.", "According to worksite program officials, significantly increasing the funding for and staff assigned to worksite investigations may not significantly reduce unauthorized alien employment.

A Labor official told us that about 70 percent of Labor\u2019s investigations are based on worker complaints. Labor initiates the other 30 percent of its investigations.

For example, although the agreement calls for Labor to \u201cmake prompt referrals of employers suspected of knowingly hiring unauthorized aliens,\u201d Labor field officials told us that they do not conduct any investigative activities to determine whether employees may be unauthorized. The Labor Field Operation Handbook states that the role of Labor investigators does \u201cnot include investigating beyond the records (e.g., interviewing employees for I-9 purposes).\u201d Instead, Labor\u2019s assistance to INS has primarily been in the form of reviewing employers\u2019 Form I-9 paperwork and providing the results to INS. Even in this area, Labor has decreased its activity, although not because of any conflict in mission. The percentage of inspections in which Labor investigators did not determine whether employers were in compliance with Form I-9 paperwork requirements increased from 13 percent of Labor inspections in fiscal year 1990 to 26 percent in fiscal year 1998. According to Labor officials, the increase has been due, in part, to the shortened time that investigators spend at worksites. In many cases, these officials stated, investigators complete their inspections and leave worksites within 3 days.

As a result, according to these officials, Labor investigators have had increasing difficulty in getting employees to cooperate with them. The new agreement is meant to correct this misperception so those workers understand that Labor will not report the results of any of its complaint-driven investigations to INS. Labor officials told us that they hoped the new agreement would result in more employee cooperation, thereby enabling Labor to better enforce workplace labor standards.

As noted in this report, however, Labor officials expressed concern that using Labor investigators to identify and refer to INS workers who may be unauthorized could deter unauthorized workers from reporting labor standards violations, thus compromising Labor\u2019s fundamental mission of rooting out employers who violate labor standards. To the extent that this observation is true, our intent was to point out the potential for such a conflict in certain circumstances.", "We also received technical comments from Justice and SSA, and we incorporated them in this report as appropriate. Labor did not provide comments on the draft report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Janet Reno, Attorney General; the Honorable Doris Meissner, Commissioner, Immigration and Naturalization Service; the Honorable Alexis Herman, Secretary of Labor; the Honorable Kenneth Apfel, Commissioner, Social Security Administration; the Honorable Jacob Lew, Director, Office of Management and Budget; and other interested parties.

In addition, we held discussions with INS, Labor, and Social Security Administration (SSA) officials and analyzed data from INS\u2019 database of employer sanctions cases to obtain INS statistics on the use of fraudulent documents by unauthorized aliens.", "To determine what actions INS had undertaken to improve the employment verification process, we held discussions with and obtained documents from INS, SSA, Labor, and Justice\u2019s Office of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices officials. Using a data collection instrument, we surveyed INS managers, representing worksite enforcement units in 32 of INS\u2019 33 districts, who attended INS\u2019 June 1998 national worksite enforcement conference in San Diego. We asked respondents questions about the availability of pilot programs, the extent to which INS staff made efforts to enroll employers in the pilot programs, and the level of interest in the pilots among employers in their districts. We contacted representatives of four national organizations representing business owners or employee unions to discuss INS\u2019 pilot verification projects, among other issues. We selected three of these organizations because they represented business owners or employees in industries that INS targeted in its worksite enforcement investigations. We selected the fourth organization because it represented business owners in a wide range of industries.", "To determine the extent of INS\u2019 resources devoted to activities in the worksite area, we analyzed INS budget data and workload data. To determine the results of these worksite activities, we also analyzed data from INS\u2019 database of employer sanctions investigations. This database contains such information as the business\u2019 name, address, location, industry code, owner name, and number of employees. In addition, it contains information on the predication for opening the investigation (i.e., whether the case was lead-driven or randomly selected for a compliance inspection); the investigation\u2019s administrative and/or criminal disposition (e.g., compliance, warning notice, notice of intent to fine, or initiation of a criminal case); the number of unauthorized aliens identified and arrested by INS; the number and type of fraudulent documents identified by INS; the number and type of violations by employers; the amount of civil monetary penalties; and the amount collected by INS.", "INS provided us with a CD-ROM containing information on its employer sanctions investigations for the period of October 1, 1996, to May 29, 1998. We analyzed this time period because INS officials told us that the database was likely to be more complete and accurate for this period than for previous time periods. According to these officials, starting in fiscal year 1997, the INS priorities for worksite enforcement emphasized accurate reporting of employer sanctions case activity. Also, we believed that analyzing cases opened or completed after October 1, 1996, would be more representative of INS\u2019 recent investigative activities. We discussed the strengths and limitations of these data with INS headquarters officials and with investigators at the local level, but we did not independently verify the validity of these data.", "In our survey of INS worksite enforcement unit supervisors (previously described), we also asked questions about the type and extent of (1) worksite activities in the supervisors\u2019 districts and (2) coordination with Labor and other federal and state agencies. To further determine the extent of Labor\u2019s coordination with INS, we conducted structured telephone interviews with Labor officials from districts in Los Angeles; San Diego; Phoenix; Houston, TX; Chicago; Miami, FL; Baltimore; Atlanta; northern New Jersey; and New York. We selected these offices because they were in the seven states with the highest reported number of illegal aliens, based on INS data collected in 1996 (each state had an estimated population of over 100,000 illegal alien residents), or because INS worksite enforcement unit supervisors indicated they had either good coordination or problems coordinating with Labor. We also analyzed Labor workload data to determine the extent to which Labor referred cases to INS for investigation and conducted structured interviews with state labor officials from California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey to determine the extent to which they coordinated their activities with INS.", "To identify changes being made to INS\u2019 worksite enforcement program, we reviewed INS strategy documents, attended INS meetings in which INS officials explained worksite enforcement program changes, and discussed these changes with INS headquarters and regional officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Justice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of the General Counsel, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Los Angeles Field Office", "paragraphs": ["Michael P.
