Our analysis of the 18 legislative, security and economic benchmarks shows that as of August 30, 2007, the Iraqi government met 3, partially met 4, and did not meet 11 of its 18 benchmarks. Overall, key legislation has not been passed, violence remains high, and it is unclear whether the Iraqi government will spend $10 billion in reconstruction funds. These results do not diminish the courageous efforts of coalition forces. The Iraqi government has met one of eight legislative benchmarks: the rights of minority political parties in Iraq's legislature are protected. The government also partially met one other benchmark to enact and implement legislation on the formation of regions; this law was enacted in October 2006 but will not be implemented until April 2008. Six other legislative benchmarks have not been met. Specifically, a review committee has not completed work on important revisions to Iraq's constitution. Further, the government has not enacted legislation on de-Ba'athification, oil revenue sharing, provincial elections, amnesty, or militia disarmament. The Administration's July 2007 report cited progress in achieving some of these benchmarks but provided little information on what step in the legislative process each benchmark had reached. Two of nine security benchmarks have been met. Specifically, Iraq's government has established various committees in support of the Baghdad security plan and established almost all of the planned Joint Security Stations in Baghdad. The government has partially met the benchmarks of providing three trained and ready brigades for Baghdad operations and eliminating safe havens for outlawed groups. Five other benchmarks have not been met. The government has not eliminated militia control of local security, eliminated political intervention in military operations, ensured even-handed enforcement of the law, increased army units capable of independent operations, or ensured that political authorities made no false accusations against security forces. It is unclear whether sectarian violence in Iraq has decreased--a key security benchmark--since it is difficult to measure the perpetrator's intent and other measures of population security show differing trends. Finally, the Iraqi government has partially met the economic benchmark of allocating and spending $10 billion on reconstruction. Preliminary data indicates that about $1.5 billion of central ministry funds had been spent, as of July 15, 2007. As the Congress considers the way forward in Iraq, it must balance the achievement of the 18 Iraqi benchmarks with the military progress, homeland security, foreign policy, and other goals of the United States. Future administration reporting to assist the Congress would be enhanced with adoption of the recommendations we make in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 4 years, the United States has provided thousands of troops  and obligated nearly $370 billion to help achieve the strategic goal of  creating a democratic Iraq that can govern and defend itself and be an ally  in the War on Terror. These troops have performed courageously under  dangerous and difficult circumstances. The U.S. Troop Readiness,  Veterans\u2019 Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations  Act of 2007 (the Act) requires GAO to submit to Congress by September 1,  2007, an independent assessment of whether or not the government of  Iraq has met 18 benchmarks contained in the Act, and the status of the  achievement of the benchmarks. The benchmarks cover Iraqi government  actions needed to advance reconciliation within Iraqi society, improve the  security of the Iraqi population, provide essential services to the  population, and promote economic well-being. The benchmarks contained  in the Act were derived from benchmarks and commitments articulated by  the Iraqi government beginning in June 2006. (See appendix XIX for  information on the origin of these benchmarks.)", "The January 2007 U.S. strategy, The New Way Forward in Iraq, is designed  to support the Iraqi efforts to quell sectarian violence and foster  conditions for national reconciliation. The U.S. strategy recognizes that  the levels of violence seen in 2006 undermined efforts to achieve political  reconciliation by fueling sectarian tensions, emboldening extremists, and  discrediting the Coalition and Iraqi government. Amid such violence, it  became increasingly difficult for Iraqi leaders to make the compromises  necessary to foster reconciliation through the passage of legislation aimed  at reintegrating former Ba\u2019athists and sharing hydrocarbon revenues more  equitably, among other steps. Thus, the new strategy was aimed at  providing the Iraqi government with the time and space needed to help  address reconciliation among the various segments of Iraqi society.", "As required by the Act, this report provides 1) an assessment of whether or  not the Iraqi government has met 18 key legislative, security, and  economic benchmarks, and, 2) provides information on the status of the  achievement of each benchmark. Among these 18 benchmarks, eight  address legislative actions, nine address security actions, and one is  economic-related. In comparison, the Act requires the administration to  report in July and September 2007 on the status of each benchmark, and to  provide an assessment on whether satisfactory progress is being made  toward meeting the benchmarks, not whether the benchmarks have been  met. In order to meet our statutory responsibilities in a manner consistent  with GAO\u2019s core values, we decided to use \u201cpartially met\u201d criteria for  selected benchmarks. See appendices I-XVIII for information on our  assessment and the status of the achievement of each benchmark, and  appendix XX for a comparison of GAO\u2019s assessment with the  administration\u2019s July 2007 initial benchmark assessment report.

These  officials included Ryan Crocker, the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq, and General  David H. Petraeus, Commander of Multi-National Force-Iraq (MNF-I). We  also reviewed translated copies of Iraqi documents and met with officials  from the government of Iraq and its legislature. As part of this work, we  made multiple visits to Iraq during 2006 and 2007, most recently from July  22 to August 1, 2007. Our analyses were enhanced by approximately 100  Iraq-related reports and testimonies that we have completed since May  2003.

We received formal written comments from State  and Defense and technical comments from the Central Intelligence Agency  and National Intelligence Council which we incorporated as appropriate.  This letter and each appendix describe the detailed criteria we used in  making our assessments of the 18 benchmarks. As required by the  mandate, we made a determination of whether all 18 benchmarks had  been met. For 14 of the 18 benchmarks, we developed criteria for  assessing whether the benchmark was \u201cpartially met.\u201d For the remaining 4  benchmarks, we determined that they should be judged as \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cnot  met\u201d because the nature of the individual benchmarks did not lend  themselves to a \u201cpartially met\u201d assessment.", "Although we analyzed classified data, including the August 2007 National  Intelligence Estimate for Iraq, this report only contains unclassified  information, as of August 30, 2007.

In addition, the Iraqi  government partially met the benchmark to enact and implement  legislation on the formation of regions; this law was enacted in October  2006 but will not be implemented until April 2008.", "Six other legislative benchmarks have not been met. The benchmark  requiring a review of the Iraqi Constitution has not been met. Fundamental  issues remain unresolved as part of the constitutional review process,  such as expanded powers for the presidency, the resolution of disputed  areas (such as Kirkuk), and power sharing between federal and regional  governments over issues such as distribution of oil revenue. In addition,  five other legislative benchmarks have not been met. Figure 1 highlights  the status of the legislative benchmarks requiring legislative enactment  and implementation.", "As figure 1 shows, legislation on de-Ba\u2019athification reform has been  drafted but has yet to be enacted. Hydrocarbon legislation is in the early  stages of legislative action; although three key components have been  drafted, none are under active consideration by the Council of  Representatives. Although the government of Iraq has established an  independent electoral commission and appointed commissioners, the  government has not implemented legislation to establish provincial  council authorities, provincial elections law, or a date for provincial  elections. No legislation on amnesty or militia disarmament is being  considered because the conditions for a successful program, particularly  the need for a secure environment, are not present, according to U.S. and  Iraqi officials.", "Prospects for additional progress in enacting legislative benchmarks have  been complicated by the withdrawal of 15 of 37 members of the Iraqi  cabinet. According to an August 2007 U.S. interagency report, this boycott  ends any claim by the Shi\u2019ite-dominated coalition to be a government of  national unity and further undermines Iraq\u2019s already faltering program of  national reconciliation. In late August, Iraq\u2019s senior Shi\u2019a, and Sunni Arab  and Kurdish political leaders signed a Unity Accord signaling efforts to  foster greater national reconciliation. The Accord covered draft legislation  on de-Ba\u2019athification reform and provincial powers laws, as well as setting  up a mechanism to release some Sunni detainees being held without  charges. However, these laws need to be passed by the Council of  Representatives. (See appendices I-VII, and XVI for further information on  these legislative benchmarks).", "The Administration\u2019s July 2007 report cited progress in achieving some of  these legislative benchmarks but provided little information on what step  in the legislative process each benchmark had reached.

Of the remaining 7  benchmarks, the Iraqi government partially met 2 and did not meet five.  (see fig. 2)", "The Iraqi government partially met the benchmark of providing three  trained and ready brigades to support Baghdad operations. Since  February 2007, the Iraqi government deployed nine Iraqi army battalions  equaling three brigades for 90-day rotations to support the Baghdad  Security Plan. The administration\u2019s July 2007 report to Congress noted  problems in manning the Iraqi brigades, but stated that the three brigades  were operating in support of Baghdad operations. Our classified report  provides additional information on the readiness levels and performance  of these units, which supports our assessment of this benchmark.", "The Iraqi government also partially met the benchmark of ensuring that  the Baghdad security plan will not provide a safe haven for any outlaws  regardless of their sectarian or political affiliation. Even though the  Baghad Security Plan is aimed at eliminating safe havens, and U.S.  commanders report satisfaction with the coalition\u2019s ability to target  extremist groups, opportunities for creating temporary safe havens exist  due to the political intervention of Iraqi government officials (see  discussion in appendix X) and the strong sectarian loyalties and militia  infiltration of security forces.", "The Iraqi government has not met the benchmark to reduce sectarian  violence and eliminate militia control of local security.As discussed in  appendix XIII, militia control of local security forces remains a problem.  Several U.S. and UN reports have found that militias still retain significant  control or influence over local security in parts of Baghdad and other  areas of Iraq.", "On trends in sectarian violence, we could not determine if sectarian  violence had declined since the start of the Baghdad Security Plan. The  administration\u2019s July 2007 report stated that MNF-I trend data  demonstrated a decrease in sectarian violence since the start of the  Baghdad Security Plan in mid-February 2007. The report acknowledged  that precise measurements vary, and that it was too early to determine if  the decrease would be sustainable. Measuring sectarian violence is  difficult since the perpetrator\u2019s intent is not always clearly known. Given  this difficulty, broader measures of population security should be used in  judging these trends. The number of attacks targeting civilians and  population displacement resulting from sectarian violence may serve as  additional indicators. For example, as displayed in figure 3, the average  number of daily attacks against civilians remained about the same over the  last six months. The decrease in total average daily attacks in July is  largely due to a decrease in attacks on coalition forces rather than  civilians.", "While overall attacks declined in July compared to June, levels of violence  remain high. Enemy initiated attacks have increased around major  religious and political events, including Ramadan and elections. For 2007,  Ramadan is scheduled to begin in mid-September. Our classified report  provides further information on measurement issues and trends in  violence in Iraq obtained from other U.S. agencies. The unclassified  August 2007 National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) on Iraq reported that  Coalition forces, working with Iraqi forces, tribal elements, and some  Sunni insurgents, have reduced al Qaeda in Iraq\u2019s (AQI) capabilities and  restricted its freedom of movement. However, the NIE further noted that  the level of overall violence, including attacks on and casualties among  civilians remains high and AQI retains the ability to conduct high-profile  attacks.", "For the remaining four unmet security benchmarks, we found that:    The Iraqi government has not always allowed Iraqi commanders to make  tactical and operational decisions without political intervention, resulting  in some operational decisions being based on sectarian interests.", "The government had not always ensured that Iraqi security forces were  providing even-handed enforcement of the law, since U.S. reports have  cited continuing sectarian-based abuses on the part of Iraqi security  forces.", "Instead of increasing, the number of Iraqi army units capable of  independent operations had decreased from March 2007 to July 2007.", "Iraqi political authorities continue to undermine and make false  accusations against Iraqi security force personnel.

Of particular concern is the lack of progress  on the constitutional review that could promote greater Sunni  participation in the national government and comprehensive hydrocarbon  legislation that would distribute Iraq\u2019s vast oil wealth. Despite Iraqi leaders  recently signing a unity accord, the polarization of Iraq\u2019s major sects and  ethnic groups and fighting among Shi\u2019a factions diminishes the stability of  Iraq\u2019s governing coalition and its potential to enact legislation needed for  sectarian reconciliation.", "Reconciliation was also premised on a reduction in violence. While the  Baghdad security plan was intended to reduce sectarian violence,  measuring such violence may be difficult since the perpetrator\u2019s intent is  not clearly known.
