GAO reviewed funding for four programs, three in FCC and one grant program in RUS, and found that in total, less than 1 percent has gone directly to tribes or to tribally owned broadband providers to expand broadband service. GAO found that 14 tribal entities received federal funding from FCC and RUS to increase broadband deployment for 2010\u20132017.", "The tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned broadband providers GAO contacted cited several barriers tribes face in obtaining federal funding to deploy broadband service on tribal lands. For example, they said tribes face regulatory barriers in applying for RUS's grant funding, including (1) preparing existing and proposed network design, (2) demonstrating financial sustainability of the broadband project within 5 years, and (3) obtaining matching funds. An interagency council recently recommended that federal agencies identify and address regulatory barriers that may unduly impede broadband deployment. Although RUS conducts some outreach with tribes, it has not undertaken a formal assessment to identify and address the regulatory barriers that tribes may face in obtaining RUS's funding for broadband deployment. RUS officials told GAO that they do not have the resources to do so. Nevertheless, lacking such an assessment, tribes may continue to face regulatory barriers in obtaining RUS funding for broadband deployment on their lands.

In 2018, the Federal Communications Commission  (FCC) estimated that 35 percent of Americans living on tribal lands lack  broadband service, compared to 8 percent of Americans overall.  According to FCC, the gap in broadband access between rural areas and  rural tribal lands is even larger. Further, when including mobile broadband  service, FCC reported that nearly 60 percent of Americans living in rural  tribal lands nationwide lack broadband access, compared to about 31  percent of rural Americans overall. This large difference is due, in part, to  the relatively high proportion of tribal lands that are located in rural areas  with rugged terrain and low population density, which decreases business  incentives to invest in broadband infrastructure in these areas. According  to FCC, this lack of service on tribal lands could impede efforts by Indian  tribes to achieve self-governance and promote economic opportunity,  education, public safety, and cultural preservation.", "Currently, the federal government has programs that support increasing  broadband deployment in rural and unserved areas (including tribal  lands). Most notably, Congress has tasked FCC with encouraging the  deployment of advanced telecommunications capability in a reasonable  and timely fashion to all Americans, including those in rural areas and on  tribal lands. To accomplish this requirement, FCC is responsible for  implementing Universal Service Fund programs, one of which, the  Connect America Fund, provides approximately $4.5 billion annually to  support broadband service in underserved and unserved areas. The  Rural Utilities Service (RUS), a component agency of the U.S.  Department of Agriculture, also has the Community Connect Program  that provides grant funding to improve broadband service. Tribes as well  as partnerships between tribes and other entities may apply for such  funding in order to expand service on tribal lands.", "You asked us to examine several issues related to broadband access on  tribal lands, including the use of partnership arrangements between tribal  entities\u2014that is, tribal governments and telecommunications providers  owned by tribes\u2014and other entities.

Of those federal programs, we focused our  review on four programs\u2014three in FCC and one grant program in RUS\u2014 selected because they provide the most directly relevant funding for  broadband deployment in unserved areas, which includes tribal lands.  We compiled total funding data for these four federal programs and the  amount of funding provided to tribes and tribal entities for broadband  deployment projects for 2010 to 2017. We took steps to assess the  reliability of the data, such as cross-checking the data, following up with  agency officials, and reviewing documentation, and found the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of summarizing total funding and the  amount provided to tribes and tribal entities. Because we relied upon titles  or names of grant recipients to identify those grants awarded to tribes and  tribally owned providers, our analysis may not include some grants  awarded to broadband providers that deploy infrastructure to larger  service areas that may also include tribal lands.", "We obtained stakeholder views on barriers that tribal entities face in  obtaining federal funding and federal government efforts to address those  barriers by interviewing FCC and RUS officials and 17 tribal government  officials, 9 tribally owned broadband providers, and 5 tribal associations.  We selected tribal governments to interview to include variation in  geographic location, level of broadband deployment, and population  density. We visited six tribes in Idaho, New Mexico, and Washington  State. We also interviewed other stakeholders selected to represent a  range of views and those with experience working with Indian tribes and  broadband service.

The two primary  barriers these interviewees cited were (1) the statutory requirement for  ETC designation and (2) grant application requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Statutory Requirement for ETC Designation", "paragraphs": ["FCC\u2019s Connect America Fund (CAF) is the largest source of federal  funding for broadband deployment in unserved and underserved areas;  however, very few tribes are currently eligible for this source of funding.  At the time of our review, FCC officials told us there were 11 tribes that  have providers that are designated as ETCs and therefore would be  eligible to receive CAF funding. Although FCC adopted rules in 2011 to  create CAF and modernize the program so that it could support  broadband capable networks, FCC officials told us that most ETCs are  the telephone companies that were in existence when Congress passed  the Telecommunications Act of 1996. According to FCC officials, FCC  has explored whether it has authority to allow non-ETC providers to  receive CAF support payments but determined that the statute is clear  that only ETCs can receive program support. Between 2012 and 2017,  FCC officials said FCC received nine ETC applications, four of which  were from tribally owned providers. Of those four, only one tribally owned  provider was designated an ETC. Three tribes we contacted said they  would like the opportunity to receive CAF support to deploy broadband on  tribal lands, but they realize they are not eligible to receive funding unless  they have the ETC designation. Moreover, officials from two tribes and a  tribal association stated that while they want to provide broadband  services in their communities, they did not seek the ETC designation  because of the ETC service obligations described above.", "The Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe applied for ETC status in 2013. We met  with tribal officials who told us that the tribe was providing broadband  service in its community through its own, tribally chartered  telecommunications company and at the time of our visit, they had been  waiting several years for a decision from FCC on their ETC application.  The tribal officials told us that if FCC did not make a decision soon, the  tribal government would need to shut down the broadband network, as  the tribe\u2019s original decision to fund the network assumed there would be a  CAF subsidy to help defray the costs. The Leech Lake reservation is rural  with low population density and is surrounded by the Chippewa National  Forest. Subsequent to our meeting with the tribe in November 2017, the  tribe withdrew its application in March 2018, noting that it was ceasing its  attempt to run its telecommunications company specifically \u201cdue to  inaction\u201d by FCC.", "According to representatives from a tribal association we contacted, FCC  has provided ETCs with billions of dollars to deploy service to unserved  areas through the Universal Service Fund programs, but FCC\u2019s efforts  have not always been successful in the hardest to reach areas,  particularly tribal lands. The representatives noted that FCC\u2019s competitive  market approach does not work where competition cannot be supported  and that there needs to be a different approach. Similarly, tribal officials  from Idaho told us that rural service providers are able to operate due to  CAF support, but the tribe is not eligible to receive those subsidies.  Officials said although the provider in their area has received millions of  dollars in CAF subsidies, it has not deployed broadband on the tribal  lands. Other tribal officials from Washington State told us that although  private providers received CAF subsidies to deploy broadband service to  their reservation, the private providers told the tribe it would be years  before they offer service on tribal lands.", "In 2014, FCC conducted its Rural Broadband Experiment to open up  eligibility for CAF funding to non-ETC providers. FCC made $100 million  available for the experiment and applicants included a diverse group of  entities, including competitive providers, electric utilities, wireless Internet  service providers, and others. However, while this experiment opened the  application process to non-ETC providers, it did not remove the ETC  requirement. CAF support awarded through this experiment was  provisional pending the broadband providers\u2019 obtaining ETC status.  According to FCC documentation, there were 181 applicants for the  experiment, but only 16 ended up meeting all the requirements to receive  funding. None of those 16 entities was tribal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grant Application Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders we interviewed said tribes may face barriers completing  federal grant applications to obtain funding for broadband deployment. In  particular, two community access providers, five tribally owned providers,  and one regional consortium we contacted said that meeting the  application requirements was difficult. Representatives from eight of the  tribes we contacted told us that in general, the language included in the  federal grant applications is difficult to understand or the administrative  requirements of federal grants are burdensome. Another tribal  representative told us he would only recommend applying for RUS\u2019s  Community Connect program if the tribe has an entire team of dedicated  people to manage the grant process. Some of the tribal officials we  contacted cited difficulties preparing required application materials  between the time a grant announcement was made and the submission  deadline. For example, tribal officials we contacted from New Mexico and  Oklahoma stated that the constrained time frames prevented them from  effectively preparing a comprehensive application package. In some  cases, the narrow application windows prevented the tribes from applying  at all. Furthermore, tribal officials, tribal associations, and tribally owned  broadband providers told us that complying with the following regulatory  requirements for RUS Community Connect grants could be challenging  for tribes:", "Preparing existing and proposed network design: RUS\u2019s Community  Connect program requires applicants to submit information on the  network\u2019s design that contains all the technical information on the  applicant\u2019s existing (if applicable) and proposed network. The network  design is typically completed by a licensed engineer. Tribal officials in  Washington State told us that conducting analyses of existing  infrastructure and what improvements are needed can be cost- prohibitive for some tribes because it requires financial resources that  the tribe may not have before applying for the grant. Many of these  costs are related to the expense of bringing in outside experts or  consultants who are needed to perform the technical studies. Another  tribal representative told us since the tribe has no way of knowing if  the grant will be approved, spending money to complete the  application is a large risk. According to RUS officials, the Community  Connect program is not authorized to fund pre-planning activities.", "Demonstrating financial sustainability within 5 years: The RUS  Community Connect grant application requires a \u201cfinancial forecast\u201d  that includes the applicant\u2019s existing operations and the proposed  project and must be supported by a detailed narrative that explains  the methodology and assumptions used to develop the projections,  including the number of subscribers projected to take the applicant\u2019s  service. The financial forecast must cover at least 5 years, and it is  used by RUS to determine whether the proposed project is financially  sustainable. However, tribal officials from Idaho told us that it is not  feasible for tribes to show financial sustainability (a return on  investment) in 5 years in high cost areas. They noted that a period of  15 years may be needed to produce a return on investment in those  areas, and this requirement prevents tribes from qualifying for  Community Connect grants.", "Obtaining matching funds required to apply for federal grants: RUS\u2019s  Community Connect program requires grant applicants to provide  matching funds of at least 15 percent from non-federal sources and  does not accept in-kind contributions of goods or services. The  matching fund requirement can be difficult for some tribes to obtain.  For example, officials from RUS and the tribal entities we contacted  told us that tribes often times do not have the upfront cash to meet the  matching requirement. According to a tribal association we contacted,  obtaining credit is a serious problem for some tribes. In general, tribes  cannot collateralize tribal property, and therefore often times are  unable to get bank loans for infrastructure projects.", "The National Broadband Plan recommended that federal agencies  facilitate tribal access to broadband funding opportunities. Furthermore,  recognizing the need to reduce barriers to expand broadband  deployment, the Broadband Opportunity Council, established in March  2015, issued a report stating that federal agencies should use all  available and appropriate authorities to identify and address regulatory  barriers that may unduly impede either broadband deployment or the  infrastructure to augment broadband deployment. RUS officials said  they have held a number of external training and outreach events, such  as workshops and seminars, with tribes over the past 5 years to provide  information about RUS\u2019s broadband programs. For example, in April  2018, before the 2018 Community Connect grant\u2019s application deadline,  RUS hosted a webinar on various requirements for grant applications.  RUS officials told us that RUS\u2019s outreach efforts generally focus on  specific programs and instructing potential applicants on program  requirements and how to complete application packages.", "However, beyond these outreach efforts, RUS officials said they have not  undertaken a formal assessment to identify and address the regulatory  barriers that tribes may face in obtaining RUS funding for broadband  deployment. When we asked RUS officials about the feasibility of doing  so, they said that they have limited resources and multiple competing  priorities for those resources. RUS officials also noted that BIP authorized  and provided funding for technical assistance for applicants, funding that  enabled RUS to address some of the barriers tribes face. Nevertheless,  lacking such an assessment, tribes may continue to face the regulatory  barriers described above in obtaining RUS funding for broadband  deployment on their lands. According to the National Broadband Plan,  local entities (including tribal, state, regional, and local governments)  decide to offer broadband services when no providers exist that meet  local needs, and local entities do so after trying to work with established  carriers to meet local needs. Several of the tribes we visited told us they  were trying to deploy broadband infrastructure or offer service because  the private providers were not building out on their lands. For example,  one tribe stressed that unlike private providers, they would prioritize tribal  areas needing broadband service, but they need federal funding to do so."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["An estimated 35 percent of Americans living on tribal lands lack  broadband service, which could hinder tribal efforts to promote self- governance, economic opportunity, education, public safety, and cultural  preservation. However, little federal funding aimed at increasing  broadband service actually goes to tribal entities, even though the  National Broadband Plan stressed that tribes needed substantially greater  financial support and recommended that federal agencies facilitate tribal  access to broadband funding opportunities. Tribes may face barriers in  obtaining federal funds to deploy broadband, and the Broadband  Opportunity Council recognized the need for federal agencies to reduce  the barriers that are impeding broadband deployment. However, RUS has  not taken steps to identify or address the barriers tribes face when  applying for RUS grant funding.

In addition,  we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials from FCC, including  officials from the Office of Native Affairs and Policy; U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS); U.S. Department of  Commerce\u2019s National Telecommunications and Information  Administration (NTIA); and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s Office of Native American Programs.", "To gather information on partnership arrangements that tribes have  entered to increase broadband deployment on tribal lands and their  outcomes, we conducted a review of relevant published literature that  included government reports, industry articles, and publications from  associations, non-profits, and public policy research organizations.  Although we were not able to identify an industry-accepted definition of partnerships, we used the term partnerships to refer to instances in which  a tribal nation or tribal government works with another entity to design,  build, or operate infrastructure assets, or other capital assets to improve  or enhance broadband service. This also included partnerships between  a tribe and its tribally owned broadband provider. To identify examples of  tribal broadband partnerships for our review, we first interviewed agency  officials, tribes, private providers, and other stakeholders such as tribal  associations. We also identified broadband projects with a tribal  partnership component by reviewing reports from 2010 to 2017 for the  following federal programs: (1) FCC\u2019s Universal Service Fund high-cost  program and Connect America Fund (including the Mobility Fund Phase I  (Auction 901) and Tribal Mobility Fund Phase I (Auction 902)); (2) RUS\u2019s  Community Connect Program; (3) RUS\u2019s Broadband Initiatives Program;  and (4) NTIA\u2019s Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. While  there may be other tribal partnership examples that exist, through these  efforts we identified seven broadband projects with a tribal partnership  component completed within the last 5 years (2013 to 2017). We  interviewed tribal leaders and officials from the seven tribes that were  involved in the selected partnerships, and visited six tribes in Idaho, New  Mexico, and Washington State. When meeting with tribal leaders and  officials, we used the same semi-structured interview questions for all  tribes; however, tribal officials may not have answered all questions.  Because we limited our review to these seven selected partnership  examples, our findings are not generalizable.", "To determine the amount of funding from key federal programs provided  to tribal entities for broadband deployment, we first identified the federal  programs that provide broadband funding from NTIA\u2019s Guide to Federal  Funding of Broadband Projects. The guide lists 17 federal programs that  fund broadband infrastructure. Of those federal programs, we focused our  review on four programs, three in FCC and one grant program in RUS,  selected because they provide the most directly relevant funding for  broadband deployment in unserved areas, which includes tribal lands. We  first identified federal agencies and programs that provide grants or loans  to tribal and non-tribal entities to buildout broadband infrastructure on  tribal lands including: FCC, RUS, U.S. Department of Commerce  Economic Development Administration (EDA), and NTIA. We interviewed  federal agency officials to identify any additional federal programs that  provided funding in the last 7 years. We excluded federal loan programs  because they may require letters of credit and or assets as collateral,  which is often not a feasible option for tribes given land ownership issues.  We also considered but excluded those federal programs that are not  directly related to broadband expansion and deployment, such as the  Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Choice Neighborhoods  Program, whose primary purpose is housing related. We compiled total  funding data for these four federal programs and the amount of funding  provided to tribes and tribal entities for broadband deployment projects for  2010 to 2017. We took steps to assess the reliability of the data\u2014such as  cross-checking the data, following up with agency officials, and reviewing  documentation\u2014and found the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of summarizing total funding and the amount provided to tribes  and tribal entities. Because we relied upon titles or names of grant  recipients to identify those grants awarded to tribes and tribally owned  providers, our analysis may not include some grants awarded to  broadband providers that deploy infrastructure to larger service areas that  may also include tribal lands.", "To determine stakeholder-identified barriers that tribal entities face in  obtaining federal funding for broadband deployment and federal  government efforts to address those barriers, we interviewed FCC and  RUS officials and the tribal government officials, tribally owned broadband  providers, and tribal associations listed in table 1. We interviewed  representatives from 17 tribes in different locations with varying  population sizes and levels of broadband deployment. Additionally, we  interviewed officials from 9 tribally owned and 7 private broadband  providers operating on tribal lands. We selected these broadband  providers to interview because they received federal support to serve on  tribal lands or because they were a designated eligible  telecommunications carrier (ETC) serving tribal interests. Furthermore,  we identified and interviewed industry stakeholders such as research  groups and telecommunications associations on their views regarding  barriers to obtaining federal program assistance for broadband  deployment on tribal lands. These stakeholders were selected based on  their exposure to broadband issues on tribal lands such as representing  tribally owned broadband providers. The views obtained from these  interviews are not generalizable to all tribes, all broadband providers, or  all industry stakeholders.
