This report examines (1) the number of 510(k) submissions for power morcellators FDA cleared, and the extent to which the agency determined the devices had new intended uses or new technological characteristics; (2) FDA's understanding of any concerns with the use of power morcellators to treat uterine fibroids prior to receiving adverse event reports, and the actions FDA has taken in response to these reports; and (3) the professional standards and guidance for physicians regarding the use of power morcellators, and the information device manufacturers provided. GAO reviewed documentation of FDA's decision-making and guidance and manufacturers' device labeling, and interviewed FDA officials. In addition, GAO reviewed documents and contacted officials from 10 professional societies and other organizations that have a potential interest in the use of power morcellators, and three health care providers that performed gynecological procedures that could involve the use of the devices. GAO also contacted all 12 manufacturers for the power morcellators FDA cleared for the U.S. market.", "The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between 1991 and 2014, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\u2014the federal agency responsible for the oversight of medical devices\u2014cleared 25 submissions for laparoscopic power morcellators for the U.S. market. FDA cleared the submissions for these devices, which cut tissue into small pieces to facilitate removal through small incision sites of gynecological and other types of minimally invasive surgeries, through its premarket notification process. Under this process, established under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, FDA reviews information submitted by a device manufacturer and determines whether the new device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device, known as a predicate device. In making this determination, FDA assesses whether a device has (1) the same intended use; and (2) the same technological characteristics as a predicate device, or has different technological characteristics but submitted information demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as the predicate device, and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. A device determined to be substantially equivalent is cleared to be marketed. For power morcellators, FDA determined the devices in all 25 of the 510(k) submissions had the same intended use as their predicates, while 6 had new technological characteristics.", "Prior to receiving adverse event reports, FDA understood the risk of having an unsuspected cancer that could be spread using a power morcellator as low; in response to such reports, the agency has taken several actions. According to FDA officials, the agency was aware of the potential for power morcellators to spread tissue (cancerous and noncancerous) when the agency cleared the first device in 1991. FDA officials noted that, at the time, the risk of having a type of uterine cancer that can resemble noncancerous uterine tumors, called fibroids, was thought to be low based on available information. After receiving reports in December 2013 about the spread of an unsuspected cancer following the use of power morcellators in surgeries to treat fibroids, FDA estimated the cancer risk to women undergoing these surgeries to be about 1 in 350 for one type of cancer. FDA issued a safety communication in November 2014 warning against certain uses of power morcellators\u2014specifically in treating uterine fibroids. The agency also issued guidance recommending that manufacturers add a boxed warning to their device labeling, which all current manufacturers followed, and conducted inspections to review hospitals' compliance with medical device reporting requirements. As questions remain related to the use of power morcellators, FDA has continued to monitor adverse event reports, among other actions.", "Professional societies provided some guidance to physicians regarding the use of power morcellators, while manufacturers of the devices provided instructions and some technical training. According to officials at professional societies that GAO contacted, there are no professional standards specific to the use of power morcellators, but some guidance and educational resources are available for surgical procedures to treat uterine fibroids in which the devices may be used. Training requirements for physicians using power morcellators generally occur at hospitals as part of the processes to ensure that physicians have suitable experience and abilities. Manufacturers provide instructions for use, and some offer technical training that demonstrates device set-up, operation, and cleaning."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Americans depend on the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an  agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), to  oversee the safety and effectiveness of medical devices marketed in the  United States. Beginning in late 2013, media reports raised concerns  regarding the safety of one particular medical device, a laparoscopic  power morcellator, which cuts tissue into small pieces for removal during  minimally invasive surgery. Specifically, these reports described the  experience of a patient who underwent surgery involving the use of a  power morcellator for the treatment of uterine tumors, known as fibroids,  which, by definition, are presumed to be noncancerous. However,  according to these reports, this patient also had an unsuspected and  difficult to diagnose type of cancer and the use of a power morcellator  was thought to have resulted in the spreading of cancerous tissue and  worsening the likelihood of her long-term survival.", "FDA\u2019s oversight of medical devices begins before a new device is brought  to the market and continues after a device is on the market. For most  medical devices that require premarket review, including power  morcellators, FDA determines whether they should be allowed to be  marketed in the United States through the agency\u2019s premarket notification  process established under section 510(k) of the Federal Food, Drug, and  Cosmetic Act. Specifically, under this process, FDA reviews information  submitted by the device manufacturer (in a 510(k) submission) and  determines whether the new device is substantially equivalent to another  legally marketed device, known as a predicate device. To be substantially  equivalent, a device must (1) have the same intended use as a predicate  device; and (2) have the same technological characteristics as the  predicate device, or have different technological characteristics but  submitted information demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as  the predicate device, and does not raise different questions of safety or  effectiveness. A device determined to be substantially equivalent is  cleared to be marketed in the United States. As part of its postmarket  oversight efforts, FDA requires medical device manufacturers, importers,  and user facilities (such as hospitals) to report events in which a  marketed device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious  injury, known as an adverse event. FDA also encourages voluntary  reporting of adverse events from healthcare professionals, patients,  caregivers, and consumers. FDA received the first adverse event reports  describing the spread of cancer after the use of a power morcellator to  treat uterine fibroids about the same time the first media reports raising  concerns over the use of the devices were published in December 2013.", "Given concerns about the safety of power morcellators, you asked us to  examine FDA\u2019s clearance of the devices for the U.S. market, the agency\u2019s  response to adverse event reports, and relevant information and training  on the use of power morcellators. This report examines  1.  the number of 510(k) submissions for power morcellators FDA cleared  for the U.S. market, and the extent to which the agency determined  the devices had the same intended uses or technological  characteristics as predicate devices;  2.  FDA\u2019s understanding of any concerns with the use of power  morcellators to treat uterine fibroids prior to receiving adverse event  reports, and what actions the agency has taken in response to these  reports; and  3.  the professional standards and guidance for physicians regarding the  use of power morcellators, and the instructions for use and training  provided by device manufacturers.", "To determine the number of 510(k) submissions for power morcellators  FDA cleared for the U.S. market, and the extent to which the agency  determined they had the same intended uses or technological  characteristics, we examined information from FDA\u2019s publicly available  510(k) database and FDA\u2019s files of 510(k) submissions. The 510(k)  database contains information on devices cleared through FDA\u2019s 510(k)  premarket review process, including the device, the device  manufacturer\u2019s name, the date FDA determined the device was  substantially equivalent to a predicate device, and an FDA-assigned  product code that can be linked to a medical specialty. We searched the  510(k) database files in order to identify potential power morcellators and  then reconciled those identified to a list of power morcellators provided by  FDA. To determine the extent to which these devices had the same  intended uses and same technological characteristics as predicate  devices, we conducted a review of information from FDA\u2019s 510(k)  submission files in July 2016. During this file review, we collected data  concerning the steps FDA officials took to reach a determination that the  devices were substantially equivalent to predicate devices. This included  the incremental decisions FDA made concerning the intended use and  technological characteristics, and in sum, defined the path the FDA  reviewers took to reach a determination of substantially equivalent for  each submission. We recorded the individual decisions made for each  power morcellator, and analyzed the results. In addition, we reviewed  relevant FDA policy and guidance documents, and interviewed  knowledgeable agency officials regarding the clearance of power  morcellators.", "To identify FDA\u2019s understanding of any concerns regarding the use of  power morcellators to treat uterine fibroids prior to receiving adverse  event reports, and the actions FDA has taken in response to these  reports, we reviewed device labeling for power morcellators, information  from FDA\u2019s adverse event databases, and FDA documentation regarding  agency actions, including policy and guidance documents and safety  communications issued. We examined FDA\u2019s public adverse event data  for reports the agency received from January 1996 through June 2016 to  corroborate information we received from FDA on adverse event reports  (both the date the agency received the first report and the number of  reports received) about the potential spread of cancer following the use of  a power morcellator to treat uterine fibroids. We conducted a literature  search for articles regarding the prevalence of uterine cancer and risks of  spreading cancer when using a power morcellator to treat uterine fibroids  that were published in peer-reviewed journals between January 1980 and  March 2016. We interviewed FDA officials knowledgeable about the  agency\u2019s understanding of the risk related to power morcellation and  FDA\u2019s actions in response to adverse event reports involving the spread  of cancerous tissue when using a power morcellator. We also contacted  officials from 10 professional societies and other stakeholder  organizations that have a potential interest in the use of power  morcellators. We selected these professional societies and other  stakeholders to include organizations (1) that represent member  physicians that may use power morcellators to treat uterine fibroids, (2)  that accredit individual physicians and hospitals, and (3) that represent  device manufacturers. Of the 10, we interviewed officials and/or reviewed  information from 6 organizations. The perspectives of the officials from  these selected professional societies and other stakeholder organizations  are not generalizable, but they provided insight on these issues.", "To identify professional standards and guidance for physicians regarding  the use of power morcellators, and the instructions for use and training  provided by device manufacturers, we interviewed officials from the  selected professional societies and three selected health care providers.  We selected health care providers that performed gynecological  procedures that could involve the use of a power morcellator, which  included two hospitals that had an accredited surgical residency program  for the 2016\u20132017 academic year and a physicians group. The  perspectives of the officials from selected health care providers are not  generalizable, but provided us with valuable insight on the training  requirements for physicians who use power morcellators. We also  contacted all 12 manufacturers for the power morcellators FDA cleared  for the U.S. market and asked about their instructions for use and  training. We received information from three manufacturers. Other  manufacturers we contacted did not provide information, citing ongoing  litigation involving their power morcellator devices, or that their power  morcellators were no longer marketed in the United States, among other  reasons.", "To assess the reliability of FDA\u2019s data on 510(k) submissions and  adverse event reports, we reviewed relevant documentation and traced  some data to FDA source documentation.

Most women will develop uterine  fibroids at some point in their lives, although  most cause no symptoms. In some cases,  however, uterine fibroids can cause  symptoms, including heavy or prolonged  menstrual bleeding, pelvic pressure or pain, or  frequent urination, requiring medical or  surgical therapy.  Treatment for uterine fibroids includes   surgical procedures to remove the uterus  (hysterectomy) or to remove the fibroids  (myomectomy). These surgical procedures  can be done via minimally invasive  laparoscopic procedures or through traditional  surgical procedures, such as an abdominal  hysterectomy. Other treatments   for uterine fibroids include, for example,   high-intensity focused ultrasound, and   drug therapy.", "Power morcellators are medical devices used during laparoscopic  (minimally invasive) surgeries. Morcellation refers to the cutting of tissue  into smaller fragments for removal from the body. In laparoscopic surgical  procedures, morcellation facilitates the extraction of large pieces of tissue  through small incisions. Over time, laparoscopic surgeons have applied  different manual methods of morcellation using scalpels, forceps, and  other tools that require repetitive manual motions, such as twisting. Power  morcellators generally use an electromechanical motor to spin a  cylindrical blade within a tube for cutting and removing tissue.", "Power morcellators can be used during different types of laparoscopic  surgeries, including general surgical procedures, such as spleen and liver  surgeries; urological surgical procedures, such as kidney removal  surgeries; and gynecological surgical procedures. These laparoscopic  gynecological procedures include two types of surgeries used to treat  uterine fibroids: (1) the removal of the uterus, known as hysterectomy;  and (2) the removal of individual fibroids, known as myomectomy. Some  women may prefer laparoscopic hysterectomies and myomectomies,  because these procedures are associated with such benefits as a shorter  post-operative recovery time and, for laparoscopic hysterectomies, a  reduced risk of infection compared to open procedures.", "Medical devices, including power morcellators, are regulated by FDA. The  agency classified most power morcellators as class II devices, meaning  that FDA generally considers them to be higher-risk than class I devices  and lower-risk than class III devices. For most class II devices, FDA  determines whether they should be legally marketed in the United States  through the agency\u2019s 510(k) premarket notification process. Specifically,  the device manufacturer through a 510(k) submission must notify FDA at  least 90 days before it intends to market a new device and establish that  such device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device. To be  substantially equivalent, a device must (1) have the same intended use  as the predicate device; and (2) have the same technological  characteristics as the predicate device, or have different technological  characteristics but submitted information demonstrates the device is as  safe and effective as the predicate device, and does not raise different  questions of safety or effectiveness.

Under these requirements, these parties must  report device-related adverse events, including events that reasonably  suggest a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or  serious injury, in a timely manner. For example, user facilities must report  such deaths and serious injuries within 10 work days of becoming aware  of information reasonably suggesting the device may have caused or  contributed to the death or serious injury. Within this time frame, deaths  must be reported to both FDA and the manufacturer, if known, and  serious injuries must be reported to the manufacturer, or, if the  manufacturer is unknown, to FDA.

In clearing the first of the 25 power morcellators in 1991, FDA  determined the new device was substantially equivalent to an  electromechanical system for cutting tissue during minimally invasive  surgeries performed on joints, known as an arthroscopic surgical  system. (For more information on this predicate device, see app. II.)  FDA determined the other 24 power morcellators\u2014the most recent of  which was cleared in May 2014\u2014were substantially equivalent to at least  one previously cleared power morcellator.

FDA officials stated that the additional devices referenced likely informed FDA\u2019s decision-making for all 25 power  morcellators. However, FDA\u2019s determinations of substantial equivalence  were based on only one predicate device, the arthroscopic surgical  system for the first power morcellator cleared and a previously cleared  power morcellator for the other 24 devices, according to agency  officials.

In making this determination, FDA also  determined that 4 power morcellators had different indication statements  compared to the predicate devices, but the differences did not alter the  intended use of each device. In general, the indication statements for the  4 power morcellators identified new or fewer procedures during which the  devices were to be used compared to the predicates. For example, the  indication statement for a power morcellator FDA cleared in 2000  specifically identified use in hysterectomies where the predicate\u2019s  indication statement only identified myomectomies. In another example,  the indication statement of a power morcellator cleared in 2011 only  identified use in gynecological procedures where the predicate identified  general surgical and urological procedures, in addition to gynecological.  For all 4 devices, however, FDA determined that the differences in  indication statements did not alter the intended effect of the devices or  raise new questions of safety or effectiveness, and determined, overall,  that the power morcellators had the same intended use as their  predicates.", "We also found that FDA determined that 19 of the 25 power morcellators  had the same technological characteristics as their predicate devices,  while 6 devices did not. According to FDA officials, the technological  characteristics of these 6 power morcellators that were different included  the change from the use of a vacuum to suction tissue into the  morcellator to the use of forceps to grasp tissue for this purpose;  the change from single use, disposable body or blade to ones that are  reusable;  the change from a rotary cutting action to one that is reciprocating;  and  the addition of the ability to control suction with a foot switch.", "In addition, for 11 power morcellators, we found that FDA reviewed  performance data. These included 3 power morcellators for which FDA  determined that different technological characteristics could affect safety  and effectiveness, and 8 other power morcellators for which the device  description was not sufficient to determine whether the devices were  substantially equivalent to predicate devices.

Agency officials, however, noted that at the time, there  was no consensus within the clinical community regarding the risk of this  occurring, particularly for cancerous tissue. We identified 30 such articles  published between 1980 and 2012 that mentioned or concluded a risk of  tissue dissemination following the use of a power morcellator, or the need  for a physician to remove all fragments of tissue following a surgery. Most  of these articles involved case studies or were limited in scope. For  example, one case study published in 2010 looked at a single patient  who, after undergoing a hysterectomy to treat a uterine fibroid, was found  to have a previously unsuspected sarcoma (a type of cancer), and  concluded that there is a potential risk of spreading the unsuspected  cancer following morcellation. None of the articles that we identified  estimated the risk of spreading tissue, cancerous or noncancerous,  during power morcellation.", "Uterine Sarcoma  Uterine sarcoma is a cancer of the muscle  and supportive tissues of the uterus. Uterine  sarcoma is one of two types of uterine cancer  (endometrial carcinoma is the other, more  common type of uterine cancer). The  American Cancer Society estimates that less  than 4 percent of uterine cancers are uterine  sarcoma. Of the two types of uterine cancer,  uterine sarcoma tends to be more aggressive,  more difficult to diagnose before surgery, and  have worse prognoses. Leiomyosarcoma is a  type of uterine sarcoma that, similar to  fibroids, develops in the muscular tissue of the  uterus. Leiomyosarcoma can resemble a  fibroid and, as a result, can be difficult to  diagnose before surgery.", "Though the risk of spreading tissue during power morcellation was  known, FDA officials stated that prior to December 2013, the general  understanding was that the risk of a woman undergoing treatment for  fibroids having unsuspected cancer\u2014specifically, a difficult to diagnose  cancer called uterine sarcoma\u2014was low. Therefore, the risk of a power  morcellator spreading a uterine sarcoma would be expected to be low, as  it could be no higher than the risk of having a uterine sarcoma. In  addition, FDA officials were not aware of any definitive scientific  publications regarding the actual risk of cancer in uterine fibroids (by  definition presumed to be noncancerous), which is generally consistent  with statements by two professional societies. FDA officials noted that  published estimates for an unsuspected cancer (specifically uterine  sarcoma) in a woman with a presumed uterine fibroid varied from about 1  in 1,000 women to 1 in about 10,000 women. These estimates of the risk  of cancer depended on several factors, including the cancer diagnosis  (e.g., uterine sarcoma or a category of uterine sarcoma called  leiomyosarcoma), the type of treatment for uterine fibroids (e.g.,  hysterectomy or myomectomy), or the patient population included in the  estimate (e.g., women of reproductive age or women who are older). One  2012 study that examined 1,091 instances of uterine morcellation at one  hospital, however, reported that the rate of unsuspected cancer (uterine  sarcoma) after laparoscopic morcellation was 9 times higher than the rate  quoted to patients at the time (1 in 10,000), and concluded that uterine  morcellation carries a risk of spreading unsuspected cancer."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Response to First Adverse Event Reports Included Estimating Cancer Risk, Warning Against the Use of Power Morcellators, and Recommending New Labeling", "paragraphs": ["FDA took several actions after receiving the first adverse event reports in  December 2013 describing the spread of cancerous tissue after using a  power morcellator to treat uterine fibroids.

In April 2014, FDA issued  a safety communication discouraging the use of power morcellators in  surgical procedures (hysterectomies and myomectomies) to treat  uterine fibroids. In discouraging this use, FDA cited the lack of a  reliable method for predicting whether a woman with uterine fibroids  may have an unsuspected cancer; specifically, a uterine sarcoma.  The agency also noted that if a power morcellator is used on women  with an unsuspected uterine sarcoma, the procedure may spread  cancerous tissue within the abdomen and pelvis, significantly  worsening the patient\u2019s likelihood of long-term survival. The safety  communication also recommended that health care providers carefully  consider all the available treatment options for women with  symptomatic uterine fibroids and thoroughly discuss the benefits and  risks of all treatments with patients.

For power morcellators with a general or gynecologic  indication for use, the guidance recommended the addition of specific  safety statements to the product labeling for laparoscopic power  morcellators, including two contraindications and a boxed warning that  the use of power morcellators during fibroid surgery may spread  cancer. (See fig. 4.) FDA also recommended that manufacturers  submit their revised labeling language to FDA, as well as to the  hospitals and other facilities that had previously purchased power  morcellators. We found that the manufacturers of the 10 power  morcellators with indications for use for general surgical or  gynecological procedures marketed as of November 2016 followed  the recommendation, providing FDA with updated labeling.  Information provided by FDA indicated that manufacturers also  contacted hospitals and other user facilities that purchased their  power morcellators, providing the updated labeling and instructing  them to switch out any old labeling. Half of the manufacturers also  instructed the user facilities to mail back a receipt of  acknowledgement regarding the safety alert to the manufacturer.", "Issuing an updated safety communication. At the same time it  issued guidance in November 2014, FDA issued an updated safety  communication warning against the use of power morcellators in the  majority of women undergoing surgery (hysterectomy or  myomectomy) to treat uterine fibroids. This safety communication  recommended that doctors thoroughly discuss the benefits and risks  of all treatments with their patients. The updated safety  communication also specified that FDA considers the spread of  unsuspected cancer when using a power morcellator for hysterectomy  or myomectomy to treat uterine fibroids as a serious injury, which is a  reportable adverse event under the agency\u2019s medical device reporting  requirements.", "Inspecting selected user facilities for compliance with adverse  event reporting. In December 2015, FDA initiated inspections at  selected hospitals to review their compliance with medical device  reporting requirements, which specify that hospitals and other user  facilities must report certain device-related events to FDA and to  manufacturers when the manufacture is known. These inspections  included five hospitals that, according to FDA officials, were chosen  because there were reports of adverse events at these facilities  related to the spread of uterine cancer from the use of power  morcellators. FDA identified significant deviations from medical  device reporting requirements at these hospitals based on its review  of the inspection evidence. FDA investigators\u2019 observations included  user facilities\u2019 failure to report adverse events within required time  frames or to establish and maintain files for medical device  reporting\u2014that is, adverse event reports.

For example,  FDA officials noted there was limited information available to assess how  the risk of spreading cancerous tissue is affected when the morcellation is  performed using a power morcellator or through manual morcellation  (e.g., using a scalpel). Similarly, officials from one professional society  also stated that they were not aware of any reliable data showing that  power morcellation spreads tissue any worse than other morcellation  techniques. In addition, professional societies have questioned or noted  concerns with FDA\u2019s estimate of the risk of cancer (uterine sarcoma) in  women who undergo surgical treatment of uterine fibroids, citing  limitations related to FDA\u2019s methodology. One professional society\u2019s open  letter to FDA included concerns regarding the keywords FDA officials  used to find the studies included in their estimate, stating that those  keywords may have limited the number of studies used to develop the  agency\u2019s estimate. The letter also asserted that FDA\u2019s estimate was  higher than a more appropriate estimated risk of uterine cancer of about 1  in 1,500 to 1 in 2,000. FDA officials have acknowledged limitations,  such as the small number of studies, in their estimate, but stated that  estimates in more recently representative published studies have  generally been consistent with the agency\u2019s estimate.", "Continuing questions also include the long-term effects of FDA\u2019s  guidance on patients, according to the stakeholders we interviewed. Two  professional societies we contacted have expressed concern that FDA\u2019s  decision to discourage the use of power morcellators in laparoscopic  surgeries (hysterectomies and myomectomies) to treat uterine fibroids  limits women\u2019s health options. According to officials from the two  societies, the reduction or elimination of laparoscopic surgery using a  power morcellator to treat uterine fibroids\u2014in response to FDA\u2019s safety  communication and guidance\u2014may lead to an increased use of  abdominal hysterectomies, a surgical procedure that typically does not  involve the use of power morcellators, but is associated with other risks.  One professional society noted that abdominal hysterectomies require  larger incisions, slower recovery time, and present the patient with higher  mortality rates and complications than laparoscopic hysterectomies.  However, FDA officials noted that one 2016 study reported a decline in  the use of power morcellators in hysterectomies since the agency issued  its November 2014 guidance, and found no increase in complications  from abdominal hysterectomies.", "While these questions remain, FDA officials stated that the agency  continues to review scientific literature regarding the use of power  morcellators to treat uterine fibroids as new studies have been conducted  since 2014. We found more than 50 articles on the risk of uterine cancer  in women or the use of morcellation in women undergoing gynecologic  surgeries like hysterectomy and myomectomy\u2014including peer-reviewed  articles, case studies, and opinion pieces\u2014that have been published  since December 2013.", "FDA also continues to monitor available adverse event information  regarding the use of power morcellators, while acknowledging the  limitations of the available information. FDA reported that, as of  September 2016, the agency had identified 285 adverse event reports  about the spread of an unsuspected cancer following the use of a power  morcellator. According to FDA officials, the majority (over 88 percent) of  these reports were mandatory reports submitted by manufacturers. The  remainder were voluntary reports from patients and their families, as well  as physicians (about 10 percent) and mandatory reports from hospitals  and other user facilities (less than 2 percent). According to FDA officials,  of the 285 adverse event reports regarding power morcellators and the  spread of unsuspected cancer that the agency received through  September 2016, 5 were related to events occurring after FDA issued its  guidance and updated safety communication in November 2014. FDA  officials noted, however, the limitations in the current, passive, medical  device reporting system, which relies on people to identify that a harm  occurred or a risk is present, recognize that the harm or risk is associated  with the use of a particular device, and take the time to report it. For  power morcellators, officials from three health care providers (two  hospitals and one physician group) that we spoke to stated that prior to  November 2014, physicians would likely not have considered the  spreading of an unsuspected cancer following the use of a power  morcellator as a reportable adverse event, because the device would  have performed as intended (e.g., cutting and extracting tissue). FDA\u2019s  inspections of manufacturers of power morcellators and hospitals that use  them have also identified issues related to medical device reporting of  adverse events. (See app. I for more information on FDA inspections  related to medical device reporting.)", "Recognizing the limitations in its current postmarket surveillance  activities, the agency reported plans to generate better information in the  future. For example, in October 2016, the agency reported plans to work  with hospitals to identify a system that quickly identifies life-threatening  problems caused by medical devices. FDA officials also noted they will  continue to review new technologies, such as morcellation containment  systems, and work on a national registry to collect data on the treatment  of fibroids.

According to health care provider officials, physicians\u2019 privileges to  perform laparoscopic hysterectomies and myomectomies could be part of  broader privileges\u2014for example, they said that some hospitals may grant  permission for a physician to use a power morcellator as part of a general  list of procedures for gynecologists, or a hospital could require specific  permission for use of the device."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Manufacturers Provided Instructions and Offered Technical Training on the Use of Power Morcellators", "paragraphs": ["All of the 25 power morcellators cleared by FDA included instructions  from the manufacturers for using the device, and some of the  manufacturers offered technical training for physicians.

Second, they are used to detect safety signals, such as identifying  unexpected events associated with a particular device or device type.", "Adverse event reports are submitted to FDA through mandatory and  voluntary sources. Mandatory adverse event reporting by medical device  importers, manufacturers, and user facilities enables FDA to obtain  specific safety data related to medical devices from these reports.

Manufacturers and importers also must report  certain device malfunctions\u2014manufacturers must report the information  to FDA and importers must report the information to the manufacturer.
