However, internal control deficiencies exist for, among other things, ensuring that only eligible applicants are approved to participate in the Law Enforcement Support Office (LESO) program and receive transfers of excess controlled property. DLA is establishing memorandums of understanding with participating federal agencies intended to, among other things, establish general terms and conditions for participation, revise its program application to require additional prospective participant information, and plans to provide additional online training for participating agencies that is expected to begin in late 2017. However, GAO created a fictitious federal agency to conduct independent testing of the LESO program's internal controls and DLA's transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies.", "Through the testing, GAO gained access to the LESO program and obtained over 100 controlled items with an estimated value of $1.2 million, including night-vision goggles, simulated rifles, and simulated pipe bombs, which could be potentially lethal items if modified with commercially available items (see photos). GAO's testing identified that DLA has deficiencies in the processes for verification and approval of federal law enforcement agency applications and in the transfer of controlled property, such as DLA personnel not routinely requesting and verifying identification of individuals picking up controlled property or verifying the quantity of approved items prior to transfer. Further, GAO found that DLA has not conducted a fraud risk assessment on the LESO program, including the application process. Without strengthening DLA and LESO program internal controls over the approval and transfer of controlled property to law enforcement agencies, such as reviewing and revising policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal agency applications and enrollment, DLA lacks reasonable assurance that it has the ability to prevent, detect, and respond to potential fraud and minimize associated security risks.", "Examples of Controlled Property Items Obtained", "DLA maintains a public Internet site to address statutory requirements to provide information on all property transfers to law enforcement agencies.

Since 1991, DOD has reported  transferring more than $6 billion worth of its excess controlled and non- controlled personal property to more than 8,600 federal, state, and local  law enforcement agencies. According to DOD, approximately 4 to 7  percent of the total excess property items transferred to law enforcement  agencies is controlled; the remaining percentage of excess property is  non-controlled. Controlled items are typically sensitive in nature, cannot  be released to the general public, and require specific actions to ensure  proper disposal. Examples of controlled items available through the  LESO program include night-vision goggles, thermal imaging equipment,  specialized printers, and explosive ordnance detonation robots, as well as  certain high-visibility items, such as small arms, High Mobility  Multipurpose Wheeled Vehicles (HMMWVs), Mine\u2010Resistant Ambush  Protected Vehicles (MRAPs), and aircraft.

We have made 24 recommendations aimed at enhancing  internal controls over DOD\u2019s disposal and accountability of its excess  property and improving the overall economy and efficiency of DLA\u2019s  reutilization program, including better coordination regarding data  reliability and strengthening management oversight, accountability, and  physical inventory control. The department has implemented 22 of the 24  recommendations. Likewise, the DOD Office of Inspector General has  reported on internal control deficiencies, such as the distribution of  excess property to law enforcement agencies without the accountability  necessary to ensure that the released property had the proper  authorization.

In appendix I, we also include survey and  case study information on how federal, state, and local law enforcement  agencies reported using and benefiting from excess controlled property  transferred to them through the LESO program in accordance with the  purposes of the program, including enhancement of counterdrug,  counterterrorism, and border-security activities.", "For objective 1, we reviewed DOD, DLA, and LESO program policy and  guidance on LESO program processes for transferring controlled  property, including conditions of transfer, monitoring, training,  accountability, and disposal of controlled property obtained through the  LESO program. We tested the department\u2019s internal controls and  control activities related to LESO program enrollment and application.  Specifically, our investigators posed as a fictitious federal law  enforcement agency and, using publicly available resources, created a website describing the agency\u2019s activities. We completed the LESO  program application, submitted it to LESO officials, and corresponded by  email with LESO program staff to respond to their follow-up questions.  We also compared DLA and LESO practices to those identified in GAO\u2019s  A Framework for Managing Fraud Risks in Federal Programs (hereafter  cited as the Fraud Risk Framework). Issued in July 2015, GAO\u2019s Fraud  Risk Framework is a comprehensive set of leading practices that serves  as a guide for program managers to use when developing efforts to  combat fraud in a strategic, risk-based manner. Additionally, we  conducted a survey of 15 participating federal law enforcement agencies  as well as 53 state coordinators who had controlled property transferred  to their offices through the LESO program during calendar years 2013,  2014, and 2015 to gain an understanding of their use of the LESO  program. We selected these calendar years because they were the last  three complete years prior to our audit work. For federal law enforcement  agencies, we selected major recipients of LESO controlled property,  which were all the agencies within the top four federal departments  whose law enforcement components had received controlled property  from the LESO program during calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015.  For state coordinators, we included all state coordinators from states and  U.S. territories. The overall response rate for the survey of federal law  enforcement agencies was 87 percent (13 of 15), and the overall  response rate for the survey of state coordinators was 94 percent (50 of  53). Further, we conducted non-generalizable case studies of five states:  Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, and Texas. We selected these  states based on quantity, type, and initial acquisition value of controlled property received through the LESO program as well as geographic  dispersion. For each case study we interviewed officials from selected  federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to gain an  understanding of how property is transferred to them, including how they  screen for, obtain, and dispose of DOD excess controlled property. We  interviewed officials from DLA Disposition Services, who have oversight  over the LESO program, as well as officials from LESO headquarters who  manage the program, to gain an understanding of LESO program policies  and processes for transferring its excess controlled property to law  enforcement agencies.", "For objective 2, we reviewed the statutory requirement, interviewed  officials from LESO headquarters to obtain updates on the  implementation status of the Internet site, and analyzed the capabilities of  the Internet site, including the fields it contained and the searches that  can be performed using it.

According to  DLA policy, to participate in the program, a law enforcement agency must  be a federal, state, or local government agency whose primary function is  the enforcement of applicable federal, state, and local laws and whose  sworn compensated law enforcement officers have powers of arrest and  apprehension. According to LESO program data, as of August 2016,  there were over 8,600 federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies  participating in the program. Of these, approximately 96 percent were  state and local law enforcement agencies and approximately 4 percent  were federal law enforcement agencies.

Further, LESO  program guidance requires state coordinators to develop a State Plan of  Operation outlining how the program will be managed in their state, and  each participating state or local law enforcement agency must sign the  plan, attesting to the terms and conditions of the program. According to  LESO officials, unlike state and local agencies, federal law enforcement  agencies work directly with the LESO program office. As of December  2016, the LESO program office finalized a memorandum of  understanding (MOU) that it plans to sign with participating federal  agencies. According to the MOU, it will establish DLA\u2019s authority as the  owner of the program and, among other things, establish general terms  and conditions.

According to LESO officials, they manually review all  property requests forwarded from state coordinators for state and local  law enforcement agencies, as well as requests submitted directly from  federal agencies, for final approval or denial. LESO officials told us they  look for detailed justifications, including who will use the property and  how, when reviewing requests for approval. For certain items, such as  aircraft, vehicles, and weapons, law enforcement agencies are required to  answer additional questions and provide additional documentation, such  as their training plan(s) and how the items will be secured. According to  LESO officials, they follow statutory direction in U.S. Code title 10 which  authorizes preference be given to property requests indicating that the  use of the property will be for counterdrug, counterterrorism, and border- security activities. LESO officials also stated that a request for excess  property may be denied for a variety of reasons, including if the request  was not detailed enough or if the law enforcement agency has met its  allowed allocation for certain property. For example, according to program  documentation, for small arms, only one type is allocated for each  qualified full-time or part-time officer; for HMMWVs, only one vehicle is  allocated for every three officers; and for MRAPs, only one vehicle is  allocated per law enforcement agency.

Such revisions were  made, in part, because of recommendations made by the DOD and DLA  Offices of Inspector General. The DOD and DLA Offices of Inspector  General conducted four audits of the LESO program between 2003 and  2013 that identified more than a dozen recommendations, such as to:  develop and implement written standard operating procedures that  include, for example, criteria for approval and disapproval of law  enforcement agency property requests; strengthen policy and procedures  on disbarring law enforcement agencies and state coordinators that do  not comply with LESO program conditions; improve oversight and  accountability of property; use the automated processing system for  requisitioning, approving, and issuing items; and further develop  procedures for the issuance, transfer, turn-in and disposal of LESO  property.

The checklist  required manual completion of a number of items, including quantity,  date, and who fulfilled the order. The other two Disposition Services sites,  including the site that transferred the wrong quantity, did not include this  checklist with the transfer documentation we received.

Further, DLA  officials stated they are more carefully reviewing the legitimacy of some  information on the application such as email addresses and physically  visiting federal agencies that enter into MOUs with the LESO program.  However, as previously discussed, we identified internal controls  weakness in the policy or procedures for verifying and approving federal  agency applications and enrollment as well as weakness throughout the  process from approval to the actual transfer of the items to the agencies,  which indicates that DLA has not examined potential risks for all stages of  the process.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government note that  management should remediate identified internal control deficiencies on a  timely basis, assess fraud risk by considering the potential for fraud when  identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks, and analyze and respond  to identified fraud risks so that they are effectively mitigated.  Additionally, according to GAO\u2019s Fraud Risk Framework, effective fraud  risk managers collect and analyze data on identified fraud schemes, use  these lessons learned to improve fraud risk management activities, and  plan and conduct fraud risk assessments that are tailored to their  programs. The framework states there is no universally accepted  approach for conducting fraud risk assessments since circumstances  among programs vary. However, per leading practices, assessing fraud  risks generally involves five actions: (1) identifying inherent fraud risks  affecting the program, (2) assessing the likelihood and effect of those  fraud risks, (3) determining fraud risk tolerance, (4) examining the  suitability of existing fraud controls and prioritizing residual fraud risks,  and (5) documenting the program\u2019s fraud risk profile. In conducting the  fraud risk assessment, the framework identifies that managers should  develop and document an antifraud strategy which describes, among  other things, existing fraud control activities as well as any new control  activities a program may adopt to address residual fraud risks. The DLA  Office of Inspector General has an investigation ongoing, but DLA Office  of Inspector General officials told us that a number of internal control  weaknesses were identified and several recommendations were made to  DLA that if implemented could help to mitigate future potential fraud risks.  As such, DLA has begun to examine some risk associated with the LESO  program. During our March 2017 meeting with DLA officials, they  acknowledged that they have not conducted a fraud risk assessment on  the LESO program, to include the application process, and as such, has  not designed or implemented a strategy with specific control activities to  mitigate risks to the program. Conducting such an assessment could  have program-wide improvements, including strengthening the controls to  verify the legitimacy of state and local law enforcement agencies.

We took steps in the development of the  survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to minimize these non- sampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the answers that were  obtained. For example, a survey specialist designed the survey, in  collaboration with our staff who have subject matter expertise. Then, as  noted earlier, the draft surveys were pre-tested to ensure that questions  were relevant, clearly stated, and easy to comprehend, and in the case of  the federal agency survey we conducted an expert review. Data were  manually extracted from the Microsoft Word form into an Excel  spreadsheet and that data entry accuracy was verified. We examined the  survey results and performed analyses to identify inconsistencies and  other indications of error, and addressed such issues as necessary.  Quantitative data analyses and a review of open-ended responses were  conducted by our staff who have subject matter expertise. Results of  select survey questions can be found in Appendix I, IV and V.", "Further, we conducted non-generalizable case studies of five states:  Arizona, Georgia, Maryland, Michigan, and Texas. We selected these  states based on quantity, type, and initial acquisition value of controlled  property received during calendar years 2013, 2014, and 2015 as well as  geographic dispersion. We selected these calendar years because they  were the last three complete years prior to our audit work. First, for each  state, we met and interviewed the state coordinator and when applicable,  each state\u2019s point of contact(s), to discuss roles and responsibilities in  managing and overseeing the LESO program within each state. Second,  we selected at least one federal, state, local, and university law  enforcement agency within each case study state.

Selected law  enforcement agencies accounted for large and small percentages as well  as different types of controlled property received within each state. For  example, we selected law enforcement agencies that received weapons,  tactical vehicles, and aircraft, as well as night-vision equipment and other  miscellaneous items. We met with law enforcement officials from the  selected federal, state, local, and university law enforcement agencies to  discuss the LESO program and to gain an understanding of the transfer  process, including how they screen for, obtain, and dispose of DOD  excess controlled property.", "Further, we reviewed LESO\u2019s program policy to gain an understanding of  how LESO ensures accountability of controlled property through an  annual inventory and certification process and to gain an understanding  of the program compliance review process in which LESO officials visit  select law enforcement agencies within each state to verify all controlled  property. We accompanied a LESO performance compliance review team  as its members conducted their review in the annual program compliance  review in Georgia. We attended the LESO-led in-brief and out-brief with  the Georgia state coordinator and his team, as well as accompanied them  to seven law enforcement agencies in Georgia to physically verify the  serial numbers of controlled property. Additionally, we also analyzed  survey responses, as previously discussed, from federal law enforcement  agencies and state coordinators regarding DLA\u2019s processes for  transferring controlled property and training on LESO program policies  and processes. We interviewed officials from DLA Disposition Services,  who have authority over the LESO program, as well as officials from  LESO headquarters who manage the program, to gain an understanding  of LESO program policies and processes for transferring its excess  controlled property to law enforcement agencies, including past and  planned program enhancements. We also interviewed these officials to  gain an understanding of how law enforcement agencies are trained on  LESO program policies and procedures. We also met with officials from  select law enforcement agencies, as previously discussed, to gain an  understanding of LESO program processes, including how they screen  for, obtain, and dispose of DLA excess controlled property,  enhancements made to the program, and how they are trained on LESO  program policies and processes. We selected these law enforcement  agencies based on a number of factors, including range of quantity of  items, total acquisition value, and item type. We reviewed training  materials provided by LESO and attended the 15th annual training  seminar provided to state coordinators. Finally, we visited two Disposition  Service sites in the United States to observe their processes for disposing  of excess property received from the military services.

In our  survey of select federal law enforcement agencies, training had not been  regularly provided to participating federal law enforcement agencies. For  example, 3 of the 13 respondents to the federal survey reported that their  agency had received training from LESO; the remaining 10 respondents  to the federal survey stated that either they did not receive training from  LESO or they did not know if their agency had received any training from  LESO regarding the LESO program. LESO officials told us that they have  not regularly provided training to federal law enforcement agencies in the  past, with training mainly provided to the state coordinators participating  in the LESO program. Survey results of federal law enforcement agencies  also showed that officials generally stated that training on the LESO  program would be beneficial. For example, 9 of the 13 respondents to the  federal survey stated that refresher training provided by LESO would be  beneficial to their agency. In addition, officials from federal agencies\u2019 field  offices in our case studies generally stated that training provided by  LESO would be beneficial to them in participating in the LESO program  and that they wanted more training to better understand, for example,  LESO program processes, such as the turn-in or transfer of controlled  property. Officials from federal field offices in our case studies also  generally stated that they were mostly self-taught on the LESO program.", "According to LESO officials, LESO funds and provides an annual training  seminar that includes training on LESO policies and procedures for state  coordinators. LESO officials stated that as a part of this annual training  they direct state coordinators to train participating law enforcement  agencies, and state coordinators have discretion to establish their own  training. However, our survey results showed that nearly three-fourths of  the state coordinators reported that they do not provide mandatory  training on LESO program policies and procedures to law enforcement  agencies. Also, we found that state coordinators varied in the types of  training they provided on LESO program policies and procedures to law  enforcement agencies in their state, as shown in table 8. For example,  our survey found that 40 percent (18 of 45) of responding state  coordinators reported that they do not provide in-person refresher or  annual training and 15 percent (7 of 46 responding to the question)  reported that they do not provide training aids or reference aids (i.e.,  PowerPoint format).", "The majority of state coordinators reported they found LESO training  \u201chelpful\u201d, as shown in table 9.", "However, the majority of state coordinators also reported they would find  LESO training modules helpful, as shown in table 10.", "Moreover, officials from state and local law enforcement agencies in our  case studies reported different experiences about the availability and  accessibility of training on policies and procedures of the LESO program  from their state coordinators and stated that they would benefit from  additional training on policies and procedures, such as on returning  property to DLA. For example, an official from one law enforcement  agency in our case study told us that it took 8 months to receive training  from his state coordinator upon joining the program. In another example,  an official stated that he received little formal training from his state  coordinator or from LESO officials; rather, he was trained by his  predecessor when he was assigned to manage the LESO program for his  law enforcement agency. In contrast, for example, an official from another  law enforcement agency stated that he attended mandatory training with  his state coordinator upon joining the LESO program to learn how to set  up an account and screen for items and that his state coordinator is  responsive when questions arise.", "As noted in this report, DOD is enhancing its processes for the transfer of  excess property by developing additional training for participating law  enforcement agencies on LESO program policies and procedures by  establishing an online training tool. According to DLA officials, the online  training tool will assist in providing specific information and training  modules on LESO program policies and procedures to federal law  enforcement agencies, and state coordinators can provide the training to  law enforcement agencies in their states.

Also, the majority (11 of 13) reported that  the LESO program office had not provided, or they did not know if the  LESO program office had provided, any policy or guidance to their  agency on program roles and responsibilities regarding the LESO  program, as shown in Table 11.
