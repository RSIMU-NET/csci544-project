Several bureaus have reported effective controls over their systems. However, longstanding information security weaknesses in access and software change controls, segregation of duties, and service continuity have been consistently identified at certain key Treasury bureaus, such as IRS and the Financial Management Service. Weaknesses at these bureaus place the sensitive information managed by the bureaus at increased risk of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Moreover, bureaus have not consistently implemented key information security requirements. An analysis of performance data for the 11 Treasury bureaus that reported on these requirements for fiscal years 2002 and 2003 reveals that most Treasury systems did not meet certain key information security requirements in fiscal year 2003 and that the percentage of systems that meet certain requirements has decreased from fiscal year 2002. The information security weaknesses and inconsistent implementation of security controls at Treasury bureaus exist, in part, because Treasury's departmentwide security program, while evolving, has not yet been fully institutionalized across the entire department. During fiscal year 2003, Treasury launched or expanded several initiatives to implement key elements of its program.

Logical  access controls at IRS facilities did not effectively prevent, limit, or detect  access to computing resources. IRS did not adequately control user  accounts and passwords to ensure that only authorized individuals were  allowed access to computer systems. Inactive and unused user system  accounts were found at all 11 IRS computing facilities reviewed. In  addition, IRS inappropriately granted powerful operating system privileges  to users who did not need them and granted users access to certain system  files for which they had no business need. Further, inadequate controls  over network services and devices were found that could allow intruders  to gain unauthorized access to valuable information about IRS systems  without logging on to the systems.", "Physical security control weaknesses, such as inadequate physical barriers  and ineffective screening of visitors, contributed to weakening the  perimeter security at several IRS facilities.

Elements of the model include integrating security programs  both functionally with capital planning and organizationally across  bureaus; increasing CIO oversight; increasing bureau self-assessments;  creating and distributing comprehensive security policies, standards, and  procedures; establishing a security policy forum; and linking the  information technology governance process to the enterprise architecture  and capital investment and planning process.", "Updated departmental information security policies and procedures.", "During fiscal year 2003, Treasury undertook a major revision of its  outdated and incomplete information security policies. In August 2003,  Treasury published a comprehensive, up-to-date body of information  security policies and procedures\u2014the Treasury Information Systems  Security Program\u2014consisting of the Treasury Information Technology  Security Program Policy (Volume 1) and the Treasury Information  Technology Security Program Handbook (Volume 2). The documents  replaced Treasury Directive 71-10 and formally establish a uniform  baseline for the department\u2019s information security requirements. They are  based on requirements levied by the FISMA, NIST, and OMB and are to  serve as a framework for the bureaus as they develop their specific  policies and operating directives.", "Expanded program and system review. Treasury expanded its review of  the bureaus\u2019 information security programs and systems during fiscal year  2003. According to Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2003 FISMA report, one  departmental initiative to create and maintain a system inventory revealed  an additional 270 systems in fiscal year 2003. The department also  conducted reviews of each bureau\u2019s information security program and  performed 21 system certification and accreditation package reviews. In  addition, Treasury conducted vulnerability scans on networks and  performed system penetration tests as part of its program and system  reviews.", "Analysis of bureaus\u2019 plans of action and milestones. Treasury continued  tracking and analyzing the plan of action and milestones (POA&M)  reported by the bureaus on a quarterly basis. This plan is a tool that details  the tasks that need to be accomplished and the resources required,  milestones, and scheduled completion dates for accomplishing the tasks.  The purpose of a POA&M is to help agencies identify, assess, prioritize,  and monitor the progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses  found in programs and systems. OMB requires agencies to (1) develop a  separate POA&M for every program and system for which weaknesses  were identified and (2) report quarterly on progress implementing the  plans. Accordingly, Treasury requires its bureaus to maintain POA&Ms on  all information security weaknesses and provide quarterly updates to the  Treasury CIO\u2019s office. Treasury monitors bureau progress in correcting  weaknesses by using the plans as a performance tracking mechanism.  According to the Treasury CIO, Treasury analyzes the updated plans for  quality and completeness and evaluates progress and other significant  trends that may influence the resolution of security-related weaknesses.", "Educational outreach programs. According to Treasury\u2019s FISMA report  for fiscal year 2003, Treasury\u2019s oversight and compliance program also  developed and maintained a series of outreach programs that are designed  to educate Treasury employees about elements of information security  compliance and to stimulate dialogue among security practitioners and  stakeholders across the department.", "Increased funding for information technology security. According to  Treasury\u2019s FISMA report for fiscal year 2003, the department more than  doubled its total information security spending, from $85 million in fiscal  year 2002 to $174 million in fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Despite Initiatives, Information Security Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Although Treasury has significantly increased funding for information  security and has begun to make progress implementing key elements of its  information security program, it remains challenged to effectively and  consistently implement security controls and procedures across the  department. As illustrated in figure 6, an analysis of security metric data in  Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2002 GISRA report and its fiscal year 2003 FISMA  report shows that  the majority of Treasury systems do not meet key information security  requirements, and   Treasury\u2019s reported performance in meeting certain of these requirements  has decreased.", "Treasury reported that it did not implement any of these six required  information security activities on a majority of its systems for fiscal year  2003. For example, Treasury established a specific goal that 80 percent of  all information systems be certified and accredited by the end of fiscal  year 2003. However, as of August 15, 2003\u2014the date of data contained in  its FISMA report for fiscal year 2003\u2014Treasury had certified and  accredited only about 24 percent of its 708 systems.  According to  Treasury\u2019s CIO, this was due to (1) the discovery of 276 additional systems  at the IRS as a result of an effort to compile an accurate inventory and (2)  a new reporting requirement that stipulated that systems with an interim  authority to operate not be counted in fiscal year 2003 as an accredited  system.  In fiscal year 2002, such systems were counted as accredited for  reporting purposes.", "In addition, implementation of certain information security requirements  has decreased from fiscal year 2002. For the 11 bureaus that reported  performance measures for both years, the percentage of Treasury systems  implementing five of the six requirements decreased in fiscal year 2003,  while it increased for one. For example, Treasury-reported data for fiscal  year 2002 shows that 93 percent of the systems at those bureaus were  assessed for risk and assigned a level of risk, while for fiscal year 2003  only 42 percent were.", "Treasury\u2019s overall performance demonstrates that it continues to face  challenges implementing and monitoring information security throughout  the department. The following factors contribute to the challenges  confronting Treasury as it endeavors to improve the security of its  information systems and data:    Treasury reorganization. Throughout fiscal year 2003, Treasury  underwent a major reorganization. The reorganization resulted in the  reassignment of three bureaus to the Department of Homeland Security,  the creation of a new entity within Treasury, and the transfer of about 50  percent of Treasury\u2019s information technology security staff to the  Department of Homeland Security. The reduction in staff resulting from  the reorganization, combined with the reported increase in the total  number of departmental systems, could hinder the department\u2019s ability to  provide effective oversight and direction over the bureaus\u2019 information  security programs.", "Senior information security officer has not been designated. FISMA  requires that a senior agency information security officer be designated to  carry out the information security duties and responsibilities of the CIO  under the act. This senior level official is to (1) have information security  as his or her primary duty; (2) head an office with the mission and  resources necessary to assist in ensuring compliance with the act; and (3)  possess the professional qualifications, including training and experience,  required to administer the functions described in the act. The official  would oversee the development and implementation of departmental  information policies, procedures, and control techniques and coordinate  departmentwide security-related activities to ensure that weaknesses  identified in one bureau\u2019s systems do not place the entire department\u2019s  information assets at undue risk. However, Treasury has not designated a  senior agency information security officer to develop, maintain, and  oversee the department\u2019s security program. The lack of a senior  information security officer with the stature and experience as well as the  responsibility and authority for directing and overseeing the  implementation of the departmentwide program could impair  departmental control or influence in information security program  decisions made by the bureaus.", "Reliability and completeness of performance information. Although  FISMA reporting provided performance information on key security areas,  it is important for agencies to ensure that they have the appropriate  management structures and processes in place to strategically manage  information security, as well as to ensure the reliability of performance  information. For example, disciplined processes can routinely provide the  agency with timely, accurate, and useful information for day-to-day  management of information security. Treasury has established a process  for receiving quarterly updates on the bureaus\u2019 plans of actions and  milestones and issuing an annual data call to the bureaus for performance  information on key information security requirements used in FISMA  reports. However, the Treasury reports reveal issues with the reliability  and completeness of bureau-reported information. For example, in  Treasury\u2019s fiscal year 2002 GISRA report, there were significant  differences between what Treasury and the OIG reported for the  percentage of systems that met certain information security requirements.", "In addition, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration  (TIGTA) states in the fiscal year 2003 FISMA report that IRS\u2019s POA&Ms do  not report on the status of system-specific vulnerabilities and are not  specific enough to ensure accountability and timely remediation of the  vulnerabilities. TIGTA also states that since IRS\u2019s POA&Ms are not  reported by system, justifications for information security funding found  in its business cases cannot be tied to or linked with weaknesses reported  in the POA&M. With the need for effective oversight to ensure compliance  with the departmentwide information security program and the need to  comply with a new requirement by OMB for quarterly reporting of agency  progress against certain information security performance measures,  disciplined processes that can routinely provide Treasury with timely,  accurate, and useful information for day-to-day management of  information security will become more important for the department."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in information security controls at Treasury bureaus have  placed its financial and information management systems at risk and could  hinder its ability to effectively and efficiently accomplish its mission.  Although Treasury has taken the initial steps necessary to implement a  departmentwide information security program, key elements of such a  program\u2014those needed to help mitigate Treasury\u2019s long-standing  information security weaknesses\u2014have not been fully implemented.  Implementing an effective information security program could help ensure  that known weaknesses affecting Treasury\u2019s computing resources are  promptly mitigated and that general controls effectively protect its  computing environments.
