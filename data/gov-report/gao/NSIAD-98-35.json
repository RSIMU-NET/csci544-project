The Air Force decided to privatize-in-place the remaining AGMC workloads. At the time it made this decision, the Air Force relied on an analysis that estimated privatizing would save about $5 million in 1997.

After the decision, Air Force organizations conducted several studies comparing the projected cost of privatizing-in-place the AGMC depot maintenance workload against the historical costs of the Air Force depot. These studies concluded that costs of a privatized-in-place operation would exceed the historic costs by $6.2 million to $20 million, on a projected workload of about $82 million to $90 million.

Items to be repaired have been misclassified as government-furnished material.", "According to Audit Agency officials, two factors will inhibit AFMC\u2019s ability to reconcile physical inventory with the inventory records and establish material consumption rates. First, with Air Force and contractor concurrence, the contractor accepted a transfer of initial material inventory from the Air Force without the Air Force performing a physical inventory. According to the Audit Agency, the contractor disputes the accuracy of the Air Force\u2019s inventory transfer documents and, therefore, it may be impossible to determine how much material the contractor has consumed. In addition, the contractor assumed control over stock already issued to the shop floor that was not on Air Force inventory records. Therefore, the Air Force has no accurate way to measure consumption of those items typically held in stock at repair work benches.", "According to the Air Force Audit Agency, because the contract award fee structure does not emphasize minimizing the use of government-furnished material, the contractor may have used a greater amount of such material than necessary in order to reduce repair turn around time on items. Nonetheless, BGRC personnel maintain that BGRC\u2019s consumption of material does not vary significantly from prior AGMC consumption levels because it is repairing items using the same people, the same facilities, and the same repair procedures.", "While the increased ordering of material clearly represents an increased cost to the program during the period evaluated, it is uncertain how material consumption will compare over a longer period.

Air Force officials stated that its interim analysis actually assigned 100 percent to both the minimum and most likely material consumption cost computations and 200 percent to the maximum material costs. The 100 percent referred to by the Air Force is the same as the historic material consumptions costs and represents the 0-percent increase we use in our explanation for the minimum condition. In stating that there was no increase in material assigned to the most likely scenario, the Air Force was referring to the material consumption variable input to the model.

Moreover, they said that the Audit Agency\u2019s approach greatly overstated material usage. As previously discussed, lacking precise data on material consumption, the Air Force study used a range from no increase on the low end to a high of a 100-percent increase, with a 35-percent increase used to represent the most likely usage. In the absence of actual consumption data, Air Force officials stated that they based their treatment of consumption on material orders, which should provide a good indicator of consumption. Given the high material usage indicators but the lack of definitive data, the Air Force also took several independent actions.
