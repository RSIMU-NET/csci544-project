The Aviation and Transportation Security Act, enacted in November 2001, established the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and significantly changed how passenger and checked baggage screening is conducted in the United States. This act removed screening responsibility from air carriers and the contractors who conducted screening for them, and placed this responsibility with TSA. As a result, TSA hired and deployed about 55,000 federal passenger and baggage Transportation Security Officers (TSO)--formerly known as screeners--to more than 400 airports nationwide based largely on the number of screeners that the air carrier contractors had employed. Since August 2002, however, TSA has been statutorily prohibited from exceeding 45,000 full-time equivalent positions available for screening. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, enacted in December 2004, required TSA to develop and submit to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and the House of Representatives Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, standards for determining the aviation security staffing for all airports at which TSA provides or oversees screening services by March 2005.

However, TSA faces some challenges to effective implementation of the model, primarily in ensuring that the model's key assumptions reflect operating conditions across airports. The model determines the annual TSO allocation for each airport by first considering the workload demands unique to each airport based on an estimate of each airport's peak passenger volume. This input is then processed against certain TSA assumptions about screening passengers and checked baggage--including expected processing rates, required staffing for passenger lanes and baggage equipment based on standard operating procedures, and historical equipment alarm rates. To monitor the sufficiency of the model's allocation outputs, TSA has both field and headquarters-driven mechanisms in place. However, TSA does not have a mechanism, such as a documented plan, for selecting and prioritizing which assumptions to review each year and for assuring that all assumptions are periodically reviewed to help ensure that they are current with and reflect actual operating conditions. Without a plan for periodically validating all of the assumptions, TSA is at risk of assumptions becoming outdated, which could result in TSO allocations that do not reflect operating conditions. TSA has vested its FSDs with responsibility for deploying and managing to their TSO allocation in light of local circumstances, including those that might affect scheduling and pose challenges to most efficiently deploying their resource allocations. After receiving the annual staffing allocation from TSA headquarters, FSDs must prepare work schedules, which may include use of the Staffing Allocation Model's optional scheduling tool, to deploy TSO staff to meet screening demand. However, Federal Security Directors (FSD) we interviewed identified several challenges they faced in deploying their TSO workforce. These challenges involve factors outside the model's determination of overall TSO staffing levels and affect FSDs' ability to effectively deploy their TSO staff regardless of their allocation. Specifically, FSDs cited difficulties in achieving a 20 percent part-time TSO workforce, which the model has identified as the optimal ratio for scheduling efficiency; recruiting and retaining sufficient TSOs (both full-time and part-time) to reach their full allocations as determined by the model; staffing checkpoints appropriately given that some TSOs are unavailable due to absenteeism and injuries; and managing competing demands on TSOs' time, particularly with regard to operational support functions sometimes performed by TSOs and TSO training requirements. FSDs also had to manage around physical infrastructure limitations at some airports, such as lack of room for additional lanes or baggage check areas despite demand levels that would justify such added capacity. TSA headquarters officials and FSDs we interviewed reported having several efforts underway to help address challenges they face in deploying the TSO workforce. TSA officials at individual airports we visited are also working to address these challenges. TSA human capital officials told us that they plan to evaluate the effects of their workforce initiatives and use the results of the evaluations to make any needed changes to their approach."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 600 million people travel by air each year in the United States, and  the screening of airline passengers and their carry-on and checked  baggage is vital to securing our transportation security system.

We assessed the reliability of these data for fiscal years 2005 and 2006 and  concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  review.

By  November 2002, TSA had fully deployed a federal passenger and checked  baggage TSO workforce of about 55,000 full-time equivalents to the  nation\u2019s commercial airports. This level of TSOs needed to conduct  passenger and checked baggage screening was identified by a consultant,  relying largely on the number of private sector screeners that had been in  place prior to TSA. Subsequently, TSA decided to develop a staffing model  to more effectively determine the appropriate number of TSOs needed at  the nation\u2019s airports. TSA developed a demand driven model\u2014a model  based on flight schedules, connecting flight data, passenger loads,  passenger arrival distribution curves, and number of passenger bags  along with throughput rates for processing the passengers and bags\u2014in an  effort to make screening operations more efficient. This model identified  a TSO staffing level of 49,600 full-time equivalents based, in part, on the  need for 5.5 TSOs per passenger screening lane. The DHS Appropriations  Act, 2004, enacted in October 2003, however, imposed a 45,000 full-time- equivalent cap specific to the number of TSOs.", "In May 2003, TSA set out to develop a tool to better define aviation  security staffing requirements at airports nationwide by accounting for  changes in screening technology, operating conditions, and airline  operations. The result of this effort is the Staffing Allocation Model\u2014an  optimization model that seeks, within certain TSA constraints, to  estimate the most efficient balance of TSOs needed to ensure security and  minimize wait times.", "As shown in figure 4, TSA uses the staffing allocation model to generate  (1) an annual full-time-equivalent total for each airport, known as an  \u201cannual allocation run,\u201d and (2) TSO work schedules throughout the  course of the year, known as a \u201cproduction, or scheduling, run.\u201d To  determine the annual full-time-equivalent total for each airport, FSDs must  first provide input to the model on their airports\u2019 passenger and checked  baggage screening configuration. FSDs also provide input to the model on  their airports\u2019 busiest month for screening demand based on originating  passenger load factors. This \u201cpeak month\u201d determination forms the basis  of one of the model\u2019s key operating parameters used to compute each  airport\u2019s full-time-equivalent staffing allocation. Specifically, for  determination of an airport\u2019s annual full-time equivalent level, the model  assumes a screening demand based on the average demand day during the  airport\u2019s peak month. This assumption is linked to TSA\u2019s 10-minute wait  time goal for processing passengers and baggage through security.  According to TSA officials, the use of the average peak demand day is  intended to ensure that, on an annual basis, 85 percent or more of the total  passengers screened in U.S. airports will not have to wait more than 10  minutes to be screened. Once the peak month is selected for each airport,  TSA performs the annual allocation run on a representative week within  the peak month.", "After receiving and reviewing the inputs and assumptions for each airport,  TSA runs the Staffing Allocation Model to determine each airport\u2019s full- time equivalent level for the upcoming year. During the run, the model  takes each airport\u2019s configuration and peak month screening demand  input, combines it with the assumptions regarding baggage and passenger  processing, and uses these factors to simulate the flow of passengers and  baggage through an airport\u2019s screening areas to provide work force  requirements. Then it calculates the total number of TSOs required  (expressed in full-time equivalents) for the year based on the results of  running the model for the representative week of the peak month. This  representative week FTE level is used to calculate the annual FTE  estimate for the airport.", "After receiving their annual full-time-equivalent allocation, TSA staff at  individual airports may periodically run the model throughout the year. As  shown in figure 4, during these \u201cscheduling\u201d runs, FSD staff may use the  model\u2019s optional scheduling tool to determine work schedules for TSO  staff that will satisfy screening demand on a day-to-day basis.  Similar to  the annual allocation runs, TSA also inputs various historic data into the  model during the scheduling runs. This input includes originating  passenger load factors, estimates of number of bags per passenger, and  passenger arrival distribution curves.", "In order to formulate TSO work schedules, the model monitors the  passenger arrival patterns and recommends opening and closing lanes at  passenger checkpoints to accommodate the demand. The optional  scheduling software recommends a mix of full-time and part-time TSOs to  satisfy the workforce requirements based on projected screening demand.", "According to TSA officials responsible for the staffing allocation model,  TSA first ran the Staffing Allocation Model in August 2004 for fiscal year  2005. The model, which did not yet contain complete data on each airport,  identified a TSO full-time-equivalent level of 47,865 across all airports. To  reach the congressionally-mandated limit of 45,000 full-time-equivalent  TSOs, TSA applied a 7 percent reduction to the staffing levels identified by  the model across all airport categories. TSA officials stated that they  subsequently questioned this approach given that smaller (category III and  IV) airports have significantly fewer TSOs and, therefore, were more  significantly impacted by the 7 percent reduction in full-time equivalent  positions.", "According to TSA officials, because the Staffing Allocation Model was not  centrally hosted and did not contain complete data, the model may have  over-estimated the required FTEs for fiscal year 2005. TSA determined that  in August 2005, the Staffing Allocation Model contained complete and  accurate data on each airport and the agency used it to identify TSO FTE  allocations for each airport, and the output reflecting the total number of  FTEs required\u201442,303\u2014required no adjustment to fall within the  congressionally-mandated limit of 45,000 TSO FTEs. According to TSA  officials, when TSA ran the model, it did so without imposing a limitation  on the maximum number of full-time-equivalent TSOs, including either the  45,000 congressional limit or any budgetary limits. TSA informed FSDs of  their TSO full-time-equivalent allocations in October 2005.

In addition, certain airports may, during  the course of the year, experience significant changes to their screening  operations (e.g., arrival of a new airline, opening of a new terminal, etc.).  For these airports, TSA established a reserve of 329 TSO full-time  equivalents for fiscal year 2006 that can be used to augment the existing  force.

Under the Screening Partnership Program, six airports have  applied to TSA and received approval to hire private contract screener  forces as of fiscal year 2006. Despite the fact that these airports do not use  federal screeners, TSA still used the Staffing Allocation Model to  determine the full-time equivalent screening staff at each of these airports  for fiscal year 2006. These staffing levels, as determined by the model,  served as a limit on the number of private screeners that the private  screening contractors could employ.

During the first 2 years of the Staffing  Allocation Model\u2019s use, TSA established several mechanisms to monitor  the sufficiency of the model\u2019s outputs and make adjustments in key model  assumptions that do not fully reflect operating conditions for some  airports. For example, TSA established a process for FSDs to request  revisions to the assumptions used for their individual airports. In fiscal  year 2006, TSA granted some, but not all, requests. TSA headquarters also  started an assessment to evaluate selected Staffing Allocation Model  assumptions, an assessment it expects to perform annually, varying the  assumptions it examines each year. However, TSA does not have a  mechanism for selecting and prioritizing which assumptions to review  each year and for assuring that all assumptions are periodically reviewed.

For example, some FSDs stated that TSA\u2019s method of calculating  screening demand (the 85th percentile day) to also account for TSO  absences from screening did not provide them with sufficient surplus  staffing. In addition, the model assumed a ratio of 20 percent part time to  80 percent full time (expressed in full-time equivalents), even in airports  that have consistently been unable to achieve a 20 percent part-time TSO  workforce; and the model had no mechanism to account for use of TSOs  to perform operation support functions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Staffing Allocation Model Seeks to Determine the Optimal TSO Staffing Levels for Each Airport, Relying on Assumptions that Are Designed to Help Ensure Necessary Levels of Security and to Minimize Passenger Wait Times", "paragraphs": ["TSA\u2019s Staffing Allocation Model determined the fiscal years 2005 and 2006  TSO staffing level for each airport using several built-in assumptions  regarding security and wait times, in addition to data that reflect each  airports\u2019 baseline configuration\u2014e.g., permanent infrastructure and type  of screening equipment.", "The key built-in assumptions are adjustable and designed to help ensure  the necessary levels of security while minimizing wait times and include:    The minimum number of TSOs needed to staff each passenger  screening checkpoint or baggage screening area based on the standard  operating procedures for screening passengers and checked baggage  and throughput rates for passenger and checked baggage screening  equipment (see app. II).", "A 10-minute maximum wait time for processing passengers and  checked baggage.", "Originating passenger and baggage load factors by airport based on a  representative week during each airport\u2019s peak month (the 85th  percentile assumption), which TSA expects will give FSDs some time  during less busy periods to allow TSOs to obtain required training,  perform operational support functions, and take annual or other forms  of leave.", "A desired ratio of 80 percent full-time to 20 percent part-time TSO staff,  expressed as full time equivalents, at each category X, I, and II airport  to allow for heavier staffing during busier periods (e.g., the hours when  business travelers typically depart) and to minimize overstaffing during  less busy periods, times during which part-time TSOs would not be  scheduled to work.", "Nonpassenger throughput rate of 4 percent.", "Rates at which screening equipment have historically signaled the  possibility of a threat object and the consequent need for additional  screening.", "The Staffing Allocation Model used these assumptions, along with other  inputs such as each airport\u2019s baseline configuration\u2014e.g., the number and  type of checkpoints, security lanes, baggage screening areas, and  screening equipment at each airport\u2014to determine TSO staffing  allocations for the nation\u2019s commercial airports for fiscal years 2005 and  2006. TSA officials stated that the assumptions used in the staffing  allocation model and the other inputs collectively determine the TSO full- time-equivalent allocation for each airport. For this reason, airports with  similar screening demand but different checkpoint configurations and  types of screening equipment may receive different allocations. For  example, TSA officials identified two category I airports that have similar  screening demand, yet one airport received almost 50 percent more full- time equivalent TSOs in fiscal year 2006 due to the physical infrastructure  differences at these airports. Specifically, one airport has one terminal  building, with three concourses, which generally enables passengers to be  efficiently routed through one checkpoint in that one terminal. In contrast,  the other airport has two separate terminals that prevent passengers from  being routed through common checkpoints. This airport\u2019s separate  terminals make sharing TSOs among the various checkpoints more  challenging, creating a need for additional TSOs, thus the larger TSO  allocation. Additionally, we visited category X and I airports with similar  passenger volumes and differing TSO full-time-equivalent allocations for  fiscal year 2006. According to TSA, in the case of the category X airports,  while the passenger volumes for the two airports were similar\u201417.4 and  16.5 million, respectively\u2014the difference in the type of passengers and the  type of baggage screening equipment resulted in one of these airports  receiving 26 percent more full-time-equivalent TSOs. Table 1 provides a  summary of the various factors that influenced full-time-equivalent TSO  allocations for fiscal year 2006 at some of the airports we visited.", "The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 required  TSA to develop staffing standards that provide for the necessary levels of  security and minimize delays for passengers. According to TSA officials  responsible for the Staffing Allocation Model, the model ensures that the  staffing allocations provide for the necessary levels of security because the  model is based on TSA\u2019s standard operating procedures for screening  passengers and their carry-on items and checked baggage and on the  technology available at the passenger checkpoints and baggage screening  areas. For example, the passenger checkpoint standard operating  procedures require that a minimum of one TSO be staffed for each of the  screening functions at a checkpoint. The staffing model includes an  assumption (for larger airports) of at least 5.5 TSOs per screening lane\u2014 which responds to the need for one TSO per function at every checkpoint  and includes a value for supervisors that typically oversee two lanes. In  addition, the staffing model provides an allocation for each airport based,  in part, on the screening technology at the airport. In addition, the model  includes assumptions on alarm rates for various types of passenger and  baggage screening equipment and determines the sufficient number of  TSOs needed to resolve the alarms at the projected rate to be able to  achieve the model\u2019s wait time standard of 10 minutes for processing  passengers and checked baggage.", "Regarding minimizing passenger delays, a key assumption in the staffing  allocation model is that wait times for screening passengers and checked  baggage will not exceed 10 minutes when the model is set at a level  referred to as the airport\u2019s 85th percentile day, which TSA calculates by  estimating screening demand at the level required for a representative  week of each airport\u2019s busiest month. TSA officials stated this assumption  is based on a goal that was established when TSA was first created within  the Department of Transportation. Specifically, the Secretary of the  Department of Transportation established a goal that passengers be  processed through passenger screening checkpoints in 10 minutes or  less\u2014a standard considered appropriate to meet the dual needs of  ensuring security while maintaining national mobility.

Average peak wait times at the nation\u2019s  larger airports (category X and I) generally exceeded the wait time  standard, overall, although wait times were less than 10 minutes at certain  airports on certain days. According to TSA headquarters officials, if  airports are consistently exceeding the 10 minute wait time goal, it is the  responsibility of the Area Directors to reach out to the FSDs at those  airports in an effort to determine whether the root cause relates to  staffing, equipment, capacity, or some other issue and to take appropriate  remedial action.", "TSA officials cited capacity issues as a factor that contributed to category  X airports generally exceeding the 10-minute wait time goal during peak  periods, as shown in table 2.  These airports have higher screening  demand than smaller airports and sometimes lack the capacity, with  regard to space available for additional passenger lanes and baggage  screening areas, to process passengers and baggage quickly enough to  have lower wait times.

Therefore, TSA officials stated that,  just prior to the model\u2019s annual allocation run for fiscal year 2006, they  system ically solicitedat input from the industrial engineers assigned to the  more than 400 commercial airports to determine whether the model  contains correct information regarding the configuration of each airport.

With respect to annual and sick leave, 5  of the 14 FSDs stated that in their view the model did not adequately  account for this leave. Two FSDs stated that the use of the peak demand  month to account for training and leave, though sound in principle, is  particularly difficult for smaller airports because they do not have as fluctuation between their peak period and their non-peak period, which  leaves little cushion in the allocation to accommodate TSO absences from screening duties such as training and annual leave.", "TSA headquarters officials stated that TSA determined that using the 85th  percentile day concept would more than account for training, leave, and  other factors related to TSOs not being available for work because,  according to TSA, on only about 7 percent of days do passenger volumes  exceed it.

According to TSA, the national screening force is  generally deployed only to those airports experiencing significant staffing  shortfalls associated with increased seasonal traffic or when a special  event\u2014such as a Super Bowl or a large national conference\u2014occurs  requiring an immediate influx of additional, though temporary, TSO  support. Of the 14 FSDs we interviewed, 6 stated that they had used the  national screening force at least once.

As also shown in the  table, to help with hiring and retention of part-time TSOs, TSA is piloting a  program that offers full health benefits to part-time TSOs at six airports. A these airports, part-time TSOs receive the same health benefits as full-ti TSOs. At all other airports, part-time TSOs do not receive health benefits.  In addition to incentives and expanding health benefits, TSA is considering other options for attracting and retaining TSOs. For example, these  options include (1) parking allowances, (2) child care, (3) elder care, and  (4) tuition assistance.", "In addition to the national initiatives underway, several FSDs at the 14  airports we visited were implementing their own local initiatives to  address some of the staffing challenges they faced at their airports. For  example, after receiving local hiring authority under the nationwide local  hiring initiative, one FSD we spoke to stated that he puts brand-new TSO  hires out on the passenger lanes as \u201chelpers\u201d so that they may better  understand what the job entails. He expects that this will cut down on  attrition at his airport and help reduce wasted training resources for TSOs  who leave within short periods of being hired. Regarding absenteeism, all  the FSDs we spoke to stated that they monitored unscheduled absences  and counseled TSOs as needed. To help reduce the number of on the jobinjuries, 6 of the 14 FSDs we interviewed said they had local initiatives,  such as injury prevention committees and detailed instruction on safe  lifting techniques. To help mitigate inadequate numbers of part-time TSOs two TSA managers we interviewed said that they asked some of their fu ll- time TSOs to work \u201csplit\u201d shifts to cover demands in peak periods tha would normally go to part-time TSOs, one of whom might work the first  peak period shift and another who might work the second peak period  shift. The result was that it eliminated the staffing of full-time TSOs non-peak periods when they were most likely to be idle. The experience these managers illustrates an attempt at an efficient use of TSOs and also  the primary reason that TSA has tried to achieve a mix of 20 percent part- time to 80 percent full-time TSOs. Specifically, using part-time TSOs can  help to permit adequate staffing during peak periods while avoiding the  consequent overstaffing stemming from having the same number of TSOs  on duty during non-peak periods. Additionally, to maximize the flexibi lity  in staffing passenger and checked baggage screening checkpoints, 3 of the  10 FSDs whose TSOs were not all dual-trained stated that they were  working to increase the number of dual-trained TSOs\u2014TSOs trained and  certified in both pass 14 airports we visited already had dual-trained TSOs at the time of our  v enger and checked baggage screening.

Sabre takes th output and converts it into an full-time-equivalent figure and it determines  scheduling plans based on that figure (if the airport uses Sabre for  scheduling) using the 80/20 full-time/part-time TSO mix for category X and II airports."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA\u2019s Use of the Staffing Allocation Model", "paragraphs": ["TSA uses the Staffing Allocation Model in three different ways\u2014first, it is  run once a year to determine the staffing allocation for all airports (annual  allocation run). Second, it is run at other times to perform capacity  analysis for both lanes required and number and types of baggage  equipment required. Third, it is run at other times of the year where  airports can tweak certain aspects of the model for scheduling runs  without approval from TSA headquarters\u2014for example, to conduct \u201cwhat- if\u201d scheduling scenarios by changing different inputs, such as passenger  flow, or flight schedules. However, they cannot do so for an annual  allocation run unless TSA headquarters grants approval to change an  assumption for a specific airport. The baseline for an annual allocation run  always stays the same and cannot be changed by an airport without TSA  headquarters approval. TSA models each airport according to its unique  configuration\u2014that is, no two airports are modeled the same because no  two airports look the same (nor do they have the same airline traffic  profile). FSDs and their staffs typically meet with airline carriers on a  continuing basis to obtain updated flight schedules. The scheduling runs to  determine TSO schedules incorporate these updated flight schedules  whereas, the fiscal runs to determine overall full-time-equivalent  allocation, using peak month passenger volumes from historical flight  data. If the historical flight schedule used for an annual allocation run is  significantly different from current flight schedules at an airport (e.g., a  new airline carrier joins the airport), the FSD can submit an appeal to TSA  headquarters to re-run the model using the current flight schedule in order  to obtain a more accurate staffing allocation for his or her airport. (This  has been done on an annual basis or when a significant change in the  airport\u2019s flight schedule occurs.) Unlike for annual allocation runs,  updated flight schedules are used more frequently for scheduling runs at  the local airports without headquarters intervention. elements and assumptions are accurate for their airports and bringing to  headquarters\u2019 attention any factors that should be reviewed to determine changes to the model for their airports may be appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Brian J.
