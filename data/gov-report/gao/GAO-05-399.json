Researchers have sought to develop a microbicide--a substance to help users protect themselves against HIV. In the mid-1980s, researchers found that Nonoxynol-9 (N-9), a spermicide found in various contraceptive products, showed potential as a microbicide. However, more recent studies raised concerns that N-9 may increase certain users' risk of contracting HIV. GAO was asked to describe federal agencies' and contraceptive product manufacturers' actions related to N-9 and HIV. In this report, GAO reviewed (1) the efforts by federal agencies and manufacturers of contraceptive products to assess the safety of N-9 and its effectiveness as a microbicide for preventing HIV transmission and (2) the information provided to the public about the safety of N-9 and its effectiveness as a microbicide. GAO reviewed journal articles, Federal Register notices, product packaging, educational materials, and other documents. GAO also interviewed officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH), and selected manufacturers of N-9 contraceptive products."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies have undertaken a variety of efforts to research N-9 as a potential microbicide--including conducting, funding, or reviewing studies on the safety and effectiveness of N-9. In the 1990s, CDC and NIH conducted and funded research on the effectiveness and safety of N-9 as a microbicide to prevent HIV infection. For example, in 1996 CDC and others began a 4-year study on the effectiveness of an N-9 vaginal contraceptive product in preventing the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV. The results of the research by the agencies during this period were inconsistent--some research indicated that N-9 reduced the incidence of HIV while other research suggested that frequent use of N-9 may increase the risk of contracting the virus. Then in 2000, the preliminary results of a major clinical study suggested more strongly that N-9 vaginal contraceptive products did not prevent HIV infection and may increase the risk of infection among frequent users. As a result of the study, CDC and NIH stopped conducting and funding research on N-9 as a microbicide out of concern for participants' safety. FDA continued to review available research on the safety of N-9 as part of its regulation of vaginal contraceptive products and, in 2003, proposed new warning labels for N-9 vaginal contraceptive products. As of March 2005, FDA was also in the process of developing a proposal for new warning labels for N-9 condoms. As of that date, FDA had not finalized the new warning labels for N-9 vaginal contraceptive products and had not proposed new warning labels for N-9 condoms. Representatives from two manufacturers of N-9 contraceptive products have reviewed research on N-9's safety for the purpose of commenting on FDA's proposed warning labels. The information CDC and FDA have provided to the public about the use of N-9 as a microbicide has been, at times, inconsistent. In the early 1990s, CDC cautioned that there was insufficient information to conclude that N-9 may prevent HIV transmission. By 1998, in response to new research, the agency informed the public that N-9 vaginal contraceptive products did not prevent HIV. During the same period, FDA also cautioned that N-9 had not been proven to prevent HIV transmission, but in 1999, a brochure posted on its Web site stated that N-9, along with a condom, may be used to prevent HIV transmission. By 2000, CDC had responded to new research findings and had revised its educational publications to state that N-9 may actually increase the risk of contracting HIV when used frequently. In contrast, FDA did not revise the brochure on its Web site that stated that some experts believe N-9 may prevent HIV and suggested using N-9 along with a condom. FDA left this information on its Web site until these statements were deleted in September 2003 when FDA officials realized the information was inconsistent with proposed warning labels. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) provided clarification that GAO incorporated where appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Preventing the transmission of HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, is an  important public health challenge.

In 1988, the Surgeon General, in  collaboration with CDC, distributed brochures to 107 million U.S.  households that stated that based on laboratory tests, condoms with N-9  may provide additional protection against HIV.  Around this time, it was  also widely reported in newspapers and journals that it was advisable to  use contraceptive products with N-9 because it might help prevent HIV.   However, more recent studies have raised concerns that N-9 vaginal  contraceptive products may not be effective against HIV and may in fact  increase certain users\u2019 risk of contracting the virus.  Public health  organizations have also expressed concerns that consumers may use  condoms lubricated with N-9 (N-9 condoms) for anal intercourse in order  to protect themselves against HIV without knowing the degree to which the  use of such condoms may put them at risk.  Because of the potential risks  involved, the use of N-9 is an important public health issue\u2014one that  involves CDC, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the National  Institutes of Health (NIH) and their research, regulatory actions, or efforts  to educate the public about N-9 and HIV.", "You asked us to describe federal agencies\u2019 and contraceptive product  manufacturers\u2019 actions related to N-9 and HIV.

For example, in 1996, CDC and others began a major 4-year study on the  effectiveness of N-9 vaginal contraceptive products in preventing the  transmission of STDs, including HIV, among female sex workers located in  four countries.  In addition, CDC compiled a bibliography of research on  potential microbicides conducted through September 1996.  Containing  abstracts of over 55 safety and effectiveness studies and other reviews of  N-9 vaginal contraceptive products and N-9 condoms, the bibliography was  intended as a resource for clinicians, researchers, and public health  specialists interested in microbicide research.", "Like CDC, NIH conducted and funded research during the 1990s on N-9\u2019s  safety and effectiveness as a microbicide.

This meeting included  presentations on a wide variety of published and unpublished research,  including laboratory studies of N-9 and clinical studies on N-9 vaginal  contraceptive products.

Throughout the 1990s, various reviews in clinical journals also  characterized the results of research on N-9 as inconsistent.  For example,  a 1995 review in the journal AIDS noted the existence of \u201csubstantially different opinions\u201d about the safety and effectiveness of N-9 when used for  HIV prevention.  Similarly, a 1999 commentary in the American Journal  of Public Health noted that epidemiologic studies on N-9 were conflicting.", "During the 1990s, reviewers of studies involving N-9 observed that several  factors may have accounted for the inconsistency of the research results.   For example, studies varied in terms of the dosage of N-9 and the chemical  formulation of the contraceptive product used.  Additionally, the  different populations studied may have affected the outcomes of the  research.  For example, some studies were based on the experience of sex  workers, who used N-9 vaginal contraceptive products with relatively  higher frequency than the populations in other studies.

The COL-1492 study compared the use of an N-9  vaginal contraceptive gel called COL-1492 to a vaginal moisturizer without  N-9 among 892 sex workers in Benin, Cote d\u2019Ivoire, South Africa, and  Thailand.  The preliminary results of this study indicated that the incidence  of HIV infection among users of the N-9 vaginal contraceptive gel was 48  percent higher than among users of the moisturizer without N-9.  Moreover,  the study showed there was little effect of N-9 vaginal contraceptive use on  the incidence of certain other STD infections, such as gonorrhea and  chlamydia.

Another large manufacturer of condoms reported  that the percentage of N-9 condoms sold on the retail market declined from  2000 to 2003.", "Like SSL International, PPFA and a leading distributor\u2014Mayer  Laboratories\u2014have also stopped manufacturing and distributing N-9  condoms.  A representative from PPFA told us that the organization  stopped manufacturing N-9 condoms in June 2002 because of safety  concerns based on published scientific studies indicating that N-9 does not  protect against HIV and that frequent N-9 use may actually increase HIV  transmission.  In addition, a representative from PPFA stated that its  decision to halt production of N-9 condoms was influenced by the release  of the conclusions of the WHO/CONRAD report and the outcome of a  meeting with public health entities organized by the Global Campaign for  Microbicides.  Another public health organization, the Gay Men\u2019s Health  Clinic in New York, has also begun to recommend that clients not use N-9  condoms.  As of early in 2003, a distributor\u2014Mayer Laboratories\u2014stopped  distributing N-9 condoms.  Information from Mayer Laboratories stated  that this decision was based on a concern about the safety of N-9 condoms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["CDC\u2019s and NIH\u2019s efforts to research N-9\u2019s potential use as a microbicide  ended in 2000, when the preliminary results of a major clinical trial  indicated that N-9 may actually increase the risk of contracting HIV.  CDC  has warned that N-9 may increase the risk of HIV transmission when used  frequently, and some manufacturers of N-9 condoms have taken steps to  either add their own warning labels or remove their N-9 condoms from the  market, while other manufacturers have not taken such steps.  FDA has  proposed requiring new warning labels that indicate that N-9 vaginal  contraceptive products do not protect against HIV or other STDs and that  frequent use, such as more than once a day, may increase the risk of  contracting HIV.  FDA is also developing proposed warning labels for N-9  condoms.  While FDA expects to issue the final rule for the new warning  labels for vaginal contraceptive products by September 2005, it has not yet  issued proposed warning labels for N-9 condoms, and it has not indicated a  target date to issue the final warning labels for N-9 condoms.  Since FDA is  still in the process of completing warning label changes for N-9 vaginal  contraceptive products and condoms, the public may be left in doubt about  the appropriate uses of these products until FDA finalizes these warnings.   Further, the public may be at risk if the products are used inappropriately."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["HHS provided written comments on a draft of this report. (See app. II).", "In its written comments, HHS stated that the final sentence in the draft  report\u2014that said the public may be at risk until FDA finalizes the warning  labels for N-9 vaginal contraceptive products and N-9 condoms\u2014may  unintentionally undermine efforts to inform the public of the protection  provided by condoms.  HHS suggested we modify this to say that  consumers may be left in doubt about the appropriate uses of these  products.  We have revised the conclusion to acknowledge that until FDA  finalizes its warning labels, consumers may be left in doubt about the  appropriate uses of these products.  However, the conclusion also states  that the public may be at risk if the products are used inappropriately.", "In its written comments, HHS stated that the draft did not indicate that  FDA had never permitted condom labeling to claim that N-9 provides any  additional protection against HIV or other STDs.  To ensure clarity on this  issue, we have added this statement to the report.  HHS\u2019s written comments  also stated that it is important to make clear that the barrier features of  condoms provide the primary protection against STDs and the primary  contraceptive protection.  While this is an important fact in educating  consumers about methods to protect themselves against STDs, the  objectives of this report were focused on N-9 and its potential as a  microbicide.", "HHS\u2019s written comments also stated that FDA\u2019s primary means of public  health communication is through product labeling oversight and that FDA  has, on occasion, provided supplementary information through consumer  outreach efforts.  The draft report noted the role FDA has in labeling  oversight and described FDA\u2019s proposed warning labels for N-9 vaginal  contraceptive products and its efforts to develop proposed warning labels  for N-9 condoms.  The draft report also described the information FDA  provided to the public through a brochure that it posted to its Web site and  through FDA Consumer magazine articles.  HHS\u2019s written comments also  stated that the supplementary statements FDA provided to the public  through consumer outreach efforts always acknowledged the scientific  uncertainty concerning the effectiveness of N-9 as a protection against  STDs.  Examples of FDA\u2019s acknowledgement of scientific uncertainty were  provided in the draft report.", "HHS also commented that the timeline in appendix I should begin with the  1988 CDC brochure Understanding AIDS, which advised that N-9, when  used with a condom, might provide additional protection against HIV.  We  mentioned this brochure in the introduction to the draft report when we  stated that in the mid-1980s N-9 showed promise as a potential microbicide  for STDs, including HIV.  However, as we stated in the scope and  methodology section of the draft report, we focused our review on efforts  to research and provide public information on N-9 and HIV from 1990 to the  present because concerns about the safety of N-9 in preventing HIV first  began to surface in about 1990.  Further, HHS commented that the timeline  should make clear that the first indication that N-9 presented added risks  did not emerge until 2000 (the COL-1492 study).  However, this study was  not the first indication that N-9 presented added risks, and the draft report  discussed earlier concerns.", "HHS\u2019s written comments also made a number of other suggestions to  clarify the draft report, which we incorporated.  First, HHS suggested that  we clearly indicate in the report when we are discussing vaginal  contraceptive products containing N-9, condoms with N-9, or both.  We  have reviewed the report for clarity and made changes where necessary.   Second, HHS\u2019s comments stated that much of the research discussed in the  report was restricted to vaginal contraceptive products and that these  studies did not involve N-9 condoms.  We have clarified this point in the  report.  Finally, HHS\u2019s comments stated that the 1999 FDA brochure  Condoms and Sexually Transmitted Diseases . . . Especially AIDS was an  Internet posting of a brochure initially issued in 1990. We clarified the text  of our report to note that the Web site posting was of a brochure originally  issued in 1990 and that the document stated the information was current as  of December 2, 1999.  We also added the 1990 brochure to the timeline in  appendix I.", "HHS included several other comments.  First, HHS stated that we should be  clear that N-9 condoms are regulated as medical devices not through the  monograph process.  This information was discussed in the background  section of the draft report.  Second, HHS\u2019s written comments stated that  the report should recognize that some manufacturers stopped selling  condoms with N-9 because of economic considerations and not safety  concerns.  This information was included in the draft report and we noted  further that one manufacturer attributed the decrease in sales of N-9  condoms to the safety concerns raised by the 2002 release of the  WHO/CONDRAD report.  Third, HHS raised concerns that the draft report  had not explained the significance of the actions of manufacturers.  This  information was included in the draft report.  Finally, HHS\u2019s comments said  we should note that the report on the COL-1492 study was published in  2002 and the information available prior to that time could be considered  only preliminary.  This information was also reflected in the draft report  and in the timeline in appendix I.", "HHS\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II.  HHS also provided technical  comments, which we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days from  its date.
