At a hearing held by the House Committee on Science on March 26, 2003, witnesses raised concern about the length of time it takes for science students and scholars to obtain a visa and about losing top international students to other countries due to delays in the visa process. GAO reviewed 1) how long it takes a science student or scholar from another country to obtain a visa and the factors contributing to the length of time, and 2) what measures are under way to improve the process and decrease the number of pending cases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State Department (State) data are not available on how long it takes for a science student or scholar to obtain a visa. While State has not set specific criteria or time frames for how long the visa process should take, its goal is to adjudicate visas as quickly as possible, consistent with immigration laws and homeland security objectives. During this review, GAO found that the time it takes to adjudicate a visa depends largely on whether an applicant must undergo a security check known as Visas Mantis, which is designed to protect against sensitive technology transfers. Based on a random sample of Visas Mantis cases for science students and scholars sent from posts between April and June 2003, GAO found it took an average of 67 days for the security check to be processed and for State to notify the post. In addition, GAO's visits to posts in China, India, and Russia in September 2003 showed that many Visas Mantis cases had been pending 60 days or more. GAO also found that the way in which Visas Mantis information was disseminated at headquarters made it difficult to resolve some of these cases expeditiously. Furthermore, consular staff at posts GAO visited said they were unsure whether they were contributing to lengthy waits because they lacked clear guidance on when to apply Visas Mantis checks and did not receive feedback on whether they were providing enough information in their Visas Mantis requests. Another factor that may effect the time taken to adjudicate visas for science students and scholars is the wait for an interview. The wait time at posts GAO visited was generally 2 to 3 weeks but could be longer depending on the time of the year. While State and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials acknowledged there have been lengthy waits, they report having measures under way that they believe will improve the process and that they are collaborating to identify and resolve outstanding Visas Mantis cases. In addition, State officials told GAO they have invested about $1 million to upgrade the technology for sending Visas Mantis requests. According to State officials, the new system will help to reduce the time it takes to process Visas Mantis cases. But despite State's plans to improve the Visas Mantis process, challenges remain. For example, the FBI's systems will not immediately be interoperable with State's. GAO was unable to assess State's new system since it was not yet functioning at the time of the review."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each year thousands of international science students and scholars apply  for visas to enter the United States to participate in education and  exchange programs.

Thus, data are not available to  report how long it takes science applicants to obtain a visa. However, we  identified a security review procedure as the factor most likely to affect  the timeliness of science student and scholar applicant visas.  Consequently, we focused our review on the length of time it takes an  applicant to acquire a visa if he or she must undergo a security review.  Using State documents, we were able to compile data on science  applicants for this analysis. We also reviewed relevant documents and  interviewed officials at the Departments of State and Homeland Security  and at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in Washington, D.C.

Visa applicants  generally begin the visa process by scheduling a visa interview. On the  day of the appointment, a consular officer reviews the application, checks  the applicant\u2019s name in the Consular Lookout and Support System  (CLASS), and interviews the applicant. Based on the interview and a  review of pertinent documents, the consular officer determines if the  applicant is eligible for nonimmigrant status under the Immigration and  Nationality Act. If the consular officer then determines that the applicant  is eligible to receive a visa, the applicant is notified right away and he or  she usually receives the visa within 24 hours.", "In some cases, the consular officer decides that the applicant will need a  Security Advisory Opinion (SAO), which provides an opinion or clearance  from Washington on whether to issue a visa to the applicant. SAOs are  required for a number of reasons, including concerns that a visa applicant  may engage in the illegal transfer of sensitive technology. An SAO based  on sensitive technology transfer concerns is known as a Visas Mantis and,  according to State officials, is the most common type of SAO applied to  science applicants. It is also the most common type of SAO sent from  most of the posts we visited in China, Russia, and India.", "In deciding if a Visas Mantis check is needed, the consular officer  determines whether the applicant\u2019s background or proposed activity in the  United States could involve exposure to technologies on the Technology  Alert List (TAL). The list includes science and technology-related fields  where, if knowledge gained from research or work in these fields were  used against the United States, it could potentially be harmful. If a Visas  Mantis is needed, the consular officer generally informs the applicant that  his or her visa is being temporarily refused under Section 221(g) of the  U.S. Immigration and Nationality Act, pending receipt of security  clearance.", "After a consular officer decides that a Visas Mantis is necessary for an  applicant, several steps are taken to resolve the process. The officer drafts  a Visas Mantis cable, which contains information from the applicant\u2019s  application and interview. The cable is then generally reviewed by a  consular section chief or other consular official at post, who then  approves the Visas Mantis cable for transmission to Washington for an  interagency security check. Once the cable is sent, the State Department\u2019s  Bureau of Nonproliferation, the FBI, and other agencies review the  information in the cable and provide a response on the applicant to the  Consular Affairs section of State headquarters. The Bureau of  Nonproliferation and other agencies are given 15 working days to respond  to State with any objections. However, State has agreed to wait for a  response from the FBI before proceeding with each Visas Mantis case.", "State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs receives all agency responses pertaining  to an applicant, summarizes them, and prepares a response to the consular  posts. A cable is then transmitted to the post which indicates that State  does or does not have an objection to issuing the visa, or that more  information is needed. Generally, a consular official at post reviews the  cable and, based on the information from Washington, decides whether to  issue the visa to the applicant. The officer then notifies the applicant that  the visa has been issued or denied, or that more information is needed.  According to consular officials, in the vast majority of the cases the visa is  approved. However, even when the visa is issued, the information  provided by the consular posts on certain visa applicants is very useful to  certain agencies in guarding against illegal technology transfer. As a result,  according to the State Department, the Visas Mantis program provides  State and other interested agencies with an effective mechanism to screen  out those individuals who seek to evade or violate laws governing the  export of goods, technology, or sensitive information.

The sample of 71 cases is a probability sample,  and results from the data in this sample project to the universe of the 2,888  science visa applications. We found that visas for science students and  scholars took on average 67 days from the date the Visas Mantis cable  was submitted from post to the date State sent a response to the post.  This is slightly longer than 2 months per application, on average. In the  sample, 67 of the visa applications completed processing and approval by  December 3, 2003. In addition, 3 of the 67 completed applications had  processing times in excess of 180 days. Four of the cases in our sample of  71 remained pending as of December 3, 2003.

For the first sample, the data show that 58 percent of the cases were  completed within 30 days; for the second sample, the data show that 52  percent were completed within this time frame.

We found that in fiscal year 2003,  some Visas Mantis cases did not always reach their intended recipient and,  as a result, some of the security checks were delayed. For example, we  followed up with the FBI on 14 outstanding cases from some of the posts  we visited in China in September 2003 to see if it had received and  processed the cases. FBI officials provided information indicating that  they had no record of 3 of the cases, they had responded to State on 8  cases, and they were still reviewing 3 cases. FBI officials stated that the  most likely reasons why they did not have a record of the 3 cases from  State were due to cable formatting errors and duplicate cases that were  rejected from the FBI database. State did not comment on the status of  the 14 cases we provided to the FBI for review. However, a Consular  Affairs official told us that in fall 2003, there were about 700 Visas Mantis  cases sent from Beijing that did not reach the FBI for the security check.  The official did not know how the cases got lost but told us that it took  Consular Affairs about a month to identify that there was a problem and  provide the FBI with the cases. As a result, several hundred visa  applications were delayed for another month.", "Figure 2 illustrates some of the time-consuming factors in the Visas Mantis  process for our sample of 71 cases. While the FBI received most of the  cases from State within a day, 7 cases took a month or more, most likely  because they had been improperly formatted and thus were rejected by  the FBI\u2019s system. In more than half of the cases, the FBI was able to  complete the clearance process the same day, but some cases took more  than 100 days. These cases may have taken longer because (1) the FBI  had to investigate the case or request additional information from State;  (2) the FBI had to locate files in field offices, because not all of its name  check files are electronic; or (3) the case was a duplicate, which the FBI\u2019s  name check system also rejects. In most of the cases, the FBI was able to  send a response\u2014which it generally does in batches of name checks, not  by individual case\u2014to State within a week. The FBI provides the results of  name checks for Visas Mantis cases to State on computer compact disks  (CDs), which could cause delays. In December 2003, a FBI official told us  that these CDs were provided to State twice a week. However, in the past,  the CDs were provided to State on a less frequent basis. In addition, it  takes time for data to be entered into State\u2019s systems once State receives  the information. In the majority of our sample cases, it took State 2 weeks  or longer to inform post that it could issue a visa. State officials were  unable to explain why it took State this long to respond to post. Officials  told us that the time frame could be due to a lack of resources at  headquarters or because State was waiting for a response from agencies  other than the FBI.

However, consular  officers told us that they would like the guidance to be simplified\u2014for  example, by expressing some scientific terms in more comprehensible  language. Several consular officers also told us they had only a limited  understanding of the Visas Mantis process, including how long the process  takes. They told us they would like to have better information on how long  a Visas Mantis check is taking so that they can more accurately inform the  applicant of the expected wait.

Furthermore, post officials in Chennai, India, told us that the interview  wait time was as long as 12 weeks during the summer of 2003 when the  demand for visas was greater than the resources available at post to  adjudicate a visa. Officials at some of the posts we visited indicated they  did not have enough space and staffing resources to handle interview  demands and the new visa requirement. Factors such as the time of year  an applicant applies for a visa, the appointment requirements, and the  staffing situation at posts generally affect how long an applicant will have  to wait for an interview.", "All the posts we visited had high and low seasons in which the visa  application volume fluctuated.

By contrast, Chennai saw an average of  10,000 visa applicants in October during these same years. During the  summer months of 2003, the high demand for visas was compounded by  the new visa interview requirement State established in May 2003. The  new requirement, which went into effect on August 1, 2003, states that,  with a few exceptions, all foreign individuals seeking to visit the United  States need to be interviewed prior to receiving a visa.

According to a survey conducted by a national  scientific organization, applicants from 26 different countries, most  notably Russia and China, have been delayed or prevented from entering  the United States. Another survey conducted by a national educational  association reported that hundreds of students and scholars experienced  delays in receiving a visa or were denied a visa. According to several  surveys, scientific research was postponed, jobs were left unstaffed, and  conferences and meetings were missed as a result of the delays."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Officials Cite Improvements", "paragraphs": ["FBI and State officials acknowledged that lengthy visa waits have been a  problem, but said they are implementing improvements to the process and  working to decrease the number of pending Visas Mantis cases.  Improvements include implementation of customer service initiatives,  coordination between agencies to identify and resolve outstanding cases,  and upgrades in information systems. In addition, State and FBI officials  told us that the validity of Visas Mantis checks for students and scholars  has been extended to 12 months.", "State, FBI, and consular officials at posts have made customer service  improvements related to Visas Mantis checks that allow them to address  questions and provide information to people inquiring about a status of a  visa case. For example, consular officials at some of the posts we visited  told us that they have established inquiry lines at post for visa applicants  to check the status of their case and remind consular officials that their  case is still pending. This also helps consular officers to monitor cases that  have been outstanding. In addition, State set up an inquiry desk at the  beginning of 2003, and the FBI set one up during the summer of 2003 to  accommodate calls from the public about the status of pending visa  applications that have been submitted for Visas Mantis checks. State has  set up a separate e-mail address for inquiries from agencies involved in  Visas Mantis processing. Consular Affairs officials also told us they have  set up an inquiry line where post officials can obtain additional  information on outstanding cases. However, some post officials told us  that they would still like more information on how long the Visas Mantis  check takes.", "Officials from State\u2019s Consular Affairs and the FBI told us they are  coordinating efforts to identify and resolve outstanding Visas Mantis cases.  For example, Consular Affairs officials have been working with FBI  officials on a case-by-case basis to make sure that cases outstanding for  several months to a year are completed. However, State officials said they  do not have a target date for completion of all the outstanding cases,  which they estimated at 1,000 in November 2003. According to these  officials, while about 350 of these outstanding cases required further  review or more information, State has not yet begun working to reconcile  them.", "FBI officials also told us that to address some of the delays on their end,  such as those that occur due to problems with lost case files or inoperable  systems, the FBI has taken several actions to improve its Visas Mantis  clearance process. For example, the officials indicated that the FBI is  working on automating its files and setting up a common database  between the field offices and headquarters. FBI officials also told us that  they have set up a tracking system for all SAOs, including Visas Mantis  cases. In addition, they said the FBI has established new procedures to  deal with name check files the agency cannot locate within a certain  amount of time. In a July 2003 letter to State, the FBI said it would notify  State after 90 days that it could proceed with visa processing in the event  that the FBI could not locate relevant files and there were no security  concerns.", "Consular Affairs officials told us that State has invested about $1 million  on a new information management system that it said would reduce the  time it takes to process Visas Mantis cases. They described the new  system as a mechanism that would help strengthen the accountability of  Visas Mantis clearance requests and responses, establish consistency in  data collection, and improve data exchange between State and other  agencies involved in the clearance process. In addition, officials said the  system would allow them to improve overall visa statistical reporting  capabilities and data integrity for Visas Mantis cases. The new system will  be paperless, which means that the current system of requesting Visas  Mantis clearances by cable will be eliminated. Through an  intergovernmental network known as the Open Source Information  System, the new system will allow most government agencies involved in  the Visas Mantis process, such as the FBI, to obtain visa applicant  information and coordinate Visas Mantis responses. State officials told us  that the system is on schedule for release early this year, and that the  portion relating to SAOs will be operational sometime later this year.  However, challenges remain. FBI officials told us that the name check  component of the FBI\u2019s system would not immediately be interoperable  with State\u2019s new system, but that they are actively working with State to  seek solutions to this problem. However, FBI and State have not  determined how the information will be transmitted in the meantime. We  were not able to assess the new system since it was not yet functioning at  the time of our review.", "In addition to improvements to the Visas Mantis process, State officials  told us that they are taking some actions to continue to monitor the  resource needs at post. To alleviate concerns about staffing, Consular  Affairs officials told us that temporary adjudicating officers are sent to the  posts as needed. These officials also told us that State added 66 new  officers in 2003 and plans to add an additional 80 in 2004. However, the  decision to add these new officers was made before the new August 2003  interview requirements were implemented and thus it is unknown if there  are enough resources for the task at hand. In addition, post officials told  us that State plans to expand some consular sections, such as in Chennai,  India, where the consulate is scheduled to undergo an expansion in spring  2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Agency officials recognize that the process for issuing a visa to a science  student or scholar can be an important tool to control the transfer of  technology that could put the United States at risk. They also acknowledge  that if the process is lengthy, students and scholars with science  backgrounds might decide not to come to the United States, and  technological advancements that serve U.S. and global interests could be  jeopardized. Our analysis of a sample of Visas Mantis cases from April to  June 2003 show that some applicants faced lengthy waits. While the State  Department and the FBI report improvements in visa processing times,  our analysis of data from the posts we visited in September 2003 and our  contact with post officials in January 2004 show that there are still some  instances of lengthy waits. State\u2019s and FBI\u2019s implementation of the Visas  Mantis process still has gaps that are causing lengthy waits for visas.  Consular officers believe that if they receive clearer guidance and  feedback on Visas Mantis cases, they could help reduce the time it takes  for Washington to process applications and provide better information to  applicants. Finally, State and FBI do not have interoperable systems that  would help complete security checks of visa applicants more quickly.

State indicated that it had taken a number of recent actions to  improve the Visas Mantis process that we believe are positive steps in  implementing our recommendation. For example, State said that it has  started to provide feedback to posts regarding the information contained  in Visas Mantis cables and is providing expanded briefings on the Visas  Mantis process to new consular officers at the National Foreign Affairs  Training Center. State also said that it would study our recommendation to  explore possibilities for further improvements to the Visas Mantis security  check process.", "State emphasized the importance of the Visas Mantis clearance process in  protecting U.S. national security and acknowledged that in the past some  visa applicants have been required to wait long periods to obtain a visa.  However, as a result of recent improvements, State claims that most  security checks are now being completed within 30 days and therefore our  analysis of Visas Mantis cases from April to June 2003 does not represent  current processing times. State commented that it had recently conducted  two samples of Visas Mantis cases that show improvements in processing  times. However, we were unable to independently validate either sample.  In addition, the data for both samples show that lengthy waits remain for  some cases. Moreover, because State\u2019s sample selection methods were  different from ours, and because its samples would have a wide margin of  error, its samples cannot demonstrate improvements in processing times.  Thus we are not in a position to conclude that the Visas Mantis processing  turnaround times have improved.", "The Federal Bureau of Investigation did not comment on our  recommendation. The FBI acknowledged that the visa program was  overwhelmed in the summer of 2002. However, the FBI believes that it is  now processing the name checks more quickly and today only a few  applicants encounter a significant wait for the FBI to complete the  security review process. The FBI indicated that it is working closely with  State and other agencies to improve the Visas Mantis process.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 7 days from the  report date.

We  reviewed the Immigration and Nationality Act and associated legislation,  the State Department\u2019s Foreign Affairs Manual, and cables and other  related documents from State\u2019s Bureau of Consular Affairs. In addition, we  reviewed State\u2019s data on visa applications and issuances worldwide and  for selected posts. We also requested data from State to conduct a sample  of Visas Mantis cases to help us determine the number of science students  and scholars that were undergoing a Visas Mantis security check and how  long those applicants waited for a visa. In Washington, we interviewed  officials from the Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Justice.  At State, we met with officials from the Bureau of Consular Affairs, the  Bureau of Nonproliferation, the Office of the Science and Technology  Adviser to the Secretary, and the Office of Science and Cooperation in the  Bureau of Oceans and International Environmental and Scientific Affairs.  At the Department of Homeland Security, we met with officials from the  Directorate of Border Transportation and the Office of Policy and  Planning. At the Department of Justice, we met with officials from the  Federal Bureau of Investigation\u2019s Name Check Unit and country desk  officers for China and Russia. We requested meetings with officials from  the Central Intelligence Agency and the White House Office of Science and  Technology Policy (OSTP), but they declined to meet with us. However,  OSTP provided us with written answers to questions pertaining to its  involvement in visa policies for science students and scholars.", "Based on our review of State Department data systems regarding visas, we  determined that visa data are collected for students (F visas) and for  exchange visitors (J visas), but State\u2019s data systems do not track science  applicants within these categories. Thus, data are not available to report  how long it takes science applicants to obtain a visa. However, agency  officials identified a special security review procedure known as Visas  Mantis as the factor most likely to affect the timeliness of science student  and scholar applicant visas. Consequently, we focused our review on the  length of time it takes an applicant to acquire a visa if he or she must  undergo a security review. Using State documents, we were able to  compile data on science applicants for this analysis.", "To obtain data for our sample of Visas Mantis cases, we asked State in July  2003 to provide us all the incoming Visas Mantis cables for the first 6  months of 2003. State indicated that our request would yield  approximately 9,000 cables, and that such a large volume would be too  time consuming to compile. To address State\u2019s concern, we requested  Visas Mantis cables from April 1 through June 30, 2003. We requested  these 3 months because they were the most recent months from our initial  request and would include some of the summer student visa applicants.  Because Consular Affairs did not have electronic, aggregated data on Visas  Mantis cases, they provided us with 5,079 hard copy cables submitted  during that time period. We reviewed the cables to determine which ones  pertained to a science student or scholar or other categories, including  business. The science student and research scholar category included  applicants studying at universities or conducting research at universities,  national laboratories, and medical centers. We included applicants  attending conferences, symposiums, workshops, and meetings hosted or  sponsored by universities, professional institutes, and other organizations.  We did not include in our sample universe business-related cables, cables  that were incomplete, and cables that were duplicates.", "We entered all the data from the cables into an Excel spreadsheet, gave  each a GAO number for control and identification purposes, and verified  that there were no duplicates. We ended up with 2,888 Visas Mantis entries  in the Excel database. From these 2,888 Visas Mantis cases, we took a  computer-generated random sample of 124 cases and requested further  data on those cases and their time frames from State. State replied that our  request was too labor intensive and asked that we modify it. Therefore, we  took a smaller subsample of 71 cases from the 124.", "Of the 71 cases we received from State, 67 were processed by December 3,  2003. Four cases were still pending. The 71 cases yielded an average  completion time of 67 days. This estimate is accurate to within plus or  minus 17 days at the 95 percent level of confidence. We assessed the  reliability of the sample data provided by State by tracing a statistically  random sample of data to source documents. We determined that the data  was sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "State created its own two randomly selected samples of Visas Mantis  cases. However, based on the documentation of how these records were  selected, GAO was not able to determine whether these were scientifically  valid samples whose results project to the entire population of all science  student and scholar visa applications. As such, results reported by the  agency from these application records should be treated as testimonial  information from a judgmental sample rather than data from a probability  sample.", "We conducted fieldwork at seven visa-issuing posts in three countries\u2014 China, India, and Russia. We chose these countries because they are  leading places of origin for international science students and scholars  visiting the United States. We limited our review to nonimmigrant visa  applicants. During our visits at all of these posts, we observed visa  operations, reviewed selected Visas Mantis data, and interviewed consular  staff about visa adjudication procedures.
