The federal government has signed treaties with or taken other actions to  recognize Indian tribes, although some tribes have never developed a  formal relationship with the federal government. Changes in federal  Indian policy throughout U.S. history have influenced which tribes are  recognized today by the federal government.

On the basis of our interviews with state officials we determined  that 12 of the 15 states had state-recognized tribes. For the other  33 states, we largely relied on information provided by these states to  Interior\u2019s Indian Arts and Crafts Board. According to this information,  these states had identified no state-recognized tribes within their borders  that were not also federally recognized.

For each  program we identified as having awarded funding to non-federally  recognized tribes for this period, we reviewed the authorizing statutes,  program regulations, and eligibility requirements to identify the key means  by which non-federally recognized tribes would have been eligible for  federal funding from these programs. In addition, we collected information  about the organizational and legal status of each entity and compared this  information with program eligibility requirements. For example, we  determined which of these non-federally recognized tribes are also  organized as nonprofit organizations. When a non-federally recognized  tribe was eligible to receive federal funding from a program through  several means, we did not attempt to single out the means by which the  tribe qualified for the funding it received. We limited the scope of our  review to federal funding awarded directly to non-federally recognized  tribes and excluded federal funding provided through loans or  procurement contracts.", "From the information we obtained from USAspending.gov and from the  federal agencies, we compiled the total amount of federal funding  awarded to non-federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through  2010, by agency and program. We assessed the reliability of this  information by, for example, testing for missing data and outliers and  comparing USAspending.gov data against agency information and  financial reports filed by selected non-federally recognized tribes. Where  we identified inconsistencies in these data, we worked with  knowledgeable agency officials to update the data set. After taking these  steps, we concluded that the updated data set was reliable for the  purpose of estimating the amount of funding awarded by federal agencies  to non-federally recognized tribes for fiscal years 2007 through 2010.", "During our review, as we were comparing programs\u2019 eligibility  requirements with the characteristics of the non-federally recognized  tribes that received federal funding, we identified some instances where  federal agencies had made grants to likely ineligible non-federally  recognized tribes and where an agency had initiated actions to enforce  federal financial reporting requirements.

The Act of February 8, 1887, commonly referred to  as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Act, was a comprehensive  congressional attempt to change the role of Indians in American  society by encouraging assimilation through individual land  ownership.

Some of these 12 states\u2014such as North  Carolina and South Carolina\u2014have formalized their procedures for  recognizing tribes, while other states\u2014such as Massachusetts\u2014have not.  For example, North Carolina\u2019s Commission of Indian Affairs and South  Carolina\u2019s Commission for Minority Affairs have promulgated regulations  outlining the process for entities seeking recognition in those states.  Furthermore, some states have established state reservations that are  not also federal Indian reservations. No federal agency maintains a list of  state-recognized tribes and their reservations, but the U.S. Census  Bureau collected information about state-recognized tribes as part of its  effort to designate American Indian Areas for the Decennial Census of  2010.

Education stated that its  interpretation of the term \u201creservation\u201d was reasonable and that we  should defer to its interpretation. However, for the reasons detailed in the  report, we continue to have substantial questions about whether  Education reasonably interpreted the statutory definition of \u201creservation\u201d  for the American Indian Vocational Rehabilitation Services grant program  to include tribal service areas. We note that Education\u2019s interpretation  effectively rewrites the statute to allow tribes to unilaterally self-define a  reservation and then apply for a grant.

In  addition, this report provides information about some cases we identified  during our work concerning non-federally recognized tribes\u2019 eligibility for  funding and compliance with federal financial reporting requirements.", "Because no comprehensive list of non-federally recognized tribes exists,  we first compiled a list of about 400 such tribes in the contiguous  48 states.

We compiled this list by gathering  information from a variety of sources, including information gathered by  Interior\u2019s Indian Arts and Crafts Board on state-recognized tribes in all  50 states and information collected by the U.S. Census Bureau. On the  basis of this information, we identified 15 states that were most likely to  have state-recognized tribes, and we reached out to state officials in each  of these states. On the basis of our discussions with officials in these  states, we confirmed that 12 of the 15 states had state-recognized tribes.  In addition, state officials in the other 33 states had at one time told  Interior\u2019s Indian Arts and Crafts Board that their states had no state- recognized tribes that were not also federally recognized. As part of our  contact with these 15 states, in addition to inquiring about any state- recognized tribes, we also asked about whether they were aware of any  other non-federally recognized tribes within their borders. For the other  33 states, we relied largely on information provided by these states to  Interior\u2019s Indian Arts and Crafts Board. According to this information,  these states had identified no state-recognized tribes within their borders.  We spot-checked this information by contacting 20 states for which we  were able to identify a state official who could respond to our questions,  and 9 of these states responded to our inquiry and confirmed that they did  not have any state-recognized tribes.", "To address both objectives of this review, we obtained and reviewed  statutes and agency documents; searched databases such as  USAspending.gov and the Single Audit Database; analyzed agency- provided data; and met with officials of various federal agencies, including  all six agencies with programs that have explicit statutory or regulatory  authority to fund certain non-federally recognized tribes, such as state- recognized tribes that are not also federally recognized. These agencies  are the Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and  Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, and Labor. In  addition, we traveled to North Carolina and Virginia to meet with state  officials, representatives of Native American organizations, and officials  from several non-federally recognized tribes located in those states. We  selected North Carolina because it had the highest concentration of non- federally recognized tribes that we identified as having received funding  during the 4-year period (7 out of 26), including three of the top four  recipients of federal funds during the period. We included Virginia  because of its proximity to Washington, D.C., and because tribes in the  state have received federal funding in the past.", "To identify which non-federally recognized tribes had received federal  funding during the period 2007 through 2010 and which programs had  provided this funding, we searched publicly available funding data from  USAspending.gov and agency-provided data. USAspending.gov, a  publicly accessible website containing data on federal awards, was  launched in December 2007 to comply with the requirements of the  Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. Under  that act, federal agencies are required to report information about all  federal awards of $25,000 or more. As a result of these searches, we  determined that 26 of the about 400 non-federally recognized tribes that  we had identified had received federal funding in the 4-year period from  24 federal programs.", "To determine by which means non-federally recognized tribes were  eligible to receive federal funding, we reviewed the authorizing statutes,  program regulations, and eligibility requirements for all 24 programs that  had awarded funding to the 26 non-federally recognized tribes during  fiscal years 2007 through 2010. In addition, we collected information  about the organization and legal status of the 26 non-federally recognized  tribes. For example, we searched Internal Revenue Service data to  identify which of the receiving entities were organized as nonprofits at any  time during the 4-year period. We then analyzed how each entity could  have qualified for the funding it received, by comparing the organizational  and legal status of the recipient with the statutory and regulatory authority  of the awarding program. When a non-federally recognized tribe was  eligible to receive federal funding from a program through several means,  we did not attempt to single out which means qualified the tribe for the  funding received. In those instances where we could not identify any  means by which a non-federally recognized tribe was eligible for funding  received, we contacted agency officials to determine how the entity had  qualified. For example, we contacted two agencies to determine how non- state-recognized tribes in New Jersey qualified for funding from programs  that are authorized to fund state-recognized tribes but not to fund other  non-federally recognized tribes.", "For each non-federally recognized tribe we identified, we searched  USAspending.gov and agency-provided data on relevant identifying  information, including tribal names provided by Interior for petitioners and  by state officials for state-recognized tribes and other non-federally  recognized tribes in their states. Where possible, we used available  information such as tribal names and addresses to identify each entity\u2019s  Data Universal Numbering System (DUNS) number\u2014a nine-digit number  assigned by Dun & Bradstreet, Inc., to identify each physical location for  businesses. Entities such as non-federally recognized tribes may have  multiple DUNS numbers, and we took steps to identify all relevant DUNS  numbers by, for example, searching Dun & Bradstreet\u2019s records for  additional DUNS numbers associated with a particular entity, such as a  previous DUNS number where applicable. We then searched  USAspending.gov and agency-provided data on tribal names and DUNS  numbers to compile an updated data set on federal funding awarded by  federal agencies in the 4-year period to the non-federally recognized  tribes we identified.", "To determine the amount of federal funding awarded for fiscal years 2007  through 2010 to non-federally recognized tribes, we used the information  that we obtained from USAspending.gov and agency-provided data. We  supplemented USAspending.gov data with agency-provided data from  (1) all seven programs that we identified as each having awarded a total  of more than $1.5 million in funding to non-federally recognized tribes in  the 4-year period and (2) some additional programs administered by  these agencies. Some programs awarded funding appropriated through  the annual appropriation process as well as funding appropriated by the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Although the Catalog  of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) may assign unique numbers to  track these two funding sources, we did not consider the funding as  coming from separate programs for the purposes of tallying the number of  programs that awarded funding to non-federally recognized tribes.", "We took a number of steps to assess the reliability of these data. For  example, we compared USAspending.gov against information in single  audit reports filed by those non-federally recognized tribes that filed these  reports for one or more of the fiscal years included in this review. We also  tested the data for missing data and outliers, interviewed agency officials  from all seven programs that awarded more than $1.5 million to non- federally recognized tribes in the 4-year period to discuss how they collect  and maintain these data, and contacted knowledgeable agency officials to  resolve any inconsistencies in these data sources. For example, by  reviewing single audits completed by the Lumbee Tribe of North Carolina,  we identified an award that was not listed in USAspending.gov; we  contacted agency officials to confirm the amounts awarded by fiscal year  and program and to determine why the award was not listed. An agency  official stated that the award was not listed in USAspending.gov because  it was below the reporting threshold required by the Federal Funding  Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006. On the basis of information  provided by the agency, we were able to include the award in our updated  data set. After taking these steps, we concluded that the updated data set  was reliable for the purpose of estimating the amount of federal funding  awarded by federal agencies to non-federally recognized tribes for fiscal  years 2007 through 2010. After collecting this information, we compared  the characteristics of each non-federally recognized tribe with applicable  program eligibility requirements, and we checked for compliance with the  financial reporting requirement in the Single Audit Act, as amended. As a  result, we identified some instances where federal agencies had made  grants to likely ineligible non-federally recognized tribes and where an  agency had initiated actions to enforce federal financial reporting  requirements.", "We excluded awards received by non-federally recognized tribes as  subawards from other entities, including states, because neither  USAspending.gov nor the federal agencies maintain reliable information on  subawards. We also excluded loans, procurement contracts, and tax  expenditures and did not make any effort to determine the amount of  funding received directly by individual members of non-federally recognized  tribes through, for example, scholarships awarded by federal agencies.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2011 through April 2012,  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
