However, some issuers have stated that these rules could be misused, resulting in non-continuous coverage.

Eligible individuals (e.g., U.S. citizens or those lawfully present in the United States) are able to enroll in health coverage during the annual open enrollment period. Outside of open enrollment, eligible individuals may enroll in coverage or change their coverage selection during special enrollment periods. Individuals may enroll under a special enrollment period if, for example, they lost their coverage from another source, such as Medicaid or an employer, or due to relocation. Under federal regulations, enrollees may not sign up for coverage under a special enrollment period citing loss of coverage if the coverage was lost due to nonpayment of premiums.", "About half (53 percent) of the 2015 federally facilitated exchange (FFE) enrollees maintained continuous health insurance coverage throughout the year\u2014that is, they began coverage between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and maintained it through December 31, 2015. These individuals had an average of 11.6 months of coverage. The remaining 47 percent of FFE enrollees started their coverage later or ended it during the year; they averaged 5.0 months of coverage. Enrollees could have voluntarily ended coverage\u2014due to gaining other coverage, for example\u2014or have had it terminated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) or the issuers of coverage for valid reasons, including losing eligibility for exchange coverage or for nonpayment of premiums.", "CMS does not have reliable data on issuer-generated terminations of coverage for enrollees' nonpayment of premiums. Although CMS and issuers share data on the terminations each generates and reconcile their data on a monthly basis to ensure data accuracy, the agency does not require issuers to consistently report data on the reasons for terminations. Officials told us they do not track these data because they are not critical to ensure the accuracy of the federal subsidy amounts\u2014which is the main function of the monthly reconciliation process. Further, CMS lacks a transparent process to ensure the accuracy of these data, as the monthly reconciliation files transmitted between CMS and issuers do not include a place to capture data on termination reasons. Issuers said that they are therefore unable to ascertain whether data they provide on the reasons for termination match CMS's data, and thus they cannot make corrections where necessary.", "The agency's lack of reliable data on terminations for nonpayment limits its ability to effectively oversee certain federal regulations. For example, because CMS is not systematically tracking these data, it cannot tell whether enrollees applying for coverage under a special enrollment period had lost their coverage for nonpayment of premiums\u2014in which case they would be ineligible for the special enrollment period per federal regulations. CMS could capitalize on its existing process, already familiar to issuers, by adding a variable that captures data on termination reasons to the monthly reconciliation file. By taking this step, in addition to requiring issuers to report these data, CMS could help ensure it has reliable and transparent data on terminations of enrollee coverage for nonpayment of premiums, and it could use these data to assess the effects of CMS policies and the overall stability of the exchange."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS ensures it has (1) complete data on terminations of coverage for nonpayment of premiums; and (2) a transparent process to reconcile discrepancies and ensure the accuracy of these data.

However, some issuers offering health  insurance plans in the FFE have noted that certain of these rules could  also undermine enrollees\u2019 incentives to maintain continuous coverage.", "Specifically, issuers have raised concerns about enrollment that occurs  outside of the open enrollment period (OEP), which generally runs near  the start of the coverage year, and about enrollees ending their coverage  before the end of the year. Individuals may use special enrollment periods  (SEP) to sign up for coverage outside of open enrollment if they  experience a triggering event, such as losing coverage from another  source including Medicaid or an employer. However, issuers have noted  that an SEP could be misused if individuals, instead of signing up during  OEP, delayed enrollment until they were sick and had imminent health  care costs to be covered. Some issuers also noted that CMS could be  allowing individuals whose coverage was terminated due to nonpayment  of premiums to re-enroll under an SEP due to loss of coverage although,  under federal regulations, this is not allowed. Finally, some issuers have  stated that enrollees receiving Advance Premium Tax Credits (APTC),  which reduce the cost of coverage for eligible individuals, may  intentionally stop paying their premiums before the end of the year to take  advantage of the 3-month coverage grace period allowed by law while still  meeting requirements for PPACA\u2019s individual mandate.", "There is, however, little data about the extent to which these specific  problems have occurred. Further, enrollees may stop paying premiums  and terminate their coverage for valid reasons including unexpected  reductions in household income or gaining other government or  employer-sponsored coverage, and other research has found that short  periods of coverage were common in the individual market even prior to  PPACA. Officials from both CMS and issuers indicated that individuals  often do not provide notification that they are ending their coverage due to  a change of circumstance. Instead, they stop paying premiums and let  their exchange policies \u201cpassively\u201d terminate.", "You asked us to examine the extent to which exchange enrollees  maintained coverage and paid their premiums during the plan year. This  report: 1.  describes the extent to which enrollees who purchased health  insurance coverage through the FFE in 2015 maintained their  coverage during the plan year; and  2.  evaluates the extent to which CMS has reliable data on the rate at  which enrollees in the FFE are terminated from coverage due to  nonpayment of premiums.", "To describe the extent to which enrollees who purchased health  insurance coverage through the FFE in 2015 maintained their coverage  during the plan year, we obtained and analyzed enrollment and  demographic data from CMS. According to CMS officials, 2015 was the  most recent full year of data available at the time of our review.  Specifically, CMS provided us with data from its centralized enrollment  system, the Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System, for each  enrollee who obtained health insurance coverage\u2014that is, selected a  plan and paid their first premium\u2014through the FFE for coverage year  2015. These data included, among other information, the enrollees\u2019  coverage start and end dates; type of plan, premium, and any APTC  amounts; and demographic information reported by enrollees, including  gender, state of residence, and household income. We used these to  analyze the extent to which enrollees maintained continuous FFE  coverage throughout 2015\u2014which we defined as coverage that began  from January 1, 2015, to March 1, 2015, and ended on December 31,  2015. We compared the demographic and coverage characteristics of  enrollees who maintained continuous coverage throughout 2015 with  those of all other enrollees. We also examined the demographic and  coverage characteristics of all FFE enrollees in 2015. Further, CMS  provided us with FFE enrollment data for the time period of January 1,  2016, through June 30, 2016, which we used to analyze the extent to  which the 2015 FFE enrollees re-enrolled for coverage year 2016. We  assessed the reliability of the data provided by CMS in several ways,  including discussing the reliability of the data with CMS officials, reviewing  relevant CMS data manuals and other documentation, performing manual  and electronic tests of the data to identify any outliers or anomalies, and  comparing the data with data from published sources. We also  interviewed representatives from a small selection of issuers to discuss  the reliability of relevant issuer-reported data maintained in CMS\u2019s  centralized enrollment system. We determined that the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "To evaluate the extent to which CMS has reliable data on the rate at  which FFE enrollees are terminated from coverage due to nonpayment of  premiums, we examined data from CMS\u2019s enrollment system on the  reported reasons for termination of enrollee coverage in 2015. For a small  selection of enrollees identified by CMS as having their coverage  terminated for nonpayment, we examined the termination reasons listed  in issuer data. We also interviewed officials from CMS, industry stakeholders, and selected issuers to learn about how the data on  termination reasons are collected. In addition, we reviewed relevant  PPACA provisions and federal regulations and guidance, including  technical guidance from CMS governing the transfer of information  between CMS and issuers participating in the FFE, and determined  whether the agency\u2019s relevant policies and procedures are consistent with  standards for internal control in the federal government.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2016 to March 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

The data that individuals  provide in their application is stored in the FFE\u2019s centralized enrollment  system, which is maintained by CMS.", "Although CMS oversees the centralized enrollment system, both CMS  and issuers have shared responsibility for enrollment and coverage  functions once individuals apply for coverage:", "CMS is responsible for determining an individual\u2019s eligibility for  coverage and income-based federal subsidies, enrolling the  individual, and processing subsequent coverage changes or  terminations. For example, individuals may change their existing  coverage by signing up under an SEP due to the birth of a child or  relocation, or they may voluntarily terminate their coverage, or CMS  may terminate coverage if the agency is unable to verify key  information such as citizenship status. CMS is also responsible for  making payments for APTCs and determining whether an enrollee is  eligible for any cost-sharing reductions that lower enrollees\u2019 out-of- pocket costs for expenses, such as deductibles and copayments.", "Issuers are responsible for, among other things, collecting premiums  from enrollees, arranging for coverage through provider networks, and  paying claims. Issuers are also responsible for processing, and  notifying CMS of, terminations related to nonpayment of premiums or  fraud.", "As a result of this shared responsibility, CMS and issuers notify each  other of coverage updates by transferring data back and forth through  electronic files known as \u201ctransaction files.\u201d It is critical that both issuers  and CMS have consistent, accurate, and current information on enrollees,  because monthly APTC payments are based on enrollment data in CMS\u2019s  centralized system. Federal regulations require CMS to reconcile  enrollment information with issuers on at least a monthly basis.  Accordingly, CMS and issuers reconcile certain key data elements on a  monthly basis through an automated enrollment reconciliation process, in  which issuer and CMS data are compared and discrepancies are  resolved. Through this process, APTC amounts and their effective dates  are compared and reconciled. CMS\u2019s data system is considered to be  correct when considering discrepancies on overall enrollment counts or  with key data elements, such as coverage start and end dates between  issuer and CMS data. Therefore, CMS will not change the APTC  payments based on issuers\u2019 data that may differ from CMS\u2019s data unless  there are significant discrepancies.", "There are several specific steps involved in transferring data between  CMS and issuers for initial enrollment, subsequent updates, and  reconciliation (see fig. 1 for a high-level overview of the data transfer  process):  Initial enrollment: CMS forwards an outbound electronic transaction  file to the issuer with information on the applicant, the plan selection,  the premium, and the APTC amount. Once the issuer receives the  initial premium payment, the issuer sends an inbound electronic  transaction file back to CMS to confirm the enrollment. Issuers may  not refuse to issue coverage to an individual CMS has deemed  eligible once that individual has made the initial premium payment.  Transaction files are transmitted electronically on a daily basis.", "Subsequent changes/terminations: Subsequent changes to the  individual\u2019s coverage may be initiated by enrollees, CMS, or issuers.  For example, enrollees may request changes to their coverage  through the portal if they experience a change in circumstance (such  as needing to enroll under an SEP due to the birth of a child, or to  terminate their coverage if they move to a different state); CMS may  terminate coverage if the agency cannot verify key eligibility  information (such as citizenship status); or issuers may terminate  coverage if enrollees fail to pay their premiums. If CMS initiates  changes in coverage, it notifies issuers through subsequent outbound  transaction files, and similarly, if issuers initiate changes they notify  CMS through subsequent inbound transaction files.", "Monthly reconciliation: CMS sends issuers a snapshot of key  elements of the enrollment data in its centralized enrollment system in  an outbound reconciliation file. Issuers compare the data from the file  to their enrollment systems and identify missing enrollments or other  discrepancies. Issuers make updates as necessary and send CMS an  inbound reconciliation file with information about current enrollees,  cancellations, and terminations in their systems. CMS then performs an automated comparison of the data in the inbound reconciliation  files with its centralized enrollment system and identifies any further  discrepancies that may need to be resolved either by CMS or issuers.  If necessary, CMS makes further updates to its data.", "In an April 2017 final rule, CMS implemented several actions that, in part,  responded to issuer concerns about special enrollment periods and  stability of enrollment. Specifically, CMS stated that the agency would  require documentation from all individuals applying to enroll in coverage  under an SEP to verify their eligibility for the SEP prior to enrollment.  CMS also stated that, starting in June 2017, it would allow issuers,  subject to state law, to apply a new premium payment to an individual\u2019s  past due payments before applying that premium towards a new  enrollment. CMS stated that issuers would be allowed to refuse to  provide coverage to an enrollee applying under an SEP due to loss of  existing coverage if the issuer had previously terminated the enrollee\u2019s  coverage for nonpayment of premiums, unless the enrollee paid the past  due premiums. CMS further stated that this provision was intended to  encourage individuals to maintain continuous coverage rather than start  and stop coverage (and thereby avoid incurring past due premiums)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Just over Half of FFE Enrollees Maintained Continuous Coverage throughout 2015; Length of Coverage Varied by Enrollee Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Approximately 4.9 million enrollees (53 percent of the 9.2 million FFE  enrollees in 2015) maintained continuous coverage throughout the year\u2014 that is, their coverage began between January 1 and March 1, 2015, and  lasted through December 31, 2015.

CMS uploads these data into its centralized FFE enrollment  system. However, while the issuers may also include codes that  designate the reasons for the terminations, there is no requirement for  them to consistently do so.
