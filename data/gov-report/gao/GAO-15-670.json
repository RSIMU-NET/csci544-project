The number of new borrowers with permanent modifications added to the Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP), the key component of these programs, began to decline in late 2013 but has stabilized at between 9,000 and 15,000 additions per month. Activity under HAMP Tier 1, the original modification for qualified borrowers seeking to reduce their mortgage payments to affordable levels (rates periodically reset), has gradually declined. HAMP Tier 2, a broader fixed rate modification announced in 2012, has gradually grown to account for the majority of new entrants. Since October 2014, Treasury has expanded incentives in order to draw new entrants into the programs and further assist existing participants.", "In making program changes, Treasury took steps to assess their benefits and costs but did not fully meet all of the key elements of federal benefit-cost analysis guidance, and thus has limited assurance that the additional expenditures are an effective and efficient use of taxpayer dollars (see figure below). For example, it is unclear whether the recent changes, such as extending performance incentives to borrowers in the sixth year of their HAMP modification (estimated to cost $4-6 billion), will reduce redefaults. Treasury officials told GAO that borrower surveys confirmed that borrowers responded to performance incentives. But Treasury does not have the estimates needed to fully assess the effectiveness of this or other recent changes. Treasury officials said that program benefits and costs depended on unknown factors and macroeconomic trends and that program benefits were difficult to quantify. Office of Management and Budget guidance and GAO's past work stress that analyzing benefits and costs can help decision makers choose among alternatives.

The largest component of MHA is the  first-lien modification program.

Borrowers are eligible only if the companies servicing their  mortgages have agreed to participate in the program.  To determine  whether a participating loan servicer is required to modify a loan,  HAMP uses a standardized net present value (NPV) model to  compare expected cash flows from a modified loan to the same loan  with no modifications, using certain assumptions. If the expected cash  flow with a modification is positive (i.e., more than the estimated cash  flow of the unmodified loan), the participating loan servicer is required  to make the loan modification. Treasury uses TARP funds to provide  both one-time and ongoing incentives to mortgage investors, loan  servicers, and borrowers for up to 6 years after a loan is modified.

When a borrower\u2019s first lien is modified under  HAMP and the servicer of the second lien is a 2MP participant, that  servicer must offer modification and/or full or partial extinguishment of  the second lien. Treasury provides incentive payments to second- lien mortgage holders, including in the form of a percentage of each  dollar in principal reduction on the second lien.

Under PRA, Treasury provides  mortgage holders/investors with incentive payments in the form of a  percentage of each dollar in principal reduction. Treasury has tripled  the PRA incentive amounts offered to mortgage holders/investors for  permanent modifications with trial periods effective on or after March  1, 2012.

Among the stated  purposes of the legislation that created the TARP program are protecting  home values and preserving homeownership, while key considerations  include minimizing the impact on the national debt, among other things.  OMB has issued guidance on using benefit-cost analyses to help federal  agencies efficiently allocate resources through well-informed decision  making. While Treasury is not required to follow the OMB guidance  because MHA program changes are not issued under a rulemaking  framework, the guidance does contain practices that are still relevant and  may be useful for Treasury to consider. Additionally, since the formal  rulemaking process does not apply in this instance and no public  comment period is required, it is therefore even more important that a  framework is used to maintain accountability and efficiency in the use of  public funds. In our 2010 report on Treasury\u2019s decision to extend TARP  we found that Treasury could improve its decision making by establishing  a robust analytic framework that included clear objectives and meaningful  measures.

Further, program benefits  extend beyond individual borrowers to the larger community and are  difficult to quantify.", "Based on our review of available documentation and discussions with  Treasury officials for this review, we determined that Treasury  substantially or partially met some but not all four of the OMB elements in  considering benefits and costs of the three recent program changes we  reviewed\u2014the HAMP Tier 2 Interest Rate Reduction, HAFA Relocation  Assistance, and the Year Six Pay-for-Performance Incentive and Recast  (see fig. 5). Treasury used action memorandums to summarize the need  for and basis of these program changes. However, the action  memorandums and the additional supporting documentation provided by  Treasury varied in terms of the content of the material discussed and the  degree to which they addressed the key elements of benefit-cost  analysis.", "Policy rationale: Treasury substantially met this element. Treasury  considered lowering the interest rate as a way of making HAMP Tier 2  modifications a more effective alternative for homeowners that cannot  sustain, or do not qualify, for a HAMP Tier 1 modification. These  borrowers include, in particular, HAMP Tier 1 borrowers who may  struggle with interest rate increases in years 6 and beyond of their loan  modification. According to Treasury, after all of the HAMP Tier 1 interest  rate increases, the median monthly HAMP Tier 1 payment will increase  about $212. Increasing a borrower\u2019s monthly payment by increasing the  interest rate, something that will happen to many HAMP Tier 1 borrowers  in 2015, increases the borrower\u2019s risk of defaulting. Treasury has reported  that 83 percent of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers (approximately 752,000) will  experience at least one interest rate increase and that the majority of  them will experience two or three increases.", "Treasury determined that reducing a borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage  payments continues to be the primary driver of the long-term  effectiveness of HAMP modifications. Likewise, in our June 2012 HAMP  report, our econometric analysis showed that reducing a borrower\u2019s  monthly payment by reducing either their mortgage interest rate or  principal balance reduced the borrower\u2019s risk of defaulting on the loan,  but only up to a certain point. HAMP Tier 2 loan modifications offer  borrowers a below-market interest rate that is fixed for the life of the loan  and that may be lower than the scheduled interest rate increases under  HAMP Tier 1. For example, the average interest rate cap would be 5.04  percent for borrowers who received a HAMP Tier 1 loan modification in  2009. When Treasury made the program change, it assumed a Freddie  Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey rate of approximately 4 percent  resulting in an expected fixed rate under Tier 2 of about 3.5 percent (after  50 basis point discount).", "Explicit assumptions: Treasury partially met this element. Treasury  assumed that reducing HAMP Tier 1 borrowers\u2019 monthly payments  through a HAMP Tier 2 loan modification would offset the increased risk  of redefault caused by the HAMP Tier 1 interest rate reset. Treasury  determined that the median HAMP Tier 1 monthly payment would rise by  $95 after the first interest rate increase and would have risen by $212  after the last increase. Assuming a Freddie Mac Primary Mortgage Market Survey rate of approximately 4 percent and 50 basis points  discount, Treasury estimated that the HAMP Tier 2 interest rate reduction  would provide a median savings of $258 from the median payment under  HAMP Tier 1 after the first interest rate increase.", "Treasury conducted significant analysis to arrive at its decision to lower  the HAMP Tier 2 interest rate. Before Treasury\u2019s most recent change, the  HAMP Tier 2 interest rate was the same as the Freddie Mac Primary  Mortgage Market Survey rate. Treasury officials provided analysis  showing that, assuming a 4-percent primary mortgage market survey  rate, reducing the HAMP Tier 2 interest rate 50 basis points below the  market rate could help a number of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers experiencing  an interest rate increase by increasing the number of HAMP Tier 1  borrowers passing the HAMP Tier 2 NPV eligibility test. However,  Treasury\u2019s analysis also found that a more deeply discounted HAMP Tier  2 interest rate decreased the number of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers who  might benefit. That is, with a deeper discounting of the HAMP Tier 2  interest rate, fewer HAMP Tier 1 borrowers would pass the HAMP Tier 2  NPV eligibility test. Treasury\u2019s analysis showed that setting the HAMP  Tier 2 interest rate at 50 basis points below the market rate allowed the  largest number of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers (approximately 192,000) to be  NPV positive while giving them some payment reduction. Treasury\u2019s  analysis also showed setting the rate at 100 basis points (instead of 50  basis points) below the market rate would increase the amount of Tier 1  borrowers\u2019 payment reduction (an additional $22 or from $258 to $280)  but would decrease the number of Tier 1 borrowers eligible for a Tier 2  loan modification (approximately 12,000 fewer loans).", "However, Treasury does not appear to have estimated the percentage of  the 192,000 HAMP Tier 1 borrowers who would likely redefault or be in  imminent default (i.e., future HAMP Tier 1 beneficiaries of this program  change). According to Treasury officials, Treasury data shows that  approximately 25 percent of HAMP Tier 2 modifications relate to  borrowers who previously received HAMP Tier 1 trial or permanent  modifications that they could not thereafter sustain. Treasury officials  stated that given the unique criteria and circumstances of HAMP Tier 1  borrowers, it would be difficult to predict how many additional borrowers  will redefault as a result of an interest rate increase. However, an Urban  Institute study on interest rate resets, which Treasury officials told us they  reviewed and considered, using Treasury published loan file information  assumed a 10 percent increase in redefaults.", "In addition to not estimating redefaults, Treasury did not estimate future  costs to the HAMP program as a result of this program change. Treasury  officials told us that because their goal was to help as many homeowners  as possible avoid foreclosure, they settled on the rate that would benefit  the larger number of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers. As a result of the reduction  in the HAMP Tier 2 interest rate, Treasury\u2019s share of the costs of the  monthly reductions will increase a maximum of 25 basis points for the first  five years of all new HAMP Tier 2 loan modifications.HAMP Tier 2 transactions represented more than half of all new HAMP  transactions. According to Treasury, because the $29.8 billion in  obligated funds remains unchanged, the interest rate change will have no  impact on the MHA budget and will fit into Treasury\u2019s existing budgetary  authority. However, this assessment does not take into account the fact  that unused MHA program funds could be returned to the federal  government general fund if deobligated by Treasury, ultimately reducing  federal government expenditures and minimizing the impact on the  national debt.", "Evaluation of alternatives: Treasury partially met this element, primarily  due to the lack of documentation of some alternatives considered.  Treasury provided documentation showing that it considered lowering the  interest rate in increments of 50 basis points, 100 basis points, 150 basis  points, 200 basis points and not lowering the interest rate at all. Treasury  also evaluated the effect of the interest rate reduction at various Primary  Mortgage Market Survey rates, (e.g., 4 percent, 5 percent, etc.) given that  such rates may change over time.  Although Treasury did not provide any  supporting documentation, officials told us that they had considered a  number of other alternatives as well. For example, Treasury officials said  they considered limiting the reduction to HAMP Tier 1 borrowers only.  However, Treasury officials told us that limiting the change to redefaulting  HAMP Tier 1 borrowers only would have limited the overall assistance  provided and would not have increased the overall number of potentially  eligible borrowers.", "Treasury officials said they also considered further targeting the rate  reduction only at the Tier 1 borrowers most in risk of default. Treasury  officials told us that HAMP Tier 2 already does that by virtue of its  eligibility criteria. In order to quality for HAMP Tier 2, a HAMP Tier 1  borrower must meet basic eligibility criteria, which includes being either  delinquent or at risk of imminent default. Treasury officials added that  creating a bifurcated rate would add considerable operational complexity  that would have reduced effectiveness by delaying implementation and  putting borrowers at risk until the changes could be implemented.", "Treasury officials also told us that they had considered a stakeholder\u2019s  suggestion of freezing HAMP Tier 1 borrowers\u2019 interest rate (i.e.,  eliminate interest rate increases). However, Treasury officials told us they  rejected the suggestion as unfeasible because stakeholders advised  them that it would have required the remodification of all Tier 1 loans,  including executing new loan documents. Officials also added that  freezing rates would likely cost significantly more than the selected  approach.", "Verification: Treasury partially met this element. Treasury identified the  maximum number of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers who could possibly benefit  from its decision to reduce the HAMP Tier 2 interest rate. However,  Treasury did not estimate the number of these HAMP Tier 1 borrowers  that it expected to use HAMP Tier 2 or the total number of borrowers  (both existing Tier 1 and new borrowers) expected to benefit from HAMP  Tier 2. According to Treasury officials, they do not attempt to estimate the  number of borrowers it expects to serve under HAMP Tier 2 or other  programs because Treasury found servicer estimates of future  participation to not be reliable predictors of future participation. Treasury  officials said that their objective is to serve the greatest number of  borrowers possible. However, as we found in July 2009 and June 2010,  Treasury will be unable to effectively evaluate the success of program  changes if it does not establish specific outcomes-based performance  measures (expected benefits) at the outset to compare actual results  versus the additional program outlays.", "Further, according to Treasury officials it is difficult to estimate the  number of borrowers that will ultimately receive assistance under HAMP  Tier 2 or other programs, given borrowers\u2019 unique situations, the dynamic  nature of the housing market, and broader economic forces including  changes in unemployment rates and rates of new mortgage defaults.  OMB\u2019s guidance recognizes that uncertainty is basic to many analyses  and therefore its effects should be analyzed and reported. For example,  OMB\u2019s guidance states that the analysis should include information  surrounding the key sources of uncertainty, expected value estimates of  outcomes, sensitivity of results to sources of uncertainty, and where  possible, probability distributions of benefits, costs, and net benefits.", "Treasury officials told us that they would closely track the number of  homeowners who entered HAMP Tier 2 before and after the discounted  rate went into effect to identify the impact of the change and the percent  of HAMP Tier 2 borrowers who come from HAMP Tier 1. According to  officials, this information will help Treasury fully assess the effectiveness  of the program change. While following trends is a necessary component  of a verification plan, it remains unclear how Treasury will be able to  assess the effectiveness of this program change (i.e. whether anticipated  benefits and costs have been realized, and whether it is minimizing the  impact on the national debt) without a specific estimate or benchmark to  track."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HAFA Relocation Assistance", "paragraphs": ["Policy rationale: Treasury substantially met this element. Treasury noted  that negative equity continued to be a persistent problem for many  communities in the United States, with nearly 1 in 10 homeowners still  underwater. Treasury also concluded that HAFA would be an important  alternative for underwater homeowners facing interest rate increases and  at risk of default. Treasury officials said they increased the HAFA  relocation assistance after reviewing relocation costs, including moving  expenses and rental deposits. Additionally, Treasury officials told us that  HAFA can provide a safety net for borrowers who cannot sustain, or do  not quality for, HAMP Tier 1 including those struggling with interest rate  increases. While not a home retention option, HAFA can provide an  alternative to foreclosure for those borrowers through the use of short  sales and deeds-in-lieu. Treasury officials provided us with academic  research they used when making changes to HAFA supporting these  conclusions. According to Treasury, this research indicated that such  mobility helped resolve regional unemployment differences through the  movement of individuals to areas with greater employment opportunity.  Treasury also demonstrated that some of the states with the most HAFA  transactions also had above-average unemployment rates.", "Explicit assumptions: Treasury partially met this element. As noted  above, Treasury noted that nearly 1 in 10 homeowners were still  underwater. Being underwater effectively prevents many borrowers from  selling their homes to pay off their mortgages. Treasury also concluded  that the costs of relocating, such as rental deposits and moving  expenses, could be especially burdensome for recently delinquent  homeowners, who were often struggling with unemployment, may have  exhausted their cash reserves, or both. However, Treasury did not fully  meet this element because while it provided arguments for a higher  assistance amount, the assumptions that went into its decision to more  than triple the amount of assistance provided from $3,000 to $10,000 per  borrower remain unclear. Treasury\u2019s action memorandum noted rental  rates in California, Florida, and Arizona (the states with the highest  number of HAFA transactions) were steadily increasing. For example,  Treasury focused on California when calculating rental deposits, because  California accounted for more HAFA transactions than any other state.  Treasury estimated rental deposits for a two-bedroom apartment to be  approximately $4,500 in California. Officials also explained that the  increase would help ensure that interstate moves remained a viable  option for borrowers seeking employment opportunities. Treasury officials  told us that the average cost of moving a two-bedroom household out of  state was estimated at more than $5,600, almost five times more than an  intrastate move, which was estimated at $1,170 based on data from the  American Moving and Storage Association.", "In its action memorandum, Treasury noted that the funds obligated to  MHA remain unchanged at $29.8 billion and that the changes would have  no impact on the MHA budget or TARP overall. However, this  assessment does not take into account the fact that unused MHA  program funds could be returned to the federal government general fund  if deobligated by Treasury.", "Evaluation of alternatives: Treasury partially met this element. Treasury  did not provide evidence that it conducted research or analysis that would  allow it to evaluate a potential alternative of adjusting the benefits  provided on a needs-based approach to assistance. Treasury officials told  us that they had considered basing the relocation assistance on borrower  location, but because HAFA is a national program Treasury wanted to  treat borrowers in all states equally. Also, Treasury officials said they had  concerns about servicers communicating the details of a needs-based or  tiered approach to borrowers. Using a tiered approach might have led to  borrower confusion about how much assistance they would receive and  would require borrowers to provide additional documentation evidencing  their relocation costs. Treasury officials also stated that using a needs- based or tiered approach would have required significant adjustments to  both Treasury\u2019s and servicers\u2019 systems and processes, and that ease of  implementation was an important consideration. Treasury officials noted  that if Treasury had chosen a different approach it would not have had the  assistance in place by February 2015. A more complicated alternative  could not have been implemented until summer 2015 at the earliest. It  remains unclear what impact such a delay might have had, particularly if it  had permitted a more tiered approach that recognized borrowers\u2019 unique  circumstances and needs. Providing equal amounts of relocation  assistance regardless of borrowers\u2019 location and circumstances can result  in inequitable treatment and potentially unintended results. For example,  borrowers with underwater mortgages residing in low-cost areas might be  more likely to seek the HAFA incentive, even if they were likely to remain  current on their modified mortgage without it.", "Verification: Treasury partially met this element. Treasury did not provide  specific estimates on the number of homeowners, including HAMP Tier 1  borrowers, whom it expected to receive HAFA assistance. Treasury noted  that the amount that would be ultimately disbursed in connection with the  HAFA relocation assistance payment increase would depend on a  number of factors that it could not predict at the time (e.g., national  mortgage delinquency rates and other economic conditions, borrower  application rates, and the performance of modified loans over time).", "Treasury officials said they will continue to track the number of HAFA  transactions before and after the relocation assistance increase.  However, without specific estimates, Treasury will be unable to assess  the expected effectiveness of this program change, particularly for HAMP  Tier 1 borrowers.

Treasury provided three main  justifications for making this change. First, Treasury officials noted that  increasing financial incentives for homeowners in good standing after a  HAMP modification could help lower the risk of redefault by providing a  strong incentive for remaining current on modified loans. Previously,  Treasury conducted a survey of active HAMP Tier 1 borrowers. The  survey showed that nearly two-thirds of borrowers were aware of the  incentives, and 73 percent of those respondents said they were motivated  by them. Treasury officials said that the survey\u2019s results confirmed that  borrowers responded to performance incentives. Second, Treasury  officials told us that having more equity in their homes\u2014something this  incentive provided\u2014was important to lower the risk of redefault,  particularly for those struggling with negative equity. Research by  Treasury found higher redefault risks associated with underwater  borrowers, who have no or negative equity in their homes. Third,  officials said that they decided to offer the $5,000 incentive at the end of  year 6 to lessen the financial impact of HAMP Tier 1 interest rate  increases. Specifically, they said that the combination of a recast of the  HAMP Tier 1 loan (which servicers are required to offer in conjunction  with this program change) and all of the pay-for-performance incentives  would lower monthly payments for a large population of homeowners  facing increasing interest rates. Treasury officials also noted that this  incentive was among options that they believed both Treasury and MHA  servicers could implement relatively quickly because it did not require  complex infrastructure changes.", "However, it is less clear why Treasury extended the $5,000 Year Six Pay- for-Performance Incentive to borrowers with HAMP Tier 2, RD-HAMP,  and Treasury FHA-HAMP loan modifications. Borrowers in these  programs do not face interest rate increases, because the modified  interest rate of their loans is fixed for the life of the loan. Also, prior to  Supplemental Directive 14-05, HAMP Tier 2 borrowers did not receive  any pay-for-performance incentives. According to Treasury officials,  borrowers in HAMP Tier 2, RD-HAMP and FHA-HAMP can still benefit  from the increased equity that performance incentives provide. Officials  stated that HAMP data showed that redefault rates fell as a loan\u2019s post- modification LTV ratio decreases, and lowering the LTV ratio is especially  important for those homeowners who remain underwater. In addition,  officials said that increasing borrower incentives for these three programs  could also incentivize more borrowers to apply for assistance with HAMP  in the future.", "In addition to the survey results showing that borrowers are motivated by  existing incentives, Treasury officials pointed to their own analysis to  support the year 6 incentive\u2019s expansion to those programs. Treasury\u2019s  research showed that holding all other factors constant, borrowers with  HAMP modifications performed better than similarly situated borrowers   Officials stated that HAMP\u2019s borrower  with proprietary modifications.incentives were a probable explanation for these results. However, the  borrower incentives were not included in the study\u2019s analytical model. As  a result, we believe the research cannot be used as evidence to support  Treasury\u2019s conclusions. Lastly, Treasury was unable to provide  documentation to explain how it determined that $5,000 was the  appropriate dollar amount for the incentive, given its stated goal of  reducing loan modification redefaults.", "Explicit assumptions: Treasury partially met this element. Treasury  assumed that providing these changes would incentivize HAMP  borrowers to remain current in their monthly payments. While Treasury  officials pointed to surveys of HAMP Tier 1 borrowers to demonstrate the  effect of performance incentives, Treasury did not provide data supporting  a greater willingness of borrowers already current on their modified  mortgages\u2014including HAMP Tier 2, RD-HAMP, FHA-HAMP and  enterprise HAMP borrowers\u2014to continue paying because of an increase  in incentives.", "Treasury also assumed that the incentive would encourage HAMP Tier 1  borrowers in good standing and facing interest rate increases to remain  current. Treasury estimated that the median HAMP Tier 1 monthly  payment would increase by $95 after the first interest rate increase and  by $212 after all interest rate increases. Treasury further estimated that  the proposed recast would result in a median monthly payment reduction  of $56 for HAMP Tier 1 borrowers. Treasury estimated that the reduction  would offset 27 percent of the $211 cumulative payment increase for the  median borrower. Treasury has reported that payment reduction strongly  correlates with decreased defaults on HAMP loan modifications.  However, our June 2012 report found that certain levels of payment  reductions have a greater effect on reducing redefaults and that beyond  these levels greater payment reductions have a diminishing impact on  reducing redefault. It is unclear whether Treasury determined the extent  to which this offset would help HAMP Tier 1 borrowers experiencing  interest rate increases avoid redefault because of the increase in their  monthly mortgage payments.", "HAMP Tier 1 borrowers will see their first rate increase at the beginning of  year 6, and these borrowers will not receive the benefit until the beginning  of year 7. Treasury officials told us that they expected many borrowers to  be able to absorb the first interest rate increase. However, according to  an Urban Institute study on interest rate resets, all HAMP borrowers with  resetting loans in 2017 and 2018 will have an average increase of 33  percent, or about $254 in monthly payment increases. Moreover,  according to a study by the Urban Institute large numbers of 2010 HAMP  Tier 1 borrowers (nearly 235,000) in 2017 and 2011 HAMP Tier 1  borrowers (nearly 160,000) in 2018 are expected to encounter much  higher monthly payment increases of $318 (a 43 percent increase) and  $313 (a 41 percent increase), respectively.", "According to Treasury, approximately one million total borrowers already  in HAMP are potentially eligible for the incentive, of which 752,000 in  HAMP Tier 1 will see at least one interest rate increase. The balance of  the one million represents homeowners in HAMP Tier 1, HAMP Tier 2,  RD HAMP and Treasury FHA-HAMP who will not experience an interest  rate change on their loan modifications. Treasury officials told us that they  had not estimated how many of these potentially eligible borrowers will  benefit from the additional incentive. Further, Treasury has not indicated  the number of redefaults it expects the new incentive to prevent.", "Treasury estimated the total cost of the additional incentives at between  $4 billion and $6 billion in additional TARP fund outlays, depending on  how many potentially eligible homeowners participate and remain current.  According to Treasury, this number includes the cost of extending the  incentives to all HAMP programs and the maximum cost of Treasury\u2019s  agreement to fund the extension of the additional incentive to enterprise  HAMP loans meeting the requirements of Supplemental Directive 15-01.  Treasury did not report the expected costs for each specific program,  making a cost comparison across programs difficult.", "Officials told us that Treasury\u2019s goal was more than to prevent HAMP Tier  1 borrowers from defaulting and that Treasury wanted to increase the  performance and sustainability of all HAMP modifications.

Treasury  officials noted that they had explored options to enhance MHA programs  to provide continued assistance to homeowners at risk of default,  including those facing interest rate increases under HAMP. For example,  the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program  (SIGTARP) recommended that Treasury increase the amount of the  annual borrower incentives and require servicers to apply the annual  incentive against the borrowers\u2019 monthly mortgage payment rather than  using it as a principal curtailment. Treasury did increase borrower  incentives (e.g., by adding the sixth year $5,000 incentive), but officials  said that they found multiple complications with SIGTARP\u2019s suggestion to  apply the annual incentive against the borrower\u2019s monthly mortgage  payment. For instance, borrowers on an automatic payment plan might  have trouble making payments as the monthly payment amount changed,  depending on whether it included the month\u2019s incentive. According to  Treasury officials, the mechanics of a monthly incentive would be difficult  to explain to borrowers.", "Treasury officials told us that they had discussed SIGTARP\u2019s suggestion  with servicers, one of which suggested utilizing a recast option as an  alternative means of lowering the borrower\u2019s monthly payment. Treasury  officials also told us that they had discussed SIGTARP\u2019s recommendation  with housing advocates that had expressed some concerns regarding  logistics and changing monthly payments.", "Treasury officials told us that because servicers already had infrastructure  in place to apply incentives to borrowers\u2019 principal balance, they could  quickly implement the additional incentive after the sixth year. Officials  also told us that given Treasury\u2019s experience implementing HAMP,  Treasury had to consider implementation difficulties, feasibility for  servicers, time constraints, and costs associated with any potential  solution.  Because interest rate increases had already begun and officials  wanted to get assistance to borrowers as quickly as possible, Treasury  had to consider the limitations of its administrative system and servicers\u2019  systems when making its decision.", "Treasury internal documents said that they had considered variations of  the pay-for-performance incentive, such as limiting it to borrowers with the  most demonstrated need, reducing the amount of the incentive, or limiting  the number of eligible HAMP programs. Treasury officials told us that they  had made the judgment that a $5,000 amount in the sixth year with a  recast option appropriately balanced the effect of a significant incentive,  the desire for a timely and substantial payment relief option, and the time  required to implement program changes. With regard to the selected  amount of the incentive\u2014$5,000\u2014Treasury documents discussed how it  considered providing smaller or larger amounts but reached the current  amount after taking into account a number of possible factors.

Treasury identified the  universe of potentially eligible HAMP borrowers for the additional  incentive but did not estimate how many borrowers would likely qualify  (e.g., remain in good standing for six years and, as to enterprise  borrowers, be serviced by a participating SPA servicer.

Treasury has  recently made a series of program changes that are intended to increase  participation in MHA programs and mitigate the impact of HAMP Tier 1  interest rate increases. Treasury\u2019s analysis showed that these changes  could result in additional outlays of TARP funds in the billions of dollars.   However, inconsistencies we saw with regards to Treasury\u2019s analysis  suggest the lack of a standard process in place to ensure that program  changes were subject to a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis. Treasury  did not fully meet all of the key elements of benefit-cost analysis for the  three program changes that we reviewed.

Each of the four elements of a benefit-cost  analysis\u2014policy rationale, explicit assumptions, evaluation of alternatives,  and verification\u2014are important in promoting efficient resource allocation  through well-informed decision-making. Since such program changes do  not require Treasury to engage in a formal rulemaking process that  includes a public comment period, standardizing the process might allow  for increased accountability of Treasury\u2019s program changes. Because  Treasury did not comprehensively address each of the four key elements  of an effective benefit-cost analysis, when it has made recent program  changes, it has limited assurance that the changes will effectively mitigate  expected rate increases in a manner that minimizes the impact on the  national debt.

For this reason, we believe it is important  that Treasury consider carefully whether the additional costs associated  with these program changes are consistent with the expected benefits  provided.

We compared Treasury\u2019s process to key  elements of effective cost-benefit analysis contained in guidance from the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB).", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2014 to July 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on the audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Harry Medina (Assistant  Director), Jon D.
