Seventeen of these citations were issued from 2010  through 2014 (see fig. 7). These citations were issued in about 5 percent  of the 344 workplace violence inspections of health care employers that  were conducted from 1991 to April 2015.", "All 18 citations arose from unprogrammed inspections. Fourteen of the  citations arose from complaints\u2014the most common type of  unprogrammed inspection among these cases. For example, in one case,  OSHA cited an employer for exposing employees working in a residential  habilitation home to the hazard of violent behavior and being physically  assaulted by patients with known histories of violence or the potential for  violence. OSHA determined that the company failed to identify and abate  existing and developing hazards associated with workplace violence. In  all 18 of these cases, health care workers had been injured or killed by  patients, clients, or residents. We found that the three regions that  conducted the highest number of workplace violence inspections also  issued the majority of workplace violence-related general duty citations to  health care employers. Collectively, the three regions issued 12 of the 18  general duty citations issued since 1991.", "Staff from all 10 OSHA regional offices said it was challenging to cite  employers for violating the general duty clause when workplace violence  is identified as a hazard and staff from 4 OSHA regional offices said it  was challenging to develop these cases within the 6-month statutory time  frame required to develop a citation. As described in OSHA\u2019s  enforcement directive, to cite an employer for violating the general duty  clause for a workplace violence hazard, OSHA inspectors must  demonstrate that (1) a serious workplace violence hazard exists and the  employer failed to keep its workplace free of hazards to which employees  were exposed, (2) the hazard is recognized by the employer or within the  industry, (3) the hazard caused or is likely to cause death or serious  physical harm, and (4) there are feasible abatement methods to address  the hazard. Some inspectors and other regional officials from 5 OSHA  regional offices said it is difficult to collect sufficient evidence to meet all  four criteria during an inspection. For example, two regional officials noted  that while injuries may have occurred as a result of workplace violence at  facilities they have inspected, the assaults may involve a single employee  or a very small number of employees, or the assaults may not be frequent  or serious enough to demonstrate a hazard that can cause serious  physical harm or death. Another inspector noted that an employer may  have a minimal workplace violence prevention program and that it is  sometimes difficult to prove that the employer has not done enough to  address the hazard.", "Staff, including officials and inspectors, from 5 of OSHA\u2019s 10 regional  offices said it would be helpful to have additional assistance to implement  the 2011 workplace violence enforcement directive. They suggested  having additional information on how to collect evidence and write up a  workplace violence citation, examples of workplace violence issues that  have been cited, examples of previously documented workplace violence  case files, and examples of citations that have been upheld in court would  be helpful. According to federal internal control standards, agency  management should share quality information throughout the agency to  enable personnel to perform key roles in achieving agency objectives.  While OSHA\u2019s webinar on the 2011 workplace violence enforcement  directive provides general guidance on the types of evidence needed to  develop a general duty clause citation, it does not provide the types of  detailed information proposed by staff. For example, officials from one  region said that although the training they received was helpful, assessing  workplace violence hazards is new to many inspectors, and additional  information would help inspectors fully understand how to inspect, collect  evidence, and write up a workplace violence citation. Inspectors from  another region suggested the national office provide an updated webinar  with lessons learned and examples of what has been cited so inspectors  can be consistent in how they develop these cases. Officials from  OSHA\u2019s national office told us they have considered developing additional  training for inspectors on conducting workplace violence inspections and  are planning to revise the 2011 enforcement directive. For example, they  said that they would like to provide inspectors more specific guidance on  developing a workplace violence case in different environments and  additional information about the hazards and abatement measures  applicable to different health care facilities. OSHA officials said the  training would be developed and the directive would be revised by the  end of 2016. Without this additional information, inspectors may continue  to face challenges in conducting workplace violence inspections and  developing citations.", "When inspectors identify workplace violence hazards during an  inspection, but all the criteria for issuing a general duty clause citation are  not met and a specific standard does not apply, inspectors have the  option of issuing warning letters to employers, known as Hazard Alert  Letters (HAL). These letters recommend that the employer voluntarily  take steps to eliminate or reduce workers\u2019 exposure to the hazard. The  letters describe the specific hazardous conditions identified in an  inspection, list corrective actions that can be taken to address them, and  provide contact information to seek advice and consultation on  addressing the hazards. From 2012 through May 2015, OSHA issued 48  HALs to health care employers recommending actions to address factors  contributing to workplace violence. Several of the HALs we reviewed  stated that workers had been assaulted, notified the employers that they  failed to implement adequate measures to protect their workers from  assaults, and recommended the employers take specific steps to better  protect their workers.", "Agency officials informed us OSHA inspectors are not required to  routinely conduct follow-up inspections after issuing HALs, and the  uniform inspection procedures from the 2011 enforcement directive do  not specify a process for contacting employers to determine whether  hazards and deficiencies have been addressed. They explained,  however, that a follow-up inspection would not normally be conducted if  the employer or employer representative provides evidence that the  hazard has been addressed. According to OSHA officials, if OSHA  decides to conduct a follow-up inspection, OSHA\u2019s recommended time  period for a follow-up with employers is 12 months following employer  receipt of the HAL, although this is not required in the inspection  procedures from the 2011 enforcement directive. OSHA established a  policy in 2007 to follow up on HALs related to ergonomics issues, but this  policy does not apply to HALs related to workplace violence issues.   OSHA established the ergonomics HAL policy after its ergonomics  standard was invalidated under the Congressional Review Act in 2001.  The ergonomics HAL follow-up policy outlines a process for contacting  employers to determine whether ergonomic hazards and deficiencies  identified in the letters have been addressed. OSHA inspectors are  directed to schedule a follow-up inspection to determine if the hazards are  being addressed if the employer does not respond or responds  inadequately.", "In addition, OSHA was not able to tell us how many of the 48 health care  employers who received HALs for workplace violence issues had follow- up inspections because the follow-up status of HALs is not centrally  maintained. Each regional office workplace violence coordinator would  have to be contacted to find out the status of each HAL. OSHA has a  centralized information system, but has not systematically used it for  tracking the status of HALs. While OSHA\u2019s information system is capable  of tracking the status of HALs, OSHA officials are not sure if regional  offices are consistently entering updated information. According to federal  internal control standards, agency management should perform ongoing  monitoring as part of the normal course of operations. Without a uniform  process to follow up on these HALs, OSHA will not know whether the  hazards that placed employees at risk for workplace violence at these  facilities continue to exist. In addition, without routine follow up on these  cases, OSHA may not obtain the information needed to determine  whether a follow-up inspection or other enforcement actions are needed.", "OSHA officials acknowledged that it can be challenging to develop a  general duty clause citation for workplace violence and cited some  potential benefits of having a workplace violence prevention standard.  However, officials stated that OSHA is not planning at this time to develop  a workplace violence prevention standard because it has identified other  workplace hazards that are higher priorities for regulatory action.  According to OSHA officials, the potential benefits of having a specific  standard include setting clearer expectations for employers, increasing  employer implementation of workplace violence prevention programs, and  simplifying the process for determining when citations could be issued.  Rather than pursuing a standard on workplace violence, the officials  stated that OSHA has focused its efforts on increased enforcement using  the general duty clause, issuing new guidance, and developing a new  webpage for employers and workers with resources for addressing  workplace violence in health care facilities.", "OSHA officials also highlighted other efforts the agency has taken to  reduce workplace violence in health care facilities. These efforts included  obtaining feedback from stakeholders on the employer guidelines,  establishing a task force to develop a long term agency plan for  workplace violence prevention and resources for OSHA staff and the  public, and issuing publications on workplace violence prevention  strategies. In addition, OSHA officials reported conducting a qualitative  and quantitative review of data from its NEP for Nursing and Residential  Care Facilities. However, OSHA\u2019s review of the NEP entailed  summarizing data collected from the regions 6 months after the program  began on inspections that resulted in the issuance of ergonomics hazard  alert letters. OSHA officials said they did not complete an overall  evaluation of the program even though the NEP procedures provided that  the agency do so. The NEP procedures stated that the national office was  to collect data relevant to the effectiveness of the program from the  regions and complete an evaluation. Additionally, the procedures  specified that the evaluation should address the program\u2019s role in meeting  OSHA\u2019s goals, such as the reduction in the number of injuries and  abatement measures implemented. An OSHA official we spoke with could  not provide a reason why OSHA did not conduct an evaluation of the NEP  and was not aware of any plans for the agency to conduct such an  evaluation. According to information provided by agency officials, they  have not assessed how well OSHA\u2019s approach to helping prevent  workplace violence is working. According to federal internal control  standards, agency management should assess the quality of agency  performance over time and correct identified deficiencies. Such  assessments involve analyzing data to determine whether the intended  outcomes were achieved and identifying any changes that may improve  results. Because OSHA has not assessed the results of its education and  enforcement efforts, it is not in a position to know whether they have  helped, for example, to increase employer awareness and  implementation of abatement measures. Assessing how well OSHA\u2019s  approach is working could inform future efforts to address workplace  violence in health care facilities. For example, completing the evaluation  of the NEP results could provide OSHA with information to decide  whether further action may be needed to address workplace violence  hazards. OSHA could also consider cost-effective ways to conduct such  assessments, such as reviewing a sample of workplace violence  inspections that resulted in hazard alert letters to determine the extent to  which employers implemented recommended abatement measures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Selected States Have Workplace Violence Prevention Requirements Similar to OSHA\u2019s Voluntary Guidelines and Have Some Additional Efforts to Address Workplace Violence", "paragraphs": ["All of the nine states we reviewed have enacted laws that require health  care employers to establish a plan or program to protect workers from  workplace violence. According to our review of information provided by  state officials, these states have requirements, either in law or  regulation, similar to the components of an effective workplace violence  prevention program identified in OSHA\u2019s voluntary guidelines (see table  4). Specifically, seven of the nine states require management and  worker participation in workplace violence prevention efforts, such as  through a committee or other means. Eight of the nine states require  health care employers to analyze or assess worksites to identify hazards  that may lead to violent incidents. All nine states require health care  employers to take steps to prevent or control the hazards, such as  changing policies, security features, or the physical layout of the facility.  Eight of the nine states also require health care employers to train  workers on workplace violence prevention, such as how workers can  protect themselves and report incidents. All nine states require health  care employers to record incidents of violence against workers, and eight  of the states require health care employers to periodically evaluate or  review their workplace violence prevention plan or program.", "According to state officials in the nine states we reviewed, the department  of labor is responsible for ensuring compliance with these workplace  violence prevention requirements, although in some states the  department of health also has oversight responsibilities. In addition, under  their OSHA-approved state plans, the state departments of labor in our  selected states may issue citations to employers under their jurisdiction  for violations of an applicable state standard or the state\u2019s equivalent to  the general duty clause. Similar to OSHA, state agency oversight  activities included investigating complaints and reports of violent  incidents, as well as conducting planned inspections. The departments of  labor in the states we reviewed conducted varying numbers of inspections  of health care employers involving workplace violence issues and in some  cases cited employers for violations of their requirements. From 2010  through 2014, state officials from eight of the nine states reported  conducting from 2 to 75 inspections of health care employers related to  workplace violence. One state did not conduct inspections of health  care employers regarding workplace violence. The completed  inspections resulted in 0 to 74 reported citations.", "In addition to their workplace violence prevention laws, officials in some of  the states we reviewed described other efforts to further address  workplace violence against health care workers. For example, California,  New York, and Oregon have a NIOSH-funded program for tracking and  investigating work-related fatalities called the Fatality Assessment and  Control Evaluation Program. The purpose of this program is to identify  risk factors for work-related fatalities and disseminate prevention  recommendations. Also, the state of Washington has an independent  research program called the Safety and Health Assessment and  Research for Prevention Program that conducts research projects on  occupational health and safety. In addition, California department of labor  officials stated that they are developing a workplace violence prevention  standard that will be adopted by July 2016, which officials said would  make it easier for inspectors to cite employers for workplace violence  issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on the Effectiveness of Workplace Violence Prevention Programs Is Limited, but a Few Studies Show Positive Results", "paragraphs": ["Relatively few studies have been conducted on the effectiveness of  workplace violence prevention programs, limiting what is known about the  extent to which such programs or their components reduce workplace  violence. After conducting a literature review, we identified five studies  that evaluated the effectiveness of workplace violence prevention  programs and met our criteria, such as having original data collection and  quantitative evidence.", "Four of the five studies we reviewed suggest that workplace violence  prevention programs can contribute to reduced rates of assault.", "Three Studies of the Veterans Health Administration system. In  one study, researchers surveyed workers from 142 Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA) hospitals in 2002 and identified facility-level  characteristics associated with higher and lower rates of assaults. The  researchers found that facility-wide implementation of alternate  dispute resolution training was associated with reduced assault  rates. In a separate study of the VA system, researchers examined  the relationship between the implementation of a comprehensive  workplace violence prevention program at 138 VA health care  facilities and changes in assault rates from 2004 through 2009. The  workplace violence prevention program included training, workplace  practices, environmental controls, and security. The researchers  found that facilities that fully implemented a number of training  practices experienced a modest decline in assault rates. The training  practices included assessing staff needs for training, having trainers  present in the facility and actively training, and providing staff training  on prevention and management of disruptive behavior and reporting  disruptive behavior, among other things. In a third study, researchers  described the processes that VA\u2019s Veterans Health Administration  (VHA) uses to evaluate and manage the risk of assaultive patients.  The study stated that VHA\u2019s approach included the use of committees  made up of various stakeholders to assess threatening patients, and  recommendations flagged in veterans\u2019 electronic medical records to  notify staff of individuals who may pose a threat to the safety of  others. Researchers surveyed Chiefs of Staff at 140 VHA hospitals  and found that committee processes and perceptions of effectiveness  were associated with a reduction in assault rates. For example,  facilities that rated their committees as \u201cvery effective\u201d were the only  facilities that experienced a significant decrease in assault rates from  2009 to 2010.", "Emergency departments study. In a fourth study, researchers found  mixed results regarding the effect that a workplace violence  prevention program had on the rate of assaults. The study was  conducted with three emergency departments that implemented the  program (intervention sites) and three emergency departments that  did not implement the program (comparison sites). Implementation of  the program took place in 2010 and included environmental changes,  changes in policies and procedures, and staff training. Researchers  measured assault rates in the intervention and comparison sites  before and after the workplace violence program was implemented by  surveying on a monthly basis over an 18-month period 209 health  care workers who volunteered to participate in the study. The  researchers found that workers at the intervention sites and the  comparison sites reported significantly fewer assaults over the study  period. Therefore, the researchers could not conclude that workers at  the intervention sites experienced a significantly greater decrease in  violence compared with workers at the comparison sites. However, at  the facility level, the researchers found that two of the intervention  sites experienced a significant decrease in violence, and no individual  comparison site had any significant change in assaults.", "In-patient mental health facilities study. A fifth study we reviewed  found that implementation of a workplace violence prevention  program improved staff perceptions of the safety climate in the facility  but did not result in an overall change in assault rates. This study  evaluated a comprehensive workplace violence prevention program  that New York implemented in three state-run, in-patient mental health  facilities from 2000 through 2004. The study compared these  facilities that implemented the program (intervention sites) with three  state-run, in-patient mental health facilities that did not implement the  program (comparison sites). Researchers surveyed 319 staff at the  intervention sites and found that staff perceptions of management\u2019s  commitment to violence prevention and employee involvement in the  program was significantly improved after the program was  implemented. However, an analysis of the change in staff-reported  physical assaults did not indicate a statistically significant reduction in  assaults at the facility level in either the intervention or comparison  sites.", "Research also suggests that workplace violence prevention legislation  may increase employer adoption of workplace violence prevention  programs. Two studies compared the workplace violence prevention  programs reported by hospitals and psychiatric facilities in California\u2014 which enacted a workplace violence prevention law for hospitals in  1993\u2014to facilities in New Jersey, where a similar law did not exist at the  time of the study, according to the authors. Information was collected  through interviews; facility walk-throughs; and a review of written policies,  procedures, and training material. In the first study, researchers  compared 116 California hospital emergency departments to 50 New  Jersey hospital emergency departments and found that a significantly  higher percentage of the California hospitals had written policies and  procedures on workplace violence prevention compared to hospitals in  New Jersey. In the second study, researchers compared 53 psychiatric  units and facilities in California to 30 psychiatric units and facilities in New  Jersey and found a higher percentage of California facilities that  participated in the study had written workplace violence prevention  policies compared to facilities in New Jersey. While New Jersey had a  smaller percentage of facilities with written workplace violence prevention  policies compared to California, the study found that New Jersey had a  higher proportion of facilities (17 of 30 or 71 percent) than in California  (25 of 53 or 61 percent) with workplace violence policies that address  violence against personnel, patients, and visitors. In a third study,  researchers found that rates of assault against employees in selected  California hospital emergency departments decreased after enactment of  the California law (from 1996 to 2001), whereas the assault rates in  selected New Jersey hospital emergency departments increased over this  same time period. However, the researchers could not conclude that  these differences were attributable to the California law."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Compared to workers overall, health care workers face an increased risk  of being assaulted at work, often by the patients in their care. Given the  high rate of violence committed against health care workers, particularly  in in-patient facilities, there is an increasing need to help ensure that  health care workers are safe as they perform their work duties. OSHA  may issue general duty clause citations to employers who fail to protect  their workers from hazardous conditions. While OSHA has increased the  number of inspections of workplace violence in health care facilities in  recent years, relatively few general duty clause citations resulted from  these inspections. Inspectors reported facing challenges in developing  the evidence needed to issue these citations, and officials and inspectors  from 5 of OSHA\u2019s 10 regions said it would be helpful to have additional  information to assist them in implementing the 2011 enforcement  directive.

We decided not  to report the perpetrator information from the survey data because BJS  officials said that due to a limitation of the survey, it underestimates the  number of workplace violence cases in which patients assault workers.  Specifically, the variables that describe the relationship of the victim to the  perpetrator in the survey are dependent on whether the victim knows the  perpetrator. Survey respondents who answer that the perpetrator is a  stranger are not subsequently asked if the perpetrator was a patient.

We also assessed the extent to which each study\u2019s data  and methods support its findings and conclusions. We eliminated studies  that were not sufficiently reliable and methodologically rigorous for  inclusion in our review. For example, we eliminated studies with low  survey response rates and studies whose findings were based on  information collected from a small number of health care workers. We  assessed the methodological sufficiency of each study using internal  guidance documents. We determined that 17 of the studies were  sufficiently reliable and methodologically rigorous for inclusion in our  review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of OSHA\u2019s Actions to Protect Health Care Workers from Workplace Violence", "paragraphs": ["To examine the steps OSHA has taken to protect health care workers  from workplace violence, we reviewed relevant federal laws and  regulations; analyzed OSHA\u2019s guidance, inspection procedures, and  enforcement data; and interviewed OSHA officials.

We analyzed enforcement data from 1991 through April  2015 on federal OSHA inspections, including data on the type of  inspection, inspection findings, citations, and penalties. To assess the  reliability of the OSHA enforcement data, we reviewed relevant agency  documentation, conducted electronic data testing, and interviewed  agency officials.

We focused our review on these nine states because  they were the ones we identified from our search of legal databases;  related studies; and interviews with federal officials, researchers, and  national labor organizations. We did not conduct a nationwide review of  state laws or collect information from all 50 states; therefore, other states  may have these types of requirements. For the nine states we identified,  we reviewed information provided by state officials on state requirements,  including laws and regulations, for workplace violence prevention  programs in health care settings. We confirmed our descriptions of the  selected state requirements with state officials as of December 2015. We  did not evaluate the quality or effectiveness of state requirements.", "We visited four of these states\u2013California, Maryland, New York, and  Washington\u2013selected for variation in the length of time their state  workplace violence prevention laws have been in place. During our visits,  we interviewed state officials from the state\u2019s department of labor and  department of health, visited one health care facility in each state, and  held discussion groups with health care workers. We visited four health  care facilities, including two state psychiatric hospitals, a nursing home,  and a hospital with an emergency department. We selected these types  of facilities because BLS data indicate that most workplace violence  incidents occur in hospitals and nursing and residential care facilities.  During each of the health care facility visits, we met with security,  management, and health care workers. We also participated in a guided  tour of the facility. The information we obtained from the states and our  site visits is not generalizable.", "We conducted five nongeneralizable discussion groups with health care  workers to learn about their experience with workplace violence. These  discussion groups were organized by labor organization officials that  represent health care workers. The discussions occurred in Baltimore,  Maryland; Los Angeles, California; New York, New York; Seattle,  Washington; and Washington, D.C. These locations were selected to  align with our selected site visit states. The labor organization officials  invited health care workers who had been verbally and/or physically  assaulted while performing their duties at work. A total of 54 health care  workers participated in the discussion groups. The participants worked in  various health care practice areas, including home health, acute care,  mental health, and residential care. We asked the health care workers  about their experience with workplace violence, whether they received  workplace violence prevention training, the factors they consider when  deciding whether to report an incident to their employer, the factors that  contribute to workplace violence, and what could be done to reduce these  incidents. We used their responses to identify themes and illustrative  examples. Methodologically, discussion groups are not designed to (1)  demonstrate the extent of a problem or to generalize results to a larger  population, (2) develop a consensus to arrive at an agreed-upon plan or  make decisions about what actions to take, or (3) provide statistically  representative samples or reliable quantitative estimates. Instead, they  are intended to generate in-depth information about the reasons for the  discussion group participants\u2019 attitudes on specific topics and to offer  insights into their experiences. Because of these limitations, we did not  rely entirely on the information collected from the discussion groups, but  rather used several different methodologies to corroborate and support  our findings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Summary of Findings from Research", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Labor", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Mary Crenshaw (Assistant  Director), Cathy Roark (Analyst-in-Charge), Hiwotte Amare, Carl Barden,  James Bennett, Rachael Chamberlin, David Chrisinger, Sarah Cornetto,  Lauren Gilbertson, LaToya King, Linda Kohn, Joel Marus, Ashley McCall,  Jean McSween, Kathy Leslie, Terry Richardson, Stacy Spence, Walter  Vance, and Kate van Gelder made significant contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: B", "paragraphs": ["Arnetz, J.
