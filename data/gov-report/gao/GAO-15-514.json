In focus groups, EO staff generally told GAO that these procedures were valuable tools to help them administer the tax law.", "However, there are several areas where EO's controls were not well designed or implemented. The control deficiencies GAO found increase the risk that EO could select organizations for examination in an unfair manner\u2014for example, based on an organization's religious, educational, political, or other views. Examples of internal control deficiencies GAO found include the following:", "Staff could deviate from procedures for some selection processes without executive management approval. GAO found that procedures for some processes\u2014such as applying selection criteria to organizations under consideration for review\u2014are not included in the IRM, as required by IRS policy. As a result, staff are not required to obtain executive management approval to deviate from these procedures. This increases the risk of unfair selection of organizations' returns for examination.", "EO management does not consistently monitor selection decisions. GAO found that IRS does not consistently monitor examinations and database files to ensure that selection decisions are documented and approved, to help ensure fairness. GAO's review of examination files found that approval of some selection decisions was not documented, as required by EO procedures. For example, GAO's analysis of a sample of files suggests that an estimated 12 to 34 percent of cases where staff initially selected an organization for examination, but ultimately decided not to perform the examination, were missing the indication of management approval of the final decision, as required in the IRM.

According to the EO  referrals manager, this is often because they did not contain enough  information or did not deal with tax issues (known as \u201cno issue\u201d  referrals). These numbers highlight the extent to which classifiers make  decisions outside of the committee review process.", "According to internal control standards, key duties and responsibilities  should be divided or segregated among different people to reduce the risk  of error. Spreading classification responsibilities for sensitive referrals to  more than one classifier could help decrease the potential influence of  any one classifier. Even if other safeguards are in place, having the same  individual initially classify all political activity or all high profile and church  referrals creates the potential for unfairness, particularly for referrals that  the classifier labels as \u201cno issue\u201d and therefore are not sent for committee  review.", "The lack of cross-training among the classifiers also creates concerns  about succession planning. For example, three of the five classifiers are  eligible for retirement, according to the EO referrals manager. Internal  control standards require that management should ensure that skill needs  are continually assessed and that the organization is able to obtain a  workforce that has the required skills that match those necessary to  achieve organizational goals. As a part of its human capital planning,  management should also consider how best to retain valuable  employees, plan for their eventual succession, and ensure continuity of  needed skills and abilities. The EO referrals manager agreed that they  should have a succession plan, but said that they are working with a  \u201cbare bones\u201d staff and do not have the resources to take time away from  current classifiers\u2019 duties for training. TE/GE executives agreed that  cross-training classifiers is ideal, but also stated that it is currently not  feasible given existing resources. However, without cross-training or  provisions for succession planning, EO is risking its ability to process  referrals upon the departure of one of its classifiers. It is inevitable that  classifiers will eventually need to be replaced. By completing some cross- training ahead of those departures, referrals classification could benefit  from overlapping specialties and spreading responsibility for classifying  sensitive referrals to reduce the potential for error and potential  unfairness."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Referral Committee Membership is Not Rotating as Required", "paragraphs": ["According to internal control standards, procedures that enforce  management directives, such as IRM requirements on the rotation of  staff, help ensure that management directives are carried out.  Management should also design and implement internal controls based  on the related costs and benefits. The IRM requires that committee  members rotate every 12 months, on a staggered schedule.", "The members of the referral review committees are not rotating every 12  months. Based on start dates for committee members provided by EO  and our database review, we found 87 percent of current committee  members were serving for more than a 12 month period, as of April 30,  2015. Specifically, current committee members who exceeded their 12-month tenures have been serving on the committees for an average of 34  months (see table 8). In addition, although not reflected in this table,  some committee members may have served on another committee prior  to their current term, according to the EO referrals manager. Our  database review showed that some committee members have served on  committees since 2009.", "Rotating staff may help ensure that a variety of staff serve on the  committees, which serve as a safeguard in the classification of political  activity and sensitive referrals. If the required committee rotation serves  as an internal control to address risks in the referrals examination  selection process, then by not following its procedures, EO has the  potential to fall short of its goal of fairness.", "Committee member volunteers are to be senior EO technical employees,  and should be solicited in an annual memorandum from the Director of  EO Examinations, according to the IRM. EO did not have records of an  issued memorandum soliciting volunteers, although all of the current  members are volunteers, according to an EO official. The EO referrals  manager told us that it is difficult to get volunteers because of the  potentially high volume of work, particularly for political activity referrals,  and the difficulty providing prospective committee members with an  estimate of the time commitment required. However, by not utilizing all  avenues for soliciting volunteers\u2014such as the memorandum from the  Director of EO Examinations\u2014EO is not reaching the pool of potential  volunteers and maximizing opportunities to rotate committee members.", "Yet management should also design and implement internal controls  based on the related costs and benefits. The current committee members  have likely developed an expertise in assessing these cases, and training  new members may require additional resources. Although a provision for  rotations is consistent with internal controls, it is possible that a rotation of  more than 12 months may suffice. If EO believes that to be the case, it  could revise the IRM accordingly."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Exempt Organizations unit (EO) is faced with the challenging task of  overseeing the diverse population of exempt organizations and enforcing  their compliance with the tax laws. EO\u2019s reliance on a variety of sources  and processes to select organizations\u2019 returns for examination  underscores the importance of it having a robust internal control system  to ensure selection fairness and integrity, in accordance with the Tax  Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE) division\u2019s mission. EO has  some controls in place that are consistent with internal control standards,  and has implemented some of these controls successfully. However,  there are several areas where EO\u2019s control system could be  strengthened, as noted by the control deficiencies identified in this report.  Many of these deficiencies pose a risk that could lead to returns being  selected, or not selected, for examination based on criteria or practices  that fall short of TE/GE\u2019s mission of ensuring fairness and integrity. For  example, internal controls monitoring is one way to help reduce risk, but  without consistent monitoring, there is the possibility returns could be  selected for unfair reasons.", "Control design improvements. To reduce the risk of returns being  selected unfairly, EO could make several improvements to its  examination selection control design. Formalizing additional procedures  in the Internal Revenue Manual (IRM) would ensure coverage using  standards that dictate when deviations from selection procedures are  appropriate, and would increase transparency. Ensuring that all  procedures are current and accurate would reduce the risk of employees  following incorrect procedures and administering tax laws inconsistently.  Enhancing both the monitoring of database files used to document  examination selection decisions and monitoring the content of  examination files would increase EO management\u2019s ability to address and  rectify problems such as missing signatures, errors in applying criteria,  and inappropriate justifications for case selection or dismissals\u2014each of  which might result in case selection decisions inconsistent with TE/GE\u2019s  mission. Improving tracking of closed examination files would have  multiple benefits, including facilitating congressional oversight. More  consistent documentation and approval of criteria in EO\u2019s project files  would reduce the risk that inappropriate selection criteria could be  developed. Finally, more accurate coding of examinations would reduce  the risk of ineffective or inefficient resource allocation decisions for  compliance activities.", "Control implementation improvements. EO could also make several  improvements to control implementation that would reduce the risk of  returns being selected unfairly. Maintaining up-to-date EO database  documentation of data element definitions used to track case selection  would reduce the risk of inaccurate use of data elements. Additionally, EO  has the opportunity to provide cross-training for referrals classifiers and to  quickly benefit from their resulting skills enhancements. This would allow  shared responsibility for reviewing political activity and sensitive referrals,  and also could reduce the potential for unfairness. Providing training for  classifiers currently onboard, rather than waiting until a classifier departs  and it becomes a necessity, would help preempt a significant void of  knowledge and an increased backlog of work. Finally, rotating the staff  who serve on referral review committees would help ensure that a variety  of staff serve on committees, providing a safeguard for maintaining  fairness and objectivity in the classification of political activity and  sensitive referrals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To better ensure the Exempt Organization (EO) unit\u2019s adherence to the  Tax Exempt and Government Entities (TE/GE) division\u2019s mission of  \u201capplying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all\u201d in selecting exempt  organizations to review or examine, we recommend that the  Commissioner of Internal Revenue direct EO to take the following nine  actions:  1.
