However, the report is not fully reliable because the data were captured and reported using different methods, hindering comparability across the department. Specifically, the Energy Report addressed six, partially addressed four, and did not address two reporting requirements. For example, the Energy Report addressed the requirement to describe actions taken to implement DOD's energy performance master plan, partially addressed the requirement to describe progress to meet various energy goals (it described progress for three of five required goals), and did not address the requirement to describe the types and amount of financial incentives received. The Energy Report correctly reflected data provided by the military services and defense agencies. However, the military services and defense agencies used different methods for capturing and reporting on data in the Energy Report such as on energy consumption and projects. These inconsistencies resulted from guidance that was either unclear or lacking. For example, DOD did not provide guidance on reporting end-of-fiscal-year energy data; thus, the military services and defense agencies used different reporting methods. Without clear guidance for reporting data consistently, it will be difficult for DOD to have reliable data to plan effectively to reach energy goals, and Congress will have limited oversight of DOD's energy consumption and difficulty in comparing energy projects.", "The military services generally help ensure energy security (the ability to continue missions in the event of a power outage) at their energy-remote military installations in Alaska and Hawaii by providing access to multiple power sources. However, GAO identified areas of risk to energy security regarding installation electricity systems, high energy costs, and funding. GAO found that the military services addressed some risks by conducting studies on integrating renewable energy into electricity systems and identifying alternative energy solutions to lower costs. However, military service efforts to incorporate energy security into funding decisions have been limited. The processes to evaluate projects for funding generally do not consider energy security in prioritizing those to receive funding, and officials from all four military services stated that there is no military service or DOD guidance related to evaluating projects for funding that focuses on energy security. As a result, six of the nine locations GAO visited in Alaska and Hawaii cited difficulty obtaining funding for energy security projects. For example, officials at the Air Force's Alaska Radar System said they have sought funding since 2002 to build a networked system of multiple fuel tanks at three off-grid locations that each have only one fuel tank, but they said energy security projects do not compete well against other projects, such as those for new facilities. Navy officials similarly stated that energy security projects\u2014which have significant infrastructure costs\u2014do not compete well for funding against energy conservation efforts based on return on investment. Without clarification of the processes used to compare and prioritize projects for funding to include consideration of energy security, it will be difficult for decision makers to have sufficient information to adequately prioritize energy security projects for funding when appropriate and thus address energy security issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends, among other things, that DOD revise its guidance for producing the Energy Report and clarify funding processes to include consideration of energy security.

This situation\u2014which ultimately affects all data  presented in the Energy Report\u2014occurred because guidance was either  unclear or lacking. In previous work examining, among other things,  DOD\u2019s efforts to effectively implement existing guidance, we found that  clear and complete guidance is important for its effective  implementation. Without collecting and reporting data using consistent  methods, decision makers in DOD will be hindered in their ability to plan  effectively for steps to reach energy goals, and Congress will have limited  oversight of the department\u2019s energy consumption and difficulty in  comparing energy projects among those reporting.", "Energy consumption of tenants and hosts. At several installations,  DOD components may serve as either tenants, in which they rent  space from another federal agency or a private organization, or hosts,  in which they lease space to other agencies or organizations. The  Energy Report guidance states that a host will report energy  consumption, unless there is a mutual agreement between the host  and the DOD tenant to report otherwise. However, we found that  limited instructions in the guidance led to different reporting  methodologies among and within the military services and defense  agencies regarding tenant and host energy reporting. The guidance  did not state that the military services or defense agencies should  identify if they were tenants or hosts at each installation, how much  energy they were reporting for tenants, or if they were splitting  reporting among different energy types, such as having the host  report all electrical consumption but the tenant report water and  petroleum consumption. For example, for facilities in which the  Defense Intelligence Agency served as tenants, the facilities either  reported all energy consumption or did not report any energy  consumption, assuming instead that the host would report. In contrast,  all tenant facilities from the Defense Commissary Agency reported  energy consumption that was separately metered or billed and  assumed that the host reported energy consumption that was not  separately billed. As a result, it is difficult to get a clear understanding  of all the data presented in the Energy Report and challenging to  compare it among the installations that reported. Figures 3 and 4  identify some of the different reporting methods used by the four  military services and 10 defense agencies for tenant and host energy  reporting.", "Energy projects. The Energy Report lists energy conservation,  renewable energy, and water conservation projects. However,  throughout the report we found that the four military services and 10  defense agencies reported these projects inconsistently (see fig. 5)  because the guidance for the Energy Report does not identify at what  levels they should be reported. Entities reported energy projects by  installation, facility/building, project type, funding mechanism, or other  means. For example, the Navy stated that it might consolidate 10  smaller solar energy projects into 1 larger solar project for reporting  purposes, whereas the Marine Corps stated that it does not track by  project type but rather by installation, building, and energy type.  These different methods of reporting energy projects make it difficult  to clearly understand the size and scope of the projects as well as  compare the projects among those reported.", "End-of-fiscal-year data. We found that the military services and  defense agencies used a variety of methods for reporting their end-of- fiscal-year energy data\u2014and, in some cases, installations within each  military service reported their end-of-fiscal-year energy data using  different methods. For example, because OSD requires data inputs by  mid-November, some military services required initial submissions  from the installations by mid-October, which is before some energy  utility bills have been received. As a result, some installations  estimate end-of-fiscal-year usage, and the estimates may be based  on different factors, including previous month data, historical data, or  data from a month with similar weather patterns. Additionally, because  utility bills may straddle months (such as from mid-September through  mid-October), some military services and installations chose to report  according to the utility bills rather than the fiscal year. In contrast,  some installations have meters installed and report actual usage for  the fiscal year. Figure 6 identifies the different methods used by the  four military services and 10 defense agencies to report end-of-fiscal- year data.", "In our review of actual energy consumption data from a  nongeneralizable sample of installations, we found some examples of  how different methods of collecting data led to different reporting  results. For example, the Navy\u2019s Joint Base Anacostia Bolling in  Washington, D.C. used estimates to determine its annual energy  costs. In contrast, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service,  National Reconnaissance Office, and Defense Contract Management  Agency each reported actual fiscal year usage, not estimates.  However, the Energy Report did not annotate when estimates were  used. Furthermore, installations used different approaches to estimate  end-of-fiscal-year data. For example, Navy installations used previous  year data to make their estimates while some Air Force installations  estimated based on a specific month with similar weather patterns. As  a result, the data presented throughout the Energy Report cannot be  reliably compared among the military services and defense agencies.", "The guidance for the energy report did not identify how the military  services and defense agencies should report energy data when it  cannot reflect actual amounts for the full fiscal year. Additionally, the  guidance did not identify how corrections can be made, if at all. For  example, Navy officials told us they reported estimated consumption  for all installations in the initial submission to OSD, and that although  updated data was available by the December data quality review  process with OSD, they were not allowed to make corrections  because the estimated data had already been reviewed. By not  providing guidance on how to report energy data when an installation  cannot reflect actual data for the full fiscal year for the Energy Report,  it is difficult to accurately compare data among the military services  and defense agencies.", "OSD officials told us that they do not include additional instructions in the  guidance for the Energy Report to the military services and defense  agencies regarding energy consumption of tenants and hosts, energy  projects, and end-of-fiscal-year data collection and reporting. In some  cases, OSD officials stated that it would be difficult to provide guidance.  For example, they stated that each installation may receive utility bills at  different intervals, such as monthly or quarterly, making it challenging to  provide specific guidance on how to accurately report energy  consumption for the end of the fiscal year. However, currently there are  no instructions that require installations to identify their end-of-fiscal-year  reporting methods so that OSD, the military services, and the defense  agencies can identify if different reporting intervals exist.

Additionally, given its mission importance,  officials told us the Navy\u2019s Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii has a  backup diesel generator plant that can start automatically in case of a grid  failure. Furthermore, officials stated that the Army recently reached an  agreement with Hawaiian Electric Company to build a 50 megawatt power  plant in the interior of Oahu on Army land. According to Army officials, this  new power plant could potentially provide power if a weather emergency  shuts down the island\u2019s coastal power plants. Moreover, Air Force  officials in Hawaii told us that Kaena Point, a satellite tracking station, has  an Air Force-owned diesel power plant onsite that provides back-up  generation. This power plant is designed to start automatically when the  grid goes down, and it can provide power to the base for about 40 days  without refueling. In addition, officials at Joint Base Elmendorf- Richardson, Alaska, stated Fort Richardson has significant redundancy  through its onsite landfill gas electrical generation plant which, in  combination with back-up generators, can provide complete energy  independence from the municipal electrical grid for 2 weeks in the event  of an emergency (see fig. 7).", "We also found that the energy officials at all nine locations we visited or  contacted stated they are generally prepared to respond to energy  disruptions that might occur, although we found that the level of  documentation for energy security planning at energy-remote locations  varies across installations. An OSD Energy Policy Memorandum  requires that defense managers and commanders (1) conduct energy  vulnerability analyses and review for currency annually, (2) establish  energy emergency preparedness and operations plans, and (3) develop  and execute remedial action plans to remove unacceptable energy  security risks. We found differences among installations in regard to  documentation of their plans. For example, Marine Corps Base Hawaii  has a full energy emergency preparedness and operations plan and  remedial actions plans. Officials at U.S. Army Garrison Hawaii, by  contrast, stated that the Garrison does not have any documented energy  emergency preparedness and operations plans. Army officials stated the  response to an energy emergency would depend on the situation, and  they have the expertise to respond if needed. Officials at Eielson Air  Force Base, Alaska, stated that the installation does not have a formal  energy emergency preparedness and operations plan, but they receive  quarterly vulnerability analyses from the inspector general\u2019s office and  have a contingency response plan in the case of a power outage.  However, in cases where an installation did not have formal or specific  energy security documentation, we found that the requirements of the  OSD Energy Policy Memorandum were incorporated into installation-wide  plans, such as continuity of operations plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Areas of Energy Security Risk Remain, and the Military Services Are Taking Some Actions to Mitigate Them", "paragraphs": ["During our site visits in Alaska and Hawaii, we identified three areas of  risk to energy security regarding funding, installation electricity systems,  and cost. Specifically, we found that military services\u2019 funding processes  may limit energy security projects\u2019 ability to compete for funding, the  introduction of renewable energy may affect installation electricity  systems, and the high cost of energy may be difficult for installations to  sustain over the long term.", "First, we found that military services\u2019 funding processes may limit the  ability of the installations to obtain funding for energy security projects.  DOD Directive 4180.01, DOD Energy Policy, states that it is DOD policy  to, among other things, improve energy security and that the Deputy  Undersecretary of Defense for Installations and Environment should  ensure cost-effective investments are made in facility infrastructure to,  among other things, enhance the power resiliency of installations. In  addition, DOD Instruction 4170.11, Installation Energy Management,  states that DOD components shall take necessary steps to ensure the  security of energy and water resources.", "However, across the military services, officials told us that energy security  projects do not compete well for funding because there is no clarity  regarding the role that energy security plays in military service processes  when evaluating a project for funding. In May 2014, we reported that the  military services use \u201cscoring\u201d processes to consider projects for funding.  During these \u201cscoring\u201d processes, DOD officials assign numerical  values\u2014or \u201cpoints\u201d\u2014to certain project characteristics; potential projects\u2019  relative scores are used to rank the projects; and senior decision makers  at the military services\u2019 headquarters review the rank-order list, selecting  projects based on service priorities. However, energy security is  generally not included in this list of project characteristics. In addition,  since energy security projects are not identified in the decision-making  processes, there is no way of knowing how many of the projects do not  obtain funding.", "Officials at six of the nine locations we visited or contacted cited difficulty  obtaining funding for energy security or would like to see dedicated  funding for energy security projects. For example, officials overseeing the  Air Force\u2019s Alaska Radar System stated that they have sought military  construction funding since 2002 to build a networked system of multiple  fuel tanks, referred to as a tank farm, at three off-grid locations that each  has only one large fuel tank. According to officials, if any of the current  tanks were to fail, then the sites would lose all of their fuel for the year  (see fig. 8). Officials stated that the projects would replace the large fuel  tank with a multi-tank system. However, the officials said they are having  difficulties obtaining funding because energy security projects do not  compete well against other military construction projects, such as those  for new facilities or mission-critical activities. According to officials, the  tanks are now close to the point of failure. Also, an official at Marine  Corps Base Hawaii stated that difficulty getting funding for aging  equipment is the biggest vulnerability to the energy system. According to  the official, plans to replace the aging equipment keep getting postponed  in order to provide for other funding priorities. This official also noted that  if older energy equipment is broken, it can be difficult to find  replacements. In addition, Army officials at Fort Wainwright in Alaska  stated that it is difficult to obtain military construction funding for current  mission needs, including energy security projects, versus new mission  needs. Navy officials at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam also stated that  the energy security projects they submit for funding do not compete well.  For example, they said that energy security projects\u2014which have  significant infrastructure costs\u2014do not compete well for funding against  energy conservation efforts based on return on investment.", "Additionally, all four military services\u2019 energy headquarters offices told us  that there is no specific military service or OSD guidance or clarity on  energy security funding. As a result, military service officials told us that  they had difficulty incorporating energy security into funding decisions.  For example, Air Force officials stated that the Air Force Civil Engineer  Command wanted to allow for a tradeoff between cost effectiveness and  energy security when considering a new renewable energy project that  could incorporate energy security features, such as a microgrid. However,  the officials said they do not yet have the right criteria to define that  tradeoff and to conduct that level of decision making. Moreover, a Marine  Corps Headquarters official stated that, although the Marine Corps has a  process in place to identify energy security vulnerabilities and mitigating  actions, it can be difficult to get funding for energy security projects  because there is no DOD requirement for energy security. In other words,  there is no specific DOD requirement that identifies the level of energy  security an installation should have. The official further stated that energy  security projects, such as a microgrid or power plant, cannot compete  well against energy efficiency or renewable energy projects that have a  return on investment. Army officials similarly noted that energy security  projects do not compete as well as other projects for funding based on  return on investment, and it would be helpful to have criteria (project  characteristics) for energy security project funding consideration. The  Navy has made limited efforts to incorporate energy security into funding  decisions, but officials told us that the efforts are rudimentary. For  example, the Navy\u2019s energy-Return on Investment tool, which it uses to  assess energy projects, considers energy security in its calculations.  However, a Navy Headquarters official told us that energy security is  considered a \u201csoft benefit,\u201d or benefit that is not the central focus of the  project, and that it is difficult to fund a large project based only on soft  benefits.", "Officials at installations told us that, without clarification of how energy  security is considered in military service funding decisions, they have to  try different approaches in their attempts to fund energy security projects.  For example, Navy officials in Hawaii stated that they tried for 10 years to  get funding for grid consolidation at the Pacific Missile Range Facility, but  were not able to until it was shown that grid consolidation will allow the  base to potentially build and then hook up to a landfill gas renewable  energy plant. In Alaska, Air Force officials stated that difficulties obtaining  military construction funding have led Air Force officials to work with  attorneys at the Pacific Air Force Command to assess the viability of  alternative sources of funding to build tank farms at the three off-grid  Alaska Radar System locations that have only one large fuel tank each.  However, as we have previously reported, alternatives to military  construction funding have limitations, may vary in availability, and can be  complex and time-consuming. As a result, this approach may not result  in a funded project, or it may ultimately take longer than the traditional  military construction process to fund a project. Without clarification of the  processes the military services use to compare and prioritize projects for  funding to include consideration of energy security, it will be difficult for  decision makers to have sufficient information to adequately prioritize  energy security projects for funding when appropriate and thus address  energy security issues.", "Second, we found that the introduction of renewable energy sources may  affect the stability of remote or small installation electricity systems, but  the military services are taking some steps to address this risk. DOD  Directive 4180.01 calls for the diversification and expansion of DOD  energy supplies and sources, including renewable energy sources.  Military service officials we spoke with generally stated that it is difficult to  integrate intermittent sources of renewable energy (e.g., solar and wind  power) into existing infrastructure. For example, in Hawaii, Navy and  Army officials stated that because the amounts of intermittent renewable  energy can vary significantly, it can cause fluctuations in power quality  such as voltage and frequency on small or isolated electricity systems,  which can damage equipment connected to them. These officials noted  that the amount of electricity generated from solar and wind systems can  vary significantly with ambient conditions such as cloud cover and wind  speed. In Alaska, Air Force officials explained that many of the radar sites  are in locations rated with high potential for wind turbines. However, the  officials said the wind is too turbulent at these locations, such that the  wind has knocked down a wind turbine prototype that was developed.  Furthermore, even if wind energy generation was an option, the officials  explained that because the microgrids at these sites are so small, adding  wind turbines for electrical generation could cause disruptions in the  electrical frequency of the grid.", "Despite the potential challenges with integrating renewable energy  sources at energy-remote installations, officials told us that efforts are  underway, including studies on the incorporation of intermittent energy  sources, to continue to increase the use of renewable energy resources  at these locations and mitigate the integration risks. For example, officials  at Marine Corps Base Hawaii told us that they reached out to the Naval  Facilities Engineering Command to conduct studies within the next year  to enable the installation to incorporate its expanding production of  renewable energy. The installation is currently in the process of executing  a power purchase agreement for two megawatts of solar photovoltaic  arrays on rooftops and car ports. Almost all of the installation housing is  owned by a private developer and has solar photovoltaic panels on the  rooftops. Marine Corps Base Hawaii is working on an agreement with the  developer to purchase excess solar photovoltaic power generated from  the housing. In addition, Marine Corps Base Hawaii is conducting a grid- modeling study\u2014expected to be completed in a year\u2014to see the effect of  integrating solar energy into the energy system.", "Third, we found that the high cost of energy at remote locations may be  difficult for installations to sustain over the long term and thus could affect  overall mission assurance across the department, but DOD has  conducted studies or taken actions to reduce costs. DOD Directive  4180.01 states that it is the department\u2019s policy to, among other things,  mitigate costs in its use and management of energy. Army officials at  Fort Greely in Alaska told us that their biggest challenge is the high cost  of energy and expressed concern that it may become increasingly difficult  for the Army to sustain the high costs in the long term. Paying these high- cost energy bills could potentially force the military services to make  tradeoffs in a constrained budgetary environment. Fort Greely officials  stated that the Army hired a contractor to conduct a study to identify  alternative energy solutions to lower costs and still provide energy  security. Officials at Fort Wainwright also mentioned the high cost of  utilities, noting that they pay $79 per ton for coal\u2014more than double the  U.S. average price for coal. They stated that it was the primary reason  for hiring the same contractor as Fort Greely to identify alternative energy  options for their installation as well. Both studies were completed in  August 2015 and identified numerous potential energy conservation  measures and recommendations. As of September 2015, senior Army  officials were reviewing the recommendations to determine which to  implement. In Hawaii, Navy officials told us that high oil prices in 2008  greatly increased the energy costs at Joint Base Pearl Harbor Hickam,  such that the base temporarily had to shut down some facilities because  the energy costs were too high. Since then, officials stated the Navy has  instituted renewable energy projects and energy conservation efforts to  help lower energy costs. Also, Air Force officials stated that they are  concerned with the high cost of energy, which ranges from $75,000 to  $100,000 per month, at Kaena Point in Hawaii, and they are working to  lower costs through energy conservation efforts to help ensure access to  electricity in the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The ability of DOD to effectively manage energy at its installations is an  important element of mission assurance, and comprehensive  measurement of facility energy could help the department maintain an  aggressive pace toward its larger energy objectives.

However, DOD\u2019s process for preparing the Energy Report did not ensure  it addressed all the statutory requirements. In addition, while DOD has  taken steps to help ensure data quality in its Energy Report, the military  services and defense agencies capture and report using different  methods; thus, data are not comparable. Without reexamining the  process for producing the Energy Report to help ensure it fully complies  with statutory requirements, providing more consistent guidance to the  installations, and identifying in the Energy Report instances in which data  may not be comparable among the military services and defense  agencies and the reasons why, it will be difficult for decision makers in  DOD to plan effectively for steps to reach energy goals, and Congress will  have limited oversight of the department\u2019s energy consumption and  difficulty in comparing energy projects among those reporting.", "Moreover, the ability of the military services to effectively secure energy  at their energy-remote installations is essential to avoid serious and  potentially crippling operational impacts. The military services have taken  reasonable steps, such as conducting studies on the incorporation of  intermittent renewable energy sources and identifying alternative energy  solutions, to overcome grid stability issues and high energy costs.

In the case of any conflicting  determinations, a third GAO analyst adjudicated the difference. To gain a  full understanding of the elements included in the Energy Report and to  discuss the methodology used for collecting information and reporting on  the required elements, we met with DOD officials knowledgeable about  compiling information for the report, including individuals from the Office  of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)\u2014specifically, the Assistant Secretary  of Defense for Energy, Installations, and Environment; the four military  services; and the 10 defense agencies that contributed to the report. We  also compared information in the fiscal year 2013 Energy Report to that in  the fiscal year 2014 Energy Report, which was published in May 2015, to  evaluate if the structure and content of each report was similar.

We also interviewed the officials who  contributed to the report from OSD, the four military services, and the 10  defense agencies regarding how the data was collected, measures taken  to assure the reliability of the data, and any anomalies observed in the  data.", "In addition, we sent a structured questionnaire to knowledgeable officials  from the four military services and 10 defense agencies to collect  information about how facilities within each military service and defense  agency reported energy consumption, energy projects, and September  2013 end-of-fiscal-year energy consumption data included in the Energy  Report. We received responses from all of the military services and  defense agencies. Additionally, as part of the questionnaire, we asked the  military services and defense agencies to provide data from a  nongeneralizable sample of installations regarding September 2013  energy consumption reported in the Energy Report and actual energy  consumption used, as verified via utility bill or meter reading. To  determine our sample, we collected a random sample of 10 installations  each from the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Defense Commissary Agency;  5 installations from the Marine Corps; and all installations from the  remaining defense agencies in our scope. To minimize errors that might  occur from respondents interpreting our questions differently than we  intended, we pre-tested the questionnaire with knowledgeable  representatives from one military service (Army) and one defense agency  (National Reconnaissance Office). During these pre-tests, we discussed  the questions and instructions with the officials to check whether (1) the  questions and instructions were clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms  used were accurate, (3) the questionnaire was unbiased, and (4) the  questionnaire did not place an undue burden on the officials completing it.  We also submitted the questionnaire for review by an independent GAO  survey specialist.

First, to review  interconnectedness, we conducted preliminary research on the U.S.  electric power system. We determined that Alaska and Hawaii have  limited interconnectedness because they are not connected to the three  power grids in the 48 contiguous states, which are interconnected to each  other. Moreover, the electrical systems in Alaska and Hawaii are not  connected to each other. Second, once we identified these states, we  attempted to further narrow the scope by determining which areas in  Alaska and Hawaii are less \u201celectrically robust\u201d (smaller number of power  plants and transmission lines in the area surrounding the installation or no  connectivity to transmission lines\u2014e.g., an installation that uses diesel  generators for primary power) and therefore more energy-remote. Using  mapping software, we created maps of Alaska and Hawaii using layers of  data (transmission lines, power plant data, and military installations  location data). Additionally, we sent a questionnaire to each installation in  Alaska and Hawaii to gather preliminary information, including the  presence and location of the designated facility energy manager or  another official who is tasked with performing the duties of the facility  energy manager, the source(s) of electricity consumed on site, the  amount of electricity consumed on site during fiscal year 2014, the  supplier of this electricity, the existence (if any) of an energy security plan  focused on utility resilience in case of an electrical disruption, whether an  energy security assessment has been conducted, and whether there are  plans to develop an energy security plan or conduct an energy security  assessment in the future. Based on our assessment, all 26 installations in  Alaska and 35 installations in Hawaii were included in our scope.
