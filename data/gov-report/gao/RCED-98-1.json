Approximately 12 percent, or about $143 million, of FEMA\u2019s temporary housing assistance to about 400,000 households was distributed through an expedited process known as \u201cFast Track.\u201d The Fast Track process differed from the regular temporary housing assistance process in that for applications from certain designated zone improvement plan (ZIP) code areas, FEMA issued checks to the applicants before conducting physical inspections of the applicants\u2019 residences to verify their eligibility.

FEMA used the \u201cModified Mercalli Intensity\u201d (MMI) scale, which measures the intensity of earthquake shaking on a scale of 1 to 12\u2014the more severe the shaking, the higher the number. The most severe shaking in Northridge was at level 10; FEMA decided to use the Fast Track process for applicants residing in each ZIP code area with an MMI level of 8 or above. The degree of damage associated with this level includes the partial collapse of ordinary-quality masonry; the fall of chimneys, factory stacks, monuments, towers, and elevated tanks; and the movement of frame houses on their foundation if not bolted down. (A description of MMI intensity levels is in app. II.)", "FEMA officials selected a total of 68 ZIP codes to designate as eligible geographic areas with MMI readings of level 8 or higher. This designation covered an approximately 40-by-40 mile area from Santa Monica and Burbank westward into Simi Valley. FEMA initiated the Fast Track process for Northridge victims in the 68 designated ZIP code areas on January 23, 1994; limited it to applicants in only three ZIP code areas on February 3, on the basis of an analysis of the degree of damage reported by field inspectors and the temporary housing applications received; and discontinued it altogether on April 7.

Individuals are eligible for crisis-counseling services if they were residents of the designated disaster area or were located in the area at the time of the disaster and are experiencing mental health problems caused or aggravated by the disaster. States must apply for crisis-counseling funds. The magnitude of need is based primarily on a formula that takes into account such factors as the numbers of fatalities, injuries, homes destroyed or damaged, and unemployment resulting from the disaster. FEMA makes the funds available to the Center for Mental Health Services (CMHS), which awards grants to applicant states (typically to the state\u2019s department of mental health). The state, in turn, disburses funds to local governments, which fund the activities of private organizations actually providing the counseling services. In the case of the Northridge earthquake, California\u2019s Department of Mental Health was the grantee, while Los Angeles and Ventura counties contracted with 51 service providers and oversaw their day-to-day activity.

Assistance can be provided for up to 18 months from the time of the disaster declaration unless an extension is granted because of extraordinary circumstances. (42 U.S.C \u00a7 5174(a)(3)). No statutory provision, however, requires that FEMA verify that the applicants have met all relevant conditions of eligibility prior to providing temporary housing assistance.

In the case of Northridge, FEMA concluded that the Fast Track process was essential to meet the needs of disaster victims expeditiously. The enormous number of disaster victims and their psychological and physical need for immediate assistance provided the rationale for implementing the Fast Track process. After the earthquake, FEMA\u2019s on-site disaster application centers and teleregistration center were overwhelmed by the unprecedented number of applicants. Because the application centers received more applicants than could be accommodated, FEMA gave applicants appointments to come back at a later date. Even so, by the end of the first month after the disaster, nearly 360,000 applications had been filed, and the backlog of housing inspections had grown to about 189,000 residences.", "Within the first week of the January 17, 1994 disaster, over 27,000 disaster victims were living in or outside of shelters, and appointments to submit applications for assistance were not available until mid-March. Police intervention was required at application centers to help contain unruly crowds. On January 21, 4 days after the disaster, the President visited the disaster scene and, noting the long lines of applicants, decided that the situation was unacceptable.

Hence, a large-scale future disaster could lead FEMA to use a Fast Track approach again. FEMA has not developed written guidance for implementing the Fast Track process, even though FEMA\u2019s Inspector General recommended establishing formal procedures after its first use in 1992.

Because FEMA intended that applicants under the Fast Track process receive a check before an inspection occurred, FEMA officials had to develop a way of overriding the automated system. While FEMA was able to accomplish this, the resulting records are not entirely reliable because of inconsistent data.

Also, several FEMA officials had concerns about Fast Track\u2019s vulnerability to fraud, waste, and abuse; hence, formalizing guidance for the process may not have been a priority because of the uncertainty about its future use.

Subsequently, the cases are turned over to a collection agency and the Treasury Department. Nearly all currently overdue Fast Track payments from the Northridge disaster designated for recovery have reached this point. The Treasury Department then begins garnishing the debt from the recipient\u2019s federal payments (e.g., social security checks, income tax refunds, etc.).

For example, the table includes some payments designated for recovery because the recipient later received insurance proceeds for the same needs. Such payments were made under both the regular housing assistance and Fast Track processes and designated for recovery regardless of whether they were made under the Fast Track process. Furthermore, the above figures represent only those recoveries made after the cases were turned over to the Disaster Finance Center for collection.

Prior to Northridge, each FEMA region handled its own recovery efforts. At about the same time as Northridge, the recovery process was centralized at FEMA\u2019s Disaster Finance Center near Berryville, Virginia. Also, until recently, FEMA referred its uncollectible debts to the Internal Revenue Service only. Now they are referred to both the Department of the Treasury for offset and the Department of Justice for possible prosecution.

Additionally, some time was probably lost in transferring the collection responsibility from FEMA\u2019s regional offices to the Finance Center.

FEMA\u2019s National Processing Services Center\u2019s ADAMS database contained information on additional recoveries, but we were unable to extract this information from the ADAMS database. Our information thus omits some early cases in which disaster victims returned housing assistance funds. The archiving of paper documentation of housing assistance applications, inspections, and grants to an unstaffed repository near San Francisco limited our review to the information contained in these databases.

When a state applies for assistance, the Secretary of Agriculture may approve the issuance of food stamps for up to 30 days to qualifying households within the disaster area. The disaster food stamp program is different from Agriculture\u2019s regular food stamp program in that certain criteria used in determining eligibility for the disaster program are relaxed when determining eligibility. For example, regular requirements to verify criteria such as residency in the disaster area (as opposed to the project area for the regular program), work requirements, household members\u2019 social security number, and the availability of financial resources, are either not included as criteria or verified \u201cwhere possible.\u201d After the food stamps have been distributed, the applicants\u2019 files are then reviewed to identify problems, such as whether applicants received duplicate benefits. The state agency in charge of disseminating the assistance conducts this post-disaster review of a 10-percent sample of cases, up to a maximum sample size of 1,200 cases.", "The second program is administered by HUD, which provides housing assistance to disaster victims in the form of rental certificates or vouchers that are used by eligible families to rent housing units in privately owned rental housing. The assisted households may live in rental units of their choice as long as the units meet HUD\u2019s standards for rent and quality. Generally, local public housing agencies administer the program, providing landlords with rent payments in compliance with a housing assistance payment contract between HUD and the owner. Two significant differences between the FEMA and HUD housing assistance programs are that the HUD program contains income eligibility requirements\u2014the program is targeted only to very-low-income families\u2014and it generally provides the assistance over a longer period of time. HUD\u2019s income eligibility requirements are based on annual gross income and family size, and the assistance is guaranteed for a period of up to 18 months.", "While HUD normally verifies the income eligibility requirements of applicants, for severe disasters such as the Northridge earthquake, the Department allowed housing agencies to issue housing certificates without first fully verifying the applicants\u2019 income eligibility.
