GAO examined (1) how spending per episode of care for certain high-cost procedures varies across geographic areas for private payers, and (2) how the mix of service types, and the volume, intensity, and price of services contribute to variation in episode spending across geographic areas for private payers. Using a large private sector claims database for 2009 and 2010, GAO examined spending by MSA for episodes of care for three commonly performed inpatient procedures and examined spending by hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, postdischarge, professional, and ancillary service categories. For inpatient and professional services, GAO examined the volume, intensity, and price of services. GAO's findings may not be generalizable to all private insurers due to data limitations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Spending for an episode of care in the private sector varied across metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) for coronary stent placement, laparoscopic appendectomy, and total hip replacement, even after GAO adjusted for geographic differences in the cost of doing business and differences in enrollee demographics and health status. MSAs in the highest-spending quintile had average adjusted episode spending that was 74 to 94 percent higher than MSAs in the lowest-spending quintile, depending on the procedure. MSAs with higher spending on one procedure generally had higher spending on the other two procedures. High- or low-spending MSAs were not concentrated in particular regions of the nation.", "The price of the initial hospital inpatient admission accounted for 91 percent or more of the difference in episode spending between MSAs in the lowest- and highest-spending quintiles. The price of the initial admission was the largest contributor to the difference for two reasons. First, it represented the largest percentage of adjusted episode spending. For example, for total hip replacement, the average price of the initial admission was $17,134, representing 76 percent of the $22,463 in total episode spending for MSAs in the lowest-spending quintile and $30,332, representing 82 percent of the $36,969 in total episode spending for MSAs in the highest-spending quintile. Second, the price of the initial admission varied considerably across MSAs. For MSAs in the highest-spending quintile, the average price of the initial admission for total hip replacement was 77 percent higher than for MSAs in the lowest-spending quintile. Professional services\u2014office visits and other services provided by a physician or other health professional\u2014were the second largest contributor to geographic differences in episode spending, but accounted for 7 percent or less of the difference in episode spending between MSAs in the lowest- and highest-spending quintiles. (See table.) MSAs in the highest-spending quintile had higher average prices and intensity (a measure of the resources needed to provide a service) but fewer services (volume) than MSAs in the lowest-spending quintile for all three procedures.", "The Department of Health and Human Services provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["National health expenditures are projected to grow from $2.8 trillion in  2012 to over $5 trillion in 2023, outpacing gross domestic product (GDP)  growth over this period, and accounting for almost 20 percent of GDP by  2023. The United States spends significantly more on health care than  any other nation, yet health outcomes in the United States are not  necessarily better than those of other nations with lower spending.  Further, research on U.S. health care spending has shown that spending  can vary by geographic area and that this variation remains even after  accounting for important differences across areas, such as differing  health status of populations and differing costs of doing business. Studies  have also shown that higher spending is not always associated with  better quality of care. As U.S. health expenditures continue to rise, there  is widespread interest among policymakers and others in improving their  understanding of drivers of spending and in learning more about where  and how health care systems operate efficiently\u2014that is, provide  equivalent or higher quality care while maintaining or lowering current  spending levels.", "While researchers have developed a substantial body of work on  geographic variation in Medicare spending, less research has been done  on geographic variation in private sector health care spending.  Researchers have primarily focused on Medicare spending because of  the availability of Medicare spending data. However, private sector  spending on health care accounts for about one-third of U.S. health  expenditures and more comprehensive private sector data has become  available in recent years. Additional research on private sector spending  will provide important contributions to an overall understanding of  geographic variation in health care spending.", "A useful framework for exploring geographic variation and reasons behind  geographic spending differences is examining spending within an episode  of care\u2014defined as the care and services provided for a specific medical  problem, condition, or illness during a specific time period. Using the  episode, we can examine the contribution of components that drive  spending variation. These components include the mix of services  provided\u2014hospital inpatient, hospital outpatient, physician and other  professional services, postdischarge, and ancillary services\u2014and the  volume, intensity, and price of those services. the reasons for higher or lower spending in certain areas may provide  insights into the policy options that are most likely to be effective at  promoting efficiencies and cost savings.", "You asked us to examine geographic variation in private sector health  care spending. We examined how spending per episode of care for certain high-cost procedures  varies across geographic areas for private payers and how the mix of service types, and the volume, intensity, and price of  services contribute to variation in episode spending across  geographic areas for private payers.", "Volume is the number of services used, and intensity is the resources needed to provide  a service\u2014for example, a 30-minute office visit has greater intensity than a 15-minute  office visit. episode spending by metropolitan statistical areas (MSA). We created  episodes based on an inpatient admission for each of the following  procedures: coronary stent placement, laparoscopic appendectomy, and  total hip replacement. For the years we analyzed in the private sector  database\u20142009 and 2010\u2014these procedures were commonly performed  and associated with high levels of national spending. These procedures  also represent different medical specialties. In addition, we selected  hospital-based procedures because the United States spends more  nationally on hospital services than any other type of health care service.  To create the episodes, which included all services from the day of  admission to 30 days after discharge and certain services in the 3 days  prior to admission, we used private sector health insurance claims and  enrollment data from the Truven Health Analytics MarketScan\u00ae  Commercial Claims and Encounters Database for 2009 and 2010. This  database contains claims for over 50 million enrollees paid by over 100  private insurers across 50 states and the District of Columbia in 2009 and  2010. We assigned episodes to MSAs based on the location of the  hospital inpatient admission, keeping only MSAs that had a sufficient  number of episodes to support our analyses. We calculated unadjusted  spending by using the payment amounts on the claims. We then adjusted  spending for geographic differences in the cost of doing business and  differences in the demographics and health status of enrollees in each  MSA. Using all MSAs included in our analyses, we determined the  distribution of average episode spending for each procedure, and, using  the 78 MSAs with a sufficient number of episodes for all three  procedures, we calculated the extent to which MSAs with high or low  episode spending for one procedure also had high or low episode  spending for another procedure.", "To examine how the mix of service types, and the volume, intensity, and  price of services contribute to variation in episode spending across  geographic areas, we calculated and reported on differences in these  components for the 78 MSAs with a sufficient number of episodes for all  three procedures, focusing on MSAs in the lowest- and highest-spending  quintile for each procedure. We analyzed the mix of service types by  assigning all spending within an episode to one of five service categories:  (1) hospital inpatient, (2) hospital outpatient, (3) postdischarge,   (4) professional, and (5) ancillary. For hospital inpatient and  professional services, we also examined volume, intensity, and price of  services. For hospital inpatient services, we measured volume as the  number of days in the hospital stay, and we measured price by the  amount spent on the initial hospital inpatient admission (which excluded  spending on any subsequent readmissions), because hospitals are  generally paid one amount per admission regardless of the patient\u2019s  length of stay or the services delivered. For professional services, we  measured volume as the number of services provided, and we measured  intensity by using the relative value unit (RVU), which is an estimate of  the resources needed to provide a given service. We calculated the  price per unit of intensity by dividing average spending on professional  services by the total units of intensity (number of RVUs) associated with  those services. See appendix I for a more detailed description of our  methodology.", "We assessed the reliability of the MarketScan database by reviewing  documentation, discussing the database with knowledgeable officials, and  performing data reliability checks, and we determined the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "Our study had some limitations. We reported results only for those MSAs  in which we had a sufficient number of episodes to ensure the reliability of  our results for each procedure, but our results included MSAs that  constituted a majority of the U.S. population. Depending on the  procedure, 60 to 63 percent of the U.S. population lives in the MSAs  included. In addition, although we chose procedures that were  commonly performed and associated with high levels of national  spending, our results may not be generalizable to other procedures not  included in our analysis. Also, while the data used for our analyses were  from one of the largest private insurance data sources, the data did not  include all private payers and are not necessarily representative of the  private health insurance market in the United States. As such, our  findings may not be generalizable to this broader private health insurance  market. For example, in 2009 and 2010, the percentage of enrollees in  the data were disproportionately from large self-insured firms, which tend  to have more generous benefit packages compared with other payers,  and they were also disproportionately from the South. Finally, 2009 and  2010 data do not reflect the impact of more recent policy or other  changes potentially affecting private sector health care spending, such as  the implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.", "We conducted our work from January 2012 to December 2014 in  accordance with all sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that  are relevant to our objectives. The framework requires that we plan and  perform the engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to  meet our stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work.

For example, in a recent  comprehensive assessment of geographic variation in private sector  spending, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) reported on the presence of  substantial spending variation, concluding that a large amount of the  variation remained unexplained after adjusting for enrollee demographic  and health status factors, insurance plan factors, and market-level  factors, and suggesting that inefficiency is one of the causes of the  current levels of variation. Using private sector claims data from two  nationwide databases from 2007 through 2009, IOM found unadjusted  spending for the area at the 90th percentile was 36 to 42 percent higher  than the area at the 10th percentile, depending on the database used.", "The spending differences existed at all levels of geography IOM studied,  including MSAs, and these differences persisted over time. IOM also  found that price is a major determinant of geographic variation in the  private sector, and estimated that, after adjusting for underlying costs,  price accounted for 70 percent of the geographic variation in private  sector spending. The researchers attributed the large impact of price in  explaining private sector geographic spending variation to the relatively  strong market power of providers in some areas.", "Other studies, including one by GAO, have reached similar conclusions.  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission (MedPAC) examined  geographic variation in private sector spending and estimated that in  2008, hospital inpatient spending for the MSA at the 90th percentile was  90 percent higher than for the MSA at the 10th percentile. MedPAC also found that spending for physician services varied, but less so than  hospital inpatient spending. Physician spending at the 90th percentile was  50 percent higher than that at the 10th percentile. Early work by GAO  analyzing 2001 private sector claims in the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program also found substantial geographic variation in private  sector hospital inpatient prices, physician prices, and spending.", "IOM also found that areas with relatively high prices tended to have  relatively low utilization and vice versa. In addition, IOM found that private  sector utilization varied more for some service types than others. For  example, emergency department use was 50 to 100 percent higher for  the area at the 90th percentile of utilization relative to the 10th percentile,  and hospital outpatient visits were 30 to 46 percent higher. In addition,  consistent with other research, use of discretionary services varied  substantially. For example, the utilization rate for hip replacement,  considered a discretionary procedure, for the area at the 90th percentile  was 53 percent higher than the area at the 10th percentile, and other  discretionary procedures, such as hysterectomies, lower back surgeries,  and nuclear stress tests, had even larger differences.", "Researchers from the National Institute for Health Care Reform recently  examined geographic variation in spending for hip and knee replacement  episodes of care using 2011 claims data for autoworkers and their  dependents in nine geographic areas in six states.  They defined  episodes as those beginning with a hospital admission and including all  services up to 30 days postdischarge. Average spending per episode  across the nine markets ranged from below $25,000 in Louisville,   However, variation  Kentucky, to above $30,000 in Buffalo, New York.across the 36 hospitals within these markets varied more than twofold,  and all but one of the markets had a lower-spending hospital option,  defined as having average episode spending below $25,000. To get a  broader measure of variation in episode spending, these researchers also  examined all episode types across hospitals. The spending variations  observed for knee and hip replacements held true for other conditions,  and hospitals with high spending for one service line (cardiology,  orthopedics, etc.) were also likely to have high spending for other service  lines. In addition, the price of the initial hospital stay accounted for more  than 80 percent of the variation in overall spending. Variation in the prices  and volume of physician and other services together accounted for less  than one-tenth of the variation in episode spending. These researchers  noted that reasons for higher-priced hospitals in some areas included  their provision of specialized service lines that other nearby hospitals did  not offer, being part of a local hospital system with greater bargaining  clout, having unusually good clinical reputations, and being part of a large  teaching hospital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Episode Spending Was 74 to 94 Percent Higher in Highest- Compared with Lowest-Spending Areas, with High- Spending Areas Generally High for All Three Procedures Episode Spending Was 74 to 94 Percent Higher in the Highest- Compared with Lowest-Spending Areas, Depending on Procedure", "paragraphs": ["We noted variation in episode spending across MSAs for all three  procedures, even after adjusting for geographic differences in the cost of  doing business and differences in demographics and health status of  enrollees in each MSA.
