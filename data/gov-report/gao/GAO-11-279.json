In April 2004, CDC published the results. However, an inaccurate statement and incomplete descriptions of the limitations of the analyses resulted in confusion about CDC's intended message. GAO was asked to examine (1) CDC's actions to clarify its published results and communicate current knowledge about the contribution of lead in tap water to elevated blood lead levels (BLL) in children and (2) CDC's changes to its procedures to improve the clarity of the information in its public health communications. GAO reviewed CDC communication policies and procedures and interviewed CDC officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CDC officials told GAO that although the agency does not have a policy to monitor the use of or clarify information in public health publications, the agency took actions to address confusion it created related to the 2004 Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR) article about elevated lead levels in Washington, D.C., tap water. For example, in 2008, CDC officials contacted District of Columbia Water and Sewer Authority officials requesting corrections to a statement in a fact sheet published by the water authority that incorrectly characterized information from the 2004 MMWR article. In addition, CDC also published articles in the 2010 MMWR intended to clarify the confusion, such as a June 25, 2010, article that discussed limitations about how information in the 2004 article could be used. While CDC took these actions, among others, to clarify confusion about the effect of elevated lead levels in District tap water, as of January 2011, CDC had no plans to publish an overview of the current knowledge about the contribution of elevated lead levels in tap water to BLLs in children, as suggested by a CDC internal incident analysis of issues surrounding the 2004 MMWR article. CDC officials told GAO they had begun an initiative and revised procedures designed to help ensure the accessibility and clarity of CDC public health communications, both agencywide and in the National Center for Environmental Health, the center responsible for lead poisoning prevention programs. For example, under the new initiative, CDC will revise existing procedures to help ensure that information that CDC publishes, such as guidelines and recommendations, is easily accessible by a common portal on CDC's Web site. While the initiative and revised procedures focus on making CDC information more accessible and on preventing errors or unclear statements in CDC communications, they do not include actions to address confusion that may arise after information is published, such as occurred with the 2004 MMWR article. Without agency procedures specifically addressing how and when to take action about confusion after publication, CDC runs the risk of inconsistent responses across the agency when its published information is not interpreted as CDC intended. CDC's mission to promote the nation's public health relies on its credibility in presenting accurate, reliable, and timely information. Communicating the agency's current knowledge about the health effects of lead levels in tap water and developing procedures that allow it to address confusion in a timely, consistent manner could improve the public's understanding of the effect of lead in water and help CDC mitigate the risk of confusion in other situations and protect its credibility."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations to CDC: (1) publish an article providing a comprehensive overview of tap water as a source of lead exposure and communicating the potential health effects on children and (2) develop procedures to address any confusion after information is published.

For the second recommendation, while CDC described procedures it is developing, the agency did not explicitly address all components of the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In February 2004, the District of Columbia Department of Health  (DCDOH) requested assistance from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) to assess the effects of elevated lead levels in the city\u2019s  residential tap water on the city\u2019s residents. Elevated levels of lead in tap  water can result in elevated blood lead levels (BLL), which can cause  adverse health effects in adults and children. CDC, an agency in the  Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for  developing lead poisoning prevention programs and policies, and  collaborating with federal and state partners, health departments, and  health care providers to prevent lead poisoning. CDC assists state and  local partners in developing laboratory-based surveillance systems for  BLLs among children and assists states in the analysis and dissemination  of lead surveillance data.

On   April 2, 2004, CDC published the preliminary results in an article in the  Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), the agency\u2019s primary  vehicle for disseminating public health information. MMWR is intended to  provide information that is timely, reliable, and accurate. However,  according to CDC officials, the article inaccurately stated that no children  had BLLs over CDC\u2019s established level of concern, when in fact some  children\u2019s BLLs exceeded that level. Specifically, despite stating that \u201cno  safe BLL has been identified\u201d for children, the article indicated that  although lead in tap water contributed to a small increase in BLLs in the  District, no children were identified with BLLs above CDC\u2019s established  level of concern, even in homes with water lead levels that were greatly in  excess of Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards.  Additionally, CDC officials have stated that the MMWR article did not fully  describe limitations on how the results should be interpreted and used. In  a June 2010 article in a District newspaper, CDC\u2019s Director said that CDC  communicated scientific results poorly in the 2004 MMWR article and that  as a result the article \u201cmay have led some people to improperly minimize  concerns about lead exposure and conclude that lead in the water had  never been a problem.\u201d Examples of confusion regarding the seriousness  of the health risks include a news report in which a District official was  quoted as saying that CDC\u2019s view was that residents\u2019 health had not been  affected by elevated water lead levels in the District, and a news report  from another city, which cited the article to downplay the seriousness of  the effect of elevated water lead levels in the city on the health of children.

Specifically, an official from the Office of the Director told us that the CDC  Office of the Associate Director of Science has begun an initiative to revise  existing procedures to help ensure that information that CDC publishes,  such as guidelines and recommendations, is easily accessible by a  common portal on CDC\u2019s Web site. As of January 2011, CDC officials were  still determining what type of CDC products and communication methods  would be included in the initiative. In addition, CDC officials told us that  NCEH, the center responsible for lead poisoning prevention programs and  the 2004 MMWR article, had revised its clearance procedures for certain  products, including those submitted to the MMWR, in an effort to ensure  that the information presented is accurate and clear. CDC officials said  that the revised NCEH clearance procedures are more rigorous and  systematic and include requirements for additional peer review of some  products, as well as review of some products by the Office of the Director,  to help ensure that senior officials are aware of the products. For example,  CDC documents that include major scientific findings or conclusions  representing scientific breakthroughs or that directly contradict previous  science that served as the basis for public health policy will be elevated to  the Office of the Director for review. The officials said that the agency  believes the initiative and revised procedures will help to mitigate the risk  of other communications being subject to the type of confusion or  misinterpretation surrounding the 2004 MMWR article. As of January 2011,  CDC did not have time frames for completing the Office of the Director\u2019s  initiative.", "Despite the agency\u2019s current actions to strengthen review of CDC  communications prior to publication, CDC officials said that neither the  initiative nor the revised procedures will include actions to address  confusion after publication. For example, if CDC becomes aware that  information is being interpreted incorrectly, the procedures will not direct  CDC staff to reach out to newspapers or other entities that have published  the information to request corrections or clarifications. The importance of  having procedures for this type of outreach was noted in the internal  incident analysis, which stated that when CDC messages are not on target  or are misinterpreted, such as happened in reaction to the 2004 MMWR  article, CDC should respond in appropriate visible forums to publicly and  expeditiously correct itself or correct those who are interpreting the  message. Further, neither the initiative nor the revised procedures will  include any postpublication review of certain types of communications  that are similar to the 2004 MMWR article, such as those that are published  in an expedited time frame and address urgent or high-profile issues, to  determine whether corrections or clarifications are needed based on how  the communications have been interpreted or used. Because CDC does not  have procedures for addressing confusion after publication, the agency  runs the risk that its staff will provide inconsistent responses to  interpretations of its information that differ from what CDC intended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Although CDC has taken some belated actions to clarify confusion related  to the 2004 MMWR article on BLLs of residents in the District, the agency  does not plan to publish a comprehensive review of the role of tap water  as a source of lead exposure that would communicate what is known  about the contribution of lead in water to elevated BLLs in children. A goal  of the Healthy People 2020 initiative is to eliminate elevated BLLs in  children. Although significant progress has been made in reducing lead  exposure from lead-based paint and leaded gasoline, CDC has an  opportunity to refocus its efforts toward accomplishing this Healthy  People 2020 goal and to make a significant contribution to scientific  literature by clearly describing what is known about the effect of lead in  tap water on BLLs in children.", "CDC\u2019s credibility as the nation\u2019s premier public health agency relies on  presenting accurate, reliable, and timely information to the public.  Information that is inaccurate or unclear in a CDC public health  publication could result in confusion\u2014such as resulted when some  readers understood the 2004 MMWR article to state that elevated lead  levels in tap water were not a concern in the District or in their area\u2014and  could undermine the agency\u2019s credibility. The potential for presenting  confusing information may increase when the agency has to respond  quickly, as it did when it published the 2004 MMWR article 6 weeks after  the DCDOH requested CDC\u2019s assistance. When CDC presents potentially  confusing information and does not respond in a timely or consistent  fashion to clarify confusion following publication of a public health  product, the agency runs the risk that an incorrect interpretation of the  intended message could put the public at risk of adverse health effects,  such as those that result from elevated water lead levels. CDC can mitigate  the risk of such misinterpretations as well as the resulting risk to its  credibility by developing procedures that allow it to address confusion in a  timely, consistent manner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are recommending that the Director of CDC take two actions, the first  to clarify confusion about the contribution of lead in tap water to elevated  BLLs, and the second to improve the clarity of CDC\u2019s published  information on public health issues.  1.  Publish an article in an MMWR Recommendations and Reports that  conveys what is known and not known about tap water as a source of  lead exposure and communicates the potential health effects in  children of elevated lead levels in water in consultation with EPA, as  appropriate. 2.  Develop procedures to review previously published information and  determine whether additional information should be published to help  ensure the correct understanding of the public health message. The  procedures could include criteria to use when deciding how to  respond in certain situations, such as the event in the District, in which    CDC learns of confusion about the public health message and  determines that clarification or additional information should be  published or    CDC issues or releases a product in an expedited time frame or based  on uncertain or incomplete information and determines additional  information should be published to clarify the original public health  message, even if there is no evidence of confusion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["CDC reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments,  which are reprinted in appendix V.

While CDC previously stated that  it had no plans to publish such an article, it stated in its written comments  that it now plans to publish an article in an MMWR Recommendations and  Reports that will focus on what is known about tap water as a source of  lead exposure and summarize the potential health effects in children from  lead exposures.", "Related to our second recommendation to develop procedures to review  previously published information and determine whether additional  information should be published to help ensure the correct understanding  of the public health message, CDC said it planned to adopt several  procedures for taking action when the agency becomes aware of  confusion about its message. CDC\u2019s written comments indicated that these  procedures will be effective when approved by the CDC Director.  Specifically, CDC stated that when appropriate, it may take actions to  address significant errors of understanding or perception resulting from  public health information disseminated by the agency. For example, for  errors of understanding or perception in which there is a persistent, broad,  or otherwise significant misinterpretation of information in a public health  product, CDC will present the scientific conclusions in clear language in  several ways, such as a posting on the CDC Web site or by direct outreach  to the news and electronic media, including via press releases or letters to  the editor. However, within these procedures, CDC did not explicitly  address situations where CDC issues or releases a product in an expedited  time frame or based on uncertain or incomplete information and  determines additional information should be published to clarify the  original public health message, even if there is no evidence of confusion. It  is important that CDC take this additional step in order to help ensure that  the agency can address confusion in a timely manner and thereby mitigate  risk to the public\u2019s health or the agency\u2019s credibility.", "CDC also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
