However, these rates remained about double the rates of charter schools nationally and slightly higher than D.C. traditional public schools and were also disproportionately high for some student groups and schools. Specifically, during this period, suspension rates in D.C. charter schools dropped from about 16 percent of all students to about 13 percent, and expulsions, which were relatively rare, went down by about a half percent, according to GAO's analysis. However, D.C. Black students and students with disabilities were disproportionately suspended and expelled. For example, Black students represented 80 percent of students in D.C. charter schools, but 93 percent of those suspended and 92 percent of those expelled. Further, 16 of D.C.'s 105 charter schools suspended over a fifth of their students over the course of school year 2015-16, according to D.C. data.", "Note: Numbers may not add to 100 due to rounding.", "The Public Charter School Board (PCSB) regularly uses several mechanisms to oversee charter schools' use of suspensions and expulsions. For example, PCSB reviews school-level data and schools' discipline policies to encourage schools to reduce reliance on suspensions and expulsions to manage student behavior. Several D.C. agencies have roles in overseeing charter schools and reported collaborating on other issues, but we observed a lack of consensus around roles and responsibilities regarding charter school discipline. Further, a plan to issue regulations addressing discipline disparities among D.C. public schools was unsuccessful because the D.C. agency that planned to issue the regulations was unsure of its authority to do so. Absent a coordinated plan to continue progress in reducing discipline rates in charter schools, as well as clarified roles, responsibilities, and authorities of D.C. agencies with respect to oversight of discipline in charter schools, continued progress may be slowed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making two recommendations, including that D.C. education agencies collaborate on a plan to further reduce discipline rates and make explicit agency roles, responsibilities, and authorities regarding charter school discipline.

The large and disproportionate numbers of suspensions and expulsions  for some students in our nation\u2019s K-12 schools has received national  attention. This matter has prompted Education, in conjunction with the  U.S. Department of Justice (Justice), to issue guidance encouraging  states, school districts, and public schools, including charter schools, to  limit the use of suspensions and expulsions, as these practices\u2014known  as exclusionary discipline\u2014remove students from the classroom and  reduce their instruction.", "In the District of Columbia (D.C. or the District), which has the fourth- largest proportion of its students enrolled in charter schools of any U.S. city, the U.S. Secretary of Education has raised questions about the rates  of suspensions and expulsions at some charter schools\u2014public schools  established under charters that are granted autonomy from certain state  and local laws and regulations in exchange for increased accountability.  The entity with primary oversight of charter schools in the District, the  Public Charter School Board (PCSB), was established by the District of  Columbia School Reform Act of 1995. The District of Columbia  Appropriations Act, 2005, as amended, includes a provision for GAO to  conduct a management review of PCSB every 5 years, including its  oversight of charter schools. In this report, we examine 1) what is known  about suspensions and expulsions in D.C. charter schools, and 2) to what  extent PCSB oversees the use of suspensions and expulsions at charter  schools.", "To determine what is known about suspensions and expulsions in D.C.  charter schools and compare them to national rates, we analyzed  Education\u2019s biennial Civil Rights Data Collection (CRDC) for school years  2011-12 and 2013-14, the most recent years for which national data are  available. The CRDC is a comprehensive source of data on suspensions  and expulsions that collects comparable data across the nation\u2019s public  school districts, schools, and students. As such, we used the CRDC to  make comparisons between D.C. charter schools, D.C. traditional public  schools, and traditional and charter schools nationally. PCSB also  collects information on suspensions and expulsions in D.C. charter  schools, but these data are not comparable to CRDC data on schools and  students in other states. At the time we did our work PCSB had data that  were more recent than data available through the CRDC (school year  2014-15 for PCSB versus 2013-14 for CRDC). We therefore chose to  present PCSB\u2019s data in selected analyses in the report, while also being  careful not to make comparisons between the PCSB and CRDC data. In  its written comments on a draft of this report, PCSB noted the recent  availability  of data for the 2015-16 school year. We updated our analyses  accordingly to provide the most current picture of D.C. charter school  discipline rates. Doing so did not materially change the findings in this  report. PCSB provided us with these data on each charter school, which  are part of data that the District collects annually on both charter schools  and traditional public schools. We determined that the data from both  datasets were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report by  reviewing documentation about the systems used to produce the data,  conducting electronic testing, and interviewing Education and D.C.  officials. As part of our data analysis, we also examined whether certain  school characteristics\u2014such as school type (charter versus traditional)  and the racial composition of the student body\u2014were associated with a  higher incidence of suspensions in D.C. schools using a regression model  based on the 2013-14 CRDC. In order to obtain charter school  perspectives on reasons for high discipline rates in some schools, we  conducted interviews with officials at three charter schools, selected  because two had high discipline rates and one had reduced its formerly  high discipline rates, according to D.C. data. These schools also  represented variation on other school factors such as grades served and  academic performance.", "To determine the extent to which PCSB oversees suspensions and  expulsions at D.C. charter schools, we reviewed documentation and  guidance from PCSB as well as federal and District laws and regulations.  We also reviewed documentation from other D.C. education agencies and  Education. We interviewed PCSB officials, as well as officials at other  D.C. agencies that have oversight responsibility for charter schools,  including the Office of the State Superintendent of Education (OSSE), the  District\u2019s state educational agency; the Deputy Mayor for Education; and  the State Board of Education, including the Ombudsman for Public  Education and the Chief Student Advocate. Further, to obtain additional  context and insights, we selected and interviewed researchers and  officials from advocacy groups and associations with different  perspectives on charter schools and discipline. Finally, we reviewed  selected research studies that provided further context and insight into  school discipline in charter schools.

Charter schools in D.C. serve  students ranging from pre-kindergarten (pre-K) through grade 12. D.C.  charter schools offer a range of focuses and specialized curricula, such  as foreign language immersion or a focus on serving students who have  not been successful in traditional public school settings. For the vast  majority of public charter schools, students enroll through D.C.\u2019s common  lottery system, My School DC.", "D.C. charter schools, like all public schools, must comply with various  laws governing the education of children, including those pertaining to  individuals with disabilities, civil rights, and health and safety conditions.  Further, in January 2014 guidance, Education and Justice stated that  school districts that receive federal funds must not intentionally  discriminate on the basis of race, color, or national origin, and must not  implement any policies that have the effect of discriminating against  students on the basis of race, color, or national origin. In addition, charter  schools are to be held accountable for their financial and educational  performance, including the testing requirements under the Elementary  and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), as amended. In D.C., all  charter schools are nonprofit organizations and are required to be  governed by a board of trustees. Members of the board of trustees are  selected according to terms laid out in the school\u2019s charter, and the board  assumes a fiduciary role and sets the overall policy for the school.", "Some D.C. charter schools are part of larger charter school networks that  have schools in other states, such as KIPP or BASIS Schools. While  some charter schools are managed by charter management  organizations\u2014which may handle, for example, curriculum development,  teacher recruitment and training, and operational support services for the  charter school\u2014other charter schools are single-school networks and  operate without such an entity. In the 2015-16 school year, there were  114 charter schools in D.C., run by 65 different organizations. In the  District, each charter school or group of charter schools functions as its  own local educational agency (LEA), both for purposes of Title I of  ESEA, and other purposes. As such, each charter school or group of  charter schools is responsible for a wide range of functions associated  with being an LEA, such as applying for certain federal grants and  acquiring and maintaining facilities. PCSB officials told us that each  charter LEA also has the autonomy to establish its own discipline policies  and suspend and expel students. Officials from the State Board of  Education also told us that, unlike D.C. traditional public schools, charter  LEAs are not subject to the discipline policies and procedures in D.C.  municipal regulations.", "As shown in figure 1, charter schools and traditional public schools in  D.C. both serve a largely Black population. In the 2013-14 school year, 80  percent of the students in charter schools were Black, compared to 67  percent in traditional public schools in the District. Both charter and  traditional public schools in D.C. serve much higher percentages of Black  students compared to schools nationally, reflecting D.C.\u2019s large Black  population.", "With respect to students with disabilities, D.C. charter schools serve  slightly lower percentages of these students than D.C. traditional public  schools, but D.C. charter schools and D.C. traditional public schools both  serve slightly higher percentages of these students than their national  counterparts (see fig. 1). The Individuals  with Disabilities Education Act  (IDEA) contains specific procedures that govern the discipline of IDEA- eligible students with disabilities. In 2016, Education issued two pieces  of \u201csignificant guidance\u201d relevant to these students. The first emphasizes  the importance of using IDEA\u2019s individualized education program (IEP)  and placement provisions to provide needed positive behavioral  interventions and supports and other strategies to address the behavior of  a student whose behavior impedes his or her learning or that of others.  The guidance explains that these supports are especially important in  light of research showing the detrimental effects of disciplinary  suspensions, both short- and long-term, on students with disabilities.  The second guidance document emphasizes that charter schools have  the same obligation as other public schools to provide IDEA-eligible  students with these supports, as well as all other protections under the  law. In addition, Education noted in this guidance that it expects that a  charter school authorizer will be able to ensure that any charter school  that it authorizes complies with the terms of its charter, as well as  applicable federal and state laws, including IDEA and other civil rights  laws.

PCSB is also required to submit an annual report that  includes information on charter renewals, revocations, and other actions  related to public charter schools. (See app. V for more information on  PCSB\u2019s annual reporting.) The School Reform Act allows PCSB to grant  up to 10 charters per year. Each charter remains in force for 15 years.  After 15 years in operation, if a school desires to renew its charter, it is  required to submit a renewal application requesting to renew its charter  for another 15-year term. Charters may be renewed an unlimited  number of times. PCSB is also required to review each charter at least  once every 5 years to determine whether the charter should be revoked.", "PCSB itself is comprised of seven unpaid board members who are  appointed by the Mayor, with the advice and consent of the D.C. Council,  and who are to be selected so that knowledge of specific areas related to  charter schools is represented on the board. In addition, there are 37  employees who implement the board\u2019s policies and oversee charter  schools.

Further, students with disabilities under IDEA have specific  rights afforded under that statute. In particular, if a school proposes  suspending a student served under IDEA for more than 10 days, the LEA,  the student\u2019s parents, and relevant members of a child\u2019s IEP team must  conduct a review to determine whether the behavior in question is a  manifestation of the student\u2019s disability.

The three D.C. charter schools we visited all  engaged in these practices to some extent. For example, at one of the  three schools, officials said a student may be asked to stay home, but not  formally suspended, while the school investigates a behavior incident.  Such full-day removals from school should be reported as suspensions  under D.C. law, which defines out-of-school suspension as removing a  student from school for disciplinary reasons for 1 school day or longer.  At this school and the two others we visited, officials also said that when a  behavioral incident occurs, they may send a student home for the  remainder of the school day without issuing a formal suspension. Based  on D.C.\u2019s legal definition of suspension and PCSB reporting  requirements, these partial day removals would only be tracked in the  D.C. data if the student had a disability and was sent home for at least  half of the school day. PCSB officials told us they require charter schools  to follow the law in reporting suspensions and have discouraged schools  from using partial day removals as a way to avoid formal suspensions.

One charter school we visited fell into this category  and officials told us that their rates were high because they served many  students who had been encouraged to leave their previous schools  because of bad behavior. In addition, charter school officials in all three  schools we visited said that managing the behavioral issues of some  students with disabilities was one of the key discipline challenges they  faced. Officials at these schools also said that many of their students  have experienced trauma, which can manifest as behavior issues in the  classroom. All of these schools had hired or planned to hire more mental  health experts to better address these issues. However, officials at two  schools said they have had challenges obtaining additional mental health  resources and added that their staff could benefit from further training on  working with traumatized students.", "With respect to school discipline policies, PCSB officials also said that  many of the schools with high discipline rates are part of networks with  reputations for strict policies. For example, they said that one network  started with a \u201cno excuses\u201d discipline philosophy that encouraged  punishment for minor offenses, although their approach to discipline is  now changing. PCSB officials described another network that runs D.C.  charter schools with high suspension rates as having an \u201celaborate\u201d  behavior management system, which uses 1-day suspensions as an  anchor of their discipline system. The network does not see their high  suspension rate as a problem because their policy does not keep  students out of school for a long time, and, according to school officials,  helps correct student behavior. PCSB officials said they conducted an  analysis which found no correlation between 1-day suspensions and  withdrawal rates. However, several other stakeholders we interviewed  told us that some parents have withdrawn their children from so-called  \u201cno excuses\u201d charter schools out of frustration because of the multiple  suspensions their child received.

At the three charter schools we visited, all of the officials said  they took steps to reduce their suspension rates and create a more  positive environment to reduce behavior problems. For example, one  charter school official described an approach that incorporates empathy  and problem solving skills to address discipline, while keeping the student  in school. This school is part of an OSSE pilot program in which five D.C.  traditional public and charter schools receive on-site technical assistance  to implement such practices. An official at a second charter school said  that they were using interventions and supports that emphasize positive  behaviors to reduce incidences of discipline. (See text box.) An official  from the third school said that they have implemented an alternative to in- school suspensions when a student is disruptive, giving the student an  opportunity to reflect and continue classwork in a separate environment.  D.C. data for school year 2015-16 showed that discipline rates in these  three schools had declined from 2014-15, although suspension rates at  all three remained above the public charter school average, with one  school\u2019s suspension rate remaining above 30 percent.", "Alternatives to Exclusionary Discipline  Restorative Justice Practices: An alternative disciplinary approach which uses non-punitive disciplinary  responses that focus on repairing harm done to relationships and people. The aim is to teach students  empathy and problem solving skills that can help prevent the occurrence of inappropriate behavior in the  future. For example, officials at one school we interviewed described asking a student who stole a laptop to  \u201crestore\u201d his community by writing a reflection paper, as well as attend Saturday school, instead of being  suspended.  Positive Behavior Intervention and Supports: A schoolwide framework, which focuses on positive behavioral  expectations. By teaching students what to do instead of what not to do, the school can focus on the preferred  behaviors. At one school implementing this practice, officials told us they instruct teachers to note three  positive behaviors for every negative behavior, for each student.", "School officials told us that implementing changes to their discipline  practices and creating a more positive environment is time and resource  intensive and that full implementation would take several years.

In interviews, the Deputy Mayor for  Education (DME), OSSE, and PCSB officials described different views  regarding agency roles in overseeing charter schools and providing  guidance and training. In particular, officials described differing views on  the appropriate scope of PCSB\u2019s role with respect to charter schools. For  example, the DME\u2014whose role is to oversee District-wide education  strategy\u2014said that PCSB could issue further guidance on certain  discipline-related topics and place additional requirements on schools. In  contrast, officials from PCSB\u2014the entity charged with overseeing charter  schools\u2014told us that providing additional or more specific guidance  would be inconsistent with their role as authorizer.

In the report, OSSE said that this effort would address potential  discipline disparities across D.C. charter and traditional public schools  and help ensure that all public school students in the District are treated  fairly. However, OSSE never issued the regulations, and OSSE officials  told us in 2016 that, in contrast with previous administrations\u2019 interests, the current administration does not interpret the School Reform Act as  providing them with clear authority to issue such regulations. OSSE  officials also stated that the complexity of the D.C. regulatory framework,  combined with the fact that some regulations were promulgated prior to  the creation of D.C. charter schools, resulted in a lack of clarity around  their oversight authority over charter schools in some areas. OSSE did,  however, issue non-regulatory guidance in June 2016, which provides  high-level descriptions of federal and D.C. laws relating to school  discipline and cites some leading practices. It is unclear whether this  guidance will lead to any changes in charter schools\u2019 discipline rates.  Subsequent to releasing this guidance, OSSE released a new report in  2016, concluding that further progress is still needed on discipline policy,  implementation, and disproportionality across all D.C. public schools.", "Despite these challenges, officials from these three agencies and D.C.  traditional public schools have collaborated together on a key effort to  address discipline rates by publishing the Equity Reports for each charter  and traditional public school in the District.

PCSB  also commented on our analysis that used CRDC data to make  comparisons between D.C. charter school rates to those of charter  schools nationally.

We applaud  PCSB\u2019s efforts in steadily bringing down rates, as noted in the draft  report, and continue to believe that a coordinated multi-agency plan is  needed to continue this progress.", "In addition, PCSB said in its comments that our draft report failed to  acknowledge the autonomy granted to D.C. charter schools under the  School Reform Act, which it interprets as preventing any D.C. agency  from mandating charter school disciplinary processes. We believe that the  report clearly states that each charter LEA has the autonomy to establish  its own discipline policies and suspend and expel students, and that  unlike D.C. traditional public schools, charter LEAs are not subject to the  discipline policies and procedures in D.C. municipal regulations.

In making our  selections, we also took into consideration:  the number of LEA campuses in D.C., to get perspectives from large  and small charter school networks; grade levels served, because both research and stakeholders  indicated that discipline rates are higher for middle and high school  students than elementary school students; school location and demographics, to ensure that we spoke to schools  serving similar populations of students; and  rank in the 2014 Performance Management Framework (PMF), when  available, to get perspectives from higher and lower performing  schools.

Further, our model showed that D.C. charter schools overall  were associated with a higher incidence of suspensions than D.C  traditional public schools. However, our model also examined the  interactions between school type and school demographic variables and  found that the association between school type and suspension rate  varied across several demographic variables.
