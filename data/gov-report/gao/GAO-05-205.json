The MMA included incentives for sponsors of employment-based retiree health plans to offer prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees, such as a federal subsidy when sponsors provide benefits meeting certain MMA requirements. Plan sponsors cannot receive a subsidy for retired Medicare beneficiaries who enroll in part D. In response to an MMA mandate, GAO determined (1) the trends in employment-based retiree health coverage prior to the MMA and (2) which MMA prescription drug options plan sponsors said they would pursue and the effect these options might have on retiree health benefits. GAO identified trends using data from federal and private sector surveys of employers' health benefit plans and financial statements of 50 randomly selected Fortune 500 employers. Where data for Medicare-eligible retirees were not available, GAO reported data for all retirees, including Medicare-eligible retirees. To obtain plan sponsors' views about options they were likely to pursue, GAO reviewed the 50 employers' financial reports and interviewed benefit consultants; private and public sector plan sponsors, including the Office of Personnel Management for federal employees' health benefits; and other experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A long-term decline in the percentage of employers offering retiree health coverage has leveled off in recent years, but retirees face an increasing share of costs, eligibility restrictions, and benefit changes that contribute to an overall erosion in the value and availability of coverage. Although the percentages and time frames differed, two employer benefit surveys showed that the percentage of employers offering health coverage to retirees has declined since the early 1990s; this trend, however, has leveled off. The cost to provide retiree health coverage, including coverage for Medicare-eligible retirees, has increased significantly: one employer benefit survey cited double-digit increases each year from 2000 through 2003. Prescription drugs for Medicare-eligible retirees constituted a large share of retiree health costs. Employers and other plan sponsors have used various strategies to limit overall benefit cost growth that included increasing retiree cost sharing and premiums, restricting eligibility for benefits, placing financial caps on health care expenditures, and revising prescription drug benefits. Many plan sponsors had not made final decisions about which MMA prescription drug options they would choose for their Medicare-eligible retirees at the time of GAO's review. Specifically, 13 of the 15 private and public plan sponsors GAO interviewed were undecided for some or all retirees. However, most plan sponsors interviewed had chosen the federal subsidy option for some or all retirees or were considering the subsidy as one of several options. Alternatively, some plan sponsors that had set caps on their retiree health benefit obligations were considering supplementing (known as \"wrapping around\") the new Medicare prescription drug benefit for some or all retirees rather than providing their own comprehensive prescription drug coverage in lieu of the Medicare drug benefit. Also, some plan sponsors and benefit consultants said they were waiting to see how the market for other MMA options, such as Medicare Advantage plans, develops. About two-thirds of financial statements GAO reviewed for Fortune 500 employers reporting obligations for retiree health benefits had begun to reflect reduced obligations resulting from the MMA options. While plan sponsors contacted said they did not anticipate reducing their drug coverage in view of new coverage offered through the MMA, increasing health care costs might cause them to do so in the future. Benefit consultants and other experts interviewed said that the MMA was not likely to induce employers to begin to provide prescription drug coverage or to supplement the Medicare drug benefit if they had not previously offered retiree health coverage. In commenting on a draft of this report, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and four experts generally agreed with the report's findings. The Office of Personnel Management indicated that it has not made final decisions about which MMA prescription drug option it would choose for the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, but it does not expect to choose the subsidy option."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As prescription drug costs have continued to increase, many retired senior  citizens face significant out-of-pocket costs for prescription drugs.  Because the Medicare program as originally designed did not cover  outpatient prescription drugs, many beneficiaries relied on other sources  to cover the costs of drugs. About a third of all retired Medicare  beneficiaries obtained supplementary health benefits through plans  sponsored by former employers or other employment-based groups, and  most of these plans covered prescription drugs. However, most retired  Medicare beneficiaries, including those with employment-based health  plans, still relied to varying degrees on their own financial resources to  pay for prescription drugs. More broadly, there has been concern in recent  years about a long-term decline in the availability of employment-based  retiree health coverage. To help senior citizens with increasing  prescription drug costs and encourage employment-based retiree health  coverage, especially for prescription drugs, Congress passed the Medicare  Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) in  December 2003 that among other things, created a new prescription drug  benefit as part D of the Medicare program. The Medicare part D benefit  begins in January 2006. The MMA also established various options and  incentives to encourage sponsors of employment-based retiree health  plans to offer prescription drug benefits to retired Medicare beneficiaries.", "Once the Medicare drug benefit is available in 2006, employers and other  sponsors of health coverage will have several options to provide  prescription drug benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees. To encourage plan  sponsors to offer prescription drug coverage to retired Medicare  beneficiaries\u2014which they generally do on a voluntary basis\u2014the MMA  established a federal subsidy payment for plan sponsors that offer  comprehensive drug benefits meeting certain MMA requirements.3, 4  Subsidy payments will be available for each retiree who chooses to enroll  in the sponsor\u2019s plan in lieu of enrolling in part D. Alternatively, plan  sponsors can provide coverage that supplements (wraps around) the  retiree\u2019s Medicare part D prescription drug benefit and forgo eligibility for  the subsidy. Plan sponsors also have several other options for providing  prescription drug coverage to retired Medicare beneficiaries under the  MMA, such as contracting with private plans that provide standard or  enhanced Medicare part D prescription drug benefits.", "The MMA required that we conduct a study documenting trends in  employment-based retiree health coverage prior to the enactment of the  MMA, including coverage provided under the Federal Employees Health  Benefits Program (FEHBP), and the options and incentives available  through the MMA that could affect the voluntary provision of employment- based retiree health benefits.

To  supplement these sources and to obtain more in-depth information, we  interviewed officials at (1) 6 firms providing benefit consulting services  primarily for large public and private sector employers; (2) 12 Fortune 500  employers that sponsored retiree health benefit plans; (3) 3 public sector  sponsors of retiree health benefits, including the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM), which administers FEHBP; (4) 1 association  representing unions and 1 representing multiemployer plans that sponsor  retiree health benefit plans for unionized workers; (5) 2 associations  representing small to midsized employers; (6) 4 trade organizations,  including those representing large employers; and (7) 1 professional  organization for actuaries. We focused on trends particularly affecting  Medicare-eligible retirees, but in some cases when information specific to  Medicare-eligible beneficiaries was not available, we reported on trends  affecting all retirees, including those who were under age 65 and those  who were eligible for Medicare. To determine which MMA prescription  drug coverage options plan sponsors said they would likely pursue and  what effect these options might have on retiree health benefits, we relied  primarily on our review of the annual and quarterly financial statements  that 50 Fortune 500 employers filed with the SEC and on our interviews  with benefit consultants, private and public sector sponsors of  employment-based retiree health benefit plans, and other experts. We also  interviewed officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS), the federal agency that administers Medicare, to obtain  information on MMA prescription drug options for plan sponsors.

While these benefits vary by employer, they almost always include  prescription drugs and often cover both retirees under age 65 as well as  those eligible for Medicare. However, coverage can vary between these  groups of retirees. For example, premiums are often lower for those aged  65 and over because Medicare pays for certain costs, and cost sharing  requirements, which can make retirees more sensitive to the costs of care,  may differ. Plan types may also differ based on Medicare eligibility. For  example, some employers offer retirees under age 65 a preferred provider  organization (PPO) plan but offer a fee-for-service plan for retirees eligible  for Medicare. Regardless of the type of plan offered, retirees who have  employment-based coverage generally have a choice of more than one  plan.", "Plan sponsors typically coordinate their retiree health benefits with  Medicare once retirees reach age 65, with Medicare as the primary payer  and the plan sponsor as the secondary payer. Several types of  coordination occur between plan sponsors and Medicare. For example,  some plan sponsors coordinate through a carveout approach, in which the  plan calculates its normal benefit and then subtracts (or carves out) the  Medicare benefit, generally leaving the retiree with out-of-pocket costs  comparable to having the employment-based plan without Medicare.  Another approach used by plan sponsors is full coordination of benefits, in  which the plan pays the difference between the total health care charges  and the Medicare reimbursement amount, often providing retirees  complete coverage and protection from out-of-pocket costs.

According to OPM, average FEHBP  premiums increased by 11 percent in 2003, about 11 percent in 2004, and  about 8 percent for 2005.", "Prescription drug benefits represent a large share of plan sponsors\u2019 retiree  health costs, particularly for Medicare-eligible retirees. In 2002,  prescription drug costs were cited as a key driver of increases in  employment-based retiree health costs and were estimated to be typically  50 to 80 percent of an employer\u2019s total health care costs for Medicare- eligible retirees. According to 2001 MCBS data, prescription drug  expenditures for retired Medicare beneficiaries that were paid by  employment-based insurance accounted for 45 percent of all health care  expenditures for these beneficiaries. Three Fortune 500 employers we  interviewed reported that prescription drug costs for Medicare-eligible  retirees and their dependents ranged from approximately 56 to 64 percent  of their total estimated annual cost of providing health benefits for this  same population."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Sector Plan Sponsors\u2019 Cost-Cutting Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Faced with increasing costs, private sector plan sponsors have  implemented certain strategies to reduce these obligations that often  require retirees to pay more for coverage and contribute to a general  erosion in the value and availability of health coverage for retirees. For  example, many plan sponsors have increased cost sharing through  increased copayments, coinsurance, and premium shares; restricted  eligibility for benefits based on retirement or hiring date; implemented  financial caps or other limits on plan sponsors\u2019 contributions to coverage;  and made changes to prescription drug benefits, such as creating tiered  benefit structures and increasing retiree out-of-pocket contributions.  These cost-cutting strategies are not new\u2014in 2001 we reported that  employers had implemented similar mechanisms designed to control  retiree health care expenditures. However, according to private plan  sponsors we interviewed, the share of costs paid by retirees is increasingly  affected as the plan sponsors reach and enforce financial caps and other  limits they had set. While these strategies are intended to limit the increase  in plan sponsor obligations, the information provided by employer benefit  surveys and the plan sponsors and consultants we interviewed did not  specify the magnitude of any decrease in plan sponsors\u2019 costs for retiree  health benefits that could be attributed to these changes.", "Increasing Retirees\u2019 Cost Sharing. One strategy that plan sponsors  have adopted to limit their obligations for retiree health costs is increasing  the share of costs for which the retiree is responsible. For example,  employers have increased retiree copayments and coinsurance. When  asked about changes made \u201cin the past year,\u201d Kaiser/Hewitt reported that  nearly half of its surveyed private employers (1,000 employees or more)  had increased cost sharing. The majority of employers in the  Kaiser/Hewitt study reported that they expected to make similar increases  \u201cfor the 2005 plan year,\u201d with 51 percent indicating they were very or  somewhat likely to increase retiree coinsurance or copayments. These  increases are consistent with the changes cited in our interviews with  private employers and with officials we interviewed at other organizations,  including benefit consulting firms and an organization representing  unions. For example,    one employer we interviewed reported cost sharing increases for all  retirees every year since 1993;    another employer we interviewed introduced a mix of coinsurance and  copayment requirements in January 2004 to address rising health care  costs and make retirees more aware of the cost of the benefits they  received; and    a third employer we interviewed that had historically paid approximately  90 percent of total retiree health care costs was planning to increase the  share of costs borne by retirees who had retired prior to 1994 from  approximately 10 percent to 20 percent of health care costs by   January 1, 2006.", "Increasing Premiums. Increased contributions by retirees to health care  premiums is another area where plan sponsors have continued to make  changes to control their health care expenditures. Kaiser/Hewitt data  showed that 79 percent of surveyed employers had increased retiree  contributions to premiums in the past year, and 85 percent reported that  they were very or somewhat likely to increase these contributions for the  2005 plan year. Retiree contributions for new retirees aged 65 and over  increased, on average, 24 percent from 2003 to 2004, according to the  Kaiser/Hewitt study. The Mercer 2003 study reported that employers  varied retiree premium contributions, with Medicare-eligible retirees  paying on average about 38 percent of plan premiums when the cost was  shared between the employer and the retiree, an increase of  approximately 4 percentage points since 1999. Four of the 12 Fortune 500  plan sponsors we interviewed also reported changes to premiums. For  example, one plan sponsor made a change in 2004 to increase premiums  for all individuals retiring after January 1, 2004, consistent with increases  in premiums for active workers, whereas previously retirees kept the same  premiums for life. Officials we interviewed representing unions and their  members also cited increased premiums for many retired union workers.", "Some employers are also beginning to offer access-only coverage to some  or all retirees, in which employers allow retirees to buy into a health plan  at the group rate, but without any financial assistance from the employer.  For example, according to 2003 Mercer data, about 37 percent of retiree  health plans for employers with 500 or more employees required  Medicare-eligible retirees to pay the full cost of the employment-based  plan. Thirteen percent of the Kaiser/Hewitt employers reported making a  change in the past year to provide access-only coverage to retirees, with  retirees paying 100 percent of the costs. A supplement to the 2004  Kaiser/HRET survey examined the percentage of Medicare-eligible retirees  with access-only coverage and found that 5 percent of Medicare-eligible  individuals who are retired from employers with 200 or more employees  that offer retiree health benefits had such coverage. While 5 of the 12  Fortune 500 plan sponsors we interviewed had implemented access-only  coverage, 1 of these plan sponsors had implemented this level of coverage  for all of its retirees in the early 1990s in response to health care costs. The  other 4 plan sponsors had implemented the access-only change at a later  date, implementing it for some or all employees ranging from those hired  after January 1, 1995, to those retiring on or after January 1, 2007.", "Reducing Benefits for Future Retirees. Implementing access-only  coverage is often part of a broader movement by plan sponsors to restrict  eligibility or offer reduced benefits for employees who are hired or retire  after a certain date. In December 2004, Kaiser/Hewitt reported that   8 percent of surveyed employers (with 1,000 or more employees) said they  had made a change \u201cin the past year\u201d to eliminate their subsidized health  benefits for future retirees, typically for those hired after a specific date.  Of the 12 Fortune 500 plan sponsors we interviewed, 5 plan sponsors had  eliminated retiree health coverage for some or all individuals hired after a  certain date, ranging from January 1, 1993, to January 1, 2003, while 4 of  the 5 plan sponsors that had switched to providing access-only coverage  did so for some or all of their future retirees. Some plan sponsors said that  they generally avoided making changes for current retirees rather than for  future retirees, who may be in a position to make other arrangements. In  addition, plan sponsors generally tried to minimize the disruption when  making changes for those already in retirement. For example, one Fortune  500 plan sponsor we interviewed carried 15 separate health plans for  several years that had accumulated as the result of grandfathering in  current coverage levels for existing retirees. It was only in 2003 that the  company consolidated the 15 plans into 3 plans and instituted changes  affecting both existing and some future retirees. Plan sponsors that have  either eliminated coverage or created access-only plans for some or all  retirees generally reported that recruitment had not been affected. One  plan sponsor we interviewed, however, noted that current employees\u2019  retirement planning could be affected, as some employees might stay  longer with the company because they could not afford to retire. This  sentiment is consistent with data reported in Mercer\u2019s 2003 annual survey  of employer-sponsored health plans showing that retirees tended to delay  retirement when their employers did not sponsor retiree medical plans.", "Introducing and Enforcing Financial Caps. In 2001, we reported that  some employers had established caps and other limits on expenditures for  retiree health benefits, but it was not clear at that time how employers  would ensure that spending did not exceed the caps and how coverage  would be affected. Employers began to implement caps in response to  rising retiree health costs and to accounting changes introduced in the  early 1990s when the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)  adopted Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) 106, requiring employers  to report annually on the obligation represented by the promise to provide  retiree health benefits to current and future retirees. The 2003 annual  survey of employer-sponsored health plans conducted by Mercer shows  that 18 percent of employers with 500 or more employees have  implemented caps, while an additional 10 percent of such employers were  considering them. Caps were most common among the employers with the  largest number of employees in the Mercer study (20,000 or more  employees); 33 percent of such employers had implemented these limits  on overall spending and 9 percent were considering them. Similarly,   54 percent of employers with 1,000 or more employees offering retiree  coverage in the 2004 Kaiser/Hewitt employer survey reported having  capped contributions. Ninety percent of employers in the Kaiser/Hewitt  study that have hit caps or anticipated hitting caps in the next year  reported that they intended to enforce them or already had.", "Of the 12 Fortune 500 plan sponsors we interviewed, 8 had implemented  capped contributions or other limits on retiree health spending. For  example, 1 plan sponsor reported monthly caps of $217 per person for  nonunionized retirees under age 65 and $51 per person for nonunionized  Medicare-eligible retirees. Another plan sponsor provided fixed company  health care credits for its retirees under age 65 (unionized and  nonunionized) in which an individual could receive up to $3,750 to apply  to the plan sponsor\u2019s estimate for health care costs for a retiree under age  65. While many plan sponsors had implemented these types of limits, they  varied as to whether all groups of retirees were affected and whether the  caps had been reached and thus enforced. For example, 2 of the 12  Fortune 500 plan sponsors we interviewed had capped benefits for some  individuals depending on the individual\u2019s date of retirement (typically  more recent retirees were affected), and in some cases the caps varied by  whether retirees were part of a union or former employees of an acquired  company. The plan sponsors we interviewed whose retiree health benefit  costs had reached the caps generally were enforcing them. For example,  one plan sponsor required some retirees\u2014both Medicare-eligible and  those under age 65\u2014to pay a portion of premiums for the first time after  the plan\u2019s costs reached the cap in 2002. However, implementing and  enforcing caps can be an issue in union negotiations. One plan sponsor we  interviewed had opted in the past to negotiate benefit changes with unions  to delay hitting the caps, but now expects to hit and enforce the caps by  2007. Another plan sponsor, while enforcing the financial caps for retiree  health benefits, has agreed in some union negotiations to give retirees an  additional contribution toward health care expenses that effectively  offsets the premium increases triggered by reaching the caps. A few plan  sponsors and benefit consultants we interviewed noted that employers are  more likely today to enforce caps than to raise them. For example, the  2003 Kaiser/Hewitt study stated that there is some concern that auditors  will question the effectiveness of a cap if there is a pattern of continually  raising it once costs approach the set limit.", "Implementing Changes to Prescription Drug Benefit Design. Given  the sensitivity of retiree health benefits to prescription drug costs, many  plan sponsors have made changes to prescription drug benefits. The  primary mechanisms cited by the 2004 Kaiser/Hewitt employer benefit  survey and benefit consultants and the 12 Fortune 500 plan sponsors we  interviewed included increasing copayments; switching from copayments  to coinsurance; and implementing tiered benefit structures in which  generic drugs, formulary/preferred drugs, and nonformulary/nonpreferred  drugs are subject to different retiree copayment and coinsurance rates.  Over half of the employers in the 2004 Kaiser/Hewitt study reported having  increased copayments or coinsurance for prescription drugs in the past  year, and 15 percent had replaced fixed-dollar copayments with  coinsurance in the past year. Over half of the plan sponsors offered a  three-tiered benefit structure, and among plans with this design, about  two-thirds require copayments and nearly one-fourth required coinsurance  for retail pharmacy purchases. In addition, about one-fourth of the  Kaiser/Hewitt-surveyed employers had instituted a three-tiered drug plan  in the past year to save money.", "The 12 Fortune 500 plan sponsors we interviewed echoed these types of  changes in their prescription drug benefit for retirees within the last 5  years. For example, 3 plan sponsors had instituted retiree coinsurance  requirements, which can make retirees more price conscious because the  retiree out-of-pocket cost is higher for more expensive drugs than for less  expensive drugs. One plan sponsor reported it had increased drug  copayments for retirees. Several of the 12 Fortune 500 plan sponsors we  interviewed already had tiered benefits in place. One plan sponsor had  implemented a three-tiered structure as well as mandatory use of a mail- order pharmacy for some prescription drugs. Another plan sponsor  reported it planned to implement \u201cstep-therapy\u201d in January 2005, in which  retirees would have to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of a lower-cost  generic drug before receiving coverage for a higher cost brand-name drug.  Officials we interviewed representing unions and their members noted  similar prescription drug trends for many former union workers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Public Sector Plan Sponsors\u2019 Cost-Cutting Strategies", "paragraphs": ["While public sector plan sponsors generally offer more coverage than  those in the private sector, these plan sponsors are also starting to  implement cost-cutting mechanisms similar to those implemented in the  private sector, with one major exception\u2014they generally are not  eliminating retiree health benefits for future retirees. For example, in  December 2002, we reported that FEHBP plans had implemented some  benefit reductions for all enrollees\u2014mostly by increasing enrollee cost  sharing. We reported that three large fee-for-service plans had increased  or introduced cost sharing features such as copayments or coinsurance for  prescription drugs and deductibles for other services. OPM officials  informed us that FEHBP plans have implemented cost-containment  strategies relating to prescription drugs, such as three-tiered cost sharing,  comparable to private sector employers. However, OPM does not  implement cost-containment strategies for retirees that do not also affect  active workers.", "Similarly, other public sector plan sponsors, such as state governments,  are starting to reduce benefit levels and implement cost-cutting  mechanisms, including changes to prescription drug benefits. However,  eliminating retiree health benefits entirely for current or future retirees  does not appear to be as prevalent in the public sector as the private  sector. For example, a 2003 survey conducted by the Segal Company, a  benefit consulting firm specializing in the public sector, reported that no  state plan sponsor in its survey was considering eliminating retiree health  coverage as a cost-containment strategy. A 2003 study prepared by  Georgetown University for the Kaiser Family Foundation that collected  survey data from 43 states and the District of Columbia also found that no  state government had terminated subsidized health benefits for current or  future retirees and no state government was planning to do so. However,  the Georgetown study found that 24 of these states reported increased  cost sharing in the past 2 years, while 13 had increased retiree premium  shares in the past 2 years. A study released by AARP in July 2004 on state  government retiree health benefits found that 11 states required Medicare- eligible retirees to pay the full amount of the premium. Almost all of the  states in the Georgetown study cited prescription drugs as the most  important driver behind the growth in state retiree health spending and, as  a result, have taken specific steps to manage these costs, such as  increasing cost sharing and implementing tiered benefit structures. The  majority of states in the AARP study had three-tiered copayment benefits.  One public sector plan sponsor we interviewed is proposing significant  changes to keep its retiree health benefits fund solvent that would vary the  employer\u2019s contribution toward retiree health care costs on the basis of  the retiree\u2019s age and years of service, rather than paying the full cost of  coverage for those meeting the minimum age and service requirements.", "Benefit consultants and officials from other organizations we interviewed  noted new pressures on public sector funding of retiree health care  benefits as a result of standards adopted in 2004 by the Governmental  Accounting Standards Board (GASB) that affect the reporting of  postretirement benefit obligations for many public sector sponsors of  employment-based retiree health coverage. Similar to FAS 106 for private  sector employers, the new standards require public sector plan sponsors,  including state governments, to accrue the costs of postretirement health  care benefits during the years of service as opposed to reporting these  costs on a pay-as-you-go basis. However, the GASB standards are not  identical to those in the private sector, and the July 2004 AARP study  noted that it is unclear whether the experience of FAS 106\u2014and its  frequently cited impact on the decrease in employment-based retiree  health coverage\u2014would directly translate to the public sector. While the  study stated that the new GASB standards might encourage state  governments to reduce retiree health benefit programs in order to reduce  obligations, it also noted that these standards alone were not likely to  cause major program changes. Regardless, benefit consultants and other  officials we interviewed cited notable implications for public sector  employers. For example, large unfunded obligations can affect bond  ratings in the public sector, which affect these public sector entities\u2019  ability to borrow money. One benefit consultant told us that its public  sector clients are raising issues such as plan design, cost, financing, and  the possible reduction of retiree health benefits in light of the new GASB  standards. The provision of retiree health benefits in the public sector may  also be affected by other factors, such as state budget deficits and state  political pressures."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Employers and Plan Sponsors Considering MMA Options for Prescription Drug Coverage, Often Considering Subsidy as Primary Option for Some or All Medicare- Eligible Retirees", "paragraphs": ["At the time of our review, many employers and plan sponsors said they  had not decided which MMA options they would implement for their  Medicare-eligible retirees, but the primary option many sponsors were  considering was the subsidy.

In  addition, plan sponsors that negotiated retiree health benefits with unions  said that they did not have as much flexibility to change these benefits  prior to negotiations. Three of the private sector plan sponsors we  interviewed said they would choose the subsidy option only for some of  their Medicare-eligible retirees because of capped benefits, the role of  unions, or both, as described in the following:    One of the three plan sponsors capped health benefits for workers who  retired after a specific date, so it offered richer uncapped benefits to those  who retired before that date. This sponsor determined that the uncapped  benefits would be actuarially equivalent. Therefore, this plan sponsor said  it would choose the subsidy option for the uncapped benefits but was not  certain that the capped benefits would be actuarially equivalent for  purposes of the subsidy.", "Another of these sponsors offered many different prescription drug plan  designs to retirees with collectively bargained benefits (union retirees)  and those without collectively bargained benefits. This sponsor chose the  subsidy option for all plans that met the actuarial equivalence test. The  sponsor\u2019s plans that were not likely to meet the actuarial equivalence test  typically had financial caps.", "The third sponsor said it was fairly certain it would choose the subsidy  option for its collectively bargained retiree prescription drug benefits.  While both the collectively bargained and noncollectively bargained  retiree benefits were capped, the unions had renegotiated higher capped  amounts for the collectively bargained benefits. The next negotiation  session with the primary union was scheduled for July 2006, thereby  making it difficult to make changes to these benefits other than accepting  the subsidy in the interim. The caps for the retirees with noncollectively  bargained benefits would be reached sooner and were less likely to be  actuarially equivalent.

Cost savings  associated with the subsidy played a major role in the plan sponsors\u2019  decision-making process. Several benefit consultants and plan sponsors  we interviewed stressed the importance of cost savings when considering  the MMA options. Most of the plan sponsors we interviewed considered  the savings associated with the subsidy to be an advantage.

According to our projections of the estimated amount of Medicare- eligible retirees\u2019 total prescription drug expenditures that employment- based plans would pay for and that beneficiaries would pay out-of-pocket  in 2006, most of the expenditures from employment-based coverage and  from out-of-pocket\u2014about 75 percent\u2014could be eligible for the subsidy  (see fig. 5).", "Preserving the benefits the plan sponsors currently provide and retaining  the control over and flexibility of the benefits were also cited as  advantages to choosing the subsidy option. Benefit consultants, plan  sponsors, and others we interviewed said that it would be easier for  beneficiaries if the benefits offered did not change. Choosing the subsidy  option also gave plan sponsors the ability to maintain control over the  benefits and their costs. In addition, preserving their current benefits  allowed plan sponsors time to see how other MMA options would play out  in the marketplace. For some plan sponsors, these advantages made the  subsidy the easiest, most seamless, and least risky option to pursue.", "Several benefit consultants we interviewed said that to receive the  subsidy, sponsors of employment-based retiree health plans would have to  fulfill certain administrative reporting and record keeping requirements, as  identified by CMS. For example, sponsors will have to apply for the  subsidy no later than 90 days prior to the start of the calendar year,  including providing an attestation regarding actuarial equivalence. Each  application must include the names of all people enrolled in the sponsor\u2019s  drug plan to ensure that a sponsor is not receiving a subsidy for an  individual who is enrolled in a part D prescription drug plan or a Medicare  Advantage plan. The plan sponsor must also notify Medicare-eligible  retirees and their spouses and dependents whether their retiree health  plan provides \u201ccreditable coverage\u201d\u2014that is, generally whether the  expected amount of paid claims under the plan sponsor\u2019s prescription  drug coverage is at least equal to that of the expected amount of paid  claims under the standard part D coverage. This notice is important  because retirees who do not enroll in part D when first eligible will be  charged a penalty for late enrollment if they enroll after finding that their  previous employment-based coverage did not meet CMS\u2019s creditable  coverage criteria. A special enrollment period will be provided, however,  without a late enrollment penalty, when there is an involuntary loss of  creditable coverage because, for example, an employer eliminates or  reduces coverage. All plan sponsors choosing the subsidy will have to  document prescription drug costs that fall within the MMA\u2019s eligibility  criteria.", "Although several benefit consultants saw the potential administrative  requirements as a disadvantage of the subsidy, most of the plan sponsors  we interviewed were not concerned about the subsidy\u2019s proposed  administrative requirements. For example, one plan sponsor told us it was  less concerned about how it would manage the subsidy\u2019s administrative  requirements than about how it would manage relations with retirees if it  changed prescription drug benefits under other MMA options. At the time  of our interviews, however, some plan sponsors said they were not fully  aware of or had not considered all of the administrative requirements.", "Besides cost savings, ease for retirees, and administrative requirements,  plan sponsors we interviewed said they also considered other factors  when making decisions about the subsidy. For example, plan sponsors  considered as part of their decision-making process possible negative  press, potential for lawsuits, relations and communications with Medicare- eligible retirees, benefit equity between Medicare-eligible retirees and  retirees not yet eligible for Medicare, future union negotiations, hiring and  retention of workers, marketplace competition, and uncertainty about  CMS rules."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Wrapping Retiree Drug Benefits around Medicare Part D", "paragraphs": ["One alternative to choosing the federal subsidy option for plan sponsors  that provide prescription drug coverage to Medicare-eligible retirees is the  option of coordinating with part D by wrapping their benefits around the  new Medicare part D benefit by covering some drug costs not paid by  Medicare. Plan sponsors would offer coverage wrapping around Medicare  part D rather than providing their own comprehensive prescription drug  coverage. Prescription drug costs not covered by Medicare part D that  plan sponsors could cover might include the $250 deductible or the  retirees\u2019 costs within the coverage gap (i.e., the doughnut hole) until the  Medicare catastrophic coverage begins paying for most drug costs. Several  plan sponsors we interviewed said they were considering this option for  Medicare-eligible retirees along with the subsidy and other options as part  of their overall MMA deliberations. For example, one plan sponsor said it  was considering wrapping its drug benefits around the part D benefit as its  primary option for all its Medicare-eligible retirees because it had set  financial caps on its retiree health benefit obligations that would  eventually render it ineligible for the subsidy. Three other plan sponsors  told us they were considering wrapping their prescription drug benefits  around the part D benefit for those Medicare-eligible retirees for whom  they could not qualify to receive the federal subsidy. Furthermore, OPM  officials said that wrapping prescription drug benefits around the part D  benefit could be more complex for the federal government than for  employers in the private sector because, in contrast to many large private  sector employers, FEHBP does not provide different benefits for active  workers and for retirees.", "Some plan sponsors and benefit consultants we interviewed expected that  wrapping prescription drug benefits offered to Medicare-eligible retirees  around the new Medicare part D benefit would provide several  advantages.

Also, plan sponsors could continue to provide the same  level of benefits to Medicare-eligible retirees in coordination with the  Medicare part D coverage, thereby maintaining benefit continuity.  Conceptually, sponsors of employment-based health benefit plans and  benefit consultants generally viewed the option to wrap prescription drug  benefits around the part D benefit as being similar to how most now  coordinate other benefits with Medicare parts A and B. Some sponsors we  interviewed planned to rely on their pharmacy benefit managers, benefit  consultants, and others for assistance in administering the benefit.  However, plan sponsors and benefit consultants we interviewed were  waiting to learn more from CMS about how the benefit coordination would  operate. As a result, at the time of our interviews, employers and others  had questions about how prescription drug benefit designs would wrap  around the Medicare part D benefit.", "Wrapping benefits around the Medicare part D benefit also could present  some administrative and other challenges for plan sponsors. Two benefit  consultants we interviewed told us that wrapping benefits around the  different Medicare part D plans, such as Medicare Advantage or a private  prescription drug plan, in which retirees might enroll could add to the  administrative complexity. Also, according to one benefit consultant and  CMS officials, while coordinating with the Medicare program can be a  fairly straightforward task for part A and B services, part D coordination  might be more difficult because each Medicare-eligible retiree\u2019s true out- of-pocket costs must be determined. Part D requires that Medicare  beneficiaries must have $3,600 in out-of-pocket expenses for covered  drugs in 2006 before federal catastrophic coverage begins. Generally,  beneficiaries\u2019 expenses reimbursed by other sources such as employment- based plans are not counted. This can become complicated for plan  sponsors that have different copayment and coinsurance requirements for  different groups of retirees.", "Another possible challenge for plan sponsors in wrapping around  Medicare part D coverage is financial. Plans sponsors that supplement the  Medicare part D benefit could spend thousands of dollars for each retiree  before the Medicare catastrophic coverage begins. Two plan sponsors and  several benefit consultants were concerned about how employment-based  drug benefits that wrap around the Medicare part D benefit would affect  the out-of-pocket payment requirements for beneficiaries. For example, if  a plan sponsor covered 75 percent of a Medicare-eligible retiree\u2019s  expenditures within the coverage gap (i.e., the doughnut hole) the plan  sponsor would have to spend $8,550 before the retiree reached $3,600 in  out-of-pocket expenditures as required by the MMA. Specifically, under  this wraparound scenario,  the Medicare-eligible retiree would spend $3,600 out-of-pocket\u2014$250 for  the part D deductible, $500 in coinsurance for the next $2,000 in  expenditures, and $2,850 for the expenses not covered by Medicare;    Medicare would spend $1,500\u201475 percent of the next $2,000 in  expenditures after the deductible is met; and  the plan sponsor would spend $8,550.", "This would require a total of $13,650 in expenditures from all sources  before the retiree would reach the amount\u2014that is, combined Medicare  and beneficiary expenditures equal to $5,100\u2014at which Medicare part D  catastrophic coverage would begin."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Options", "paragraphs": ["Under the MMA, sponsors of employment-based health benefit plans for  Medicare-eligible retirees have several other options. For example, plan  sponsors could contract with privately marketed prescription drug plans  and Medicare Advantage plans to cover the part D benefit, or they could  become prescription drug plans or Medicare Advantage plans. In  addition, while not allowed for current Medicare-eligible retirees, plan  sponsors could establish HSAs for their active workers, who could use  these benefits when they retire.", "Several benefit consultants told us their clients might consider these other  MMA options, and some plan sponsors we interviewed were doing so. For  example, four benefit consultants we interviewed said that Medicare  Advantage plans could offer advantages to plan sponsors. Two of these  benefit consultants said that having Medicare-eligible retirees enroll in  Medicare Advantage plans would shift the financial risk away from the  plan sponsor to the Medicare Advantage plan. The other two said that  Medicare Advantage plans could help to reduce costs, and they also  believed that having Medicare-eligible retirees enroll in these plans could  help reduce administrative burdens associated with the Medicare part D  benefit. Two benefit consultants noted that these plans might not be  available in all parts of the country, but others said that increased federal  reimbursement rates established as part of the MMA might cause more  private plans to enter this market in the future. In addition, two benefit  consultants commented that their clients might be more interested in  Medicare Advantage once the market for these plans is established. During  our interviews, some Fortune 500 plan sponsors generally discussed  Medicare Advantage plans as an option they might consider. While several  plan sponsors said that none of their Medicare retirees were enrolled in a  health maintenance organization (HMO), two said that HMOs might be a  viable option in the future as long as managed care plans continued to  participate in the Medicare program. One plan sponsor considered  Medicare Advantage plans as an option during its deliberations but  determined that based on its past experience with Medicare+Choice, it did  not provide many savings.", "One benefit consultant we interviewed said that plan sponsors might be  reluctant to form their own Medicare Advantage plans because many  HMOs left the Medicare+Choice program in the past. However, new  options that had not yet been offered under the Medicare Advantage  program might also be attractive to employers with retirees living all  across the country. CMS officials said that they are currently developing  the waivers that plan sponsors would need to form their own Medicare  Advantage plans.", "The MMA also established HSAs, which receive preferential tax treatment,  that are used in conjunction with high deductible health insurance plans.  The HSA can be used to pay for qualified medical expenses not covered by  insurance or other reimbursements. Although HSAs cannot be set up to  fund health benefits for current Medicare-eligible retirees, they can be a  savings vehicle for workers to pay the cost of their health care coverage  when they retire. However, some benefit experts said it is unlikely that  enough money would accumulate in these accounts for retirees, especially  for older workers, to benefit substantially from them. Six of the 15 plan  sponsors we interviewed said they were exploring how HSAs would  integrate into their overall benefit programs or were considering them for  the future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Most Plan Sponsors in Our Sample Reported MMA- Related Changes on Recent Financial Statements, While a Third Were Considering MMA Options", "paragraphs": ["According to financial statements filed with the SEC as of November 2004,  most of the Fortune 500 employers we reviewed that reported  postretirement benefit obligations (27 of 39) reflected the effect of the  MMA options on these obligations.

Plan sponsors have continued to modify their requirements  for eligibility, benefits, and cost sharing in an effort to contain cost growth.  As employers and other plan sponsors choose options as provided under  the MMA, they likely will continue to face rising health care costs,  particularly for prescription drugs, that will increase their obligations for  retiree health benefits. The Medicare drug benefit is expected to provide  some insulation from these cost increases for plans that qualify and  employers that receive a subsidy for a portion of their drug expenditures  or that choose to allow Medicare to bear primary responsibility for these  costs for Medicare-eligible retirees. Nonetheless, even after employers  select a particular option in response to the Medicare drug benefit, it is  likely that they will continue to reshape their retiree health benefits in  response to cost pressures, as they have for the last decade.
