In addition, sectarian influences within Iraqi ministries continue while militia influences divide the loyalties of Iraqi security forces. U.S. efforts lack strategies with clear purpose, scope, roles, and performance measures. The U.S. strategy for victory in Iraq partially identifies the agencies responsible for implementing key aspects of the strategy and does not fully address how the United States would integrate its goals with those of the Iraqis and the international community. U.S. efforts to develop Iraqi ministry capability lack an overall strategy, no lead agency provides overall direction, and U.S. priorities have been subject to numerous changes. The weaknesses in U.S. strategic planning are compounded by the Iraqi government's lack of integrated strategic planning in its critical energy sector. The U.S. strategy assumed that the Iraqis and international community would help finance Iraq's reconstruction. However, the Iraqi government has limited capacity to spend reconstruction funds. For example, Iraq allocated $10 billion of its revenues for capital projects and reconstruction in 2007. However, a large portion of this amount is unlikely to be spent, as ministries had spent only 24 percent of their capital budgets through mid-July 2007. Iraq has proposed spending only $4 billion for capital projects in 2008, a significant reduction from 2007. The international community has pledged $15.6 billion for reconstruction efforts in Iraq, but about $11 billion of this is in the form of loans."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s recent work on U.S. efforts  to secure, stabilize, and rebuild Iraq.", "Over the last 4 years, the United States has provided thousands of troops  and obligated nearly $400 billion to help achieve the strategic goal of  creating a democratic Iraq that can defend itself and be an ally in the war  on terror.

By mid-2006, the  cabinet was approved; the government now has 34 ministries responsible  for providing security and essential services\u2014including electricity, water,  and education\u2014for the Iraqi people.

The original \u201ccoalition of the willing\u201d consisted of 49 countries  (including the United States) that publicly committed to the war effort and  also provided a variety of support, such as direct military participation,  logistical and intelligence support, over-flight rights, or humanitarian and  reconstruction aid. Many nations and various international organizations  are supporting the efforts to rebuild Iraq through multilateral or bilateral  assistance. U.N. Security Council Resolution 1511 of October 16, 2003,  urged member states and international and regional organizations to  support the Iraq reconstruction effort.

The number of enemy-initiated attacks on civilians, Iraqi  Security Forces, and coalition forces increased dramatically after the  February 2006 bombing of the Golden Mosque in Samarra. The increase in  the number of monthly attacks generally continued through June 2007. To  help quell the violence, the United States deployed about 30,000 additional  troops to Iraq during the spring of 2007, bringing the total number of U.S.  military personnel to about 164,700 as of September 2007.", "As depicted in figure 1, enemy-initiated attacks declined from a total of  about 5,300 in June 2007 to about 3,000 in September 2007. However, the  recent decrease in monthly attacks was primarily due to a decrease in the  number of attacks against coalition forces. Attacks against Iraqi Security  Forces and civilians have declined less than attacks against coalition  forces.", "According to the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), the incidents  captured in military reporting do not account for all violence throughout  Iraq. For example, they may underreport incidents of Shi\u2019a militias fighting  each other and attacks against Iraqi security forces in southern Iraq and  other areas with few or no coalition forces.", "In addition, according to a UN report released October 15, 2007, the Iraqi  people and government continue to confront major challenges resulting  from the devastating effects of violence. The UN reported that widespread  insecurity continues to make national dialogue challenging, and increasing  levels of displacement are adding to an alarming humanitarian crisis.", "The Iraqi government continues to make limited progress in meeting eight  legislative benchmarks intended to promote national reconciliation. As of  October 25, 2007, the Iraqi government had met one legislative benchmark  and partially met another. Specifically, the rights of minority political  parties in the Iraqi legislature were protected through existing provisions  in the Iraqi Constitution and Council of Representatives\u2019 by-laws. In  addition, the Iraqi government partially met the benchmark to enact and  implement legislation on the formation of regions; this law was enacted in  October 2006 but will not be implemented until April 2008.", "The benchmark requiring a review of the Iraqi Constitution has not yet  been met. Fundamental issues remain unresolved as part of the  constitutional review process, such as expanded powers for the  presidency, the resolution of disputed areas (such as Kirkuk), and power  sharing between federal and regional governments over issues such as the  distribution of oil revenue. In addition, five other legislative benchmarks  requiring parliamentary action have not yet been met. Figure 2 highlights  the status of the benchmarks requiring legislative enactment and  implementation.", "Although State and Multinational Force-Iraq report progress in promoting  reconciliation at local levels such as Anbar province, at the national level,  sectarian factions within the Iraqi government ministries continue to  undermine reconciliation efforts. For example, ministries within the Iraqi  government continued to be controlled by sectarian factions and are used  to maintain power and provide patronage to individuals and groups.  According to an August 2007 U.S. interagency report, the withdrawal of  members of the Iraqi cabinet ended the Shi\u2019a-dominated coalition\u2019s claim  to be a government of national unity and further undermined Iraq\u2019s already  faltering program of national reconciliation. In late August 2007, Iraq\u2019s  senior Shi\u2019a and Sunni Arab and Kurdish political leaders signed a unity  accord signaling efforts to foster greater national reconciliation. The  accord covered draft legislation on de-Ba\u2019athification reform and  provincial powers laws, and established a mechanism to release some  Sunni detainees being held without charges. However, these laws have not  been passed as of October 25, 2007.", "The Iraqi government has made limited progress in developing effective  and non-sectarian forces. Since 2003, the United States has provided about  $19.2 billion to train and equip about 360,000 Iraqi soldiers and police  officers, in an effort to develop Iraqi security forces, transfer security  responsibilities to them and to the Iraqi government, and ultimately  withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq. Iraqi security forces have grown in size  and are increasingly leading counterinsurgency operations. However, only  about 10 of 140 Iraqi army, national police, and special operations forces  are operating independently as of September 2007.", "Several factors have complicated the development of effective and loyal  Iraqi security forces. First, the Iraqi security forces are not a single unified  force with a primary mission of countering the insurgency in Iraq. Second,  high rates of absenteeism and poor ministry reporting result in an  overstatement of the number of Iraqi security forces present for duty.  Third, sectarian and militia influences have divided the loyalties of Iraqi  security forces.

Second, Iraq\u2019s government confronts significant challenges in staffing a  nonpartisan civil service and addressing militia infiltration of key  ministries. Third, widespread corruption undermines efforts to develop  the government\u2019s capacity by robbing it of needed resources.

While the Iraqi  government has crafted a multiyear strategic plan for Iraq\u2019s electricity  sector, no such plan exists for the oil sector. Given the highly  interdependent nature of the oil and electricity sectors, such a plan would  help identify the most pressing needs for the entire energy sector and help  overcome the daunting challenges affecting future development prospects.  For fiscal years 2003 to 2006, the United States made available about $7.4  billion and spent about $5.1 billion to rebuild Iraq\u2019s oil and electricity  sectors.
