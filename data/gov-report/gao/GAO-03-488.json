These key practices include the following. (1) Align individual performance expectations with organizational goals: An explicit alignment helps individuals see the connection between their daily activities and organizational goals; (2) Connect performance expectations to cross-cutting goals: Placing an emphasis on collaboration, interaction, and teamwork across organizational boundaries helps strengthen accountability for results; (3) Provide and routinely use performance information to track: organizational priorities. Individuals use performance information to manage during the year, identify performance gaps, and pinpoint improvement opportunities; (4) Require follow-up actions to address organizational priorities: By requiring and tracking follow-up actions on performance gaps, organizations underscore the importance of holding individuals accountable for making progress on their priorities; (5) Use competencies to provide a fuller assessment of performance: Competencies define the skills and supporting behaviors that individuals need to effectively contribute to organizational results; (6) Link pay to individual and organizational performance: Pay, incentive, and reward systems that link employee knowledge, skills, and contributions to organizational results are based on valid, reliable, and transparent performance management systems with adequate safeguards; (7) Make meaningful distinctions in performance: Effective performance management systems strive to provide candid and constructive feedback and the necessary objective information and documentation to reward top performers and deal with poor performers; (8) Involve employees and stakeholders to gain ownership of performance management systems: Early and direct involvement helps increase employees' and stakeholders' understanding and ownership of the system and belief in its fairness; and (9) Maintain continuity during transitions: Because cultural transformations take time, performance management systems reinforce accountability for change management and other organizational goals."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The federal government is in a period of profound transition and faces an  array of challenges and opportunities to enhance performance, ensure  accountability, and position the nation for the future.

These systems  are used to achieve results, accelerate change, and facilitate two-way  communication throughout the year so that discussions about individual  and organizational performance are integrated and ongoing.  The Office of  Personnel Management (OPM) recognizes that performance management  systems are to extend beyond rating individual performance.  According to  OPM, performance management is the systematic process by which an  organization involves its employees, as individuals and members of a  group, in improving organizational effectiveness in the accomplishment of  the mission and goals.", "Recently, the Congress and the administration have pinpointed potential  solutions for modernizing performance management systems and,  specifically, making meaningful distinctions in performance.  In November  2002, the Congress passed the Homeland Security Act of 2002, which  provides for the increase of the total annual compensation limit for senior  executives in those agencies that have been certified by OPM and the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as having performance appraisal  systems that, as designed and applied, make meaningful distinctions based  on relative performance.  For 2003, the senior executive total  compensation limit would increase from $171,900 to $198,600.", "In February 2003, the administration proposed for fiscal year 2004 to allow  managers to increase pay beyond annual raises for high-performing  employees.  OPM would administer a $500 million Human Capital  Performance Fund for the purpose of allowing agencies to deliver  additional pay to certain employees based on individual performance or  other human capital needs, in accordance with plans submitted to and  approved by OPM.  In addition, the administration also has proposed  creating a wider, more open pay range for senior executive compensation,  thus allowing for pay to be more directly tied to performance.", "At your request, this report identifies key practices for federal agencies to  consider to develop modern, effective, and credible performance  management systems.  To identify the key practices, we reviewed our  issued reports on performance management that draw from the  experiences of public sector organizations both in the United States and  abroad.  While these organizations developed different performance  management systems to reflect their specific structures, priorities, and  cultures, they implemented these key practices to reinforce individual  accountability for results.  Consistent with these key practices, GAO has  implemented a performance management system that reinforces individual  accountability for results that has features such as broadbanded pay-for- performance and a set of validated competencies intended to link  employee performance to our strategic plan and core values.  We included  the agency examples illustrating the key practices primarily from these  issued reports and added examples from other GAO reports, where  appropriate.

In January 2001, we designated strategic  human capital management as a governmentwide high-risk area and  continued this designation with the release of High-Risk Series: An Update  in January 2003.  Despite the considerable progress over the past 2 years, it  remains clear that today\u2019s federal human capital strategies are not  appropriately constituted to meet current and emerging challenges or drive  the needed transformation across the federal government.  One of the key  areas that federal agencies continue to face challenges in is creating  results-oriented organizational cultures.  Agencies lack organizational  cultures that promote high performance and accountability and empower  and include employees in setting and accomplishing programmatic goals,  which are critical to successful organizations.  To help agency leaders  effectively lead and manage their people and integrate human capital  considerations into daily decision making and the program results they  seek to achieve, we developed a strategic human capital model.  The model  highlights the kind of thinking that agencies should apply, as well as some  of the steps they can take, to make progress in managing human capital  strategically.", "Since we designated strategic human capital management as a high-risk  area in January 2001, the President\u2019s Management Agenda, released in  August 2001, placed the strategic management of human capital at the top  of the administration\u2019s management agenda.  In October 2002, OMB and  OPM updated the standards for success in the human capital area of the  President\u2019s Management Agenda, reflecting language that was developed  in collaboration with GAO.  To assist agencies in responding to the revised  standards and addressing the human capital challenges, OPM released the  Human Capital Assessment and Accountability Framework.  One of the  standards of success in the framework is a results-oriented performance  culture, specifically a performance management system that effectively  differentiates between high and low performance.", "On September 24, 2002, we convened a forum to discuss useful practices  from major private and public sector organizational mergers, acquisitions,  and transformations that federal agencies could learn from to successfully  transform their cultures and that the then proposed Department of  Homeland Security could use to merge its various originating agencies or  their components into a unified department.  The participants identified  the use of performance management systems as a tool to help manage and  direct the transformation process.  Specifically, performance management  systems must create a line of sight showing how team, unit, and individual  performance can contribute to overall organizational results.  The system  serves as the basis for setting expectations for employees\u2019 roles in the  transformation process and for evaluating individual performance and  contributions to the success of the transformation process and, ultimately,  to the achievement of organizational results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Practices for Effective Performance Management", "paragraphs": ["An effective performance management system can be a strategic tool to  drive internal change and achieve desired results.

Such organizations continuously review and revise  their performance management systems to support their strategic and  performance goals, as well as their core values and transformational  objectives.", "High-performing organizations can show how the products and services  they deliver contribute to results by aligning performance expectations of  top leadership with organizational goals and then cascading those  expectations down to lower levels.  To this end, we reported that in fiscal  year 2000 the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was able to show how  the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) strategic goal to promote public  health and safety was cascaded through the FAA Administrator\u2019s  performance expectation to reduce the commercial air carrier fatal  accident rate to a program director\u2019s performance expectation to develop  software to help aircraft maintain safe altitudes in their approach paths, as  shown in figure 2.", "The FAA Administrator\u2019s performance agreement for fiscal year 2000  included a performance expectation to reduce the commercial air carrier  fatal accident rate by implementing the Safer Skies Agenda.  As part of  implementing the Safer Skies Agenda, the Flight Standards Service  Director had a performance expectation to meet milestones for reducing a  type of crash called controlled flight into terrain, which occurs when pilots  lose their sense of the plane\u2019s relation to the surface below.  Among these  milestones included validating Minimum Safe Altitude Warning software,  which had to be developed by the Aviation Systems Standards Program  Director.  This software system is designed to aid air traffic controllers  through both visual and aural alarms by alerting them when a tracked  aircraft is below, or predicted by the computer to go below, a  predetermined minimum altitude.", "Similarly, we recently reported that as a first step in establishing a  permanent performance management system, the Transportation Security  Administration (TSA) has implemented standardized performance  agreements for groups of employees, including transportation security  screeners, supervisory transportation security screeners, supervisors, and  executives.  These performance agreements include both organizational  and individual goals and standards for satisfactory performance that can  help TSA establish a line of sight showing how individual performance  contributes to organizational goals.  For example, each executive  performance agreement includes organizational goals, such as to maintain  the nation\u2019s air security and ensure an emphasis on customer satisfaction,  as well as individual goals, such as to demonstrate through actions, words,  and leadership, a commitment to civil rights.  To strengthen its current  executive performance agreement and foster the culture of a high- performing organization, we recommended that TSA add performance  expectations that establish explicit targets directly linked to organizational  goals, foster the necessary collaboration within and across organizational  boundaries to achieve results, and demonstrate commitment to lead and  facilitate change.  TSA agreed with this recommendation.", "We reported in September 2002 that some agencies set targets for  individual performance that were linked to organizational goals.  For  example, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) identified targets  with specific levels of performance for senior executives that were  explicitly linked to VBA\u2019s priorities for fiscal year 2001 and the Department  of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) strategic goals for fiscal years 2001 to 2006.  For  example, to contribute to VA\u2019s strategic goal to \u201cprovide \u2018One VA\u2019 world  class service to veterans and their families through the effective  management of people, technology, processes and financial resources\u201d and  to address its priority of speed and timeliness, VBA set a national target for  property holding time\u2014the average number of months from date of  acquisition to date of sale of properties acquired due to defaults on VA  guaranteed loans\u2014of 10 months for fiscal year 2001.

High-performing organizations use  their performance management systems to strengthen accountability for  results, specifically by placing greater emphasis on fostering the necessary  collaboration both within and across organizational boundaries to achieve  results.", "For example, in August 2002, we reported that Canada\u2019s agricultural  department, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, used individual  performance agreements to specify the internal or external organizations  whose collaboration is needed to help individuals contribute to the  departmental crosscutting goals or areas.  Specifically, the head of the  department\u2019s Market and Industry Services Branch had in his 2001-02  performance agreement the expectation to \u201clead efforts to develop the  department\u2019s ability to deal with emerging technical trade issues\u201d that  aligned with the crosscutting area of \u201cinternational issues.\u201d  The agreement  also listed two internal units whose collaboration was needed to meet the  expectation\u2014the department\u2019s Research Branch and its Strategic Policy  Branch\u2014as well as two external organizations\u2014the Canadian Food  Inspection Agency and Health Canada.

In 2000,  the VISN Director had a performance agreement with \u201ccare line\u201d directors  for patient services, such as primary care, medical and surgical care, and  mental health care.  In particular, the mental health care line director\u2019s  performance agreement included improvement goals related to mental  health for the entire VISN.  To make progress towards these goals, this care  line director had to work across each of the VISN\u2019s four medical centers  with the corresponding care line managers at each medical center.  As part  of this collaboration, the care line director needed to establish consensus  among VISN officials and external stakeholders on the strategic direction  for the services provided by the mental health care line across the VISN;  develop, implement, and revise integrated clinical programs to reflect that  strategic direction for the VISN; and allocate resources among the centers  for mental health programs to implement these programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Provide and Routinely Use Performance Information to Track Organizational Priorities", "paragraphs": ["High-performing organizations provide objective performance information  to individuals to show progress in achieving organizational results and  other priorities, such as customer satisfaction and employee perspectives,  and help individuals manage during the year, identify performance gaps,  and pinpoint improvement opportunities.

VHA\u2019s then Chief  Network Officer and each of the VISN directors used these performance  reports to inform quarterly meetings they had and to discuss each VISN\u2019s  progress towards the goals in the director\u2019s performance agreement.   Specifically, the Network Performance Report issued in May 2000 showed  that 90 percent of the patients in VISN 5 located in Baltimore received  follow-up care after hospitalization for mental illness in the third quarter of  fiscal year 2000.  Further, that VISN produced biweekly performance  reports that allowed it to monitor its three medical centers\u2019 progress on the  VHA-wide performance goals in the VISN director\u2019s performance  agreements.  For example, the VISN\u2019s biweekly performance report for  August 2000 showed that the VISN-wide rate for follow-up care after  hospitalization for mental illness remained at 90 percent, while its three  medical centers ranged from 89 to 91 percent for follow-up care.", "In addition to showing progress in achieving organizational results, high- performing organizations also provide performance information on other  priorities, such as customer satisfaction and employee perspectives.  We  reported in September 2002 that to emphasize a balanced set of  performance expectations, some agencies disaggregated customer and  employee satisfaction survey data so that the results were applicable to an  executive\u2019s customers and employees.  For example, from its Use  Authorization Survey administered to various customers in fiscal year 2000,  BLM disaggregated the survey data to provide the applicable results to  individuals who head the state offices.  Specifically, the executive in the  Montana state office received data for his state showing that 81 percent of  the grazing permit customers surveyed gave favorable ratings for the  timeliness of permit processing and for service quality.  The executive  addressed the results of the customer survey in his self-assessment for the  2001 performance appraisal cycle.", "We also reported that to help senior executives address employee  perspectives, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) disaggregated data to the  workgroup level from its IRS/National Treasury Employees Union  Employee Satisfaction Survey, which measures general satisfaction with  IRS, the workplace, and the union.  The Gallup Organization administered  this survey to all IRS employees.  The survey comprised Gallup\u2019s 12  questions (Q12); additional questions unique to IRS, such as views on  local union chapters and employee organizations; and questions on issues  IRS has been tracking over time.  Gallup provided the results for each  workgroup.  For example, an executive could compare the performance of  his or her workgroup to that of other operating divisions and to that of IRS  as a whole.  Specifically, for the 2001 survey, an executive\u2019s workgroup  scored 3.68 out of a possible 5 for the question \u201cI have the materials and  equipment I need to do my work right\u201d compared to the IRS-wide score of  3.58.  To allow individuals to benchmark externally, Gallup compared each  workgroup\u2019s results to the 50th (median) and 75th (best practices)  percentile scores from Gallup\u2019s Q12 database.

Based on the 360-degree feedback, senior executives  were to identify action items and incorporate them into their individual  performance plans for the next fiscal year.  While the 360-degree feedback  instrument was intended for developmental purposes to help senior  executives identify areas for improvement and was not included in the  executive\u2019s performance evaluation, executives were held accountable for  taking some action with the 360-degree feedback results and responding to  the concerns of their peers, customers, and subordinates.  For example,  based on 360-degree feedback, a senior executive for field services  identified better communications with subordinates and increased  collaboration among colleagues as areas for improvement, and as required,  he then incorporated action items into his individual performance plan.  In  fiscal year 2001, he set a performance expectation to develop a leadership  self-improvement action plan and identify appropriate improvement goals.   In his self-assessment for fiscal year 2001, he reported that he improved his  personal contact and attention to the division offices as evidenced by a 30  percent increase in visits to the divisions that year.  Also, he stated that he  encouraged his subordinates to assess their leadership skills.   Consequently, 9 of his 11 subordinates used 360-degree feedback  instruments to improve their personal leadership competencies.", "We also reported that to address employee perspectives based on the  performance information obtained through its employee survey, IRS  required senior executives to hold workgroup meetings with their  employees to discuss the workgroups\u2019 survey results and develop action  plans to address these results.  According to a senior executive in IRS\u2019s  criminal investigation unit, the workgroup meetings were beneficial  because they increased communication with employees and identified  improvements in the quality of worklife.  For example, through this  executive\u2019s workgroup meetings on the 2001 employee survey results,  employees identified the need for recruiting supervisory special agents to  even out some of the workload.  Subsequently, the senior executive set a  performance expectation in his fiscal year 2002 individual performance  plan to ensure that the field office had a strong recruitment program to  attract viable candidates.", "Similarly, for its customer satisfaction survey, the former Commissioner of  Internal Revenue set an expectation that the senior executives who head  the business units develop action plans based on the performance  information from IRS\u2019s customer survey that are relevant to the needs of  their particular customers.  For example, an IRS senior executive who is  the area director for compliance in Laguna Niguel, California, developed a  consolidated action plan based on the plans he required from each of his  territory managers that identified ways to improve low scores from the  customer survey.  Specifically, the senior executive had an expectation in  his action plan to improve how customers were treated during collection  and examination activities by ensuring that examiners explain to  customers their taxpayer rights, as well as why they were selected for  examination and what they could expect.  Further, the senior executive  planned to ensure that territory managers solicited feedback from  customers on their treatment during these activities and identify specific  reasons for any customer dissatisfaction.

The executives in the Senior Civil  Service have performance agreements that include both business  objectives and certain core competencies that executives should develop in  order to effectively achieve these objectives.  For example, an executive  and his supervisor select one or two competencies, such as \u201cthinking  strategically,\u201d \u201cgetting the best from people,\u201d or \u201cfocusing on delivery.\u201d   Each competency is further described by several specific behaviors.

All employees were evaluated on their commitments to deliver  results, which account for 40 to 55 percent of their overall performance  evaluations.  In addition, all employees were evaluated against core  organizational competencies such as customer focus, strategic leadership,  analysis and decision making, and communication, which make up 20 to 50  percent of their evaluations.  Some employees who have special knowledge  and expertise in areas such as tax policy, information technology, and  human capital were also evaluated against technical competencies that  may account for 20 to 35 percent of their overall performance evaluations.

Under the Performance Management Program, introduced in  1999, a significant portion of the total cash compensation package that top  and senior executives can receive takes the form of \u201cat-risk\u201d pay.  This  annual lump-sum payment ranges from 10 to 15 percent of base pay for  senior executives, and as high as 25 percent for deputy ministers.  Another  central feature of Canada\u2019s Performance Management Program is that both  increases in base salary and at-risk pay are only awarded to executives who  successfully achieve commitments agreed to in their annual performance  agreements.  These commitments are of two types: \u201congoing  commitments,\u201d which include continuing responsibilities associated with  the position, and \u201ckey commitments,\u201d which identify priority areas for the  current performance cycle.  Departments award increases in base pay to  executives who successfully carry out their ongoing commitments and  award at-risk pay to individuals who, in addition to meeting all ongoing  commitments, also successfully deliver on key commitments.

The amount of the award an individual executive can receive ranges from  no payment to a maximum of 20 percent of base salary.  To determine the  amount of performance pay for any given fiscal year, the Premier and  Cabinet, the top political leadership of the Ontario government, first  determine whether and to what extent the government as a whole has  achieved the key provincial goals it established at the beginning of the  fiscal year.  If they determine that the government has met a threshold of  satisfactory performance, these officials designate a certain percentage as  the governmentwide \u201cincentive envelope,\u201d which represents the  percentage that will be the basis for subsequent calculations used to  determine performance awards.

As a result of this assessment, each ministry receives an  amount equivalent to a specific percentage of the ministry\u2019s total executive  payroll for performance awards.  Finally, each ministry determines the  actual amount of an executive\u2019s performance award by assessing both the  individual\u2019s actual performance against his or her prior performance  commitments as well as the individual\u2019s level of responsibility.", "For example, in the 1999\u20132000 performance cycle, the Premier and Cabinet  determined that the government as a whole had met a threshold of  satisfactory performance and set an incentive envelope of 10 percent.

They also found that this  ministry \u201cexceeded\u201d the key commitments established in its business plan.  In this case, the ministry received an amount equivalent to 12.5 percent of  its executive payroll towards performance payments.  Individual awards,  depending upon the performance and position of the executive, ranged  from no payment to 15 percent, and could have reached as high as 20  percent under the program\u2019s regulations.  In contrast, during the same  performance cycle, the Secretary of Cabinet and the Premier found that another ministry had only \u201ccontributed\u201d to governmentwide goals while  having \u201cmet\u201d its business commitments.

In doing so, performance management systems in high- performing organizations typically seek to achieve three key objectives:  (1) they strive to provide candid and constructive feedback to help  individuals maximize their contribution and potential in understanding and  realizing the goals and objectives of the organization, (2) they seek to  provide management with the objective and fact-based information it needs  to reward top performers, and (3) they provide the necessary information  and documentation to deal with poor performers.", "We reported that IRS recognizes that it is still working at implementing an  effective performance management system that makes meaningful  distinctions in senior executive performance.  For example, IRS  established an executive compensation plan for determining base salary,  performance bonuses, and other awards for its senior executives that is  intended to explicitly link individual performance to organizational  performance and is designed to emphasize performance.  IRS piloted the  compensation plan in fiscal year 2000 with the top senior executives who  report to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue and used it for all senior  executives in fiscal year 2001.  To recognize performance across different  levels of responsibilities and commitments, IRS assigned senior executives  to one of three bonus levels at the beginning of the performance appraisal  cycle.  Assignments depend on the senior executives\u2019 responsibilities and  commitments in their individual performance plans for the year, as well as  the scope of their work and its impact on IRS\u2019s overall mission and goals.   For example, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or the Deputy  Commissioner assigns senior executives to bonus level three\u2014considered  to be the level with the highest responsibilities and commitments\u2014only if  they are part of the Senior Leadership Team.  IRS restricts the number of  senior executives assigned to each bonus level for each business unit.", "In addition, for each bonus level, IRS establishes set bonus ranges by  individual summary evaluation rating, which is intended to reinforce the  link between performance and rewards.  The bonus levels and  corresponding bonus amounts of base salary by summary rating are shown  in table 1.", "To help ensure realistic and consistent performance ratings, each IRS  business unit had a \u201cpoint budget\u201d for assigning performance ratings that is  the total of four points for each senior executive in the unit.  After the  initial summary evaluation ratings were assigned, the senior executives\u2019  ratings were converted into points\u2014an \u201coutstanding\u201d rating converted to  six points; an \u201cexceeded\u201d rating to four points, which is the baseline; a  \u201cmet\u201d rating to two points; and a \u201cnot met\u201d rating to zero points.  If the  business unit exceeded its point budget, it had the opportunity to request  additional points from the Deputy Commissioner.  IRS officials indicated  that none of the business units requested additional points for the fiscal  year 2001 ratings.  For fiscal year 2001, 31 percent of the senior executives  received a rating of outstanding compared to 42 percent for fiscal year  2000, 49 percent received a rating of exceeded expectations compared to  55 percent, and 20 percent received a rating of met expectations compared  to 3 percent.  In fiscal year 2001, 52 percent of senior executives received a  bonus, compared to 56 percent in fiscal year 2000.  IRS officials indicated  that they are still gaining experience using the new compensation plan and  will wait to establish trend data before they evaluate the link between  performance and bonus decisions.", "To stress making performance results the basis for pay, awards, and other  personnel decisions for senior executives, OPM implemented amended  regulations for senior executive performance management requiring  agencies to establish performance management systems for the rating  cycles beginning in 2001. These systems are to hold senior executives  accountable for their individual and organizational performance by linking  performance management with results-oriented organizational goals and  evaluating senior executive performance using measures that balance  organizational results with customer satisfaction, employee perspectives,  and other measures agencies decide are appropriate.  According to OPM,  these regulations require agency leadership to expect excellence and take  action to reward outstanding performers and deal appropriately with those  who do not measure up."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Involve Employees and Stakeholders to Gain Ownership of Performance Management Systems", "paragraphs": ["High-performing organizations have found that actively involving  employees and stakeholders, such as unions or other employee  associations, when developing results-oriented performance management  systems helps improve employees\u2019 confidence and belief in the fairness of  the system and increase their understanding and ownership of  organizational goals and objectives.  Effective performance management  systems depend on individuals\u2019, their supervisors\u2019, and management\u2019s  common understanding, support, and use of these systems to reinforce the  connection between performance management and organizational results.   These organizations recognize that they must conduct frequent training for  staff members at all levels of the organization to maximize the  effectiveness of the performance management systems.  Overall,  employees and supervisors share the responsibility for individual  performance management.  Both are actively involved in identifying how  they can contribute to organizational results and are held accountable for  their contributions.", "We described in August 2002 that, when reforming their performance  management systems, public sector organizations in other countries  consulted a wide range of employees and stakeholders early in the process,  obtained direct feedback from them, and engaged employee unions or  associations.", "Consult a Wide Range of Stakeholders Early in the Process.  An  important step to ensure the success of a new performance management  system is to consult a wide range of stakeholders and to do so early in the  process.  For its new Senior Civil Service performance management and  pay system, the United Kingdom\u2019s Cabinet Office recognized the  importance of meeting with and including employees and stakeholders in  the formation of the new system.  The Cabinet Office obtained feedback  from various employee associations, a civil servant advisory group, a  project board composed of personnel directors, and permanent secretaries As part of Canada\u2019s effort to consult stakeholders concerning its new  performance management system, the government convened an  interdepartmental committee to explore and discuss possible approaches,  consulted networks of human capital professionals and executives across  the country, and engaged top executives through the Committee of Senior  Officials, consisting of the Clerk of the Privy Council and heads of major  departments and other top officials.", "Obtain Feedback Directly from Employees.  Directly asking employees  to provide feedback on proposed changes in their performance  management systems encourages a sense of involvement and ownership,  allows employees to express their views, and helps validate the system to  ensure that the performance measures are appropriate.  Asking employees  to provide feedback should not be a one-time process, but an ongoing  process through the training of employees to ensure common  understanding of the evaluation, implementation, and results of the  systems.", "For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s Cabinet Office provided a packet  detailing proposed reforms of the existing performance management  system to approximately 3,000 members of the Senior Civil Service in a  large-scale effort to obtain their feedback on the proposed changes. In  addition, each department also held consultations where individuals  listened to proposed reforms.  More than 1,200 executives (approximately  40 percent of the Senior Civil Service) participated in the process.  The  Cabinet Office then collected and incorporated these views into the final  proposal, which was adopted by the government and implemented in April  2001.", "Engage Employee Unions or Associations.  We have previously  reported that in the United States obtaining union cooperation and support  can help to achieve consensus on planned changes, avoid  misunderstandings, and assist in the expeditious resolution of problems.   Agencies in New Zealand and Canada actively engaged unions or employee  associations when making changes to performance management systems.", "In New Zealand, an agreement between government and the primary public  service union created a \u201cPartnership for Quality\u201d framework that provides  for ongoing, mutual consultation on issues such as performance  management. Specifically, the Department of Child, Youth, and Family  Services and the Public Service Association entered into a joint partnership  agreement that emphasizes the importance of mutual consideration of each  other\u2019s organizational needs and constraints.  For example, two of the  objectives stated in the 2001\u201302 partnership agreement were to (1) develop  the parties\u2019 understanding of each other\u2019s business and (2) equip managers,  delegates, and members with the knowledge and skills required to build a  partnership for a quality relationship in the workplace.  Department and  union officials told us that this framework had considerably improved how  both parties approach potentially contentious issues, such as employee  performance management.  Also included in the partnership agreement  were measures to evaluate the success of the relationship such as  (1) sharing ownership of issues, plans, and outcomes and (2) quickly  resolving issues in a solution-focused way, with a reduction in grievances.", "The government of Canada repeatedly consulted with the Association of  Professional Executives of the Public Service of Canada (Association)  about its proposed reforms to the executive performance management  system and accompanying pay-at-risk provisions.  This dialogue began  prior to the system\u2019s rollout and continued through initial implementation  during which the Association was actively involved in collecting feedback  from executives as well as making recommendations.  For example, as part  of an assessment of Canada\u2019s Performance Management Program, based on  consultations the Association had with its membership after the first year  of the program, the Association identified several issues needing further  attention, including the need to provide executives with additional  guidance on how to develop their individual performance agreements,  particularly with regard to identifying and selecting different types of  performance commitments.  This recommendation and others were shared  with the government, and the official Performance Management Program  guidance issued the following year incorporated these concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Maintain Continuity during Transitions", "paragraphs": ["The experience of successful cultural transformations and change  management initiatives in large public and private organizations suggests  that it can often take 5 to 7 years until such initiatives are fully  implemented and cultures are transformed in a substantial manner.   Because this time frame can easily outlast the tenures of top political  appointees, high-performing organizations recognize that they need to  reinforce accountability for organizational goals during times of leadership  transitions through the use of performance agreements as part of their  performance management systems.", "At a recent GAO-sponsored roundtable, we reported on the necessity to  elevate attention, integrate various efforts, and institutionalize  accountability for addressing management issues and leading  transformational change.  The average tenure of political leadership and  the long-term nature of the change management initiatives that are needed  can have critical implications for the success of those initiatives.   Specifically, in the federal government, the frequent turnover of the  political leadership has often made it difficult to obtain the sustained and  inspired attention required to make needed changes.", "The average tenure of political appointees governmentwide for the period  1990-2001 was just under 3 years.  In addition, career executives can help  provide the long-term commitment and focus needed to transform an  agency, but the retirement eligibility of executives is increasing.  For  example, 71 percent of career senior executive service members will reach  retirement eligibility by the end of fiscal year 2005\u2014an historically high  rate of eligibility.  Without careful planning, the retirement eligibility rate  suggests an eventual loss in institutional knowledge, expertise, and  leadership continuity.", "High-performing organizations use their performance management systems  to help provide continuity during these times of transition by maintaining a  consistent focus on a set of broad programmatic priorities.  Performance  agreements can be used to clearly and concisely outline top leadership  priorities during a given year and thereby serve as a convenient vehicle for  new leadership to identify and maintain focus on the most pressing issues  confronting the organization as it transforms.  We have observed that a  specific performance expectation in the leadership\u2019s performance  agreement to lead and facilitate change during this transition could be a  critical element as organizations transform themselves to succeed in an  environment that is more results-oriented, less hierarchical, and more  integrated.  More generally, the existence of an established process for  developing and using performance agreements provides new leadership  with a tested tool that it can use to communicate its priorities and instill  those priorities throughout the organization.", "We described in August 2002 how OPS and Canada\u2019s Performance  Management Program institutionalized the use of performance agreements  in their performance management systems to withstand organizational  changes and cascaded the performance agreements from top leadership to  lower levels of the organizations.  Since 1996, OPS has used performance  agreements to align and cascade performance goals down to all  organizational levels and all employees and has required senior executives  to have annual performance agreements that link their performance  commitments to key provincial priorities and approved ministry business  plans.  In 2000, OPS extended this requirement so that agreements are now  required of all employees, from senior executives to frontline employees.   Specifically, all employees develop individual performance commitments  that link to their supervisors\u2019 performance agreements and their ministries\u2019  business plans.  Senior executives and some middle-level managers and  specialists also link commitments contained in their individual  performance plans to the government of Ontario\u2019s key provincial priorities  in areas such as fiscal control and management, human capital leadership,  and fostering a culture of innovation.", "Similarly, Canada\u2019s Performance Management Program cascades goals  down through all levels of senior executives.  It requires that each  department\u2019s deputy minister\u2014the senior career public service official  responsible for leading Canadian government departments\u2014has a written  performance agreement that links his or her individual commitments to the  organization\u2019s business plan, strategies, and priorities.  From the deputy  minister, commitments cascade down through assistant deputy ministers,  directors general, and directors.  At every level, the performance  agreement between each executive and his or her manager is intended to  document a mutual understanding about the performance that is expected  and how it will be assessed.  Some agencies, such as Industry Canada and  the Public Service Commission, have established their own programs to  cascade commitments below the director level and require the use of  performance agreements for some middle managers or supervisors within  their organizations.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report for 30 days from its  date.
