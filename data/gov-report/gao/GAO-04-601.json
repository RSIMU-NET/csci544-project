Because DOD's cost estimates to clean up its operational ranges were based on individual service calculations that combined inventory data with unvalidated DOD cost assumptions, various service assumptions, and computer-generated cost rates, these cost estimates are also questionable. Specifically, GAO found that each service compiled inventory data using various methodologies over different time periods and developed cost estimates using a mix of differing assumptions and estimates, along with actual data. As a result, the services' estimates to clean up an acre of highly contaminated land vary from about $800 for the Air Force to about $7,600 for the Army. DOD does not have a comprehensive policy requiring sampling or cleanup on operational ranges for the more than 200 chemicals associated with military munitions. However, when required by the Safe Drinking Water Act or other environmental laws, DOD has sampled and cleaned up munitions and munitions constituents. With regard to perchlorate, DOD has issued sampling policies but cannot assure funding is provided for such sampling. In some cases, DOD has sampled for perchlorate when required under the Safe Drinking Water Act's Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring Regulation and for other contaminants when directed by state environmental agencies.

Concerns about the potential cost to clean up munitions  prompted Congress to require that DOD develop an estimate for what it  would cost to clean up its operational ranges. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 required DOD to provide (1) a  comprehensive assessment of unexploded ordnance, discarded military  munitions, and munitions constituents at current and former DOD  facilities; and (2) an estimate of the aggregate projected cost of  remediation (cleanup) at operational ranges, stated as a range of costs,  including a low and high estimate. As of April 2003, DOD identified 10,444  operational ranges located in the United States and its territories, with  Army operational ranges accounting for 94 percent of the total.

The  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that about 90 percent of  the perchlorate manufactured in the United States is for solid rocket fuel  used for military purposes and by the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration. According to EPA, studies have shown that perchlorate can  interfere with thyroid function and negatively affect fetal and infant brain  development and growth. Since 1990, the state of California has detected  perchlorate in wells and other drinking water sources near sites that once  supported munitions manufacturing, storage, and testing.

EPA does  not have specific regulatory standards under the Safe Drinking Water Act  for the roughly 200 chemicals associated with military munitions use, but  requires sampling for some of these contaminants, including perchlorate.  According to DOD, at least 20 of these constituents, including perchlorate,  are of great concern due to their widespread use and potential  environmental impact. For example, EPA and some states are considering  whether to establish a specific drinking water standard for perchlorate  levels and have, in some cases, established advisory levels.

However, such estimates must be based on  accurate data that, in the case of operational ranges, begins with a  complete and accurate operational range inventory.

In January 2003,  DOD provided the services with an inventory framework and data  definitions to ensure reporting consistency and required the services to  complete detailed inventories of all of their operational ranges. DOD  revised its existing inventory of operational ranges to meet this new  requirement. Because the revised inventory was conducted for different  purposes, using a scope and set of assumptions that were different from  the inventory data used to estimate cleanup costs, it identified a different  number of operational ranges. For example, the inventory for developing  the cost estimates used actual operational range acreage, whereas the  revised inventory used actual and potential operational range acreage.  Further, the revised inventory is divided into range complexes and  individual ranges, and includes operational ranges outside the United  States and its territories not included in the inventory DOD used to  estimate cleanup costs.", "In February 2004, DOD released the results of its training range plan and  revised inventory.

This guidance specified the scope for  estimating costs but allowed for variation across the services. According to  DOD officials, because the requirement to estimate cleanup costs was a  one-time congressional requirement, DOD directed the services to limit  their data gathering efforts by using certain costing assumptions and a  computer-costing model in combination with already existing data.  Examples of the scope and some of the assumptions DOD used to estimate  costs include the following:  The scope of the inventory was limited to operational ranges within the  United States and its territories because DOD believed that was what  Congress intended.", "The scope excluded certain operational ranges, such as water ranges,  because DOD did not have a model for estimating costs associated with  such ranges and did not have any significant historical experience on  which to base an estimate. DOD also did not develop cost estimates for  several types of airspace, such as warning areas and restricted areas.", "DOD directed the services to use both a computer-costing model that  automatically assigned certain values for the cleanup costs of  unexploded ordnance and discarded military munitions and an  electronic worksheet to estimate costs to clean up munitions  constituents.", "DOD provided cost assumptions to the services based on operational  range acreage and other variables. For example, the services were  directed to divide range acreage into areas assumed to have a high  density of contamination and a low density of contamination and, on  that basis, calculate individual cleanup costs.", "DOD also provided specific assumptions to calculate costs for various  cleanup activities. For example, to estimate the cost to remove  unexploded ordnance from a highly contaminated range area, the  services were told to assume they would need to remove ordnance from  50 percent of that area to calculate the high cost estimate and 5 percent  of that area to calculate the low cost estimate.", "DOD said its assumptions were based on discussions with the services and  developed through consensus. DOD could not provide any documentation  that the assumptions they asked the services to use were validated\u2014a  confirmation of the reasonableness and justification for assumptions  used\u2014and a senior DOD official told us that, in fact, the assumptions were  not validated.", "Furthermore, DOD instructions to the services allowed them to use  additional assumptions or site-specific data so that cost estimates were  calculated based on a mix of actual data and assumptions. Based on our  review of DOD\u2019s 2003 report to Congress, and discussions with service  officials on their methodologies to estimate costs, we found DOD did not  fully explain the mix of assumptions and data used and how this mix  affected the cost estimates, so that the usefulness of DOD\u2019s overall cleanup  cost estimates to Congress is questionable.", "The inconsistencies in how the services developed their cost estimates are  evident in areas such as how the services calculated high-density acreage  (that is, the area of a range containing a high density of ordnance) and the  costs for cleaning up these acres. For example, although DOD guidance  directed the services to estimate what proportion or percentage of  operational range acreage contained a high density of unexploded  ordnance and munitions constituents, and specified how various types of  ranges were to be treated for cost estimating purposes, each service  performed this calculation differently. If site-specific data was unavailable,  the Marine Corps used varying percentages based on the characteristics of  similar ranges to determine those that were highly contaminated. Our  analysis showed that for about two-thirds of its operational ranges, the  Marine Corps assumed 10 percent of its nonsmall arms or multipurpose  range acreage was highly contaminated. However, based on a review of the  Marine Corps\u2019 total cleanup cost estimates for operational ranges, GAO  determined that the Marine Corps calculated its costs assuming that an  average 53 percent of range acreage has highly contaminated. In contrast,  the Air Force and the Army used estimated data to determine that 44  percent and 60 percent of their acreage was highly contaminated,  respectively. Further, the Air Force did not designate a percentage of each  operational range with a high density of contamination and a low density of  contamination, but rather defined each operational range as either 100  percent high density or 100 percent low density. The Navy used actual data  to determine that 11 percent of its operational range acreage was highly  contaminated. (Figure 4 shows the high and low density acreage by service  used to estimate cleanup costs.)", "Based on the data provided by the services, the model calculated four  totals for each operational range: a low and high estimated cost to clean up  the portion of the range assumed to have a low level of contamination, and  a low and high estimated cost to clean up the portion of the range assumed  to be highly contaminated. Low estimates for low and high contamination  areas were combined to calculate a total low estimate, and high estimates  for low and high contamination areas were combined to calculate a total  high estimate. (See table 3 for low and high estimates by service.)", "In general, using the model and standardized assumptions should have  produced estimates with some variation across the services because of  differing missions, operational practices, and types of munitions used.  However, as reflected in table 4, a tenfold difference in the average cost to  clean up an acre of highly contaminated rangeland calls into question the  mix of different assumptions and data used by the services to estimate  costs. For example, the Air Force\u2019s average cost to clean up an acre with a  high density of contamination was $755, whereas the Army\u2019s estimate was  $7,577.

Yet, DOD may be required by  EPA or states to sample and clean up its munitions contaminants under  various environmental laws and regulations on operational ranges. For  example, under the Clean Water Act, facilities that discharge pollutants into  surface water are required to obtain a NPDES permit from EPA or an  authorized state agency. Several states have required some DOD  installations to monitor for various contaminants associated with military  munitions as part of the NPDES permit process.

The policy stated that  the services could fund assessments using the operations and maintenance  environmental compliance account, but specified that sampling should be  considered a lower priority (Class II) environmental project and, as we found in a prior effort, was unlikely to be funded.  Finally, the policy  directed those installations that sampled for and found perchlorate to  report to DOD on the location and amount of perchlorate found. On  September 29, 2003, DOD issued a revised policy on perchlorate sampling  that directed the services to (1) consolidate data on perchlorate detections,  including data developed in response to environmental laws such as the  Clean Water Act and Safe Drinking Water Act, and (2) sample any  previously unexamined sites, including ranges, where a perchlorate release  is suspected because of prior DOD activities and where human exposure is  likely. The policy stated that the services should fund sampling using the  same environmental compliance account specified in the previous policy,  but elevated sampling to a higher (Class I) funding priority and thus made it  more likely to be funded. However, when DOD issued its policy, funding  had already been allocated to Class I requirements for fiscal year 2004. In  future years, unless specific or additional funding is added, perchlorate  sampling will have to compete with other high priority environmental  requirements and may not be funded.", "In implementing the revised policy, the services added a third criterion  requiring that installations coordinate with, or obtain written approval  from, headquarters and the chain of command before sampling for  perchlorate. However, if sampling is specifically required by an  environmental law or state agency, the service policies do not require  installations to request approval or notify headquarters before sampling.  During visits we made to selected installations with reported perchlorate  contamination between October 2003 and January 2004, we found  installations were not sampling under the revised policy to determine the  presence of perchlorate on operational ranges. More broadly, as of  February 2004, Marine Corps and Navy officials said that no installations  had requested permission to sample under this policy. According to the Air  Force, three installations asked for permission to sample for perchlorate  because EPA had asked that they sample. Air Force headquarters approved  two of the requests but denied the third because, according to Air Force  headquarters, there was not a reason to suspect the presence of  perchlorate. Four Army installations have asked for approval to sample for  perchlorate, and Army headquarters approved all four as of March 2004, an  Army headquarters official said. Overall, this suggests that little sampling is  being done under DOD\u2019s revised perchlorate policy.", "Although none of the installations had begun sampling under DOD\u2019s revised  policy, during our visits we found a few installations had sampled and  monitored for perchlorate to meet the requirements of certain  environmental laws and regulations.

The former  open burning and detonation facility is located on an operational range.  Groundwater sampling detected high levels of perchlorate\u2014up to 25,000  parts per billion.  The Army installed 56 monitoring wells on the range  to map the plume. Each well is sampled quarterly. After four years of  quarterly sampling and monitoring, Army officials said the plume is  stable and contained, which means it is isolated underground and not  expected to move. Further, officials said there is no indication that  perchlorate has migrated outside the identified plume. Under its RCRA  closure permit with the state of New Mexico, the Army must continue  monitoring the groundwater for up to 20 years.", "Three of the seven installations we visited tested for perchlorate under  the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s Unregulated Contaminant Monitoring  Regulation program. Edwards Air Force Base, in California, sampled  twice in 2002 and reported that none of the 12 chemicals listed on the  EPA list of unregulated contaminants, including perchlorate, were  detected in any of the groundwater samples collected from drinking  water wells.

Redstone Arsenal,  in Alabama, sampled quarterly for a 12-month period beginning June  2001. Two water intake sites were sampled (a drinking water source and  a drinking water and industrial water source), both along the Tennessee  River. Redstone Arsenal reported that perchlorate was not detected  above the EPA sampling level of 4 parts per billion. Nearby Huntsville,  Alabama, also sampled for perchlorate and detected no contamination,  a Redstone Arsenal official said.

The exceptions we found were two installations that had cleaned  up perchlorate under demonstration projects designed to demonstrate  perchlorate cleanup technologies. At the installations we visited,  perchlorate contamination was generally the result of research,  manufacturing, testing, and disposal of munitions (such as rocket motors)  that contained high levels of perchlorate. In one case, the perchlorate  resulted from training with smoke munitions containing perchlorate.", "Although six of the seven sites we visited reported high levels of  perchlorate contamination, none of these installations were conducting  cleanup actions specifically directed at perchlorate.

(See app. IV for details of perchlorate contamination caused by such  factors.)  Only Aberdeen Proving Ground, in Maryland, reported that some  perchlorate contamination was due to the use of perchlorate during  training exercises on operational ranges. Further, Aberdeen was the only  installation we visited where perchlorate had contaminated a neighboring  municipal water supply. At Aberdeen, perchlorate concentrations of up to 5  parts per billion have been detected in drinking water supply wells and 24  parts per billion have been detected in groundwater.", "Between June and August 2002, Aberdeen Proving Ground sampled  drinking water wells owned by the city of Aberdeen located in and along  the northern border between the city and the installation, and detected  perchlorate contamination in four wells ranging from 1.2 to 5 parts per  billion. According to Aberdeen officials, the installation sampled for  perchlorate because it was required to do so by the state of Maryland.  Groundwater samples taken near the well field showed a large perchlorate  plume with contamination levels up to 24 parts per billion. Aberdeen  Proving Ground officials attributed the perchlorate contamination to  intensive testing and training with smoke grenades and other obscurants.  Until about mid-2002, during training exercises in the vicinity of the city of  Aberdeen drinking water wells, Aberdeen Proving Ground trained troops  using smoke grenades that contained perchlorate. After perchlorate was  found in city drinking water, Aberdeen Proving Ground stopped all training  with smoke grenades containing perchlorate. However, officials at  Aberdeen Proving Ground are not cleaning up the perchlorate detected in  city wells. Instead, both the city of Aberdeen and the installation sample  finished water and production wells on an alternating monthly schedule:   Finished water is sampled weekly, four production wells are sampled twice  a month, and the remaining eight production wells are sampled monthly.  Recent sampling has detected contamination below the EPA interim  assessment guidance of 4 parts per billion, but in some cases, well samples  have been above the Maryland Department of the Environment public  health advisory for perchlorate, which is 1 part per billion for drinking  water. In the event a sample is found to be above the Maryland state  advisory limit, the city of Aberdeen blends well water without perchlorate  with well water containing perchlorate to lower the concentration level to  below 1 part per billion.

Instead, DOD provided only general information to Congress on  the assumptions and cost model used without specific details on how costs  were developed or the effect of assumptions used on the resulting cost  estimates. Consequently, we believe it is difficult for Congress to evaluate  the cost estimates DOD provided and that it may be unwise to rely on them  for assessing the potential liability associated with contamination on  operational ranges. Reliable cost estimates can be a critical piece of  information for DOD and Congress when considering the potential costs  versus benefits of closing operational ranges or entire installations.

However, the  guidance DOD cited pertains only to the migration of munitions  constituents off-range and the reporting of environmental liabilities, but  does not address the sampling or cleanup of munitions constituents found  on operational ranges that are the subject of this report. Further, DOD\u2019s  letter states that it is responding to munitions constituents at 23  installations and ranges. We acknowledge that DOD is sampling for, and in  some cases, cleaning up munitions constituents when directed to do so by  EPA or a state environmental agency under various environmental laws. In  reviewing the data provided by DOD, however, we found that only 2 of the  installations they cited had operational ranges and both of those were  being cleaned up because of EPA direction or a court order. At the 12 other  installations with active ranges, half of them had sampled or were sampling  for munitions constituents as a result of EPA or state environmental agency  requests, RCRA requirements, or cleanup associated with Superfund  hazardous waste sites.

Although the act allowed DOD to develop cost  estimates that did not meet the same standards as required for the report of  liabilities in DOD\u2019s annual financial statement, we believe that DOD had a  responsibility to provide Congress with useful information by making a  reasonable attempt to prepare accurate and complete estimates, including  assuring that its assumptions were valid. However, as our report sets out,  the inconsistencies in how DOD collected and analyzed data on operational  ranges raise questions about the reliability of DOD\u2019s inventory. Specifically,  DOD did not provide Congress with a detailed description of how the costs  were prepared and an explanation of where site-specific data were used in  place of assumptions, why specific and different assumptions were used by  the services, and how assumptions affected the overall cost estimates.  Without DOD\u2019s supporting data and analysis, it is difficult for Congress to  evaluate the accuracy or validity of the cost estimates DOD provided and it  may be unwise to rely on them for assessing the potential liability  associated with contamination on operational ranges.", "DOD disagreed with our recommendation that it needed to develop new  cost estimates for cleaning up operational ranges, stating that it is  developing a system for providing auditable data that meets the standards  for the report of liabilities and is actively assessing its ranges for potential  munitions constituent migration to off-range areas. However, the  requirement in the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2002  was to report estimated costs to clean up operational ranges, not the costs  to respond to or clean up constituent migration off-range. In its letter to  GAO, DOD also questioned whether decision makers would find useful an  estimated cost to clean up operational ranges and asserted that it is not  required to develop cleanup estimates for operational ranges until such  costs become probable and estimable by accounting standards. We  disagree with DOD\u2019s view of the information and its usefulness to  Congress. Congress on two occasions asked DOD to provide just such  information. Specifically, the 2002 Defense Authorization Act required that  DOD report this information. In addition, the Senate Committee on Armed  Services, in its report accompanying the National Defense Authorization  Act for fiscal year 2000 (S. Rep. No. 106-50), directed DOD to provide to the  congressional defense committees a report with a complete estimate of  current and projected costs to clean up munitions constituents.

As a result, perchlorate sampling must compete  with other high priority environmental priorities for funding and, due to  limited funds, may not be funded. The result is that while DOD policy has  designated a funding mechanism for perchlorate, DOD\u2019s policy cannot  assure that perchlorate sampling will be funded.

During  periods of rain, the river flows from the installation to the neighboring  White Sands National Monument. The contamination was found on the  installation near a former munitions operations site and rocket sled. Air  Force officials said it was unlikely that the contamination was due to  training. They attributed the perchlorate contamination to munitions  research and testing in the 1960s and 1970s. Officials at White Sands  National Monument attributed the perchlorate contamination to spent  rocket motors stacked near the river and a high-speed rocket sled used to  test the effects of acceleration. DOD and New Mexico\u2019s state  environmental agency sampled the riverbed and surrounding area again in  1999 and 2000 but did not find the high concentration of perchlorate  previously detected.

Indian  Head detected maximum perchlorate concentrations between 88 and  450,000 parts per billion in the soil at two of the three landfills.

At one site, sampling  detected perchlorate concentrations up to 25,000 parts per billion. Officials  said they were unsure of the precise cause of the contamination but said  they initially believed it was due to an open burning and detonation facility  used in the 1950s to incinerate rocket motors. However, officials also said  that the contamination plume was uphill from where the open burning and  detonation site is believed to have been, so that the contamination may be  generally due to previous testing of hazardous materials in the area.  Perchlorate was also found at the former site of a high-energy laser system  test facility. Perchlorate contamination detected has been as high as 118  and 295 parts per billion in some wells. Officials said the contamination  might be due to open ground burning of expended test items, or residue  from actual tests, conducted prior to 1995.
