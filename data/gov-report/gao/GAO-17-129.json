GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and guidance; visited a nongeneralizable group of seven states and five counties in two of those states, selected by foster care population and diversity of location; analyzed selected states' data on medication use in foster care populations; and interviewed officials from federal, state, and county child welfare, Medicaid, and other agencies, as well as officials from nine relevant national organizations selected to represent a variety of views."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State child welfare and Medicaid officials in seven selected states reported a variety of practices to support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications, which affect mood, thought, or behavior, for children in foster care. Practices include screening for mental health conditions, developing prescription guidelines, and monitoring a child's health while on medication. Additional state efforts aim to increase mental health knowledge among stakeholders and improve access to mental health services. However, officials in four selected states and from five national mental health organizations said limited access to mental health services was a challenge. Five of the selected states have begun offering remote consultation services that connect patients with mental health specialists. State officials said strong interagency collaboration and outreach to stakeholders helped them implement practices more effectively.", "While some selected states have reduced medication use among these children, states focused on other measures to gauge the results of their efforts. Four of the seven selected states reduced medication use from 2011 through 2015, two states had steady rates, and the remaining state did not have data during this time period. These data, however, cannot be compared across states because states use different methodologies to collect data. Officials in three selected states said reducing medication use may not be appropriate for every child, and officials in all seven states said they focus instead on measures such as tracking the use of medications that can have negative side effects and the use of psychosocial services (e.g., therapy) for children in foster care. Officials in most selected states discussed limitations with gathering data needed to oversee medication use, such as disparate data systems, resource constraints, and privacy concerns related to data sharing among state child welfare and Medicaid agencies and with managed care organizations. Officials in some states that shared data said they overcame privacy concerns through written interagency agreements and educating stakeholders.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has taken steps to help state child welfare and Medicaid agencies support the appropriate use of psychotropic medications and identify mental health needs and treatments for children in foster care. HHS has focused its efforts on practices for prescribing, screening and diagnosis, and access to trauma-related services. HHS is also working with states to implement voluntary measures to track medication use, other mental health treatments, and a child's overall health. In 2012, HHS hosted a meeting for state leaders to help them establish effective medication oversight practices. Despite the positive outcomes resulting from this meeting, and HHS guidance that says an agency goal is to facilitate cross-system collaborations, such as in the oversight of psychotropic medications, it has not convened meetings with all stakeholders together since 2012. Though HHS has conducted webinars, created learning communities, and convened smaller meetings, HHS officials said it has no plans to convene all stakeholders as it did in 2012 due to resource constraints.

As part of that review, we also reported on the  prevalence of certain prescribing patterns not supported by research that  could pose health risks. These patterns included the use of five or more  psychotropic medications at the same time, doses exceeding maximum  levels based on labels approved by the Food and Drug Administration,  and prescriptions made to children under the age of 1.", "There are a number of state and federal agencies that play a role in  ensuring that children in foster care receive appropriate treatments for  mental health conditions. At the state level, child welfare and Medicaid  agencies, along with other partners, have various responsibilities that  help ensure appropriate treatments for children in foster care. State child  welfare agencies are primarily involved in determining where and with  whom a child in foster care should live (placement) and for providing or  arranging needed supports, including certain physical and mental health  services. In addition, most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid,  and state Medicaid agencies may choose from a variety of delivery  systems to provide and pay for their health services. At the federal level,  the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) monitors state  implementation of relevant federal programs, including those that provide  federal assistance to support state child welfare and foster care  programs, through the Administration for Children and Families (ACF).  HHS also oversees the Medicaid program through the Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), in accordance with federal laws,  regulations, and guidance. These agencies, along with HHS\u2019s Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)\u2014which  undertakes efforts to improve substance abuse and mental health  treatment, prevention, and related services for individuals\u2014provide  support to states in their efforts to ensure child well-being.", "You asked us to study efforts to oversee psychotropic medications for  children in foster care since we last reported on the issue in 2014.

The states we selected were Arizona, California, Illinois, Maryland, New  Jersey, Ohio, and Washington. Our selection criteria included (1) a high  percentage of children in foster care in the state when compared  nationwide in fiscal year 2014; (2) variation in Medicaid and child  welfare systems; (3) recommendations from national organizations; and  (4) geographic diversity. In the two selected states with county- administered child welfare systems, California and Ohio, we selected five  counties and conducted interviews with officials from the respective  county-level child welfare and Medicaid agencies, as appropriate. These  counties were selected based on factors similar to those mentioned  above as well as variation in population density (i.e., rural versus urban).  We also conducted a review of selected literature related to the use of  psychotropic medications among children in foster care.", "To examine how state child welfare and Medicaid agencies work to  ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications, we also  reviewed guidance and other documents identified by officials from  selected states and counties.

In addition, while we focused our  review on children in foster care, state oversight practices may also  pertain to other children on Medicaid. To examine the results of state  efforts to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications, we  gathered and analyzed available data from selected states on the use of  these medications among children in foster care from 2011 through  2015. We determined these data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of describing trends in the percentage of children in foster care  on psychotropic medications for each of the selected states.

Child welfare caseworkers at the agency are typically  responsible for coordinating placement and needed support services for  these children, including those for mental health. If a child is determined  to be in need of mental health services, the caseworker is generally  responsible for arranging such services to be provided by primary care  physicians, child psychiatrists, or other mental health providers. State  courts, typically juvenile or family courts, are also frequently involved in  decisions regarding a child\u2019s removal, placement, and services.", "Most children in foster care are eligible for Medicaid, and those enrolled  may receive physical and mental health services through a variety of  service delivery and provider payment systems, such as fee-for-service  and managed care. In the traditional fee-for-service delivery system, the  state Medicaid agency manages the program and reimburses physicians  directly and on a retrospective basis for each health service delivered.  Under a managed care model, states contract with one or more managed  care organizations and prospectively pay the organizations a fixed  monthly fee per patient to provide or arrange for defined health services,  which may include mental health services and prescription medications.  These organizations, in turn, pay physicians.", "States are primarily responsible for administering their child welfare and  foster care programs, consistent with applicable federal laws and  regulations, which include some requirements that relate to ensuring the  well-being of children served by these programs. For example, title IV-E  of the Social Security Act authorizes federal funding to states to help  cover the costs of operating their foster care and certain other  programs. In addition, title IV-B of the Social Security Act authorizes  federal funds to support state child welfare programs and services. Both  of these programs establish various requirements that participating states  must comply with in order to receive the federal funding. The Fostering  Connections to Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 amended  title IV-B to add a requirement that states develop a plan for the ongoing  oversight and coordination of health care services for children in foster  care, including mental health and oversight of prescription medications.  The Child and Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act amended  this provision to require that these plans include protocols for the  appropriate use and monitoring of psychotropic medications. HHS\u2019s  ACF is responsible for monitoring state implementation of title IV-E and  IV-B programs. For example, ACF conducts reviews of state child welfare  and foster care programs every 5 years to ensure conformity with  requirements under these federal programs. ACF also monitors state  compliance with title IV-B plan requirements, including the health care  oversight and coordination plan, through its review of states\u2019 five-year  Child and Family Services Plans and Annual Progress and Services  Reports. In addition, ACF\u2019s mission is to promote the economic and  social well-being of families, children, individuals, and communities  through funding, guidance, training, and technical assistance.", "Under the Medicaid program, states are required to provide eligible  children under age 21 with coverage for certain health services, which  may include mental health services, through the Early and Periodic  Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) benefit. Specifically,  federal law requires coverage of periodic screening services, including a  comprehensive health and developmental history of both physical and  mental health development, a comprehensive physical exam, appropriate  immunizations, laboratory tests, and health education. The EPSDT  benefit also covers treatment services necessary to correct or ameliorate  any identified physical or mental illnesses or conditions. HHS\u2019s CMS  oversees state Medicaid programs and provides federal matching funds  for eligible services. On an annual basis, states are required to report to  CMS information on their Drug Utilization Review programs, including  prescribing patterns, cost savings generated by the programs, an  assessment of the programs\u2019 impact on quality of care, and program  operations, including information on new innovative practices adopted by  states. CMS includes these reports on its website.", "In addition, state mental health agencies are generally responsible for  planning and operating state mental health systems, and play an  important role in administering, funding, and providing treatments.

These medications have  been widely tested in children and are generally considered safe;  however, ADHD medications have also been associated with side effects  such as sleeplessness, loss of appetite, tics, agitation, hallucinations, liver  problems, and suicidal thoughts. In addition, antidepressants, such as  fluoxetine (e.g., Prozac) and sertraline (e.g., Zoloft) can be used to treat  conditions such as depression and anxiety.

These measures generally examine physician prescribing patterns, state  oversight practices, and child placement, health, education, and juvenile  justice outcomes. For additional information on measures collected by  each selected state, see appendix II.", "Physician prescribing patterns. All seven selected states examine  data to better understand certain prescribing patterns, such as the use  of antipsychotics, the use of multiple psychotropic medications at the  same time, and dosage levels for the medications prescribed. Child  welfare and Medicaid officials in all of these states said they have  particularly focused on antipsychotic medications, in part due to  concerns about inappropriate use of these medications and their  potential negative side effects for children. Officials in five states told  us their state has experienced reductions in antipsychotic use among  children in foster care in recent years. Researchers have also noted  that concerns about the use of antipsychotic medications spurred  state efforts to oversee and improve prescription behavior, and a June  2016 study examining Medicaid data in 20 states from 2005 through  2010 found that trends in the use of these medications are no longer  increasing. However, the study noted that current prescribing  patterns for antipsychotics at the \u201cnew normal\u201d rates of use remain of  great concern to many stakeholders.", "Child welfare and Medicaid officials in one state also underscored the  significance of examining prescribing patterns after they observed  spikes in the use of certain medications. These officials said that after  their state started requiring second opinions for ADHD prescriptions,  they saw increases in prescriptions of antipsychotics, and after  requiring second opinions on antipsychotics, they saw increases in  prescriptions for the use of multiple psychotropic medications at the  same time. Officials interpreted these patterns as showing that some  physicians choose to prescribe certain medications partly to avoid  their state\u2019s oversight practices. These officials expressed concern  that new requirements may cause increased medication use in other  areas, which would need to be monitored.", "State oversight practices. While selected states may have similar  reported practices for overseeing the use of psychotropic medications,  they vary in whether they examine data to determine if their practices  are followed. For example, while child welfare and Medicaid officials in  all seven states told us their state requires some form of agreement or  informed consent for a child\u2019s treatment plan, officials in three of these  states told us they review reports on whether such an agreement was  obtained. In addition, while officials in six states said their state  requires or recommends a caseworker or physician conduct follow-up  visits with a child on psychotropic medications, officials in one of these  states told us they examine data on the required follow-up, specifically  for ADHD medications. Officials in three of these states told us they  do examine data on whether a physician monitors the child\u2019s  metabolic health, including height, weight, and lipid panels. These  measures can be used to monitor whether a child is experiencing any  adverse effects as a result of taking medications. Child welfare and  Medicaid officials in most selected states said they have particularly  focused on ensuring children in foster care receive psychosocial  services to help address experiences with trauma. Officials in all  seven states said their state has guidelines that require or  recommend the use of psychosocial services prior to or concurrently  with a psychotropic medication, and officials in all of these states told  us they examine data on the number of children in foster care who  received such services. Officials in four of these states told us their  state has increased the use of psychosocial services. For example, a  2013 study on physicians\u2019 use of Washington\u2019s telephone line for  mental health consultations between 2008 and 2011 found a 132  percent increase in outpatient mental health visits for children  currently or previously in foster care after a consultation. However,  as mentioned earlier, child welfare and Medicaid officials in most of  the selected states\u2014as well as multiple studies\u2014have noted  continuing challenges with access to psychosocial services.", "While we did not assess states\u2019 implementation of specific practices to  oversee the use of psychotropic medications, findings from a 2016  California State Auditor report highlight the importance of having  measures in place to ensure that state practices are followed.  Specifically, the report found multiple cases where children in foster  care received prescriptions for psychotropic medications without court  authorization or parental consent, which, according to the report, is a  violation of state law.", "Child placement, health, education, and juvenile justice  outcomes. Most of the seven selected states collect data to monitor  outcomes for children on psychotropic medications. For example,  child welfare and Medicaid officials in four selected states told us they  monitor information on whether a child in foster care on psychotropic  medications experiences a placement disruption (the child is moved  from one placement to another). Multiple studies have shown that  placement disruptions are associated with increased mental health  needs and poor social-emotional outcomes, and that problem  behavior can be an indicator of risk for future placement disruptions.  Since children may be prescribed psychotropic medications to help  treat problem behaviors, examining data on disruptions can help  states better understand whether children with problem behaviors on  medications are improving or are still having serious behavioral  problems. Some states also examine health, education, and juvenile  justice outcome measures for children in foster care on psychotropic  medications. Child welfare and Medicaid officials in a few states said  such measures can help them determine whether the care and  services provided to children in foster care are helping these children  lead healthy and productive lives. For example, Illinois child welfare  officials told us they examine whether a child under the age of 6 on a  psychotropic medication has symptoms of self-harm or is hospitalized.  In addition, Maryland child welfare officials told us they examine data  on school enrollment and academic performance for children in foster  care on psychotropic medications, whereas Washington officials told  us they examine data on whether children in foster care with mental  health needs, including those on psychotropic medications, have any  involvement in the juvenile justice system.", "Child welfare and Medicaid officials in most of the seven selected states  discussed common challenges in their efforts to collect data needed to  oversee the use of medications by children in foster care and to monitor  outcomes for these children. In five of the seven states, officials  discussed technical issues with obtaining reliable data. They said data on  psychotropic medications and other mental health services for children in  foster care can involve data systems from state child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies. In addition, they said data needed to gauge  whether a child\u2019s life improves with treatment\u2014such as the child\u2019s living  situation and their health, education, and juvenile justice outcomes\u2014can  involve many other data systems, including those from state education  and juvenile justice agencies. Because some of these agencies may not  collect information specifically on the foster care population, officials said  gathering these data may require data matching across these systems. In  some selected states, officials said this information may also involve  county-level agencies that can vary in the types of data they collect as  well as one or more third-party managed care organizations that report to  state Medicaid agencies. These officials said matching such data can be  difficult and time-consuming, and state child welfare and Medicaid  officials in three selected states discussed limitations with data gathering  due to resource and time constraints, given other competing priorities.", "State child welfare and Medicaid officials in five selected states also  discussed privacy concerns related to data sharing. For example, officials  in two of these states said state agencies are reluctant to share sensitive  data on individuals due to their concerns about privacy protections under  the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 for health  information and the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act for  education information. Similarly, officials in two other states expressed  uncertainty over the types of data they were able to share under state and  federal laws. Child welfare and Medicaid officials in three of the five  counties where we conducted interviews discussed similar privacy  concerns with data sharing among county-level agencies. Child welfare  and Medicaid officials in two of the five states that expressed privacy  concerns also discussed concerns about sharing data with managed care  organizations. They said they were in the process of determining how to  share information specifically on the foster care population with these  organizations as well as what data to collect from them.", "State child welfare and Medicaid officials in some selected states that  were able to share data said they overcame privacy concerns through  negotiating written agreements and educating stakeholders about sharing  data consistent with state and federal privacy requirements. For example,  Maryland child welfare and Medicaid officials said their agencies each  formed an agreement to share data with the same contractor, who  matched data on children in foster care with Medicaid data on claims for  psychotropic medications and mental health services, and reported the information to state agencies without providing personal data. In addition,  Maryland child welfare officials said their agency entered into an  agreement with their state education agency to share education  information for children in foster care. This agreement granted certain  officials access to personal information, and these officials assigned  anonymous identifiers to each child to protect their privacy while  facilitating data sharing. California child welfare officials told us they  recently worked with their state education and juvenile justice agencies to  issue a letter that summarizes existing state and federal laws that pertain  to the sharing of information and records between local education  agencies, county child welfare agencies, and caregivers for children in  foster care. In addition, Washington child welfare officials discussed data  sharing agreements among multiple state agencies that allowed the state  to match and share client-level information across more than 30 state  data systems. These officials attributed the success of their agreements  to strong state leadership and the development of trust and buy-in among  the stakeholders involved."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HHS Assists States in Addressing Medication Use and the Mental Health Needs of Children, Though More Could Be Done to Support Collaboration across State Agencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HHS Supports States in Overseeing Medication Use and Determining Children\u2019s Mental Health Needs and Treatment Options", "paragraphs": ["Since our 2014 review of psychotropic medications for children in foster  care, ACF, CMS, and SAMHSA have continued to provide support to  states\u2014generally in the form of funding and technical assistance\u2014to  assist with oversight of these medications.

As discussed  earlier, these recommendations emphasize that holistic mental health  treatment can include medication, but that medication should be only one  part of the overall plan. State officials in most of our selected states said  they reviewed AACAP recommendations when developing their own  guidelines and oversight practices for children in foster care. For  example, child welfare officials in Illinois said they worked with a  representative of their state AACAP branch, among others, to develop  guidelines on prescribing medications, which, according to these officials,  were included in their state law. In addition, Ohio\u2019s medication  management and oversight program included clinical resources and  prescribing guidelines for physicians based on AACAP\u2019s  recommendations.", "SAMHSA also supports child welfare agency staff and mental health  stakeholders seeking to ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic  medications for children in foster care through a contract with the  Technical Assistance Network at the University of Maryland\u2019s School of  Social Work. SAMHSA funds a medical director position at the network,  and that director works with 55 child and adolescent psychiatrists in state  and county governments to address issues regarding psychotropic  medication, including strategies to help ensure children receive  appropriate treatment. Specifically, the director created a community  listserv of child and adolescent psychiatrists to disseminate best practices  and developed webinars on medication oversight. According to SAMHSA  officials, the medical director, with input from the listserv community, is  developing guidance on how to take youth off medication, an issue that  child welfare officials in one selected state said can be a challenge. As  these officials explained, psychiatrists generally are reimbursed more for  medication management than psychotherapy, which can create a  disincentive for keeping children off medication. Through the network\u2019s  Clinical Distance Learning Series, SAMHSA also developed webinars and  issue briefs on the oversight of psychotropic medications for children on  Medicaid, including one on developing performance measures. According  to SAMHSA officials, the technical assistance network has also begun  planning for a multi-year collaborative for residential treatment centers  that have an interest in addressing the use of antipsychotic medications  among the youth they serve. As they explained, the goal of this group is  to increase best practices related to the use of antipsychotic medications  for youth in residential care and reduce outlier practices, such as  prescribing children too many medications or at dosages exceeding  maximum levels based on labels approved by the Food and Drug  Administration. Through funding, SAMHSA has continued to support a  multi-year virtual learning community in which community participants  receive technical assistance, including monthly e-newsletters, webinar  invitations, and access tools and resources. SAMHSA-funded webinars have included issues such as cross-system data sharing, education and  engagement of key stakeholders, phone psychiatric consultation models,  and red flag and response systems for medication oversight.", "CMS, in its 2015 Quality Conference, hosted a Medicaid Track that  included a session for Medicaid and health care professionals on  physician prescribing patterns considered high risk because of the  adverse side effects, including the use of antipsychotic medications. The  National Committee for Quality Assurance, a nationally recognized quality  improvement entity, presented the results of its efforts to develop  measures to oversee medication use at the conference. According to  CMS officials, this session prompted formation of a group for interested  state Medicaid agencies and their partners on the use of antipsychotic  medications for children. Eights states are participating in the group as of  October 2016. These states are working on various projects to improve  appropriate medication use and monitoring for possible side effects.

Under title IV-B of  the Social Security Act, states are required to develop their plans for  oversight and coordination of health care services for children in foster  care in collaboration with the state Medicaid agency, and in consultation  with pediatricians, experts in health care, and experts in and recipients of  child welfare services. HHS\u2019s guidance on implementing this provision  and overseeing psychotropic medication use notes that state oversight  should include coordination among and mechanisms to actively engage  with child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health stakeholders to improve  outcomes for this population. This guidance also discussed HHS\u2019s goal  of facilitating cross-system collaborations for the purposes of promoting  improved behavioral health diagnosis, treatment, service delivery, and  service tracking for children in foster care, which includes actions to  increase oversight and monitoring of psychotropic medications. However,  HHS\u2019s assistance to states around collaboration has generally focused on  a limited number of states or certain stakeholder groups. For example,  SAMHSA hosted a day-long technical assistance meeting in 2015 for  states with the capacity and commitment to implement improved cross- agency oversight of medication use, however, the meeting was limited to  five states. In addition, at its August 2016 National Conference on Child  Abuse and Neglect, HHS held a breakout session which focused on a  range of issues, including evaluation and oversight of medication, and  how effective psychotropic medication oversight systems work in concert  with efforts to ensure access to effective psychosocial services.

In the final rule, ACF  stated that the new information system will provide child welfare agencies  with the tools and flexibility to rapidly share data among multiple  programs, including Medicaid and mental health. As discussed earlier,  officials from child welfare and Medicaid agencies in most of the selected  states spoke of challenges related to concerns about state and federal  laws protecting individuals\u2019 privacy. In 2013, we reported that state and  local human services agencies, among others surveyed, identified  challenges related to the interpretation of federal privacy requirements as  they balance the need to protect clients\u2019 personal information while  increasing the use of data sharing. These challenges included confusion  or misperceptions about what agencies are allowed to share as well as a  tendency to be risk averse and overly cautious in their interpretation of  federal privacy requirements. ACF officials told us some states interpret  federal laws on protecting confidentiality to have barriers when there often  are not barriers at the federal level. They added that they have used their  confidentiality toolkit to debunk myths and concerns with data sharing,  though child welfare officials we interviewed in a few of the selected  states said they were not aware of a federal toolkit on data sharing.", "State officials in all seven selected states spoke of the importance of  collaboration, and some said successful cross-agency collaboration has  helped them oversee the use of psychotropic medications more  effectively. Further, officials in most of these states said they benefitted  from HHS\u2019s national convening in August 2012 of state directors of child  welfare, Medicaid, and mental health agencies to address the use of  psychotropic medications for children in foster care and their mental  health needs. The meeting (\u201cBecause Minds Matter\u201d), hosted by ACF,  CMS, and SAMHSA, provided an opportunity for state leaders to enhance  their collaboration on the appropriate use of psychotropic medications.  Officials we spoke with said it helped them develop prescribing guidelines  and expand reporting on psychotropic medications.

Likewise, the meeting was the impetus for another  selected state\u2019s child welfare and Medicaid agency partnership and its  quality improvement project, according to state officials. This project  involved engaging with multiple stakeholders throughout the state,  forming work groups to study psychotropic medication use, and  developing training materials and guidance on the proper use of these  medications. In a third selected state, three lead agency directors and  medical directors formed a team to provide clinical oversight of their foster  care population. In addition, officials in one selected state said their  participation in the meeting, and in other collaborative efforts, helped  them learn about the work of other states in effective monitoring of mental  health care for children in foster care, including an improved ability to  monitor medication use.", "State officials in three of the seven selected states said more federal  government leadership could help them work through ongoing  challenges, including (1) obtaining best practices in medication use  concurrent with other treatments; (2) overcoming siloes across child  welfare, Medicaid, and mental health systems serving the foster care  population; and (3) enhancing access to child and adolescent psychiatric  resources. In addition, officials in selected states transitioning their foster  care populations into managed care expressed concern about the  transition, and the need to manage the transition to ensure optimal care  coordination. Some of the concerns identified include (1) ensuring state  agencies share data with the managed care providers to facilitate  continuity of care, (2) bringing all the necessary stakeholders onboard  during the transition to ensure a common understanding of concepts and  roles, and (3) ensuring managed care plans have the needed tools to  accommodate non-traditionally served populations that have high medical  needs.", "State child welfare, Medicaid, and mental health officials in three selected  states said having other events similar to the one hosted by HHS in 2012  could provide further support in addressing these challenges.

These  organizations were: American Academy of Child & Adolescent Psychiatry,  American Academy of Pediatrics, Center for Health Care Strategies, Child  Welfare League of America, Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access  Commission, National Association of Medicaid Directors, National  Association of Public Child Welfare Administrators, National Association  of State Mental Health Program Directors, and National Alliance on  Mental Illness.", "For all our interviews, we used a semi-structured interview protocol that  included open-ended questions about state child welfare and Medicaid  delivery systems; state and county oversight practices, including related  challenges and measurement of outcomes; and federal efforts to assist  states. Information was volunteered by officials in each interview in  response to these open-ended questions. Thus, the counts of  organizations citing such responses vary. We reviewed relevant  documents to corroborate information obtained in our interviews, when  possible.", "To examine how state child welfare and Medicaid agencies work to  ensure the appropriate use of psychotropic medications, we also  reviewed guidance and other documents identified by officials from  selected states and counties. While we identified selected states\u2019  oversight and monitoring practices related to psychotropic medications  based on interviews and these document reviews, we did not assess the  effectiveness of states\u2019 implementation of these practices, nor did we  evaluate their compliance with state or federal requirements or whether  there are controls in place to help ensure that required practices are  followed. In addition, while we focused our review on children in foster  care, state oversight practices may also pertain to other children on  Medicaid. We also reviewed guidance on oversight and monitoring of  psychotropic medications for children issued by national health care  professional organizations. In addition, we reached out to selected  states\u2019 audit agencies and HHS\u2019s Office of Inspector General to identify  past, ongoing, or planned work in this area. We also conducted a review  of selected literature, including reports from academic, professional, and  governmental organizations, related to the use of psychotropic  medications and published since GAO\u2019s report in April 2014.", "To examine the results of state efforts to ensure the appropriate use of  psychotropic medications, we gathered and analyzed available data from  selected states on the use of these medications among children in foster  care from 2011 through 2015. We selected this range in order to gather  data on 5-year trends that included the most recent data available. To  examine the reliability of these data, we interviewed and sent a  questionnaire to relevant state child welfare and Medicaid officials and  examined the data received to identify any obvious outliers. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  describing trends in the percentage of children in foster care on  psychotropic medications for each of the selected states. However,  because these states use different methodologies to collect data (e.g.,  states collected data for different time periods and ages of children in  foster care), the data are not comparable among them. In addition, the  results of our analyses are not generalizable nationwide. Information  collected from selected states, such as on their oversight practices and  measures collected to examine the results of their efforts, was provided to  officials in each selected state for their review and verification.", "To examine HHS\u2019s actions to support state efforts related to psychotropic  medications, we interviewed officials from the Administration for Children  and Families, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and Substance  Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, and reviewed relevant  documents. In addition, we reviewed guidance on oversight and  monitoring of psychotropic medications for children issued by HHS and  used it as criteria for our recommendation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Selected State Information", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Agency Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Elizabeth Morrison (Assistant  Director), Claudine Pauselli (Analyst-in-Charge), Linda Collins, and Nhi  Nguyen made key contributions to this report.
