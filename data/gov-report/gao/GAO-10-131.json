The Government Accountability Office (GAO) was asked to examine: (1) the extent to which DHS has developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration that includes the characteristics recommended in GAO's 2005 report; (2) how DHS is implementing management integration; and (3) the extent to which the USM is holding the department and component management chiefs accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships. GAO reviewed DHS plans and interviewed management officials in DHS's headquarters and in all components."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS has not yet developed a comprehensive strategy for management integration as required by the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007 and with the characteristics GAO recommended in a 2005 report. Although DHS stated in response to the 2005 report that it was developing an integration strategy, it has not yet done so, in part because it has focused on building operations capacity within functional management areas. In the absence of a comprehensive management integration strategy, DHS officials stated that documents such as management directives and strategic plans address aspects of a management integration strategy and can help the department to manage its integration efforts. However, they do not generally include all of the strategy characteristics GAO identified, such as identifying the critical links that must occur among management initiatives and time lines for monitoring the progress of these initiatives. In addition, DHS has increased the number of performance measures for the Management Directorate, but has not yet established measures for assessing management integration across the department, although DHS officials stated that the department intends to do so. Without these measures DHS cannot assess its progress in implementing and achieving management integration. In the absence of a comprehensive strategy, DHS's Management Directorate has implemented management integration through certain initiatives and mechanisms to communicate and consolidate management policies, processes, and systems. The directorate uses councils to communicate information related to the implementation of management initiatives, among other things. The directorate has also established governance boards and processes to manage specific activities. Further, the directorate is in the process of consolidating certain management systems. However, without a documented management integration strategy, it is difficult for DHS, Congress, and other key stakeholders to understand and monitor the critical linkages and prioritization among these various efforts. The USM and department and component management chiefs are held accountable for implementing management integration through reporting relationships at three levels--between the Secretary and the USM, the USM and department chiefs, and the department and component chiefs--in which, among other things, the Secretary of Homeland Security, USM, and department chiefs are required to provide input into performance plans and evaluations. The Deputy Secretary--through delegation from the Secretary--and the USM have provided input into the USM's and department chiefs' plans and evaluations, respectively. Although department chiefs are required by management directives to provide component chiefs with written objectives at the start of the annual performance cycle, in fiscal year 2009 only two out of six department chiefs provided such input to component chiefs. Without ensuring that the management chiefs provide input into component chiefs' performance plans and evaluations as required, the directorate cannot be sure that component chiefs are fully implementing management integration."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) represented  one of the largest reorganizations and consolidations of government  agencies, personnel, programs, and operations in recent history, initially  bringing together approximately 180,000 employees from 22 originating  agencies. DHS is now the third largest federal government agency with  more than 200,000 employees and an annual budget of more than $40  billion. DHS began operations in March 2003 with missions that included  preventing terrorist attacks from occurring within the United States,  reducing U.S. vulnerability to terrorism, minimizing damages from attacks  that occur, and helping the nation recover from any attacks. The  department has initiated and continued the implementation of various  policies and programs to address these missions as well as missions that  are not directly related to securing the homeland, such as Coast Guard  search and rescue.

We noted that  DHS had made progress in addressing its departmentwide management  integration through the issuance of guidance and plans to assist the  integration of each individual management function within the  department. However, we observed that DHS had the opportunity to  expand those efforts by implementing a more comprehensive and  sustained approach to management integration departmentwide. In  particular, we recommended that DHS develop an overarching strategy for  management integration. In response to the 2005 report, DHS stated that it  was developing an integration strategy. We also suggested that Congress  might want to consider whether DHS\u2019s Under Secretary for Management  (USM)\u2014who heads the department\u2019s Management Directorate\u2014has the  authority to drive, implement, and ensure accountability for management  integration departmentwide.", "You asked us to review the status of DHS management integration efforts  since our 2005 report.

The department  has remained on our high-risk list since 2003. Most recently, in our  January 2009 high-risk update, we reported that, although DHS had made  progress in transforming into a fully functioning department, its  transformation remained high risk because it had not yet developed a  comprehensive plan to address the transformation, integration,  management, and mission challenges we identified in 2003.

DHS also defined  the USM responsibilities for integration in department management  directives following the creation of the department. For example, a DHS  management directive assigns the USM responsibility and accountability  for designing departmentwide integrated systems to improve mission  support. Within the Management Directorate, the management chiefs\u2019  roles and responsibilities for the integration of the department are  established in DHS management directives. For example, DHS  management directives give the departmental management chiefs  responsibility to ensure the integration of their management function and  to review their programs in order to recommend program improvements  and corrective actions where appropriate.

For example, the TSA Administrator and DHS\u2019s  CPO are both responsible to the DHS Secretary, through their respective  chains, for procurement performance at TSA.

These documents described by DHS officials as contributing to the  department\u2019s strategy for achieving management integration can provide  high-level guidance for integration efforts and can help the department to  manage those efforts. For example, two of the functional area strategic  plans set goals, objectives, and milestones for implementing certain  initiatives within functional areas. Moreover, the Management Directorate  Strategic Plan and other departmentwide documents, for example, set  performance goals, measures, and targets for achieving certain  management initiatives.

They can also help to  guide efforts to consolidate policies, processes, and systems within each  management functional area. However, among the documents cited by  DHS officials as being part of the department\u2019s management integration  strategy, DHS has not yet looked across the management initiatives within  management functional areas to identify the critical links that must occur  among these initiatives to integrate the department\u2019s management  functions both within and across functional areas. Furthermore, the  documents generally do not identify the priorities, trade-offs, and potential  efficiencies among management initiatives, nor do they set  implementation goals and a time line for monitoring the progress of  initiatives to ensure the critical links occur when needed.

Each management chief  chairs a functional council to address issues pertaining to that  management function. For example, the DHS CFO leads a council that  includes component or agency CFOs across DHS and addresses and  coordinates departmentwide financial management issues, such as  financial management internal controls. Likewise, the USM chairs a  Management Council made up of the DHS management chiefs and a  representative from each component that discusses issues of  departmentwide importance, such as training and development programs.

The HCLC discussed the issue and raised  points, such as the relationship with the SES performance cycle and the  impact of potential continuing resolutions. Ultimately, the HCLC agreed  the subcommittee should pursue the issue. Similarly, when we observed a  Management Council meeting in April 2009, the council members shared  information on issues that affect multiple management functions, such as  the Transformation and Systems Consolidation (TASC) initiative to  consolidate and integrate its financial management, acquisition, and asset  management systems. The council meetings also provide a forum for the  component chiefs to provide input into departmentwide plans, such as the  functional area strategic plans. For example, component officials from the  information technology and human capital management functions  collaborated with their corresponding DHS management chief on the  development of their functions\u2019 strategic plans at council meetings or  council-sponsored off-site meetings.", "The councils also provide a forum for component management chiefs to  raise concerns and suggestions about departmentwide management  initiatives. For example, when we observed the CIO Council meeting in  April 2009, a component official expressed concern about the component\u2019s  outdated financial management system, which they have not replaced  because they are waiting for the departmentwide TASC solution. The  official said that the component is repeatedly receiving negative results on  their financial systems audit while they wait. The DHS CIO responded that  if the TASC initiative experiences further delays, she will work with the  DHS CFO\u2019s office to jointly determine a solution to allow the components  to make progress and identify areas of possible audit mitigation while  waiting for TASC to be implemented. Finally, we found that the six  functional councils provide the component management chiefs with an  opportunity to collaborate with their peers in other components and share  best practices. The FEMA Assistant Administrator for Management  explained that FEMA is in a better position today because of its  management chiefs\u2019 participation in the councils. He said the management  chiefs have been able to better handle issues because they are able to  learn best practices from their counterparts in other components who are  dealing with the same issues and would not have the same access to the  other components without the functional councils."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DHS\u2019s Management Directorate Has Taken Actions to Consolidate Management Policies, Processes, and Systems", "paragraphs": ["While DHS does not have a comprehensive management strategy, its  Management Directorate is working to consolidate management policies,  processes with associated governance boards, and systems. The  Management Directorate has developed and implemented departmentwide  policies to replace policies from each of the legacy agencies that make up  DHS in all six management functions. For example, the DHS CAO\u2019s office  completed a comprehensive review of directives that govern  departmentwide activities. According to the DHS Internal Control  Bluebook for fiscal year 2008, results of this review reduced the number of  directives by over 56 percent. The DHS CAO\u2019s office also implemented a  new initiative to develop uniform policies and programs for radiation  safety across the department. The DHS CFO\u2019s office launched an online  Financial Management Policy Manual tool, which serves as the single  authoritative guide on financial management and the foundation for  departmentwide financial management knowledge sharing and  standardization. According to officials from the DHS CFO\u2019s office, the  Financial Management Policy Manual is part of its approach to integrate  within the financial management function and is critical to enable financial  management employees to carry out their duties and responsibilities  effectively and efficiently.", "The Management Directorate has also taken steps toward consolidating  some management processes and established governance boards to  manage the processes in the areas of acquisition, information technology,  financial management, and resource allocation, as shown in table 4.", "As we previously reported, the Management Directorate recognized  historical shortcomings in its acquisition review process and released an  interim acquisition management directive in November 2008. The interim  directive established a revised acquisition review process, including roles  and responsibilities of DHS approving authorities, threshold levels for  acquisitions, and acquisition decision events and the corresponding  documentation required. Specifically, it established the Acquisition Review  Board (ARB) as the department\u2019s highest review body and charged it with  reviewing and approving all programs at key milestone decision points  that are above $300 million in life cycle costs. In September 2009, we  testified that DHS has also reinstated regular ARB meetings and  acquisition decision memorandums. Specifically, as of September 15,  2009, DHS\u2019s ARB reports that it completed 14 acquisition reviews in 2008,  and has thus far completed 18 reviews in 2009, including reviews of major  acquisitions, such as SBInet, US-VISIT, and Secure Flight. DHS also  reports that 7 additional reviews are scheduled to occur by the end of the  fiscal year. We previously reported that while recent actions establishing  the ARB and an acquisition process represent progress, the department\u2019s  previous acquisition review process was not able to effectively carry out  its oversight responsibilities and keep pace with investments since 2004.  It is too soon to tell whether DHS\u2019s latest efforts will be sustained to  ensure investments are consistently reviewed as needed. The DHS IG has  also reported that DHS faces challenges in implementing corrective  actions for acquisition oversight.", "In addition, DHS established an Enterprise Architecture Board (EAB) to  guide and approve new information technology investments. Enterprise  architecture provides systematic structural descriptions of how a given  organization operates today and how it plans to operate in the future, and  it includes a plan to transition from the current state to the future state.  The EAB reviews and approves information technology investments to  ensure they align with DHS\u2019s enterprise architecture and transition plan.  Based on these reviews, the EAB makes recommendations to the ARB,  mentioned above, which the ARB includes in its review of information  technology acquisitions. In September 2009, we testified that since 2003,  DHS has issued annual updates to its enterprise architecture that have  improved prior versions by adding previously missing content. However,  DHS has yet to adequately address how it determines and ensures that an  investment is aligned with its enterprise architecture. Specifically, while  the Management Directorate has recently chartered its EAB and assigned  it responsibility for ensuring that each investment is architecturally  aligned throughout its life cycle, it has yet to define a methodology,  including explicit criteria, for making a risk-based alignment  determination.", "The Management Directorate established a mission action plan process  and Senior Management Council (SMC) for Internal Controls to assist the  department in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring the  progress of efforts to remediate material weaknesses. A mission action  plan presents an overall plan for correcting a control deficiency that  includes milestones with specific dates and remediation actions and is  published annually in the department\u2019s Internal Control Playbook. In  November 2008, the Management Directorate created its first Internal  Control Bluebook, which provides the status of the department\u2019s efforts to  design and implement departmentwide internal controls. The SMC  oversees the mission action plan process and determines when sufficient  action has been taken to correct material weakness. The Management  Directorate has faced challenges in implementing the mission action plan  process at the components. For example, the DHS IG reported that while  FEMA prepared mission action plans for the fiscal year 2009 Internal  Control Playbook that address known deficiencies, its financial reporting  mission action plan did not adequately emphasize the primary root cause  of control weaknesses. Similarly, the DHS IG reported that the TSA\u2019s  financial reporting mission action plan in the fiscal year 2009 Internal  Control Playbook lacked specific milestones related to some root causes  and lacked clear linkage from the root cause to actions and milestones to  address the deficiencies.", "The Management Directorate also participates in the Program Review  Board (PRB), which governs the department\u2019s programming efforts as part  of the broader Planning, Programming, Budget, and Execution process.  This process is the department\u2019s effort to ensure goals and priorities are  translated into actionable requirements, programmed and budgeted for  appropriately, and realized through execution. Specifically, the USM is a  member of the PRB. The PRB considers major multi year programmatic  issues across the department and recommends resource allocation  decisions to the deputy secretary based on priorities. These decisions  provide department approved 5-year resource profiles by component, and  provide the foundation for the next DHS budget sent to the Office of  Management and Budget. The DHS Program Analysis and Evaluation  Director told us that the USM has been instrumental in helping  components prioritize activities. The PRB gives the USM a forum for  providing input into the resource decisions from a management  perspective. However, without a management integration strategy for the  department with clear priorities, it is unclear how the management  initiatives related to integration that are considered are being prioritized,  and whether resources are being used in the most efficient and effective  manner.", "Additionally, the Management Directorate has taken steps in an effort to  consolidate the department\u2019s systems. For example, the TASC initiative is  the department\u2019s current effort to consolidate its financial management,  acquisition, and asset management systems. DHS has been working to  consolidate its financial management systems since the department was  first created. A prior effort focused on financial management systems  integration began in January 2004, known as the Electronically Managing  Enterprise Resources for Government Effectiveness and Efficiency  (eMerge) project. This project was expected to integrate financial  management systems departmentwide and address existing financial  management weaknesses. However, DHS officially ended the eMergeprocess for a contractor to implement TASC, but DHS expects to award  the contract in early 2010. While DHS officials told us they believe  communications between the department\u2019s CFO and the component CFOs  for TASC seem to be working well, in October 2009, we testified that the  department has not yet completely defined its financial management  strategy and plan to move forward with financial management integration  efforts.", "The Management Directorate also has an initiative under way to  consolidate its information technology data centers, which are facilities  that contain electronic equipment used for data processing, data storage,  and communications networking. The Data Center consolidation initiative  is an effort to move from DHS\u2019s 17 legacy data centers to two large-scale  enterprise data centers. According to DHS\u2019s fiscal year 2010 Budget in  Brief report, DHS expects the reduced number of data centers to help  streamline the department\u2019s maintenance and support contracts as well as  enhance security and improve information sharing with stakeholders.  While the Management Directorate intends to complete the relocation of  legacy data centers to the new data centers by fiscal year 2011, it is facing  challenges in the implementation of the Data Center consolidation. For  example, the DHS IG reported that the department has not established  necessary connectivity between the two data centers so they are able to  provide backup capabilities for each other because necessary  telecommunications equipment and circuits are not in place to transmit  data between the two centers."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Performance Management Practices Could Be More Consistently Applied Departmentwide to Strengthen Reporting Relationships between Department and Component Management Chiefs", "paragraphs": ["During a transformation, strategic goals must be clear and enable  stakeholders and employees to understand what they need to do  differently to help the organization achieve success.

Specifically, we have  reported that several practices are critical to ensuring that the  performance management system supports change. To be successful,  transformation efforts must align individual performance expectations  with organizational goals. These practices support efforts to create a \u201cline  of sight\u201d showing how unit and individual performance can contribute to  overall organizational results, and in the case of transforming DHS and  integrating the department, can enable the USM and department  management chiefs to align activities of subordinate management officials  in support of the management integration strategy. A line of sight that  connects management integration goals should show how the USM,  department management chiefs, and management chiefs of DHS  components all contribute to and support DHS management integration  goals.

The 9/11 Commission Act requires that the USM enter  into an annual performance agreement with the Secretary, including  measurable individual and organizational goals, and be subject to an  annual performance evaluation by the Secretary, with a determination of  progress made toward achieving those goals and measures. Similarly, we  have reported that top leadership should drive the transformation, and  have previously stated that the organization\u2019s CMO should have a clearly  defined, realistic performance agreement. To support departmentwide  goals, the USM\u2019s performance plan should reflect the DHS Strategic Plan  and Management Directorate Strategic Plan, and when developed, the  management integration strategy. In reviewing performance management  linkages at the USM\u2019s level, we found that the Deputy Secretary provided  input into the USM\u2019s performance plan in October 2007, and conducted a  performance evaluation in 2008 based on this agreement. According to  DHS officials, the Deputy Secretary conducted the performance agreement  and evaluation\u2014rather than the Secretary\u2014based on delegated  responsibilities for the performance of management reform as the  department\u2019s chief operating officer.", "Performance objectives in the USM\u2019s agreement and evaluation show  linkages to strategic plans, and include references to several efforts  related to management integration.

One objective refers  generally to improving management programs and initiatives for DHS\u2019s  headquarters. The efforts to implement a new acquisition review system  and management controls and centralize management of SES positions  involves increasing integration of management functions. The Integrated  Strategy for High Risk Management referenced in the performance plan  was mentioned by DHS as providing guidance for management integration  efforts.

For example, performance agreements for the six department  management chiefs consistently include a reference to the Management  Directorate\u2019s Strategic Plan. We also learned from DHS officials that fiscal  year 2009 was the first year that the USM provided a common objective to  department management chiefs. Specifically, the fiscal year 2009  management chiefs\u2019 performance plans included a joint performance  objective related to management support for the expansion of NPPD. In  addition, the agreements consistently include objectives related to  management integration.

We also reviewed these objectives and goals provided to the components.", "The other four management chiefs said that they did not provide individual  input, and instead pointed to collective goals or objectives developed  through planning processes and contained in strategic or operational  plans. While these collective processes and overall plans provide general  guidance for the management function, they do not meet the standard  established by the management directives of annual, individualized  performance input.", "The USM told us that the functional councils have improved in their  development of common management goals for their functions, but she  agreed that they have not yet consistently followed through by putting  those goals into individual performance plans.

The CPO stated that he  would be providing input beginning with the fiscal year 2010 performance  appraisals. The CHCO said that, due to his limited tenure in the position,  he could not state whether input had occurred. In addition to individual  input, department chiefs have the opportunity to review the component  chiefs\u2019 performance ratings and bonuses and / or pay adjustments at the  conclusion of the department Performance Review Boards prior to their  approval by the deputy secretary.

While  linkages are being most clearly defined at the department chief level  within their individual management functions, department chiefs are not  consistently providing the guidance and input required by department  management directives and in accordance with performance management  leading practices. The inconsistent application of such guidance and  practices presents challenges to institutionalizing individual accountability  and enabling the effective exercise of authority at the department.

Current plans are a step in the right direction, but in the  absence of a comprehensive strategy for management integration as  required by the 9/11 Commission Act and meeting all of the previously  identified characteristics for such a strategy, it is unclear how  management integration will be more fully achieved across the  department. We therefore reiterate our prior recommendation, not yet  fully implemented, that DHS develop a comprehensive management  integration strategy. We continue to believe that a comprehensive strategy  for management integration is warranted, and would help the department  to ensure that its management initiatives are implemented in a coherent  way. It would also help DHS to communicate its approach for management  integration and measures for evaluating progress made. Moreover, while  DHS has been implementing management initiatives and processes across  the department, in the absence of a comprehensive management  integration strategy, it is unclear how these efforts are being prioritized  and sequenced, and trade-offs between them are being recognized. In  addition, a comprehensive strategy for management integration would  help the department establish performance measures to better gauge its  progress in integrating its various management policies, processes, and  systems across DHS.
