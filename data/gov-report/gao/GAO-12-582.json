Consumer products can be subject to mandatory or voluntary standards, or both. Questions have been raised about the level of compliance with voluntary standards and CPSC\u0092s ability to encourage compliance. The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012 directed GAO to analyze manufacturers\u0092 compliance with voluntary industry standards. This report evaluates (1) what is known about the extent to which manufacturers comply with voluntary standards for consumer products, (2) CPSC\u0092s authority and ability to require compliance with voluntary standards, and (3) the consequences for manufacturers that fail to comply with voluntary standards.", "To do this, GAO reviewed CPSC\u0092s statutory and regulatory authorities to encourage compliance with voluntary standards; reviewed agency documents and literature on consumer product safety; analyzed data on CPSC corrective actions; and met with representatives from national consumer, industry, legal, and standard-setting organizations who have expertise in developing consumer product safety standards."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) enforces compliance with mandatory federal safety standards, it is also required by law to rely on voluntary safety standards when it determines that the standard adequately addresses the product hazard and is likely to have substantial compliance. Voluntary standards\u0097developed by industry, consumer, and government participants through a consensus process\u0097cover many of the thousands of types of products in CPSC\u0092s jurisdiction. Compliance with voluntary standards is not routinely tracked, but it is generally considered to be high by industry participants. Compliance with these standards also depends on industry and legal factors, such as retailer requirements to demonstrate proof of compliance with voluntary safety standards and risk of liability in product liability lawsuits.", "Because voluntary standards do not have the force of law, CPSC cannot compel compliance with them. However, noncompliance with a voluntary standard can inform a determination of a substantial product hazard by the CPSC that in turn can lead to CPSC enforcement actions. CPSC has exercised its expanded authority to place a product on the substantial product hazards list. Specifically, it designated drawstrings from children\u0092s upper outerwear and hair dryers without a ground fault circuit interrupter as hazardous products, and Customs has seized violative items at ports. CPSC also participates in standard development activities with industry and consumer representatives and monitors select voluntary standards. CPSC attends standard development meetings, supplies hazard and injury data and analysis, and provides input on draft standards. However, CPSC\u0092s regulation prohibits staff from voting on the final standards or from participating in any meeting that excludes other groups, such as media or consumers. CPSC\u0092s rationale for limiting involvement in standards development activity is to maintain its independence\u0097such as not appearing to endorse a specific standard. Office of Management and Budget guidance gives agencies discretion to determine their level of participation in standard setting activities, including full involvement in discussions, serving in leadership positions, and voting on standards. A January 2012 White House memorandum states that the federal government may need to be actively engaged in standards development and implementation, including playing an active role in standard setting and assuming leadership positions in Standard Development Organization committees. Committee participants GAO spoke to value CPSC\u0092s input but generally agreed that CPSC should participate earlier and take a more active role in standards development. These actions could enhance CPSC\u0092s oversight, and may strengthen voluntary standards.", "Manufacturers that fail to comply with voluntary standards can face consequences when CPSC has determined that noncompliance poses a significant risk of injury or death to consumers. CPSC can take corrective action against the manufacturer, including recalls, or take longer term action to ban the hazardous product. CPSC has focused much of its surveillance and compliance work on imported products. For fiscal years 2008 through 2011, 80 percent of CPSC recalls have been of imported products that may be subject to voluntary standards, highlighting challenges CPSC faces in helping to ensure the safety of consumer products."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the adequacy of voluntary standards, CPSC should review the policy for participating in voluntary standards development activities and determine the feasibility of assuming a more active, engaged role in developing voluntary standards.

We also reviewed CPSC\u2019s standard operating procedures, performance  and accountability reports, budget documents, and our relevant prior  reports. We met with cognizant CPSC officials to discuss their authorities  and their ability to enforce them, including all of CPSC\u2019s current  commissioners and the Chairman. Additionally, we obtained and  analyzed data from CPSC\u2019s compliance databases to identify (1) the  number of reported instances of noncompliance; (2) the number of times  these instances led to a corrective action; (3) the numbers of corrective  actions that resulted; (4) the number of product units recalled; and (5) the  type of standard, if any, that covered the product. We assessed the  reliability of these data by reviewing existing information about the data  and the system that produced them, and interviewing agency officials  knowledgeable about the data and related management controls. Based  on this assessment, we determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for  the purposes of this report. We interviewed the three standards  development organizations that coordinate the development of more than  90 percent of voluntary standards developed with CPSC staff technical  support. We obtained testimonial and documentary information from  national consumer, industry, and legal organizations that have expertise  in working on voluntary standards development for consumer products.

According to CPSC, this jurisdiction covers  thousands of manufacturers and types of consumer products. CPSC does  not have jurisdiction over some categories of products, including  automobiles and other on-road vehicles, tires, boats, alcohol, tobacco,  firearms, food, drugs, cosmetics, medical devices, and pesticides. Other  federal agencies\u2014the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,  U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Justice, Department of Agriculture,  Food and Drug Administration, and Environmental Protection Agency\u2014 have jurisdiction over these products.", "CPSC has jurisdiction over thousands of types of consumer products and  hazardous substances, many of which are subject to mandatory  regulations or voluntary standards, or both. Mandatory standards are  federal rules set by statute or regulation that define the requirements  consumer products must meet. These standards establish performance  and labeling criteria that products must meet before they are  manufactured, imported, distributed, or sold in the United States. CPSC  may set a mandatory standard when it determines that a voluntary  standard would not eliminate or adequately reduce a risk of injury or finds  that substantial compliance with a voluntary standard would be unlikely.  The Commission also may impose a mandatory ban of a hazardous  product when it determines that no feasible consumer product safety  standard adequately would protect the public from an unreasonable risk  of injury. In some cases, Congress has enacted a specific statutory  requirement for CPSC to create a mandatory standard, or convert a  voluntary standard to a mandatory standard. For instance, CPSIA  mandated the conversion of voluntary standards for durable infant and  toddler products, all-terrain vehicles, and children\u2019s toys to mandatory  standards. Mandatory standards and bans are enforceable by CPSC,  allowing the agency to stop imported products that do not meet federal  requirements at ports and seek civil or criminal penalties for violations of  the mandatory standards or bans. Approximately 200 products are  currently regulated and subject to mandatory standards, including  automated garage door openers, fireworks, and children\u2019s cribs.", "Many consumer products under CPSC\u2019s jurisdiction, including smoke  alarms, candles, and portable generators, are subject to voluntary  standards. More than 700 standards development organizations (SDO) develop most voluntary standards used in the United States, including  safety standards. SDOs include private-sector professional and technical  organizations, trade associations, and research and testing entities.  According to CPSC, three SDOs\u2014Underwriters Laboratories, Inc. (UL);  ASTM International; and the American National Standards Institute  (ANSI)\u2014coordinate the development of more than 90 percent of  voluntary standards developed with CPSC staff technical support.  Participants in the standards development process include  representatives from government agencies, manufacturers, consumers,  retailers, testing laboratories, technical experts, and other interested  parties. In general, most SDOs operate by principles that govern the  voluntary standards process, such as openness, balance, consideration  of views and objections, consensus vote, and the right to appeal. The  process of developing consensus standards is designed to be  transparent, with written procedures covering each step. Participation in  the standard development process is intended to be voluntary. Standards  developed by an SDO are considered the property of the SDO. CPSC  officials told us that once a standard is published and copyrighted,  members of the public and government agencies generally must  purchase them.", "The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the federal  agency that coordinates standard activities, maintains a database of  standards that have been incorporated by reference into federal  regulations. NIST also has online search tools that members of the public  may use to locate other standards\u2014including voluntary standards not  incorporated by reference into federal regulations\u2014but according to  agency officials, the agency does not collect or maintain voluntary  standards.", "CPSC\u2019s voluntary standards activities are overseen by a Voluntary  Standards Coordinator, appointed by the Commission\u2019s Executive  Director. The coordinator is the senior agency official responsible for  managing the Commission\u2019s voluntary standards program. One of the  coordinator\u2019s main duties is to prepare and submit to the Commission a  semiannual summary of staff\u2019s voluntary standards activities. Duties also  include providing advice and recommendations for the development of  new voluntary standards or the revision of existing voluntary standards, in  conjunction with CPSC management. The coordinator also proposes  policies and guidelines concerning voluntary standards activities, reviews  associated public comments, and prepares recommended policies for  approval by the Commission. The coordinator works with SDOs, and  recommends and trains CPSC staff to serve as technical experts to those  organizations. Further, the coordinator is the liaison to industry  associations, other government agencies, and any other group interested  in voluntary standards.", "CPSC\u2019s Office of Compliance and Field Operations, currently with 166  staff, has primary responsibility for helping ensure compliance with  product safety standards. Its activities include enforcing mandatory  standards and reporting requirements, investigating product hazards, and  determining corrective actions (such as recalls) for manufacturers not in  compliance with safety standards. CPSC also has an Office of Import  Surveillance and Inspection that coordinates enforcement efforts with  U.S. Customs and Border Protection to help ensure import compliance  with safety standards. CPSC has investigators stationed at some ports of  entry to assist in surveillance activities. In a past report, we made  recommendations to strengthen CPSC\u2019s ability to target unsafe consumer  products, especially imported products. We recommended that CPSC  work to educate foreign manufacturers about U.S. product safety  standards and best practices, including the importance of complying with  voluntary standards. CPSC concurred with our recommendation. The  2011-2016 Strategic Plan states that CPSC has been seeking to create  and strengthen partnerships with domestic and international stakeholders,  including foreign regulators and manufacturers, to improve product safety  throughout the supply chain.

According to CPSC, the time  required for mandatory rulemaking varies depending on the complexity of  the product or of the rule requirements, the severity of the hazard, and  other agency priorities, among other factors. For example, a legal expert  told us that a mandatory rulemaking for cigarette lighters took 10 years  from the decision to take action to final rule. CPSC also has been  considering a mandatory rule to address the risk of fire associated with  ignitions of upholstered furniture since 1972. Generally, the flexible  process for developing voluntary standards is considered to facilitate  revisions to the standards. Working through SDOs, interested parties  have been able to revise existing standards to respond in a timely manner  to emerging hazards or risks. According to two legal experts, a  disadvantage of mandatory standards is that revision or repeal can be  difficult. One expert also told us that because mandatory standards set  fixed requirements for product safety, the rules can stifle product  development and innovation.", "Industry participants told us that advantages of the voluntary standards  process include open participation and proceedings by consensus, which  can help ensure compliance with the resulting standards.

The office coordinates with, and provides education and  outreach activities to, various domestic and international stakeholders,  including manufacturers, retailers, resellers, small businesses, and  foreign governments. Among its responsibilities, the office works with  foreign governments and regulatory bodies to help them increase their  capacity to develop voluntary and mandatory product safety standards  and plans to develop information and guidance tailored specifically to  small batch manufacturers. Staff from this office plan to update the CPSC  web page to assist small businesses in learning about their obligations  under CPSIA, by informing them about voluntary standards, and  encouraging them to comply.

The Lighter Association, a group representing cigarette  lighter manufacturers, petitioned CPSC in 2001 to adopt the prevailing  voluntary standard for lighters as a mandatory standard. The association  cited widespread noncompliance with the voluntary standard, especially  for lighters imported from China. Although CPSC has not as yet  promulgated a general rule for mechanical requirements for cigarette  lighter safety, it had adopted a regulation requiring child-resistant  mechanisms for disposable lighters in 1994.

CPSC must  determine that the characteristics are readily observable and that the  hazard has been addressed by voluntary standards. CPSC must also  determine that voluntary standards have been effective in reducing the  risk of injury from the products and there is substantial compliance with  the voluntary standards. When CPSC publishes a rule making such  determinations, the products involved are subject to all of the  enforcement consequences that apply to a substantial product hazard.  Among other actions, the product must be refused admission into the  United States. CPSC works cooperatively with Customs and Border  Protection staff at ports of entry to detect and seize defective products.

Another product safety expert also said that the expanded  authority will not substantially enhance CPSC\u2019s enforcement capability  because inspectors must have the ability to readily observe the hazard at  the port of entry. Some hazards are not readily observable and require  testing for compliance, such as lead content.

Consumer groups and other consumer  product safety experts told us that CPSIA has strengthened CPSC\u2019s  authority, effectiveness, and level of influence at SDOs. They also told us  that the industry now knows that if they do not develop an adequate  voluntary standard, CPSC will make a mandatory standard for those  products specified by CPSIA. According to consumer representatives who  have participated in the process, the dynamic has changed: prior to  CPSIA, CPSC\u2019s input was ignored or voted down. With their new  authority, CPSC is more active and their input is incorporated a great deal  more, resulting in stronger and more protective outcomes, especially for  durable goods for infants. Consumer group representatives also told us  that CPSC\u2019s involvement in standards development has been effective for  helping ensure consumer participation, especially since the passage of  CPSIA. In one instance, a consumer group had concerns about the  standards development process for window blind cords because of what it  thought was a lack of transparency, limited access to information, and  lack of consideration of its views, after they were excluded from  participating in a technical subcommittee. CPSC appealed directly to  industry groups to open the process, and consumer groups eventually  were allowed to participate in the window blinds standard development.", "CPSC officials told us that staff\u2019s effectiveness in standards development  partially depends on their own persuasiveness and the direction given  from top management. Management recommends and approves staff to  participate in standards development activity based on their ability to  listen, negotiation skills, analytical proficiency, and level of technical and  scientific expertise. Staff also receive training from the Voluntary  Standards Coordinator to prepare for SDO meetings. According to CPSC  officials, staff selected to participate in standards development activities  may seek further advice and training from the Voluntary Standards  Coordinator and other colleagues as needed.", "While consumer product safety experts we spoke to said that CPSC has  good working relationships with the SDOs, some added that the agency  could take a more active role in standards development activities.  Voluntary standard committee participants told us that they value CPSC\u2019s  contributions during standards development, one group especially valued  its incident data and analysis, and another appreciated the agency\u2019s  ability to help ensure an inclusive process. One industry official told us  that they work collaboratively with CPSC; for example, they receive data  from the CPSC in the process of developing voluntary standards for  particular products. In one case, CPSC had identified, through its incident  data, a laceration hazard resulting from a certain design of high chair with  two hooks on the back. CPSC communicated this information to industry  representatives, and it was incorporated into the voluntary standard  process for the product. Another industry stakeholder told us that CPSC  is viewed as a valuable partner in stronger standard development. By  simply being present at voluntary standards development meetings,  CPSC shows the industry that it is monitoring their activities.", "Other consumer product safety experts said that CPSC\u2019s participation in  committees could be more active and its position on the draft standards  better articulated. Because of limitations stemming from CPSC\u2019s  regulation governing staff participation in standards development activity,  the resulting standard may not fully reflect the CPSC staff input and the  standard development process can be delayed. According to some  consumer product safety experts, CPSC staff are restrained and act  largely as observers at standard development committee meetings.  Others said that, at times, CPSC staff does not challenge the adequacy of  the standards. For example, although CPSC converted the voluntary  standard for all-terrain vehicles to a mandatory standard in 2009, as  required by CPSIA, in the view of some experts, all-terrain vehicles  remain covered by a weak standard. In public statements regarding the  all-terrain vehicle standard, one CPSC commissioner said that the recent  update to the standard, while not diminishing the safety of the product,  remains a low threshold for federal safety standards. Our analysis of  CPSC public recall notices showed that there have been 36 recalls of all- terrain vehicles involving 15 companies for fiscal years 2007 through  2011. Manufacturers have recalled all-terrain vehicles for reasons such  as a risk of a crash caused by pieces of the main suspension breaking off  and a risk of loss of vehicle control due to faulty speed controls. Recall  notices do not indicate if the hazards posed by the product are covered  by voluntary or mandatory standards. In discussions with consumer  product safety experts, they said that if CPSC challenged the adequacy of  the standards more frequently this would send a signal to industry that the  agency was committed to obtaining a high level of safety in voluntary  standards.", "Some industry representatives emphasized that they wanted CPSC\u2019s  more active and earlier participation in standards development. They said  that they would benefit from more information about CPSC\u2019s views on  specific provisions of a standard, such as certain performance  requirements, level of risk tolerance, or aspects of a product CPSC  wanted changed. Some industry representatives said that if the agency\u2019s  position on a standard were more apparent from the outset, the process  would be faster and more efficient, which could result in stronger  standards. One industry representative also noted that more active and  earlier participation would allow CPSC to consider unforeseen business  consequences of their proposed revisions to standards earlier in the  process. For instance, according to this industry representative a revised  standard for child bed rails was delayed by CPSC proposing costly  revisions after the standard had already been approved by SDO  participants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CPSC Can Impose Corrective Actions When Noncompliance with Voluntary Standards Presents a Substantial Product Hazard", "paragraphs": ["Manufacturers can face consequences ranging from civil monetary  penalties to the reputational and financial losses associated with  corrective action if their products fail to comply with voluntary standards  and if they present a substantial product hazard. Corrective actions  include recalls, which encompass refunds, replacements, or repairs.  CPSC may also sue to prevent distribution or sale of a product pending  completion of a recall proceeding. Although voluntary standards do not  have the force of law, manufacturers are legally required to report  substantial product hazards to CPSC. Every manufacturer of a  consumer product must inform the Commission if they obtain information  that reasonably supports the conclusion that the product contains a defect  that could create a substantial product hazard. Such a report may  include information the manufacturer obtained about a product outside  the United States if it is relevant to products sold or distributed in the   Manufacturers that knowingly fail to report potential  United States.substantial product hazards could be subject to civil or criminal penalties.  In 2011, CPSC negotiated out-of-court settlements in which five  companies agreed to pay $3.26 million in civil penalties related to their  failure to report substantial product hazards to the agency.", "Although failure to meet a voluntary standard alone is not sufficient for  CPSC to take action against a company\u2014because voluntary standards  are not enforceable by law\u2014CPSC\u2019s analysis of the evidence of  noncompliance and determination that the product could pose a  substantial product hazard can lead to corrective action. According to  CPSC\u2019s interpretive regulations, compliance or noncompliance with  applicable voluntary standards may be a factor in determining whether a  substantial product hazard exists. To determine if corrective action is needed, CPSC staff review incident reports on a daily basis and forward  them to appropriate integrated teams for extensive analysis. CPSC  integrated teams comprise subject matter experts such as engineers,  human factors experts, health scientists, statisticians from the Office of  Hazard Identification and Reduction, and compliance officers from the  Office of Compliance. The teams then assess the reports for hazard type,  whether the incident affected vulnerable populations, and the severity of  injury. CPSC also collects data on injuries and deaths for products under  its jurisdiction, and staff conduct investigations on specific injury cases to  gain better knowledge of how the product was involved. Based on  analysis of these data, the integrated teams decide if further action would  be warranted, such as additional monitoring of the situation, an in-depth  investigation, or a product safety assessment. In our discussions with  CPSC officials, they told us that the agency decides on further actions  based on other agency priorities, resources, and the level of risk that a  product poses. Once CPSC has identified a hazardous product, the  agency will take action to remove the product from the market. If a recall  is necessary, CPSC staff negotiates with the responsible company to  seek a voluntary recall, if appropriate.", "Manufacturers that report product defects propose a remedy that must be  deemed acceptable to CPSC staff. This often involves the product\u2019s  recall, which consists of the purchase price refund, repair, or replacement  of the product. CPSC considers whether the plan adequately addresses  the risk of injury presented by the product. For example, if the  manufacturer\u2019s proposed solution was to repair its product, CPSC  engineers would test the repair to determine if it addressed the hazard  adequately. Similarly, if the proposed solution was a refund, CPSC  officials would evaluate the refund process to determine if it would cause  undue burden to the consumer. CPSC takes steps to ensure that recalled  products are not reintroduced in the market through second-hand stores  by monitoring the internet and through market surveillance programs.  Table 2 contains information about CPSC\u2019s recall activities for fiscal years  2007 through 2011 for products covered by mandatory standards and  those that are unregulated.", "In our review of CPSC documents, the agency focused much of its  surveillance and compliance work on imported products. According to  CPSC, approximately 80 percent of recalls from 2008 through 2011 have  been of imported products. The agency\u2019s Office of Import Surveillance  and Inspection has primary responsibility for product surveillance at ports  of entry in cooperation with other appropriate federal agencies. U.S.  Customs and Border Protection notifies CPSC and other regulatory  agencies with import safety responsibilities of the arrival of imported  products and provides information about those products. CPSC identifies  potentially unsafe products and requests that U.S. Customs and Border  Protection set them aside for CPSC examination. Once samples are  delivered to or taken by CPSC for examination, CPSC may detain the  shipment pending further examination and testing, conditionally release  the shipment to the importer\u2019s premises pending examination and testing,  or release the shipment to the importer outright. Compliance investigators  examine the sample to determine whether it (1) complies with the relevant  mandatory standard or standards; (2) is accompanied by a certification of  compliance with relevant product safety standard that is supported by  testing, in some cases by a third party, (3) is or has been determined to  be an imminently hazardous product; (4) has a product defect that  presents a substantial product hazard; or (5) is produced by a  manufacturer who failed to comply with CPSC inspection and   According to a CPSC notice, from October  recordkeeping requirements.1, 2011, to December 1, 2011, officials identified about 240 noncompliant  products at ports of entry, including defective hair dryers, lamps, and  holiday lights.", "Table 3 illustrates standards activities and recall actions for selected  products for fiscal years 2007 through 2011. Some products are covered  by both mandatory and voluntary standards, which may address different  aspects of the product features. For example, all-terrain vehicles, cribs,  infant bath seats, infant walkers, and cigarette lighters are subject to both  mandatory and voluntary standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CPSC Databases Do Not Identify Products with Voluntary Standards, but the Agency Collects Data That Could Help Identify Patterns of Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["CPSC has no tracking mechanism specific to voluntary standards in its  compliance database, but the agency can identify patterns of  noncompliance and address safety hazards. CPSC tracks reports of  noncompliance with mandatory standards and identifies potential product  hazards. CPSC has two internal databases for tracking noncompliance  one for regulated products (products subject to mandatory standards) and  the other for products that could pose a substantial product hazard (either  unregulated products or products subject to voluntary standards). In  discussions with CPSC officials, they told us that there is no field in the  databases to indicate whether a product is covered by one of the  thousands of existing voluntary standards. However, they noted that they  have internal policies for tracking compliance with voluntary standards.  According to agency officials, CPSC\u2019s policy states that when staff has  determined that noncompliance with voluntary standards amounting to a  substantial product hazard has occurred, staff should create a file with a  case number to track this issue. The case number is an internal tracking  number that does not correspond to the unique identifier assigned by  SDOs and cannot be linked to a voluntary standard.  However, agency  officials said that if CPSC finds that the product poses a substantial  product hazard and staff determine that the voluntary standard is  inadequate or that no standard exists, they refer the case to the voluntary  standards coordinator to address through standard setting activities.", "CPSC\u2019s compliance databases for both the regulated products and  substantial hazard (section 15) products are case management systems.  According to CPSC officials, more than 50,000 distinct firm names are in  the databases. CPSC can classify incidents by manufacturer, retailer,  distributer, and country of origin. In some cases a foreign company may  have a U.S. agent or representative, making it difficult for CPSC\u2019s  database to discern whether the reporting company is foreign or  domestic. In addition, CPSC assigns more than 800 different product and  product category codes to help track case files. CPSC\u2019s case files track  information about the firm, the product, the type of noncompliance, and  other relevant information. The agency also tracks correspondence with  the manufacturer, distributor, retailers, and public about the case, as well  as the corrective action implemented to address the noncompliance.", "Agency officials said that the databases have the capacity to track 26  hazards in 8 hazard categories, including fire hazards for fabrics,  materials, and electric appliances; mechanical hazards in children\u2019s,  household, and sports and recreation products (involving choking,  strangulation, and other injury hazards); electrocution; and chemical  hazards. Staff use data from the compliance databases to identify types  of product defects such as those associated with design, construction,  and packaging of a product, or absence of warning labels or instructions.  They also track the number of defective products in the market and  assess the severity of risk of defects and likelihood of injury.", "In addition to tracking trends from compliance data, agency staff,  including the Hazard Analysis Division, perform a range of statistical  analyses across reported incident data to identify patterns of  noncompliance. CPSC staff said they analyze compliance in terms of the  product rather than the manufacturer. Incident data comes from various  sources, including retailers; manufacturers; public safety professionals;  health care professionals; death certificates; news reports; state and local  governments; and incident reports submitted by consumers through  CPSC\u2019s website, SaferProducts.gov. CPSC staff identify potential  emerging patterns, produce estimates of injuries and quantify the  frequency of fatalities based on emergency room data, test for injury  trends over time, and characterize hazard patterns. Analysts evaluate  these data on a daily basis and report increased frequency of reports for  a given product or manufacturer to appropriate teams in the agency.  Officials said that on a weekly basis, analysts apply algorithms across  reports to characterize the frequency by product code. They generate  statistics comparing the number of reports received in the week for  particular products to the number received for the same product over a  20-week period. CPSC officials then use the data to determine which  incidents should be investigated and report on their findings to internal  teams. For example CPSC has identified instances of appliance tipovers  and issued press releases with information to consumers to raise  awareness of tipover hazards. To address this, the agency plans to  participate in standard revision activity to address kitchen range tipovers.", "In a previous report we addressed CPSC work resulting from  identification of certain hazard patterns. We reported that during the  1980s, the data CPSC collected on injuries and fatalities related to all- terrain vehicles, especially among children, led it to file a lawsuit alleging  that the vehicles were an imminently hazardous product. CPSC and  manufacturers eventually settled the lawsuit through a consent decree in  which manufacturers and distributors agreed to implement certain safety  measures and stop selling certain vehicles considered dangerous for  young children. In its fiscal year 2012 Operating Plan and Performance  Budget, CPSC also noted that it plans to update safety publications  addressing children\u2019s hazards, fire and electrical hazards, mechanical  hazards, sports and recreational hazards, and chemical and combustion  hazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Voluntary standards establish safety guidelines for many of the thousands  of consumer products in CPSC\u2019s jurisdiction. CPSC is required by law to  rely on these standards, developed through consensus by industry,  consumer, and government participants, when the standards are  adequate to address the risk of harm and substantial compliance with  them is likely. Because of the substantial prevalence of voluntary  standards for consumer products, CPSC\u2019s early and active participation in  standards development activity is critical to establishing adequacy of the  standard. If CPSC finds that a manufacturer does not comply with a  voluntary standard and it creates a substantial product hazard, the  agency can seek a corrective action, such as a recall; however, CPSC  does not have the authority to compel compliance with voluntary  standards as such. For fiscal years 2008 through 2011, 80 percent of  recalls have been of imported products that may be subject to voluntary  standards, highlighting challenges CPSC faces in helping to ensure the  safety of consumer products. CPSC has taken steps to ensure  compliance by (1) performing industry surveillance through analysis of  incident and other data, (2) participating in standards development  activities, and (3) monitoring selected voluntary standards. Although  CPSC regularly participates in standard development activity to the extent  possible, consumer product safety experts we spoke to generally agreed  that earlier and more active CPSC participation could increase its  efficiency and effectiveness in developing standards. Our review also  found that CPSC regulations concerning meetings policies and allowable  conduct for CPSC staff participating in standards development activity are  generally more restrictive than the existing general government policy on  such participation. While OMB guidance gives agencies discretion to  determine their level of participation in standard setting activities, CPSC  has chosen to limit participation to maintain impartiality and avoid  appearance of endorsing a specific voluntary standard. Further, a recent  White House memorandum on national standards policy states that  where statute, regulation, or administration policy identifies a national  priority, the federal government may need to be actively engaged or play  a convening role to accelerate standards development and  implementation. Changing regulations to enable staff to more actively  participate, especially when working with technical committees for which  CPSC has expertise and permitting CPSC staff to vote on the standard,  could result in stronger voluntary standards without compromising  CPSC\u2019s independence. Without more active participation from CPSC,  standards emerging from standards development organizations risk being  less stringent and may be inadequate to protect the public from hazards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To strengthen the adequacy of voluntary standards, we recommend that   the Chairman of CPSC direct agency staff to review the policy for  participating in voluntary standards development activities and determine  the feasibility of assuming a more active, engaged role in developing  voluntary standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to CPSC for comment.
