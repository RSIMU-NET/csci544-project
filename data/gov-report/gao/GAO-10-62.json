The Veterans' Benefits Improvement Act of 2008 directed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the DIC program and the levels of payments it provides. This report addresses (1) the extent to which DIC replaces VA disability compensation or active duty military pay lost due to the death of a veteran or servicemember, and (2) how DIC benefits compare to benefits for survivors of civilian federal employees.

Because DIC provides generally flat payments, the rate at which it replaced lost income varied according to the amount of prior income, such as VA disability compensation. The most common survivor was an older female spouse of a totally disabled veteran who, in 2009, received $1,154 per month--the base DIC payment--compared with $2,823 per month paid in VA disability compensation to the disabled veteran prior to death. In these cases, DIC replaced 41 percent of prior compensation. There were, however, DIC recipients at the far ends of the scale. For example, for surviving spouses of mid-ranked officers who died on active duty, the flat rate DIC payment represented 19 percent of prior military pay; for survivors of partially disabled veterans who had received relatively low VA disability compensation, the flat rate DIC payment sometimes represented more than 100 percent of prior compensation. When comparing survivor benefits for DIC with those for comparably paid civilian federal employees, DIC benefits are generally higher than survivor benefits paid by federal retirement programs, but lower than those paid by federal workers' compensation. The DIC program's flat payment structure differs from federal programs in which payment amounts are based on employee salaries and years of employment. We found that for most survivors, DIC provides higher benefits than the federal retirement programs because it gives more money to survivors of lower paid individuals, who comprise the majority of DIC recipients. In contrast, DIC payments are almost always less than workers' compensation payments for survivors of federal employees who die as a result of job-related injuries. For comparable employees, the salary levels of nearly all servicemembers in 2009 would result in higher survivor payments under workers' compensation than under the DIC program."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) provides monthly Dependency  and Indemnity Compensation (DIC) payments to the survivors of veterans  who died as a result of a service-connected disability and servicemembers  who died while on active military duty.

This prior income can include VA disability  compensation and military pay, which cease upon the death of the veteran  or servicemember. Because DIC benefits are generally paid at the same  flat rate, the replacement rate depends upon the amount of prior income.  While survivors of 6 out of 10 veterans and servicemembers received 35  percent to 55 percent of prior compensation, there are examples of DIC  recipients at both ends of the replacement scale (see fig. 3).", "On the low end of the replacement scale, for about 1 of 10 survivors DIC  replaced less than 35 percent of the veteran\u2019s prior disability  compensation or the servicemembers\u2019 military pay.

For example, a severely disabled veteran  could receive as much as $7,800 per month in disability and special  compensation prior to death, but the surviving spouse would receive  $1,400 per month in DIC, or 18 percent of the prior amount (see fig. 4).  Another group which sees a large drop is survivors of higher ranked  servicemembers, such as officers. DIC\u2019s flat rate replaces less of their  military pay than it does for servicemembers in lower pay grades. A Navy  lieutenant, for example, earned about $6,000 per month in 2009. If the  lieutenant died on active duty, the surviving spouse would receive the  basic DIC benefit\u2014$1,154\u2014which replaces about 19 percent of the  lieutenant\u2019s pay.", "On the high end of the replacement scale, about 3 out of 10 survivors  received DIC payments that replaced more than 55 percent of previous  disability compensation or military pay, with many receiving 100 percent  or more of the prior compensation. Many were survivors of veterans who  received relatively low VA compensation prior to their death because they  were considered partially disabled. For example, a veteran with a spouse  and a 30 percent rated disability received $421 per month in VA disability  compensation in 2009. Upon the veteran\u2019s death, the surviving spouse  received the DIC basic payment of $1,154 per month, which represented  well over 200 percent of the prior compensation (see fig. 4). Some  survivors of active duty servicemembers also fell into this group.  Generally, these were servicemembers in lower pay grades whose  survivors received additional DIC benefits to support children or parents.", "While DIC serves to replace some of the financial support lost due to a  service-connected death, the law does not define a specific percentage of  income that DIC should replace. In contrast, laws governing some other  types of survivor benefits establish set replacement rate percentages. For  example, a provision in federal law stipulates that most employment-based  pensions must provide surviving spouses with 50 percent of the deceased\u2019s  pension payment, unless both the employee and spouse opt out.  However, DIC is not a pension program, and there is no consensus among  experts on an adequate or ideal replacement ratio for survivors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DIC Benefits Are Generally Higher Than Survivor Benefits Paid by Federal Retirement Programs, but Are Usually Lower Than Federal Workers\u2019 Compensation Survivor Benefits", "paragraphs": ["The amount paid by DIC to survivors of disabled veterans and  servicemembers is generally higher than the amount paid by CSRS and  FERS retirement programs to survivors of comparably paid federal  employees. Such comparisons are difficult, however, because DIC  provides a flat rate payment while CSRS and FERS survivor payments are  determined by the salary and years of employment of the deceased  employee. As a result, there is a range of payment amounts for survivors of  federal employees. The monthly payment to a survivor of a federal  employee with more years on the job and a higher salary will be larger  than that to a survivor of a federal employee with fewer years or a lower  salary. When we looked at veterans/servicemembers and federal  employees with comparable pay and experience, we found that for most  survivors, DIC provides higher benefits than the federal retirement  programs because it gives more money to survivors of lower-paid  individuals. About 82 percent of veterans or servicemembers whose  survivors receive DIC were lower ranked during their time of service.  Personnel in these lower ranks made less than $63,000 a year in 2009, and  their survivors would have fared better under the DIC program than they  would have under the federal retirement survivor programs.", "The following examples illustrate how DIC generally provides higher  payments to the survivors of those who die after a period of disability than  CSRS for a majority of its recipients. Under DIC, the surviving spouse of  an Army sergeant who was disabled for a prolonged period before dying  in 2009 would be eligible for a monthly payment of $1,400. In contrast,  the surviving spouse of a federal employee, also disabled before his or her  death and with the same years of experience and salary as the Army  sergeant, would be eligible for a monthly CSRS payment of $606. The  surviving spouses of a private first class, a sergeant first class, and a  captain would also receive higher payments under DIC than would the  surviving spouses of federal employees with comparable pay and  experience under CSRS. Although they represent a small portion of DIC  recipients, survivors of higher-paid servicemembers would likely receive  less compensation than their federal employee counterparts. In 2009, for  example, the survivor of an Army lieutenant colonel who was totally  disabled for a prolonged period would receive the same DIC payment of  $1,400 per month, but the survivor of a comparable federal employee  would receive over $1,700 per month. (See fig. 5.)   (See fig. 5.)", "The following examples illustrate how DIC generally provides higher  payments than FERS for a majority of its recipients. For instance, the  spouse of an Army sergeant who died in 2009 after a period of disability  would receive the flat DIC payment of $1,154 a month. The spouse of a  federal employee with equal pay and years of employment who died in  2009 would receive $732 a month under FERS. Similarly, the surviving  spouses of a private first class and a sergeant first class would receive  higher payments under DIC than the surviving spouses of comparable  federal employees would under FERS. This trend generally holds true for  both employees who die while employed by the government and those  who die after a period of disability: DIC survivor benefits are higher than  FERS for the majority of individuals. Although they represent a small  portion of DIC recipients, survivors of higher-paid servicemembers may  receive lower payments than their federal employee counterparts. While  the spouse of a higher-paid Army captain would still receive the basic DIC  payment of $1,154 per month after the captain\u2019s death in 2009, the spouse  of a federal employee with equal amounts of pay and years of employment  would receive nearly $1,300 under FERS. (See fig. 6.)", "In contrast to CSRS and FERS, DIC survivor payments are generally lower  than payments to survivors of comparably paid federal employees under  the federal workers\u2019 compensation program known as FECA. FECA  provides survivor benefits to the families of federal employees who die as  a result of injuries sustained on the job. FECA survivor payments are  generally higher than those under CSRS or FERS and, like DIC, are not  subject to federal income tax. A surviving spouse receives the equivalent  of half the federal employee\u2019s salary at the time of death. This payment  would be larger than the basic DIC payment if the employee had an ending  salary of at least $27,697 in 2009. Almost all servicemembers earn more  than this salary in military pay, so their survivors would receive less under  DIC than their civilian federal counterparts would receive under FECA.  For example, under DIC, the surviving spouse of an Army sergeant who  died while on active duty would receive DIC\u2019s basic payment of $1,154 per  month. The surviving spouse of a comparably paid federal employee  would receive $1,722 under FECA for a death due to a work-related injury.

We chose these programs because they cover  the majority of federal employees and, like the DIC program, provide  ongoing survivor benefits in the event of the employee\u2019s death.  Additionally, these programs provide disability benefits to federal  employees who suffer an injury or illness, mirroring, to an extent, VA  compensation for veterans with disabilities related to their military  service.", "It is difficult to compare DIC benefits to survivor benefits under these  programs because DIC generally provides flat payments to survivors  regardless of their past incomes, while these federal programs base benefit  amounts on prior income levels.

Therefore, to compare benefits, we constructed several scenarios to  examine the DIC benefits available to various veterans and  servicemembers, and those available to federal employees with pay and  experience equivalent to those veterans and servicemembers.
