Concerns have been raised that improper payments from practices indicating fraud and abuse may have contributed to Medicare home health spending and utilization. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency that administers Medicare, is responsible for minimizing improper payments made on behalf of Medicare beneficiaries. GAO was asked to examine the growth in Medicare home health spending and utilization and the benefit's vulnerability to improper payments. GAO focused on states with the highest growth in Medicare home health spending or utilization; fraudulent and abusive practices contributing to recent spending and utilization; and administrative issues that make it vulnerable to improper payments. GAO analyzed Medicare claims data; reviewed Medicare laws and regulations and CMS documents; and interviewed stakeholders and contractors that administer and protect the home health benefit."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["California, Florida, Nevada, Oklahoma, Texas, and Utah were identified as experiencing the highest growth in Medicare home health spending or utilization from 2002 through 2006. These states ranked among the three highest in one or more of four spending and utilization indicators. Florida and Texas were among the top three on three or more indicators. Texas, Florida, and Nevada--the states with the highest percentage growth in Medicare home health spending from 2002 through 2006--had more than double the national spending growth rate of 44 percent during this period. Upcoding--overstating the severity of a beneficiary's condition--by home health agencies (HHA) and other fraudulent and abusive practices contributed to Medicare home health spending and utilization. For example, a CMS contractor found that only 9 percent of claims were properly coded for 670 Houston beneficiaries who had the most severe clinical rating and who were served by potentially fraudulent HHAs. Court cases and Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General actions illustrated that kickbacks and billing for services not rendered also contributed to Medicare spending and utilization. Stakeholders identified these practices as common types of home health fraud and abuse. Inadequate administration of the Medicare home health benefit leaves the benefit vulnerable to improper payments. Although CMS policy charges its contractors, known as Regional Home Health Intermediaries (RHHI), with the responsibility of screening applications from prospective Medicare HHAs, CMS does not require RHHIs to verify the criminal history of persons named on the application. CMS does not generally include physicians, who are in a position to detect certain types of improper billing, in the agency's efforts to detect improper payments. For instance, CMS does not provide physicians responsible for authorizing home health care with information that would enable them to determine whether an HHA was billing for unauthorized care. Current CMS regulations provide for the removal of HHAs or HHA officials from Medicare for one type of abusive billing--billing for services that could not have been rendered. However, the agency has yet to address the removal of HHAs or HHA officials engaging in other types of abusive or improper billing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2006, Medicare spent $12.9 billion for the 2.8 million beneficiaries  receiving home health care\u2014in-home services provided to beneficiaries  who need care following discharge from a hospital or who have chronic  conditions that require continuing but intermittent care. Spending on the  Medicare home health benefit grew about 44 percent from 2002 through  2006, despite an increase of just less than 17 percent in the number of  beneficiaries using the benefit during that 5-year period. In addition, the  number of home health agencies (HHA) that billed Medicare increased  from 6,507 in 2002 to 8,412 in 2006, with more than half of the increase  occurring in just two states\u2014Florida and Texas.

Data  analyses that we, CMS, and one PSC conducted showed that upcoding and  billing for unnecessary care contributed to spending and utilization.  Stakeholders also told us that common types of upcoding and billing for  unnecessary care in home health were billing for outlier cases when this  level of care was not required, billing for beneficiaries who were not  homebound, and billing for therapy visits that may have been medically  unnecessary. Other fraudulent and abusive practices, including  kickbacks, payments from HHAs to beneficiaries for use of their Medicare  identification numbers, and billing for services not rendered, also  contributed to Medicare home health spending and utilization.

For example, in Miami-Dade County, a pattern of an unusually high  number of outlier cases in 2007 indicated fraudulent upcoding of Medicare  home health claims. According to one PSC\u2019s analysis, in 2007, 57.5 percent  of home health cases in Miami-Dade County were outlier cases, compared  with 0.4 percent in Chicago, 8.6 percent in Dallas, 2.2 percent in Houston,  and 2.2 percent in Atlanta. The PSC\u2019s analysis showed that Miami-Dade  HHAs received more than $550 million in outlier payments in 2007\u2014an  amount more than four times greater than the combined total paid to  HHAs in Chicago, Dallas, Houston, and Atlanta, even though there were  more people over age 65 in each of the other four metropolitan areas.", "The PSC also reported in its written analysis to CMS that many Miami- Dade County HHAs provided daily skilled nursing visits to administer  insulin injections for diabetic beneficiaries, which resulted in higher  costs per beneficiary and outlier payments, although beneficiaries may not  have required this level of care. In a November 2007 report to CMS, this  PSC stated that Miami-Dade County beneficiaries and their caregivers had  been coached in how to respond to investigators verifying whether the  skilled nursing services for insulin injections were necessary. For  example, according to the PSC representatives, some beneficiaries said  that they were unable to administer their own injection due to poor vision,  yet they were able to read the investigators\u2019 business cards.", "Our study of 2006 Medicare home health data from U.S. counties with 100  or more home health episodes confirmed the PSC\u2019s analysis by indicating  that, compared with the rest of the country, a large percentage of home  health cases in Miami-Dade County involved diabetic beneficiaries. Nearly  50 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries in Miami-Dade County who  received home health services in 2006 had a diagnosis of diabetes. The  average for all counties included in the analysis, about 16 percent, was  significantly lower. Total Medicare payments for diabetes episodes in  Miami-Dade County exceeded $221 million in 2006. This figure was almost  double the diabetes-related payments in Los Angeles County, which had  nearly twice as many Medicare beneficiaries using home health services as  Miami. The average diabetes payment among all counties with at least one  beneficiary who had a diabetes home health episode was less than   $1 million.", "In addition to fraudulent and abusive practices involving outlier payments,  stakeholders reported that before CMS amended its payment methodology  in 2008, some HHAs billed for 10 or more therapy visits in order to qualify  for additional Medicare payments, even though these visits may not have  been medically necessary. CMS concluded that the 10-therapy-visit  threshold, established during the implementation of the PPS in 2000,  distorted service delivery patterns by creating financial incentives for  HHAs to bill for 10 therapy visits. CMS analysis showed that, prior to  implementation of the PPS, the highest concentration of therapy visits per  episode ranged from 5 to 7 visits. After implementation of the PPS, the  highest concentration of therapy visits grew to 10 to 13 visits per episode.", "Some stakeholders reported another type of fraud and abuse in which  HHAs submitted claims for beneficiaries who were not homebound or  who required fewer services than were provided. For example, several  Houston HHAs had an unusually high percentage of patients with the most  severe clinical rating. One PSC interviewed 670 Houston beneficiaries  who had the most severe clinical rating and who were patients of HHAs  identified by the PSC as having aberrant billing patterns. The PSC found   91 percent of claims for these beneficiaries to be in error. Nearly   50 percent of the beneficiaries were not homebound and therefore were  not eligible to receive any Medicare home health services. The  investigators also found that while 39 percent of the beneficiaries they  interviewed were eligible for the benefit, their clinical severity had been  exaggerated. The PSC concluded that only 9 percent of claims for the 670  beneficiaries were properly coded. In addition, the PSC found that other  home health beneficiaries it interviewed were not homebound; for  instance, some were mowing their lawns when investigators came to  interview them.", "In addition, court cases and OIG actions illustrate how other fraudulent  and abusive practices such as kickbacks, payments by HHAs to  beneficiaries for use of their Medicare identification numbers, and billing  for services not rendered contributed to Medicare home health spending  and utilization. For example, in October 2004, a registered nurse who  owned the two largest HHAs in California pled guilty to defrauding  Medicare of $40 million by billing for services not rendered or medically  unnecessary; falsifying medical records to support fraudulent claims; and  paying kickbacks. In addition, a Pennsylvania HHA agreed to pay  $300,000 and enter into a settlement agreement with the OIG to resolve its  liability in May 2005 for alleged kickbacks. The HHA allegedly paid  Pennsylvania and Florida physicians kickbacks in the form of loans,  consulting fees, and rental space payments to induce them to refer  beneficiaries requiring home health services or durable medical  equipment, or both, paid for by Medicare. (See table 1 for examples of  court cases and OIG actions.)", "Stakeholders, including industry representatives, also identified  kickbacks, payments by HHAs to beneficiaries for use of their Medicare  identification numbers, and billing for services not rendered as common  types of home health fraud and abuse. For example, a CMS official and  representatives from an RHHI, PSCs, and HHA associations told us that  some HHAs offered physicians kickbacks. For instance, representatives  from home health associations said that physician kickbacks were so  common in some parts of Florida that many physicians expected payment  for referrals and inquired how much the HHAs paid for referrals.  Stakeholders also told us that, based on their experience, some HHAs  hired physicians to serve as medical directors to disguise payments for  referrals by those physicians and that some HHAs had as many as 20 or 30  medical directors.", "In addition, stakeholders told us that some HHAs offered kickbacks to  nurses, hospital discharge planners, and assisted living facility managers  for beneficiary referrals. For example, a CMS official and a PSC  representative told us that when some nurses were hired by a new HHA  employer, the nurses moved their patients from their former HHA  employer to the new one and received bonuses according to the number of  beneficiaries they brought with them. The PSC representative said that  beneficiaries were often very loyal to their nurses and often did not realize  they were being shifted among HHAs. In another practice reported by a  Florida home health association representative, HHAs allegedly paid  managers at senior housing projects and assisted living facilities above- market rent in exchange for beneficiary referrals.", "According to stakeholders, HHAs that billed Medicare for services that  were not rendered may have paid beneficiaries for use of their Medicare  identification numbers. Stakeholders said that HHAs offered beneficiaries  payments in the form of cash or other goods, such as cigarettes or alcohol.  In addition, a CMS official told us that some Miami beneficiaries reported  that HHA nurses had given them insulin injections that investigators  suspected they did not actually receive. This official also reported that  Miami HHAs have submitted claims for visits that were probably not  provided, such as claims for visits that allegedly occurred when hurricanes  were in the area.", "Stakeholders told us that kickbacks, payments to beneficiaries for illegal  use of their Medicare identification numbers, and billing for services not  rendered were difficult to prove. For example, one PSC representative  noted that in the past, the PSC could have relied on either beneficiaries or  physicians to testify about the HHA activity and thereby to act as a  safeguard against fraud and abuse, but with all parties involved in the  practices, this type of cooperation is less likely. An official from the OIG\u2019s  Miami Office of Investigations echoed these concerns, stating that some  South Florida beneficiaries purportedly received more income in illegal  HHA payments than from their monthly disability checks and therefore  were less likely to be truthful about HHA fraudulent and abusive practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Screening, Monitoring, Investigation, and Enforcement Procedures Leave Home Health Benefit Vulnerable to Improper Payments", "paragraphs": ["Inadequate administration of the Medicare home health benefit leaves the  benefit vulnerable to improper payments.

This requires coordination between the RHHI and the PSC so that the PSC  can assess the beneficiaries, in person, within days of submission of the  RAP to the RHHI.

Prior to August 26, 2008, the regulations  provided for CMS to revoke a provider\u2019s billing privileges, but only for  reasons other than improper billing, such as conviction for certain felonies  or submission of false or misleading information on the enrollment  application. Effective August 26, 2008, CMS may also revoke a provider\u2019s  billing privileges for one narrowly defined type of abusive billing\u2014 submission of claims for services that could not have been furnished on  the date claimed. This would include claims for services provided to  deceased beneficiaries and claims for services when the physician or  beneficiary was not in the state or not in the country when services were  furnished. Discussing the new provision, CMS stated that the expanded  regulation was not intended to be used for isolated occurrences or  accidental billing errors, but was directed at those \u201cproviders and  suppliers who are engaging in a pattern of improper billing\u201d and further  explained that it would revoke billing privileges only when there were at  least three instances of abusive billing. CMS also stated that it might  propose other provisions related to revocation of provider and supplier  billing privileges in the future.", "While the OIG may remove providers from the Medicare program for  fraudulent billing, the OIG has rarely used its authority to exclude in the  absence of conviction for fraud. If an HHA or individual is convicted of a  crime related to the delivery of an item or service under Medicare, federal  law requires the OIG to exclude them from participating in any federal  health care program. The OIG also has the discretionary authority to  exclude HHAs and individuals based on the OIG\u2019s determination that the  HHA paid kickbacks, submitted claims for services that were not provided  as claimed or were unnecessary, or submitted false or fraudulent claims.  HHAs that furnish services in excess of the needs of patients or who make  false representations of material facts in support of a claim may also be  excluded under the OIG\u2019s discretionary authority. The OIG has rarely used  its discretion to exclude on the basis of fraudulent billing in the absence of  a conviction for fraud. In calendar year 2007, less than half of 1 percent of  all individual exclusions were for submitting false claims, submitting  claims for services that were not medically necessary, or making false  representations of material facts on a claim or documentation used to  support a claim. Rather than exclude on the basis of an OIG  determination or refer these cases for prosecution, the OIG may impose a  CMP or seek a settlement.

In Houston, the PSC targeted those HHAs that billed more than   50 percent of their claims at the most severe clinical level, because the  PSC\u2019s experience showed that such billing patterns were indicative of  substantial upcoding. To identify potentially fraudulent claims, the PSC  monitored the submission of RAPs for the targeted HHAs. Once enough  beneficiaries were identified, the PSC sent teams of investigators,  including nurses, to Houston for on-site interviews with beneficiaries to  assess their health condition, including whether they were indeed  homebound, and then compared these results with the information  submitted by the HHA. Once an HHA reached a threshold percentage of  submitting upcoded claims or claims for beneficiaries who were not  homebound, the PSC worked with CMS to cancel the HHA\u2019s RAP  privileges, meaning that the agency would only be paid at the end of the  episode following the submission of a valid claim. According to the PSC  officials, the cancellation of RAP privileges was particularly effective in  Houston because these HHAs relied on the RAP payments to cover their  expenses. Medicare payments for claims at the most severe clinical level  for 24 targeted HHAs decreased from nearly $1.9 million in January 2007 to  $34,461 in September 2007.", "In Miami, the PSC identified a different practice that could not be  addressed through the cancellation of RAP privileges; instead, the PSC  worked with physicians to identify overpayments. This practice involved  the submission of high numbers of outlier claims for beneficiaries with  diabetes. The PSC told us that canceling RAP privileges would not have  been appropriate in Miami because outlier payments are determined at the  end of the episode; therefore, the HHAs in Miami were getting only a small  amount of the total episode payment from the up-front payment that is  based on the RAP submission. Also, the sheer volume of claims that nurses  would have had to review in Miami was prohibitive. Instead of focusing on  the suppression of RAP privileges, the PSC addressed the outlier problems  in Miami through collaboration with referring physicians. The PSC sent  letters to physicians that had referred beneficiaries whose care resulted in  high HHA reimbursements from outlier claims with the names of the  Medicare beneficiaries they had referred and the amount of payment the  HHAs had received based on those referrals. According to the PSC  officials, some of the referring physicians became concerned about the  amount of money the HHAs had received and collaborated with the PSC.  Some of the physicians indicated, for instance, that their signature had  been forged or that they did not realize the amount of care they were  authorizing. As a result of interviews with 31 of the physicians who  responded to the letters, nearly 950 plans of care were disavowed by the  physicians, resulting in overpayment assessments against HHAs in excess  of $9 million as of March 2008.", "Despite the different strategies needed in Houston and Miami to address  the fraud and abuse concerns, the PSC found that city site visits, which  included beneficiary interviews, were necessary in both locations.  According to a PSC official, beneficiary interviews are needed so that they  have a basis on which to deny a claim. The official noted that medical  reviews that use only the medical records provided by the HHA are limited  because providers may know how to falsify records so that they can pass a  review. The PSC conducted 10 weeks of site visits in Houston between  March 2007 and February 2008, using between 6 and 24 staff per city site  visit, attempting 959 beneficiary interviews and completing 670. In Miami,  the PSC completed 118 beneficiary interviews during 6 week-long site  visits between mid-November 2007 and early March 2008 and 31 interviews  with physicians with high referral rates to targeted HHAs.", "In October 2008, CMS announced new initiatives to further address issues  identified in Miami-Dade County. CMS officials from CMS\u2019s Miami field  office are conducting beneficiary interviews with beneficiaries from HHAs  with either a high percentage of outlier episodes or a high dollar amount of  outlier payments. The beneficiaries will be visited at home to determine if  they qualified for the services they received and if they received all the  services for which Medicare was billed. Additionally, CMS is considering  implementing a trigger in Miami-Dade County that will flag an HHA for  increased scrutiny when more than 5 percent of the HHA\u2019s claims are  outliers. Beneficiaries from these HHAs would be targeted for interviews  and the HHA\u2019s claims would also be targeted for pre- or post-payment  medical review.
