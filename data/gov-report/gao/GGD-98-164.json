In spring 1996, the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) issued a press release with the headline: \u201cU.S. Legal Immigration Down 10.4 Percent in 1995.\u201d The headline is based on a 1994-95 reduction in the number of green cards authorized, and the reduction appears to have been caused mainly by a logjam in INS\u2019 processing of green-card applications. Subsequently, INS and most of the experts testifying at a congressional hearing reported that, in general terms, legal immigration was increasing. At that hearing, it also became apparent that some policymakers and reporters had been confused about whether immigration was increasing or decreasing.", "Recent dissatisfaction with immigration statistics comes roughly a decade after a thorough review of immigration statistics (Levine et al., 1985) summed up the situation as a history of neglect and despite some efforts to provide better information. It has been a decade during which levels of legal immigration increased while patterns of immigration shifted further away from the European dominance of the early and mid-20th century to heavier flows of Asian and Latin American immigrants. At the same time, illegal immigration emerged as a major concern, and the INS budget increased dramatically, mainly because of more intensive efforts to curtail illegal immigration. (During the 1990s, INS\u2019 budget quadrupled; it is expected to reach $4 billion in fiscal year 1999\u2014up from less than $1 billion in 1992.)", "In recent years, the public\u2014particularly California voters\u2014entered the debate about the value and cost of immigration.

Notably, the Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) of 1986 requires triennial reports to Congress, which are to describe the number of persons who are legally admitted or paroled into the United States within a specified interval as well as those who illegally enter or overstay temporary visas during that interval. This corresponds to the demographic concept of immigration flow. Note that with respect to illegal immigrants, it is important to distinguish two different types of flow: those who \u201center without inspection\u201d (EWIs) and those who overstay temporary visas. The distinction is important from a policy perspective because, for example, stronger border controls would not address the overstay issue.", "IRCA also requires information on a variety of impacts of immigration, including, for example, the impact on demographics and population size as well as the impact on social services. We note that the impact on population size would logically involve new entries, but not transitions between legal statuses. The impact on social services would occur as a result of both new entries and transitions of legal status\u2014that is, both types of flow\u2014because the foreign-born resident\u2019s specific legal status determines whether or not he or she is eligible for specific benefits. (It is important to note that although information on both types of flow combined is relevant for certain policy purposes, data on combined-flow to a legal status should be treated with caution. This is because it is not always clear to what extent each type of flow is represented; e.g., a change in a combined-flow statistic might reflect a change in the number of new entries or a change in the number of transitions to the status in question\u2014or some combination of the two.)", "With respect to the other relevant demographic concepts\u2014the size of the foreign-born population, net change in size, and emigration\u2014the Immigration Act of 1990 requires information on the alien population of the United States as well as rates of emigration and an analysis of trends.", "Other laws, while not directly requiring statistical information, nevertheless include mandates that imply such a need.

For example, the House Judiciary Report accompanying IRCA indicated that the requirement for the triennial reports is intended to enable Congress to review and study immigration and refugee programs and to consider possible changes to them with the benefit of reliable and detailed data. Congressional committees have requested that we provide statistical estimates, such as projections of legal immigration, to help in decisions regarding numerical limits.

That is, they are not new to the United States; as indicated in tables in the INS Yearbook, they have already been living here for years\u2014typically either illegally or as long-term temporary residents. Various factors can raise or lower the number of green cards authorized for such persons, independently of trends in new entries. Two instances show how this can\u2014and has\u2014happened: \u2022 The late 1980s amnesty (through IRCA) for illegal immigrants who had lived here for more than 5 years created a sudden major upswing in the trend line for new LPRs because a large group of illegal residents became eligible to apply for green-card status. This increase was unrelated to any change in the number of persons entering the United States. \u2022 A recent change in law (1994) allowed illegal immigrants living in the United States who qualified for green cards to transition to LPR status without leaving the United States\u2014thus shifting the processing of thousands of cases from the Department of State to INS. Because INS could not immediately handle the additional workload, there was a logjam, or slowdown, in issuing the cards to persons already living here. The logical effect of a slowdown is a decrease in the number of cards authorized (i.e., a downturn in the trend line), independent of any change in the number of persons newly taking up residence in the United States. Subsequently, as INS\u2019 capacity to handle the new workload improves, a speed-up in processing would increase the number of cards authorized for persons already living here, creating an upswing in the combined-flow trend line.", "INS statistical staff told us that annual trends in the number of new LPRs do not convey a meaningful indication of any demographic concept.

These two figures are not comparable, however, because flow is a very different concept than net change. Briefly, the difference in concepts is as follows: \u2022 The flow of illegal immigrants refers to new illegal EWIs and overstays who resided here for more than a year. (As shown in table 3.1, these two types of flow can be described separately\u2014and a combined number can be provided.) \u2022 Net change in the size of the illegal population is calculated, mathematically, as the difference between (1) the flow of illegal residents and (2) legalizations and other exits (emigration, death) from the entire illegal population, as shown in figure 3.1. \u2022 Net change may be a positive or negative number. When positive, net change measures the extent to which the flow exceeds legalizations, emigration, and deaths\u2014on the part of the entire population of illegals who were already living here. When legalizations, emigration, and deaths outnumber the entries, net change is negative.", "Legal flow cannot be validly compared to net change in the illegal population.

Reporting flow for legals and net change for illegals, without clearly distinguishing between flow and net change, could lead to misinterpretations; that is, it might invite invalid comparisons. If a comparison of legal and illegal immigration is to be made, the same demographic concept should be used for data on legals and illegals; for example, legal flow should be compared to illegal flow.", "This is important because numerically, the difference (illegal flow versus net change in illegals) could be great. Large numbers of illegal immigrants transition to green-card status (over 120,000 of those authorized to receive green cards in fiscal year 1996 admit to having entered the United States as EWIs), and the emigration of illegal immigrants may also be large.
