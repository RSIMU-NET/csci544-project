In 1995, the National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) estimated that the value of stolen vehicles, which are subsequently titled each year, amounted to over $240 million. NICB estimated that the loss associated with total vehicle theft and fraud was in excess of $7.6 billion, annually.", "The Anti-Car Theft Act originally required DOT to develop a national motor vehicle title information system by designating an existing system or establishing a new system. The act was amended by the Anti-Car Theft Improvements Act of 1996, which, among other things, transferred responsibility for development and implementation of NMVTIS from DOT to Justice. In an August 22, 1996, memorandum, the Deputy Attorney General delegated responsibility for implementing the NMVTIS project to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).

After receiving responsibility for NMVTIS in 1996, Justice awarded $1 million in fiscal year 1997 Byrne Discretionary Grant Program funding to AAMVA.

This is because, using NMVTIS, the copy of the motor vehicle title presented for retitling would be electronically validated against the database of the state that originally titled the vehicle. Thus, NMVTIS would help prevent thieves from obtaining good titles to vehicles that they intend to resell. In addition, when the title is reissued in another state, NMVTIS would electronically cancel the motor vehicle title in the originating state.
