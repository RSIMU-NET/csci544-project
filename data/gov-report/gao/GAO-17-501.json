A cap on these payments stabilized them at about $1.4 billion per year from 2011 to 2015. In capping the annual payment to companies, RMA sought to make these payments more stable and dependable for companies and agents, but payments have fluctuated widely by crop, state, and county because, as GAO's analysis shows, the method RMA uses for calculating payments has allowed large fluctuations at the policy level. Specifically, RMA calculates payments based on such factors as crop price, and a price change can cause a change in the payments. For example, the average payment for almonds decreased by 42 percent from 2010 to 2011 but increased by 75 percent from 2013 to 2014. RMA could reduce such fluctuations and achieve greater stability by considering adjustments to how the payments are calculated when it negotiates a new agreement with companies.", "The crop insurance program's target rate of return\u2014the average annual rate of return that insurance companies are expected to earn\u2014does not reflect market conditions. A 2009 USDA-commissioned study found that a 12.8 percent rate of return was reasonable for participating companies for 1989 through 2008 based on economic factors, such as interest rates. RMA used this study in 2010 negotiations with insurance companies to set a 14.5 percent target rate. According to GAO's analysis, which updated information in the study for 2009 through 2015, the reasonable rate of return declined, averaging 9.6 percent.", "GAO identified two opportunities to reduce federal delivery costs for the program.", "First, given that GAO's analysis shows that the target rate of return does not reflect market conditions, that rate could be reduced. As a result, companies would earn a lower rate of return on their existing base of retained premiums. At the 2015 premium level, if the target rate were reduced by 4.9 percentage points, from the current rate of 14.5 percent to 9.6 percent, the companies' expected annual underwriting gains would decrease by $364 million.", "Second, the portion of premiums retained by companies could be reduced so that they would earn a rate of return on a smaller premium base. The portion of premiums retained by companies has changed little, averaging 77 percent since 2000, while USDA has retained the rest. Part of the justification for companies' retaining a significant portion of premiums was that they needed financial incentive to more carefully adjust farmers' loss claims. The need for this incentive decreased after a statutory change in 2000 improved RMA's ability to monitor those claims and companies' adjustment of them. Reducing the premiums that companies retain by 5 percentage points could reduce companies' annual underwriting gains by up to $100 million.", "However, a provision in the Agricultural Act of 2014 requires any changes negotiated for a new SRA be budget neutral. To realize savings, such changes would require congressional action to repeal this provision. If Congress were to direct RMA to adjust the target rate in future negotiations or assess the portion of premiums companies retain, the agency could generate significant cost savings for the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider repealing the Agricultural Act of 2014 provision that any revision to the agreement with insurance companies not reduce their expected underwriting gains and direct RMA to (1) adjust companies' target rate of return to reflect market conditions and (2) assess the portion of premiums that companies retain and adjust it, if warranted.

Under the federal crop insurance program, farmers can insure  against losses caused by poor crop yields resulting from natural causes,  declines in crop prices, or both. To implement the program, the U.S.  Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Risk Management Agency (RMA)  partners with private insurance companies, which sell and service the  insurance policies and share with RMA in the risk of loss and the  opportunity for gain associated with the policies. RMA has overall  responsibility for administering the federal crop insurance program,  including controlling costs and protecting against fraud, waste, and  abuse. RMA administers the program through a financial agreement  called the standard reinsurance agreement (SRA), which it negotiates  with insurers. RMA\u2019s most recent renegotiation of the SRA\u2014the 2011  SRA\u2014was completed in 2010. The previous agreement was the 2005  SRA.", "Under the Federal Crop Insurance Act, the federal government is to  reimburse insurance companies for the reasonable administrative and  operating (A&O) expenses associated with selling and servicing crop  insurance policies. The method for determining the level of this federal  subsidy is set in the SRA. RMA provides A&O payments, which are  based on a percentage of crop insurance premiums, to insurance  companies. These payments are intended to cover the companies\u2019  expenses to sell and service policies. Crop insurance premiums and A&O  expense subsidies rise and fall in value with, among other things, the  price of the crop being insured. A&O expenses can include company  overhead, such as employee salaries; fees paid to insurance adjusters to  verify claims; and sales commissions and other compensation (e.g., profit  sharing) paid to the insurance agents who sell crop insurance to farmers.  In January 2017, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected that  federal crop insurance would cost the federal government an average of  about $7.9 billion per year for 2017 through 2026. These costs include  payments to private insurance companies for program delivery; these  payments make up about one-third of the program\u2019s total annual costs  and comprise a projected annual average of about $1.4 billion for A&O  subsidies and about $1.3 billion for companies\u2019 underwriting gains. As  part of the crop insurance program, the federal government pays for an  average of about 62 percent of the premiums. Farmers pay the remaining  38 percent. These premium subsidies make up the majority of the  program\u2019s overall costs. The SRA does not affect the premiums that  farmers pay.", "In 2009, we reported on the cost of A&O subsidies. From 2006 through  2008, a period of rising major crop prices and crop insurance premiums,  A&O subsidies increased from about $960 million to about $2 billion per  year. To better ensure that the A&O subsidies provided to the crop  insurance industry are sufficient for program delivery, but not excessive,  we recommended that USDA develop a new methodology for calculating  the A&O subsidies so that they are more closely aligned with business  expenses. We also recommended that once this alignment was  completed, the RMA Administrator should minimize annual fluctuations in  A&O subsidies that were unrelated to business expenses, while  recognizing variations in delivery expenses across regions of the country.  RMA agreed with this recommendation. In 2010, partly in response to our  report, USDA completed SRA negotiations and implemented the 2011  SRA to reduce A&O subsidies, capping them for the most common types  of policies. The A&O subsidy for a crop insurance policy remains based  on a fixed percentage (e.g., 18.5 percent) of the premium, which means  that the dollar amount of the A&O subsidy rises and falls with the market  price of the crop being insured because the market price of the crop  affects the dollar amount of the premium. However, if the total A&O  subsidies for policy types that are subject to the cap exceed the capped  amount, the A&O subsidies for these policy types are proportionally  reduced to make the total A&O subsidies for these policies equal to the  capped amount.", "The SRA sets the terms of the program\u2019s risk sharing between  participating insurance companies and the government\u2014in particular, the  portion of total premiums (the sum of the portion paid by farmers and the  premium subsidies provided by the government) that are \u201cretained\u201d by the  insurance companies and the portion of claims payments to farmers that  are the responsibility of the insurance companies. These allocations  determine the companies\u2019 and the government\u2019s share of each year\u2019s  program underwriting gain or loss. An insurance company\u2019s rate of return  on crop insurance for a given year is the company\u2019s underwriting gain (or  loss) divided by the premiums on which the company retains a risk of loss  or an opportunity for gain. A 2009 USDA-commissioned study derived the  annual rate of return that companies participating in the federal crop  insurance program should be expected to earn. This annual rate of  return should produce earnings that are equal to earnings from alternative  investment opportunities relative to the risk assumed\u2014a reasonable or  market-based rate of return. This study found that from 1989 through  2008, participating insurance companies\u2019 actual rate of return on equity  averaged 17.1 percent and that a reasonable rate of return on equity  during this period was an average of 12.8 percent. The current target rate  of return on retained premiums for federal crop insurance providers, as  set by the 2011 SRA, is 14.5 percent.", "The cost of the federal crop insurance program has come under scrutiny  as the nation\u2019s budgetary pressures have increased. In a January 2017  report on the federal government\u2019s fiscal future, we stated that, absent  policy changes, the federal government\u2019s fiscal path is unsustainable and  that to change the long-term fiscal path, policymakers will need to  consider policy changes to the entire range of federal activities and  spending. Any savings found in the crop insurance program could be  used for deficit reduction or other needs such as other farm program  priorities. For example, part of the savings achieved by the 2011 SRA  was used for the Pasture, Rangeland, and Forage crop insurance  program.", "In November 2015, a provision in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015  established a target rate of return on retained premiums of 8.9 percent for  crop insurance providers. CBO projected that the resulting 10-year  savings would be about $3 billion. However, this provision was repealed  in a December 2015 transportation bill.", "In this context, you asked us to review issues related to the program  delivery costs of the federal crop insurance program.

To examine the changes, if any, in the distribution of  A&O expense subsidies due to the implementation of the 2011 SRA\u2019s  national cap, we reviewed and analyzed RMA crop insurance data by  state, county, and crop for 2010 through 2015. We chose this period to  examine changes associated with the implementation of the 2011 SRA  because it contained the most recent data available at the time of our  review.

This study derived, for  the 20 years from 1989 through 2008, the annual rate of return on equity  that companies participating in the federal crop insurance program should  be expected to earn. We identified the major factors that the study used  to estimate the reasonable rate of return and collected data on these  factors from sources of financial information, such as Value Line  Investment Survey. Using the two models that the USDA-commissioned  study used, we then estimated the reasonable rate of return for 2009  through 2015, years that were not included in the study. In addition, for  the 20 years from 1996 through 2015, we summarized RMA data on the  actual rates of return on retained premiums of participating insurance  companies.

Under the Federal Crop Insurance Act,  RMA pays these companies A&O subsidies to cover the reasonable  expenses of selling and servicing crop insurance policies. Prior to the  changes implemented in the 2011 SRA, RMA calculated A&O subsidies  by using a fixed percentage of a policy\u2019s premium. This fixed percentage,  which is called the A&O subsidy rate, varies by the type of insurance  policy. In 2015, these rates ranged from 12 percent to 21.9 percent. The  most common type of insurance policy is revenue protection, which has  had an A&O subsidy rate of 18.5 percent since 2011. The price of the  crop being insured is one of the factors in the premium amount. As a  result, A&O subsidies rise and fall over time with changes in crop prices.  For example, from 2000 to 2009, insurance companies\u2019 A&O subsidies  nearly tripled as a result of increases in crop prices during that time  frame. This increase in the A&O subsidies occurred without a proportional  increase in the workload for selling and servicing policies as expressed by  the number of policies, acres, and the amount of insurance coverage  purchased. To address the increases in A&O subsidies, the 2008 farm bill  directed RMA to consider alternative methods for determining A&O  payment rates as part of the 2011 SRA, stating that changes should take  into account current financial conditions of the program and ensure  continued availability of the crop insurance program to producers on a  nationwide basis.", "Besides crop price changes, changes in premium rates cause changes in  premium amounts and, in turn, A&O subsidies.

Specifically, through a revised subsidy calculation  method, RMA capped annual A&O subsidies for the most commonly used  types of policies and set a minimum annual subsidy for these policy  types. The cap controls government costs when crop prices rise, and  the minimum protects companies against low market prices. Because  A&O subsidies remain linked to crop prices under the revised calculation  method, initial A&O subsidy calculations may exceed the cap during  years when crop prices are high.

Texas\u2019s average subsidy per  policy decreased by 6 percent and 9 percent in 2013 and 2015,  respectively.", "Appendix III shows the annual percentage changes in the average A&O  subsidy per policy for each of the 50 states from 2011 through 2015.", "Figure 7 shows the percentage change in the average A&O subsidy per  policy by county from 2011 through 2015. As shown in the maps, many  counties had substantial fluctuations in their average A&O subsidy per  policy.", "According to a crop insurance industry organization document, a large  decrease in A&O subsidies for a state can disrupt program delivery in that  state. In the 2011 SRA, RMA sought to stabilize A&O subsidies,  according to an RMA document, which states that \u201cbecause the A&O  subsidy will be less vulnerable to extreme commodity price changes,  companies and their agents will enjoy more stable and dependable  subsidies in the future to support the cost of delivering the program,\u201d  making the program more sustainable over time. Furthermore,  according to the RMA document, by providing relatively stable A&O  payments and a cap on agent commissions, the new SRA will allow for a  more sustainable delivery system in the future, protecting producers,  companies, and taxpayers.", "RMA had previously considered other A&O subsidy calculation methods  to reduce fluctuations in A&O subsidies. For example, in the 1990s, RMA  considered a fixed amount per policy plus a percentage of the policy\u2019s  premium. More recently, in its first two drafts of the 2011 SRA, RMA  proposed the use of reference crop prices\u2014rather than market prices\u2014to  calculate A&O subsidies. In general, a reference crop price is a fixed  amount that does not change from year to year. Reference crop prices  have been used in other farm programs to stabilize farmers\u2019 incomes.  Specifically, RMA proposed the use of reference crop prices in calculating  A&O subsidies for seven major commodities\u2014corn, soybeans, wheat,  grain sorghum, cotton, barley, and rice. The proposed reference prices  were based on a 10-year average (1999 through 2008) of each crop\u2019s  market price. However, the crop insurance industry expressed concerns  about RMA\u2019s reference crop price proposal. For example, according to an  RMA document, many companies noted price volatility factors in  comments on the draft SRA. This document said that price volatility  factors have become significant in the determination of premiums for the  increasing number of revenue-based policies and, consequently, the A&O  subsidy for those policies. This document also said that using reference  prices alone to stabilize the A&O subsidy accounts for levels of high  commodity prices, but ignores changes in price volatility. In addition, this  RMA document stated that incorporating reference crop prices for the  seven major commodities could affect areas of the country differently,  depending on the types and mixture of crops in each area. RMA  ultimately removed its reference crop price proposal from the 2011 SRA  and replaced it with the current calculation method to cap overall A&O  subsidies.", "Although the current calculation method has resulted in relatively modest  fluctuations in A&O subsidies for corn, soybeans, and wheat, it has not  done so for other crops or for all states and counties. In some cases,  double-digit decreases were followed by double-digit increases. As  mentioned earlier, RMA\u2019s intention was to stabilize A&O subsidies.  Without stability in A&O subsidies, the sustainability of the program\u2019s  delivery system in states and counties that experience large fluctuations  may be compromised. For example, according to crop insurance industry  organization documents, reductions may adversely affect the services  provided to farmers. In addition, fluctuations may make it more difficult for  insurance agencies to operate and budget effectively. By considering an  adjustment to the A&O expense subsidy calculation method that reduces  the effects of changes in premiums caused by changes in crop prices or  other factors, when it renegotiates the SRA, RMA could reduce year-to- year fluctuations in the A&O expense subsidies that companies receive at  the crop, state, and county levels.", "RMA officials acknowledged to us that large fluctuations have occurred  for some crops, states, and counties. However, the officials said that an  advantage of the current method is its ease of administration and that the  crop insurance industry has become familiar with and understands it.  While changing the calculation method may add complexity, not changing  it will likely result in continued large annual fluctuations for some crops,  states, and counties."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Federal Crop Insurance Program\u2019s Target Rate of Return Does Not Reflect Market Conditions", "paragraphs": ["The federal crop insurance program\u2019s target rate of return\u2014the average  annual rate of return that insurance companies are expected to earn\u2014 does not reflect market conditions.

Interest rates have decreased since 2008, and our  analysis that updated the information in the USDA-commissioned study,  in which we estimated the reasonable rates of return for 2009 through  2015 (years not included in the study), shows that the market-based  (reasonable) rate of return has declined.", "The USDA-commissioned 2009 study was based on the premise that  government intervention should reflect competitive, market-based  outcomes.

This annual rate of return should produce  earnings that are equal to earnings from alternative investment  opportunities relative to the risk assumed\u2014a reasonable or market-based  rate of return. To determine a reasonable rate of return for companies  participating in the federal crop insurance program, the USDA- commissioned study averaged the results obtained from using two  generally accepted methodologies: the capital asset pricing model and  the discounted cash flow model. We conducted our updated analysis  using the two methods that the 2009 study used. Our capital asset pricing  model calculations estimate that the average reasonable rate of return  from 2009 through 2015 was 9.7 percent. Our discounted cash flow  model calculations estimate that the average reasonable rate of return  was 9.6 percent. The average of the two methods was 9.6 percent. We  also note that the reasonable annual rate of return generally trended  downward from 2009 through 2015 and reached a low of 8.8 percent in  2015. Lower interest rates contributed to the decrease in the reasonable  rate.

The average rate of return on retained  premiums for the first 4 years that the 2011 SRA was in effect\u20142011  through 2014\u2014was less than the 14.5 percent target rate, and companies  had underwriting losses in 2012, when a major drought occurred.  However, 4 years is a short time for assessing the rate of return. The  2009 study noted that the federal crop insurance program has significant  catastrophe exposure. According to the study, with most lines of  insurance that have a significant catastrophe exposure, insurers expect to  earn significant profits in non-catastrophe years and significant losses in  years with catastrophes. As a result, average returns over relatively short  sample periods are not necessarily indicative of the long-term pattern of  returns.", "Participating insurance companies\u2019 actual rate of return can vary  significantly from year to year. Table 2 shows the participating insurance  companies\u2019 actual rate of return on retained premiums for each year from  1996 through 2015.

During the 5 years that the 2011 SRA has been in  effect\u20142011 through 2015\u2014the average rate of return on retained  premiums was 9.4 percent. A major reason the rate of return during  these 5 years was less than the target rate was because the rate dropped  to -15.3 percent in 2012. In that year, a major drought caused  underwriting losses. Because the 2011 SRA\u2019s target rate of return is 14.5  percent, additional years of experience would, on average, likely result in  an increase in the average rate of return under the 2011 SRA. For  example, as of March 2017, preliminary RMA information indicates that  the 2016 rate of return on retained premiums will be about 35 percent. If  the 2016 rate of return on retained premiums were 35 percent, then in the  6 years in which the 2011 SRA has been in effect, companies\u2019  underwriting gains during those 6 years would average about 13.7  percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Opportunities Exist for the Federal Government to Reduce the Delivery Costs of the Program", "paragraphs": ["We identified two opportunities for the federal government to reduce its  delivery costs for the crop insurance program: (1) by reducing the target  rate of return or (2) by reducing the portion of premiums that participating  insurance companies retain.

This  provision requires that any revised SRA be budget neutral with respect to  estimates of future underwriting gains for the companies participating in  the crop insurance program.

If Congress directs RMA to adjust  the participating insurance companies\u2019 target rate of return to reflect  market conditions, the underwriting gains that insurance companies can  expect to receive would decrease.

Even if the target rate of return remained unchanged, reducing  companies\u2019 portion of retained premiums would reduce their expected  underwriting gains because they would earn their rate of return on a  smaller premium base. The companies would have a smaller underwriting  stake, retaining a smaller portion of underwriting gains or losses. The  extent of sharing in premiums\u2014and the associated opportunities for gains  and risk of losses\u2014between the federal government and the companies  has long been a subject of debate. For example, according to a report by  a former USDA official, the degree of this sharing has been controversial  since the beginning of the public-private partnership created by the  Federal Crop Insurance Act of 1980. According to this report, part of the  justification for the companies to share in the program\u2019s underwriting  losses was that it would encourage the companies to more carefully  adjust farmers\u2019 loss claims. According to a crop insurance industry  organization document, the structure of the program is such that  companies have dollars at risk on every policy and are thus financially  incentivized to reduce fraudulent loss claims.", "The Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, however, improved RMA\u2019s  ability to monitor farmers\u2019 loss claims and companies\u2019 adjustment of these  loss claims by enhancing the agency\u2019s data mining capabilities. Since  2001, RMA has used its enhanced data mining capabilities to identify  policies with anomalous loss claims as compared to similar policies in a  geographic region. For example, RMA and the companies review these  policies with anomalous loss claims. As a result of its enhanced data  mining capabilities, RMA\u2019s ability to monitor companies\u2019 adjustment of  loss claims has improved. Furthermore, with more recent technological  advances, such as the inclusion of satellite data in data mining methods,  RMA\u2019s data mining ability has continued to improve. According to RMA  documents, the agency\u2019s data mining efforts have improved program  monitoring. RMA estimated its data mining resulted in $1.1 billion in  cumulative cost avoidance\u2014reduction in the amount of indemnities  claimed\u2014from 2001 through 2014.", "Moreover, the 2005 SRA reduced the companies\u2019 share of the premiums  and their potential underwriting gains or losses through a quota share  provision. A quota share is a type of reinsurance contract in which the  insurer\u2014in this case, the insurance companies participating in the crop  insurance program\u2014and the reinsurer\u2014in this case, the federal  government\u2014share premiums, gains, and losses according to a fixed  percentage. The quota share concept was introduced in the 2005 SRA as  a way to transfer underwriting gains from the companies to the  government in order to generate a reduction in program costs, according  to RMA officials. Under quota share provisions in the 2005 SRA and 2011  SRA, each company ceded to USDA a percentage of its premiums and  potential underwriting gains or losses. The 2005 SRA\u2019s quota share was  5 percent, and the 2011 SRA\u2019s quota share was 6.5 percent. For  example, in 2010, the quota share reduced companies\u2019 retained  premiums by $319 million (5 percent) from $6,382 million to $6,063  million and reduced companies\u2019 underwriting gains by $101 million (5  percent) from $2,017 million to $1,916 million. Thus, the quota share  increased the government\u2019s underwriting gains by $101 million and  reduced program delivery costs by that amount.", "Although RMA\u2019s program monitoring has improved since 2000 and even  with the implementation of a quota share, there has been little change in  the level at which companies are allowed to retain premiums and share in  program underwriting gains or losses\u2014which provides companies with  financial incentive to carefully adjust farmers\u2019 loss claims. In 2000,  insurance companies retained $1,895 million (75 percent) of the  program\u2019s $2,538 million in total premiums. In 2004, the insurance  companies retained $3,140 million (75 percent) of the program\u2019s $4,186  million in total premiums. In 2015, 14 years after RMA implemented the  Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000\u2019s data mining activities and 10  years after RMA implemented a quota share, the insurance companies  retained $7,422 million (76 percent) of the program\u2019s $9,744 million in  total premiums. Thus, during the period that RMA was improving its  program monitoring, the portion of premiums that companies retained  stayed about the same, the crop insurance program grew, and the  potential amount of companies\u2019 underwriting gains increased. The last  time RMA had an opportunity to assess and change the level of sharing in  program gains or losses was in 2010 when it completed renegotiating the  SRA.", "Reducing the portion of premiums that companies retain by, for example,  5 percentage points, could save the government tens of millions of dollars  per year by increasing the government\u2019s share of the insurance coverage,  thereby giving the government more opportunity to reduce its cost by  achieving underwriting gains. For example, in 2009, the SRA\u2019s quota  share provision, which reduced the premiums that companies retained by  5 percentage points, resulted in program cost savings of $121 million for  that year. An additional adjustment in the portion of premiums that  companies retain could result in comparable savings.", "As mentioned earlier, we reported in January 2017 that, absent policy  changes, the federal government\u2019s fiscal path is unsustainable.

In addition, the 2014 farm bill requires that if any SRA  savings are realized, they have to be used to increase underwriting gains.

USDA and private insurance companies share in the risk of  loss and the opportunity for gain associated with crop insurance policies.  The 2009 USDA-commissioned study estimates an annual rate of return  that would allow insurance companies participating in the crop insurance  program to have expected earnings that are equal to earnings from  alternative investment opportunities relative to the risk assumed\u2014a  reasonable or market-based rate of return. However, the reasonable rate  of return has declined since the 2011 SRA. This decline indicates that the  current target rate of return for the federal crop insurance program  exceeds the reasonable rate of return. If Congress were to direct RMA to  adjust the participating insurance companies\u2019 target rate of return to  reflect market conditions, the underwriting gains that insurance  companies receive would potentially be reduced, and any such reduction  would not affect the premiums that farmers pay. Such an adjustment  would, however, reduce the expected cost of the crop insurance program  and achieve expected budgetary savings for the federal government,  which could be used for deficit reduction or other purposes, such as other  farm programs or enhancements of crop insurance products available to  farmers. However, any savings that could be achieved through the SRA  by reducing companies\u2019 expected future underwriting gains as a result of  reducing the target rate of return would require congressional action to  repeal a provision in the 2014 farm bill because this provision requires  that any revised SRA is to be budget neutral with respect to estimates of  future underwriting gains for the companies.", "In addition, the portion of program premiums that participating insurance  companies retain\u2014which provides the companies with financial incentive  to accurately adjust farmers\u2019 loss claims\u2014has changed little since 2000.

Given the improvement in RMA\u2019s ability to monitor  the program, an additional assessment and possible adjustment in the  portion of premiums retained by participating insurance companies may  be appropriate. Such an adjustment could generate significant cost  savings for the program. However, because a provision in the 2014 farm  bill requires that any revised SRA is to be budget neutral with respect to  estimates of future underwriting gains for the companies, any savings that  could be achieved through the SRA by reducing companies\u2019 expected  future underwriting gains as a result of reducing the portion of premiums  retained by participating insurance companies are not allowed under  current law and would also require congressional action to repeal this  provision in the 2014 farm bill.", "Moreover, RMA sought to make A&O expense subsidies more stable and  dependable when it negotiated the 2011 SRA, and the current calculation  method has resulted in relatively modest fluctuations in A&O expense  subsidies for corn, soybeans, and wheat, the program\u2019s three leading  crops. However, our analysis shows the SRA\u2019s calculation method also  resulted in substantial subsidy fluctuations for many crops, states, and  counties with double-digit decreases followed by double-digit increases in  some cases.
