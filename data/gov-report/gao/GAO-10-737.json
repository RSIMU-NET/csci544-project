In January 2009, HHS awarded a contract to the National Quality Forum (NQF), under which HHS will reimburse NQF for its costs and pay additional fixed fees. Established in 1999, NQF is a nonprofit member organization that fosters agreement on national standards for measuring and public reporting of health care performance data. This is the first of two reports MIPPA requires GAO to submit on NQF's contract with HHS. In this report, which covers the first contract year--January 14, 2009, to January 13, 2010--GAO describes (1) the status of NQF's work on the five duties under MIPPA; (2) the costs and fixed fees NQF has reported; and (3) what NQF and HHS do in order to help ensure that NQF's reported costs are proper. GAO reviewed relevant MIPPA provisions and reviewed HHS and NQF documents, such as HHS's contract with NQF, monthly progress reports and invoices for the first contract year, and policies and other documents that describe how HHS and NQF review invoices. GAO also interviewed NQF and HHS officials responsible for implementing and overseeing the contract."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["NQF has begun work for each of five duties required by MIPPA related to quality measures: (1) make recommendations on a national strategy and priorities; (2) endorse quality measures, which involves a process for determining which ones should be recognized as national standards; (3) maintain--that is, update or retire--endorsed quality measures; (4) promote electronic health records; and (5) report annually to Congress and the Secretary of HHS. As of January 13, 2010--the end of the first contract year--NQF's work for four MIPPA duties was in progress and it had completed its first annual report for the fifth duty. For example, NQF had begun the duties related to endorsement and maintenance by initiating the endorsement process for three projects HHS selected and by starting maintenance reviews for a set of measures of interest to or used by HHS. While NQF began work for each of the duties in the first contract year, HHS determines on an annual basis the work NQF will be expected to perform under the five duties each contract year. NQF reported costs and fixed fees totaling approximately $6.5 million for the first contract year, including direct and indirect costs as well as fixed fees. Specifically, NQF reported about $3.2 million in direct costs, or 49 percent of the total. These were costs specifically incurred for the NQF contract, such as direct labor for NQF employees. NQF also reported about $2.9 million in indirect costs, which cover additional items such as employee benefits and overhead. Finally, NQF reported about $360,000 in fixed fees for the first contract year. Over $5 million of the reported costs and fixed fees were incurred in the second half of the contract year. NQF and HHS rely on reviews of NQF invoices in order to help ensure that NQF's reported costs are proper. At NQF, officials told us that they review the invoices prior to submitting them to HHS and carry out other activities, such as using an electronic system to track labor hours, in order to help ensure that the costs they report in the invoices are proper. Like NQF, HHS relies on reviews of NQF invoices in order to help ensure NQF's reported costs are proper. These reviews are governed by HHS policies and procedures and by requirements applicable to federal contracts generally. While NQF has begun work under the MIPPA contract, it is too early for GAO to assess whether, or to what extent, NQF will be successful in carrying out the five MIPPA duties. This report describes NQF's work for the first of 4 contract years. In the remaining 3 years of the contract, HHS will determine on an annual basis specific work for NQF to complete under each of the five MIPPA duties. Therefore, it is not yet known exactly what work NQF will be expected to complete during the remainder of the contract period. GAO's second report, which is due in January 2012, will provide another opportunity to review NQF's performance and costs. HHS and NQF reviewed a draft of this report and provided technical comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Health care quality measures are used to evaluate how health care is  delivered, and information obtained from such measures can promote  accountability among health care providers and help consumers make  informed choices about their care.

NQF uses a process recognized  under the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995  that grants quality measures and other standards endorsed by consensus- based entities, such as NQF, standing as national voluntary consensus  standards. NQF uses its process to evaluate available quality measures to  determine which ones are qualified to be endorsed\u2014that is, recognized\u2014 as national standards. NQF-endorsed quality measures have been used by  HHS in its quality measurement programs. In 2008, prior to receiving the  contract award, NQF\u2019s revenue from all sources was approximately $10  million. NQF staff told us that while NQF has previously received funding  from HHS for some of its work related to quality measures, the $10 million  per year authorized by MIPPA for the contract is larger than previous  funding.", "HHS\u2019s 4-year contract with NQF is a cost-plus-fixed-fee contract, under  which HHS will pay NQF for its costs and additional fixed fees for its  services.

We reviewed relevant provisions in  MIPPA, and HHS and NQF documents related to implementing health care  quality measurement duties in MIPPA. Specifically, we reviewed HHS\u2019s  contract with NQF and NQF\u2019s 2009 annual work plan, which established  specific activities for implementing these duties as well as scheduled time  frames for the activities. We also reviewed the monthly progress reports  NQF is required to submit to HHS on its efforts for the first contract year,  and we reviewed NQF\u2019s first annual report to HHS and Congress. We  interviewed NQF officials responsible for implementing the contract and  HHS officials responsible for managing the contract and overseeing NQF\u2019s  performance. For NQF activities in progress at the end of the first contract  year, we gathered information about their planned completion dates as of  January 13, 2010.

These invoices  include the amounts of costs and fixed fees reported by NQF. We also  reviewed NQF\u2019s monthly progress reports to HHS for the first contract  year. We interviewed NQF officials responsible for reviewing and  approving the costs and fixed fees submitted to HHS under the contract.  We also interviewed HHS officials responsible for reviewing NQF\u2019s costs  and fixed fees reported under the contract.

For NQF, we interviewed  officials about their process for reviewing NQF invoices submitted to HHS  and about the other policies and procedures that NQF has in order to help  ensure that the costs they report to HHS in the invoices are proper. We  focused our discussions on policies and procedures related to employee  labor costs and payments to contractors and consultants, which are the  majority of NQF\u2019s direct costs. We also reviewed the invoices that NQF  submitted to HHS during the first contract year for evidence of NQF  approval by NQF officials. Additionally, we examined the files that NQF  maintained on its subcontracts to review documentation for the eight  subcontractors and consultants that performed work related to the HHS  contract in the first contract year. We compared documentation that NQF  maintains for the eight subcontractors and consultants with the  requirements in NQF\u2019s January 2010 procurement policy. For HHS, we  interviewed officials responsible for reviewing NQF invoices, the project  officer and the contracting officer for the NQF contract.

NQF uses a consensus  development process to evaluate and endorse consensus standards,  including quality measures, best practices, frameworks, and reporting  guidelines. NQF has endorsed over 600 quality measures in 27 areas, such  as cancer and diabetes. NQF endorses quality measures developed by  other organizations, such as the Joint Commission, the National  Committee for Quality Assurance, and the American Medical Association,  rather than developing quality measures itself. HHS has used a number of  NQF-endorsed measures in initiatives to promote quality measurement,  and NQF continues to endorse quality measures separate from this  contract."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Duties Established in MIPPA", "paragraphs": ["MIPPA established five duties related to the use of quality measures.

Under the cost-plus-fixed-fee contract,  HHS will reimburse NQF for costs incurred under the contract in addition  to a fixed fee that is paid regardless of other costs. Cost-plus-fixed-fee  contracts are used for efforts such as research, design, or study efforts  where cost and technical uncertainties exist and it is desirable to retain as  much flexibility as possible in order to accommodate change. However,  this type of contract provides only a minimum incentive to the contractor  to control costs. As we reported in 2009, these contracts are suitable when  the cost of work to be done is difficult to estimate and the level of effort  required is unknown.", "Under the FAR, cost-reimbursement contracts may only be used when the  contractor\u2019s accounting system is adequate for determining costs under  the contract to help prevent situations where contractors bill the  government for unallowable costs. One method an agency can use to  determine if an accounting system is adequate is to perform a preaward  survey of a potential contractor\u2019s accounting system prior to awarding a  contract. This review serves as a key control to determine whether the  potential contractor has an adequate accounting system in place to  accurately and consistently record costs and submit invoices for costs.  HHS conducted two preaward surveys of NQF\u2019s accounting system. HHS\u2019s  initial review, in November 2007, found that NQF\u2019s accounting system was  inadequate because the system could not identify and separate  unallowable costs, among other issues. NQF subsequently replaced its  accounting system, and a second HHS review in November 2008 found that  the system was adequate.", "Under the FAR, contracts are to contain provisions for agency approval of  a contractor\u2019s subcontracts. HHS\u2019s contract with NQF contains this  provision and also requires the approval of consultants. This review  requires appropriate support documentation provided by the contractor to  the agency, including a description of the services to be subcontracted, the  proposed subcontract price, and a negotiation memo that reflects the  principal elements of the subcontract price negotiations between the  contractor and subcontractor.", "Two HHS components are principally responsible for administering the  NQF contract: the office of the Assistant Secretary for Planning and  Evaluation (ASPE) and the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services  (CMS)\u2014an operational division within HHS. To conduct oversight of the  NQF contract, HHS assembled staff in these two units with experience in  acquisitions, contract management, and program management.  Specifically, the project officer for the NQF contract, responsible for  program management and performance assessment, is a representative of  ASPE. The contracting officer for the NQF contract, responsible for  administering the contract, is a representative of CMS.

While NQF began work for each of  the duties in the first contract year, HHS determines on an annual basis the  specific work NQF will be expected to perform under the five MIPPA  duties in each contract year.", "Recommendations on a National Strategy and Priorities for Quality  Measurement. NQF has taken steps to begin the duty of making  recommendations on a national strategy and priorities for quality  measurement. In October 2009, NQF established a committee of  stakeholders that is expected to develop recommendations about a  national strategy and priorities for quality measurement. NQF published  the recommended priorities in May 2010. The committee\u2019s  recommendations are expected to be based on a synthesis of evidence that  NQF has collected, using a subcontractor, on 20 conditions that account  for the majority of Medicare\u2019s costs. The subcontractor collected  evidence on existing quality measures for these conditions and identified  gaps where quality measures did not exist. The subcontractor also  collected evidence related to each condition, such as information on each  condition\u2019s prevalence, treatment costs, variability in providers\u2019 treatment  of the condition, disparities in treatment for patients with the condition,  and potential to improve quality of care for the condition. The committee  is expected to consider this evidence when developing recommendations  on a national strategy and priorities for quality measurement. Under  PPACA, NQF\u2019s recommendations on a national strategy and priorities  must be considered by HHS when it develops a national strategy for  quality improvement, which HHS is required to submit to Congress by  January 1, 2011.", "Endorsement of Measures. NQF has taken steps to provide for the  endorsement of quality measures. Prior to its contract with HHS, NQF  established a process for endorsing quality measures. Under this process,  organizations that develop quality measures submit them to NQF for  consideration, in response to specific solicitations by NQF. NQF forms a  committee of experts from its member organizations as well as other  organizations and agencies to review these quality measures against NQF- established criteria, such as the usability and feasibility of the measure.  After this committee evaluates the measures against these criteria, NQF\u2019s  process allows for a period during which its member organizations and the  public may comment on the committee\u2019s recommendation for each  measure. The process also provides for a period for its member  organizations to vote on whether the measures should be endorsed by  NQF as a national standard. Ultimately, NQF\u2019s board of directors makes a  final decision on whether NQF should formally endorse the measures.  (See app. I for a detailed description of NQF\u2019s endorsement process.)", "In order to provide for the endorsement of quality measures under this  duty, NQF has taken several steps. Specifically, NQF initiated projects and  solicited measures to be endorsed using its process for each of these  projects. These projects relate to quality measurement in nursing homes,  patient safety, and patient outcomes, and are scheduled to be completed  between December 2010 and May 2011. In addition to endorsing measures,  NQF also hired a subcontractor to evaluate its endorsement process and  recommend ways to improve its efficiency and effectiveness. The  subcontractor\u2019s report and NQF\u2019s approval of proposed enhancements to  the process are due January 2011.", "Maintenance of Endorsed Quality Measures. NQF has taken steps to  ensure that endorsed measures are maintained\u2014that is, updated or  retired. Prior to its contract with HHS, NQF established a process for  maintenance of measures. According to NQF, once a quality measure has  been endorsed, updated information on the measure\u2019s specifications  should be submitted to NQF annually and the measure should be  comprehensively reviewed under the maintenance process every 3 years.  NQF\u2019s maintenance process is similar to NQF\u2019s endorsement process, in  that it involves a review of measures against NQF-established criteria, a  period for public comment, and a final decision by NQF\u2019s board of  directors. In order to implement this process under its contract with HHS,  NQF began maintenance reviews for 191 measures in 14 areas such as  diabetes and cardiovascular care. The measures were identified by HHS as  being of interest to, or actually used by, HHS programs. By the end of the  first contract year, NQF had not determined completion dates for  maintenance of the 191 measures. As of May 2010, maintenance of the 191  measures identified by HHS is scheduled to be completed by the end of  2012.", "Promotion of the Development and Use of Electronic Health  Records. NQF has taken steps towards completing the duty of promoting  the development and use of electronic health records for use in quality  measurement. As of January 13, 2010, NQF had begun to implement a  framework that defines a standardized set of data that should be captured  in patients\u2019 electronic health records. The framework, known as the  Quality Data Set (QDS), is intended to allow data from electronic health  records to be collected and used in quality measurement. Implementation  and maintenance of the QDS is scheduled to continue through the end of  the 4-year contract, which ends January 13, 2013. To further promote the  development and use of electronic health records in quality measurement,  NQF began additional activities. For example, NQF established a panel of  experts to recommend additional capabilities to measure utilization.  According to NQF officials, efforts under this duty are scheduled for  completion between March 2010 and January 2013.", "Annual Report to Congress and the Secretary of HHS. NQF  submitted its first annual report to Congress and the Secretary of HHS on  March 1, 2009. HHS published this report, with its comments, in the  Federal Register on September 10, 2009.
