As requested, GAO evaluated the extent to which (1) TWIC processes for enrollment, background checking, and use are designed to provide reasonable assurance that unescorted access to these facilities is limited to qualified individuals; and (2) the effectiveness of TWIC has been assessed. GAO reviewed program documentation, such as the concept of operations, and conducted site visits to four TWIC centers, conducted covert tests at several selected U.S. ports chosen for their size in terms of cargo volume, and interviewed agency officials.

To meet the stated program purpose, TSA designed TWIC program processes to facilitate the issuance of TWICs to maritime workers. However, TSA did not assess the internal controls designed and in place to determine whether they provided reasonable assurance that the program could meet defined mission needs for limiting access to only qualified individuals. GAO found that internal controls in the enrollment and background checking processes are not designed to provide reasonable assurance that (1) only qualified individuals can acquire TWICs; (2) adjudicators follow a process with clear criteria for applying discretionary authority when applicants are found to have extensive criminal convictions; or (3) once issued a TWIC, TWIC-holders have maintained their eligibility. Further, internal control weaknesses in TWIC enrollment, background checking, and use could have contributed to the breach of MTSA-regulated facilities during covert tests conducted by GAO's investigators. During covert tests of TWIC use at several selected ports, GAO's investigators were successful in accessing ports using counterfeit TWICs, authentic TWICs acquired through fraudulent means, and false business cases (i.e., reasons for requesting access). Conducting a control assessment of the TWIC program's processes to address existing weaknesses could better position DHS to achieve its objectives in controlling unescorted access to the secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. DHS has not assessed the TWIC program's effectiveness at enhancing security or reducing risk for MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels. Further, DHS has not demonstrated that TWIC, as currently implemented and planned, is more effective than prior approaches used to limit access to ports and facilities, such as using facility specific identity credentials with business cases. Conducting an effectiveness assessment that further identifies and assesses TWIC program security risks and benefits could better position DHS and policymakers to determine the impact of TWIC on enhancing maritime security. Further, DHS did not conduct a risk-informed cost-benefit analysis that considered existing security risks, and it has not yet completed a regulatory analysis for the upcoming rule on using TWIC with card readers. Conducting a regulatory analysis using the information from the internal control and effectiveness assessments as the basis for evaluating the costs, benefits, security risks, and corrective actions needed to implement the TWIC program, could help DHS ensure that the TWIC program is more effective and cost-efficient than existing measures or alternatives at enhancing maritime security. Among other things, GAO recommends that DHS assess TWIC program internal controls to identify needed corrective actions, assess TWIC's effectiveness, and use the information to identify effective and cost-efficient methods for meeting program objectives. DHS concurred with all of the recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Securing transportation systems and facilities requires balancing security  to address potential threats while facilitating the flow of people and goods  that are critical to the United States economy and necessary for  supporting international commerce. As we have previously reported, these  systems and facilities are vulnerable and difficult to secure given their size,  easy accessibility, large number of potential targets, and proximity to  urban areas.", "The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 (MTSA) required the  Secretary of Homeland Security to prescribe regulations preventing  individuals from having unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA- regulated facilities and vessels unless they possess a biometric  transportation security card and are authorized to be in such an area.  MTSA further tasked the Secretary with the responsibility to issue  biometric transportation security cards to eligible individuals unless the  Secretary determines that an applicant poses a security risk warranting  denial of the card. The Transportation Worker Identification Credential  (TWIC) program is designed to implement these biometric maritime  security card requirements. The program requires maritime workers to  complete background checks to obtain a biometric identification card and  be authorized to be in the secure area by the owner/operator in order to  gain unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and  vessels. According to the Coast Guard, as of December 2010 and January  2011, there were 2,509 facilities and 12,908 vessels, respectively, which are  subject to MTSA regulations and must implement TWIC provisions.", "Within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Transportation  Security Administration (TSA) and the U.S. Coast Guard are responsible  for implementing and enforcing the TWIC program. TSA\u2019s responsibilities  include enrolling TWIC applicants, conducting background checks to  assess the individual\u2019s security threat, and issuing TWICs. The Coast  Guard is responsible for developing TWIC-related security regulations and  ensuring that MTSA-regulated maritime facilities and vessels are in  compliance with these regulations. In addition, DHS\u2019s Screening  Coordination Office facilitates coordination among the various DHS  components involved in TWIC, such as TSA and the Coast Guard, as well  as the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, which personalizes the  credentials, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which  administers grant funds in support of the TWIC program.", "In January 2007, a federal regulation (known as the TWIC credential rule)  set a compliance deadline, subsequently extended to April 15, 2009,  whereby each maritime worker seeking unescorted access to secure areas  of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels must possess a TWIC. In  September 2008, we reported that TSA, the Coast Guard, and maritime  industry stakeholders (e.g., operators of MTSA-regulated facilities and  vessels) had faced challenges in implementing the TWIC program,  including enrolling and issuing TWICs to a larger population than was  originally anticipated, ensuring that TWIC access control technologies  perform effectively in the harsh maritime environment, and balancing  security requirements with the flow of maritime commerce. In November  2009, we reported that progress had been made in enrolling workers and  activating TWICs, and recommended that TSA develop an evaluation plan  to guide pilot efforts and help inform the future implementation of TWIC  with electronic card readers. DHS generally concurred and discussed  actions to implement the recommendations, but these actions have not yet  fully addressed the intent of all of the recommendations. Currently, TWICs  are primarily used as visual identity cards\u2014known as a flashpass\u2014where  a card is to be visually inspected before a cardholder is allowed  unescorted access to a secure area of a MTSA-regulated port or facility.  As of January 6, 2011, TSA reported over 1.7 million enrollments and  1.6 million cards issued and activated.", "In response to your request, we evaluated the extent to which TWIC  program controls provide reasonable assurance that unescorted access to  secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels is limited to those  possessing a legitimately issued TWIC and who are authorized to be in  such an area. Specifically, this report addresses the following questions:  1.  To what extent are TWIC processes for enrollment, background  checking, and use designed to provide reasonable assurance that  unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities and  vessels is limited to qualified individuals?  2.  To what extent has DHS assessed the effectiveness of TWIC, and does  the Coast Guard have effective systems in place to measure  compliance?", "This report is a public version of a related sensitive report that we issued  to you in May 2011. DHS and TSA deemed some of the information in the  prior report as sensitive security information, which must be protected  from public disclosure. Therefore, this report omits sensitive information  about the TWIC program, including techniques used to enroll and conduct  a background check on individuals and assess an individual\u2019s eligibility for  a TWIC, and the technologies that support TWIC security threat  assessment determinations and Coast Guard inspections. In addition, at  TSA\u2019s request, we have redacted data on specific enrollment center(s) and  maritime ports where our investigators conducted covert testing. Although  the information provided in this report is more limited in scope, it  addresses the same questions and includes the same recommendations as  the sensitive report. Also, the overall methodology used for both reports is  the same.", "To assess the extent to which TWIC program processes were designed to  provide reasonable assurance that unescorted access to secure areas of  MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels is limited to qualified individuals, we  reviewed applicable laws, regulations, and policies. We also reviewed  documentation provided by TSA on the TWIC program systems and  processes, such as the TWIC User Manual for Trusted Agents, Statement  of Objectives, and Concept of Operations. We further reviewed the  processes and data sources with TWIC program management from TSA  and Lockheed Martin (the contractor responsible for implementing the  program). We also met with (1) the Director of Vetting Operations at  TSA\u2019s Colorado Springs Operations Center (CSOC), where background  checks for links to terrorism and continual vetting of TWIC holders is to  take place; (2) the Operations Manager for the Adjudication Center, where  secondary background checks are to be conducted for applicants with  identified criminal or immigration issues; and (3) the Director at DHS\u2019s  Screening Coordination Office responsible for overseeing credentialing  programs across DHS. Additionally, we met with the Criminal Justice  Information Services Division at the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  to discuss criminal vetting processes and policies. We then evaluated the  processes against the TWIC program\u2019s mission needs and Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. As part of our assessment  of TWIC program controls, we also did the following.", "We visited four TWIC enrollment and activation centers located in  areas with high population density and near ports participating in the  TWIC pilot to observe how TWIC enrollments are conducted. The  results are not generalizable to all enrollment and activation centers;  however, because all centers are to conduct the same operations  following the same guidance, the locations we visited provided us with  an overview of the TWIC enrollment and activation/issuance processes.", "We had our investigators conduct covert testing at enrollment center(s)  operating at the time to identify whether individuals providing  fraudulent information could acquire an authentic TWIC. The  information we obtained from the covert testing at enrollment  center(s) is not generalizable across all TWIC enrollment centers.  However, because all enrollments are to be conducted following the  same established processes, we believe that the information from our  covert tests provided us with important perspective on TWIC program  enrollment and background checking processes, as well as potential  challenges in verifying an individual\u2019s identity.", "Further our investigators conducted covert testing at several selected  maritime ports with MTSA-regulated facilities and vessels to identify  security vulnerabilities and program control deficiencies. These locations  were selected based on their geographic location across the country (east  coast, gulf coast, and west coast) and port size in terms of cargo volume.  We also visited or met with officials at each of the seven original pilot sites  being used to test TWIC card readers, interviewed port security officials  at two additional ports responsible for implementing TWIC at their port,  and met with nine maritime or transportation industry associations to  obtain information on (1) the use of TWIC as a flashpass and with  biometric readers where they are in use, (2) experiences with TWIC card  performance, and (3) any suspected or reported cases of TWIC card fraud.  The information we obtained from the security officials at the 9 ports or  pilot participants we visited is not generalizable across the maritime  transportation industry as a whole, but collectively, the ports we visited  accounted for 56 percent of maritime container trade in the United States,  and the ports our investigators visited as part of our covert testing efforts  accounted for 54 percent of maritime container trade in the United States  in 2009. As such, we believe that the information from these interviews,  site visits, and covert tests provided us with important additional  perspective and context on the TWIC program, as well as information  about potential implementation challenges faced by MTSA-regulated  facilities/vessels, transportation workers, and mariners.", "To assess the extent to which DHS has assessed the effectiveness of  TWIC, and determine whether the Coast Guard has effective systems in  place to measure compliance, we reviewed applicable laws, regulations,  and policies. We also met with TWIC program officials from TSA and the  Coast Guard, as well as Coast Guard officials responsible for assessing  maritime security risk, and reviewed related documents, to identify how  TWIC is to enhance maritime security. In addition, we met with Coast  Guard TWIC program officials, data management staff, and Coast Guard  officials stationed at four port areas across the United States with  enforcement responsibilities to assess the agency\u2019s approach to enforcing  compliance with TWIC regulations and measuring program effectiveness.  As part of this effort, we reviewed the type and substance of management  information available to the Coast Guard for assessing compliance with  TWIC.

In response to ATSA, TSA established the TWIC program in December  2001. In November 2002, MTSA was enacted and required the Secretary  of Homeland Security to issue a maritime worker identification card that  uses biometrics to control access to secure areas of maritime  transportation facilities and vessels. In addition, the Security and  Accountability For Every Port Act (SAFE Port Act) of 2006 amended  MTSA and directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to, among other  things, implement the TWIC pilot project to test TWIC use with biometric  card readers and inform a future regulation on the use of TWIC with  electronic readers.", "In requiring the issuance of transportation security cards for entry into  secure areas of a facility or vessel as part of MTSA, Congress noted in the  \u201cFindings\u201d section of the legislation that ports in the United States are a  major location for federal crime such as cargo theft and smuggling, and  are susceptible to large-scale acts of terrorism. For example, according  to the Coast Guard\u2019s January 2008 National Maritime Terrorism Threat  Assessment, al Qaeda leaders and supporters have identified western  maritime assets as legitimate targets. Moreover, according to the Coast  Guard assessment, al Qaeda-inspired operatives are most likely to use  vehicle bombs to strike U.S. cargo vessels, tankers, and fixed coastal  facilities such as ports. Studies have demonstrated that attacks on ports  could have serious consequences. For example, a study by the Center for  Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorist Events on the impact of a dirty  bomb attack on the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach estimated that  the economic consequences from a shutdown of the harbors due to the  contamination could result in significant losses in the tens of billions of  dollars, including the decontamination costs and the indirect economic  impacts due to the port shutdown.", "As defined by DHS, the purpose of the TWIC program is to design and field  a common credential for all transportation workers across the United  States who require unescorted access to secure areas at MTSA-regulated  maritime facilities and vessels.

Such an assessment could help  provide reasonable assurance that control weaknesses in one area of the  program do not undermine the reliability of other program areas or  impede the program from meeting mission needs. TWIC program officials  told us that control weaknesses were not addressed prior to initiating the  TWIC program because they had not previously identified them, or  because they would be too costly to address. However, officials did not  provide documentation to support their cost concerns and told us that  they did not complete an assessment that accounted for whether the  program could achieve defined mission needs without implementing  additional or compensating controls to mitigate existing risks, or the risks  associated with not correcting for existing internal control weaknesses.", "Our investigators conducted covert tests at enrollment center(s) to help  test the rigor of the TWIC enrollment and background checking processes.

Additionally, the electronic device used to assess the  authenticity of identification credentials renders a score on the likelihood  of the document being authentic and produces an assessment report in  support of the score. Assessing whether the applicant\u2019s credential is  authentic is one source of information for positively identifying an  applicant.

For example,  assessments of document authenticity made by a trusted agent or the  electronic document authentication device as part of the enrollment  process are not considered as part of the first-level background check.  Moreover, TWIC program officials agree that this is a program weakness.  As of December 1, 2010, approximately 50 percent of TWICs were  approved after the first-level background check without undergoing  further review. As an initial step towards addressing this weakness, and  in response to our review, TWIC program officials told us that since April  17, 2010, the comments provided at enrollment by trusted agents have  been sent to the Screening Gateway\u2014a TSA system for aggregating threat  assessment data. However, this change in procedure does not correct the  internal control weaknesses we identified. Attempts to authenticate  copies of documents are limited because it is not possible to capture all of  the security features when copies of the identity documents are recorded,  such as holograms or color-shifting ink.

For  example, an applicant could elect to provide one document, such a U.S.  passport, which, according to TSA officials, serves as proof of U.S.  citizenship or proof of nationality. However, an applicant could elect to  submit documents that do not provide proof of citizenship. As of  December 1, 2010, nearly 86 percent of approved TWIC enrollments were  by self-identified United States citizens or nationals asserting that they  were born in the United States or a United States territory.", "Verifying a U.S.-born citizen\u2019s identity and related lawful status can be  costly and is a challenge faced by U.S. government programs such as  passports. However, reaching an accurate determination of a TWIC  applicant\u2019s potential security threat in meeting TWIC mission needs is  dependant on positively identifying the applicant. Given such potential  cost constraints, consistent with internal control standards, identifying  alternative mechanisms to positively identify individuals to the extent that  the benefits exceed the costs and TWIC program mission needs are met  could enhance TSA\u2019s ability to positively identify individuals and reduce  the likelihood that criminals or terrorists could acquire a TWIC  fraudulently.", "Controls are not in place to determine whether an applicant has a  need for a TWIC. Regulations governing the TWIC program security  threat assessments require applicants to disclose their job description and  location(s) where they will most likely require unescorted access, if  known, and the name, telephone number, and address of the applicant\u2019s  current employer(s) if the applicant works for an employer that requires a  TWIC. However, TSA enrollment processes do not require that this  information be provided by applicants. For example, when applying for a  TWIC, applicants are to certify that they may need a TWIC as part of their  employment duties. However, the enrollment process does not request  information on the location where the applicant will most likely require  unescorted access, and enrollment processes include asking the applicant  if they would like to provide employment information, but informing the  applicant that employer information is not required.", "While not a problem prior to implementing the TWIC program, according  to TSA officials, a primary reason for not requiring employer information  be captured by applicant processes is that many applicants do not have  employers, and that many employers will not accept employment  applications from workers who do not already have a TWIC. However,  TSA could not provide statistics on (1) how many individuals applying for  TWICs were unemployed at the time of their application; or (2) a reason  why the TWIC-related regulation does not prohibit employers from  denying employment to non-TWIC holders who did not previously have a  need for a TWIC. Further, according to TSA and Coast Guard officials,  industry was opposed to having employment information verified as part  of the application process, as industry representatives believed such  checks would be too invasive and time-consuming. TSA officials further  told us that confirming this information would be too costly.", "We recognize that implementing mechanisms to capture this information  could be time-consuming and involve additional costs. However, collecting  information on present employers or operators of MTSA-regulated  facilities and vessels to be accessed by the applicant, to the extent that the  benefits exceed the costs and TWIC program mission needs are met, could  help ensure TWIC program mission needs are being met, and serve as a  barrier to individuals attempting to acquire an authentic TWIC through  fraudulent means. Therefore, if TSA determines that implementing such  mechanisms are, in fact, cost prohibitive, identifying and implementing  appropriate compensating controls could better position TSA to positively  identify the TWIC applicant. Not taking any action increases the risk that  individuals could gain unescorted access to secure areas of MTSA- regulated facilities and vessels.", "As of September 2010, TSA\u2019s background checking process had identified  no instances of nonimmigration-related document or identity fraud. This is  in part because of previously discussed weaknesses in TWIC program  controls for positively identifying applicants, and the systems and  procedures the TWIC program relies on not being designed to effectively  monitor for such occurrences, in accordance with internal control  standards. Though not an exhaustive list, through a review of Coast Guard  reports and publicly available court records, we identified five court cases  where the court documents indicate that illegal immigrants acquired, or in  one of the cases sought to acquire, an authentic TWIC through fraudulent  activity such as providing fraudulent identity information and, in at least  one of the cases and potentially up to four, used the TWIC to access  secure areas of MTSA-regulated facilities. Four of these cases were a  result of, or involved, United States Immigration and Customs  Enforcement efforts after individuals had acquired, or sought to acquire, a  TWIC. As of September 2010, the program\u2019s background checking process  identified 18 instances of potential fraud out of the approximately  1,676,000 TWIC enrollments. These instances all involved some type of  fraud related to immigration. The 18 instances of potential fraud were  identified because the 18 individuals asserted themselves to be non-U.S.- born applicants and, unlike processes in place for individuals asserting to  be U.S.-born citizens, TSA\u2019s background checking process includes  additional controls to validate such individuals\u2019 identities. For example,  TSA requires that at least one of the documents provided by such  individuals at enrollment show proof of their legal status and seeks to  validate each non-U.S.-born applicant\u2019s identity with the U.S. Citizenship  and Immigration Services.", "Internal control standards highlight the need for capturing information  needed to meet program objectives; ensuring that relevant, reliable, and  timely information is available for management decision-making purposes;  and providing reasonable assurance that compliance with applicable laws  and regulations is being achieved. Conducting a control assessment of  the TWIC program\u2019s processes to address existing weaknesses could  enhance the TWIC program\u2019s ability to prevent and detect fraud and  positively identify TWIC applicants.

Some  of these offenses, such as espionage or treason, would permanently  disqualify an individual from obtaining a TWIC. Other offenses, such as  murder or the unlawful possession of an explosive device, while  categorized as permanent disqualifiers, are also eligible for a waiver under  TSA regulations and might not permanently disqualify an individual from  obtaining a TWIC if TSA determines upon subsequent review that an  applicant does not represent a security threat. Table 1 presents examples  of disqualifying criminal offenses set out in statute and implementing  regulations for consideration as part of the adjudication process.", "TSA also has the authority to add to or modify the list of interim  disqualifying crimes. Further, in determining whether an applicant poses a  security threat, TSA officials stated that adjudicators have the discretion  to consider the totality of an individual\u2019s criminal record, including  criminal offenses not defined as a permanent or interim disqualifying  criminal offenses, such as theft or larceny. More specifically, TSA\u2019s  implementing regulations provide, in part, that with respect to threat  assessments, TSA may determine that an applicant poses a security threat  if the search conducted reveals extensive foreign or domestic criminal  convictions, a conviction for a serious crime not listed as a permanent or  interim disqualifying offense, or a period of foreign or domestic  imprisonment that exceeds 365 consecutive days.

For example, TSA  has not developed guidance or benchmarks for adjudicators to  consistently apply when reviewing TWIC applicants with extensive  criminal convictions but no disqualifying offense. This is particularly  important given TSA\u2019s reasoning for including this authority in TWIC- related regulation. Specifically, TSA noted that it understands that the  flexibility this language provides must be used cautiously and on the basis  of compelling information that can withstand judicial review. They further  noted that the decision to determine whether an applicant poses a threat  under this authority is largely a subjective judgment based on many facts  and circumstances.", "While TSA does not track metrics on the number of TWICs provided to  applicants with specific criminal offenses not defined as disqualifying  offenses, as of September 8, 2010, the agency reported 460,786 cases  where the applicant was approved, but had a criminal record based on the  results from the FBI. This represents approximately 27 percent of  individuals approved for a TWIC at the time. In each of these cases, the  applicant had either a criminal offense not defined as a disqualifying  offense or an interim disqualifying offense that was no longer a  disqualification based on conviction date or the applicant\u2019s release date  from incarceration. Consequently, based on TSA\u2019s background checking  procedures, all of these cases would have been reviewed by an adjudicator  for consideration as part of the second-level background check because  derogatory information had been identified. As such, each of these cases  had to be examined and a judgment had to be made as to whether to deny  an applicant a TWIC based on the totality of the offenses contained in each  applicant\u2019s criminal report.", "While there were 460,786 cases where the applicant was approved, but had  a criminal record, TSA reports to have taken steps to deny 1 TWIC  applicant under this authority.

However, in  the absence of criteria, we were unable to analyze or compare how the  approximately 30 adjudicators who are assigned to the TWIC program at  any given time made determinations about TWIC applicants with extensive  criminal histories. Given that 27 percent of TWIC holders have been  convicted of at least one nondisqualifying offense, defining what extensive  criminal convictions means and developing guidance or criteria for how  adjudicators should apply this discretionary authority could help provide  TSA with reasonable assurance that applications are consistently  adjudicated.

According to FBI and TSA officials, policy and statutory provisions  hamper the program from running the broader FBI fingerprint-based  check using the fingerprints collected at enrollment on an ongoing basis.  More specifically, because the TWIC background check is considered to  be for a noncriminal justice purpose, to conduct an additional  fingerprint-based check as part of an ongoing TWIC background check,  TSA would have to collect a new set of fingerprints from the TWIC- holder, if the prints are more than 1 year old, and submit those prints to  the FBI each time they want to assess the TWIC-holder\u2019s criminal history.  According to TSA officials, it would be cost prohibitive to run the  fingerprint-based check on an ongoing basis, as TSA would have to pay th FBI $17 .25 per check.", "Although existing policies may hamper TSA\u2019s ability to check FBI-held  fingerprint-based criminal history records for the TWIC program, TSA has  not explored alternatives for addressing this weakness, such as informing  facility and port operators of this weakness and identifying solutions for  leveraging existing state criminal history information, where available. For  instance, state maritime organizations may have other mechanisms at their  disposal for helping to identify TWIC-holders who may no longer meet  TWIC qualification requirements. Specifically, laws governing the maritime  environment in New York and New Jersey provide for credentialing  authorities being notified if licensed or registered longshoremen have been  arrested. Further, other governing entities, such as the State of Florida and  the Alabama State Port Authority, have access to state-based criminal  records checks. While TSA may not have direct access to criminal history  records, TSA could compensate for this control weakness, for example, by  leveraging existing mechanisms available to maritime stakeholders across  the country to better ensure that only qualified individuals retain TWICs.", "Controls are not designed to provide reasonable assurance that  TWIC holders continue to meet immigration status eligibility  requirements. If a TWIC holder\u2019s stated period of legal presence in the  United States is about to expire or has expired, the TWIC program does  not request or require proof from TWIC holders to show that they continue  to maintain legal presence in the United States. Additionally, although they  have the regulatory authority to do so, the program does not issue TWICs  for a term less than 5 years to match the expiration of a visa. Instead, TSA  relies on (1) TWIC holders to self-report if they no longer have legal  presence in the country, and (2) employers to report if a worker is no  longer legally present in the country. As we have previously reported,  government programs for granting benefits to individuals face challenges  in confirming an individual\u2019s immigration status. TWIC program officials  stated that the program uses a United States Citizenship and Immigration  Services system during the background checking process prior to issuing a  TWIC as a method for confirming the legal status of non-U.S. citizens.  TSA has not, however, consistent with internal control standards,  implemented alternative controls to compensate for this limitation and  provide reasonable assurance that TWIC holders remain eligible. For  instance, the TWIC program has not compensated for this limitation by (1)  using its authority to issue TWICs with shorter expiration dates to  correspond with each individual\u2019s legal presence, or (2) updating the TWIC  system to systematically suspend TWIC privileges for individuals who no  longer meet immigration eligibility requirements until they can provide  evidence of continued legal presence.", "TWIC program officials stated that implementing these compensating  measures would be too costly, but they have not conducted an assessment  to identify the costs of implementing these controls, or determined if the  benefits of mitigating related security risks would outweigh those costs,  consistent with internal control standards.

The Coast Guard uses its Marine  Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) database to meet  these needs by recording activities related to MTSA-regulated facility and  vessel oversight, including observations of TWIC-related deficiencies.  The purpose of MISLE is to provide the capability to collect, maintain, and  retrieve information necessary for the administration, management, and  documentation of Coast Guard activities.

In reviewing the Coast Guard\u2019s records of TWIC- related enforcement actions, we found that, in addition to verifying the  number of inspections conducted, the Coast Guard is generally positioned  to verify that TWIC cards are being checked by Coast Guard inspectors  and, of the card checks that are recorded, the number of cardholders who  are compliant and noncompliant.

However, while the  Coast Guard uses MISLE to track program compliance, because of  limitations in the MISLE system design, the processes involved in the  collection, cataloguing, and querying of information cannot be relied upon  to produce the management information needed to assess trends in  compliance with the TWIC program or associated vulnerabilities. For  instance, when inspectors document a TWIC card verification check, the  system is set up to record the number of TWICs reviewed for different  types of workers and whether the TWIC holders are compliant or  noncompliant. However, other details on TWIC-related deficiencies, such  as failure to ensure that all facility personnel with security duties are  familiar with all relevant aspects of the TWIC program and how to carry  them out, are not recorded in the system in a form that allows inspectors  or other Coast Guard officials to easily and systematically identify that a  deficiency was related to TWIC. For example, from January 2009 through  December 2010, the Coast Guard reported issuing 145 enforcement actions  as a result of annual compliance exams or security spot checks at the  2,135 facilities that have undergone the inspections. These included 57  letters of warning, 40 notices of violation, 32 civil penalties, and 16  operations controls (suspension or restriction of operations). However, it  would be labor-intensive for the Coast Guard to identify how many of the  57 letters of warning or 40 notices of violation were TWIC related,  according to a Coast Guard official responsible for TWIC compliance,  because there is not an existing query designed to extract this information  from the system. Someone would have to manually review each of the 97  inspection reports in the database indicating either a letter of warning or a  notice of violation to verify whether or not the deficiencies were TWIC  related. As such, the MISLE system is not designed to readily provide  information that could help management measure and assess the overall  level of compliance with the TWIC program or existing vulnerabilities.", "According to a Coast Guard official responsible for TWIC compliance,  Coast Guard headquarters staff has not conducted a trend analysis of the  deficiencies found during reviews and inspections and there are no other  analyses they planned to conduct regarding enforcement until after  readers are required to be used. According to the Coast Guard, it can  generally identify the number of TWICs checked and recorded in the  MISLE system. However, it cannot perform trend analysis of the  deficiencies as it would like to do, as it requires additional information. In  the interim, as of January 7, 2011, the Coast Guard reported deploying 164  handheld biometric readers nationally to units responsible for conducting  inspections. These handheld readers are intended to be the Coast Guard\u2019s primary means of TWIC verification. During inspections, Coast Guard inspectors use the card readers to electronically check TWICs inthree ways: (1) verification\u2014a biometric one-to-one match of the  fingerprint; (2) authentication\u2014electronically confirming that the  certificates on the credential are authentic; and (3) validation\u2014 electronically check the card against the \u201chotlist\u201d of invalid or revoked  cards. The Coast Guard believes that the use of these readers during  inspections will greatly improve the effectiveness of enforcement efforts  and enhance record keeping through the use of the readers\u2019 logs.", "As a result of limitations in MISLE design and the collection and recording  of inspection data, it will be difficult for the Coast Guard to identify trends  nationwide in TWIC-related compliance, such as whether particular types  of facilities or a particular region of the country have greater levels of  noncompliance, on an ongoing basis. Coast Guard officials acknowledged  these deficiencies and reported that they are in the process of making  enhancements to the MISLE database and plan to distribute updated  guidance on how to collect and input information into MISLE to the  Captains of the Port. However, as of January 2011, the Coast Guard had  not yet set a date for implementing these changes. Further, while this is a  good first step, these enhancements do not address weaknesses related to  the collection process and querying of MISLE information so as to  facilitate the Coast Guard performing trend analysis of the deficiencies as  part of its compliance reviews. By designing and implementing a cost- effective and practical method for collecting, cataloging, and querying  TWIC-related compliance information, the Coast Guard could be better  positioned to identify and assess TWIC-related compliance and  enforcement trends, and to obtain management information needed to  assess and understand existing vulnerabilities with the use of TWIC."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the TWIC program continues on the path to full implementation\u2014with  potentially billions of dollars needed to install TWIC card readers in  thousands of the nation\u2019s ports, facilities, and vessels at stake\u2014it is  important that Congress, program officials, and maritime industry  stakeholders fully understand the program\u2019s potential benefits and  vulnerabilities, as well as the likely costs of addressing these potential  vulnerabilities.

This is important because, unlike prior access  control approaches which allowed access to a specific facility, the TWIC  potentially facilitates access to thousands of facilities once the federal  government attests that the TWIC holder has been positively identified and  is deemed not to be a security threat. Further, doing so as part of the  regulatory analysis could better assure DHS, Congress, and maritime  stakeholders that TWIC program security objectives will be met. Finally,  by designing and implementing a cost-effective and practical method for  collecting, cataloging, and querying TWIC-related compliance information,  the Coast Guard could be better positioned to identify trends and to obtain  management information needed to assess and understand existing  vulnerabilities with the use of TWIC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To identify effective and cost-efficient methods for meeting TWIC program  objectives, and assist in determining whether the benefits of continuing to  implement and operate the TWIC program in its present form and planned  use with readers surpass the costs, we recommend that the Secretary of  Homeland Security take the following four actions:    Perform an internal control assessment of the TWIC program by   (1) analyzing existing controls, (2) identifying related weaknesses and  risks, and (3) determining cost-effective actions needed to correct or  compensate for those weaknesses so that reasonable assurance of  meeting TWIC program objectives can be achieved. This assessment  should consider weaknesses we identified in this report among other  things, and include:    strengthening the TWIC program\u2019s controls for preventing and  detecting identity fraud, such as requiring certain biographic  information from applicants and confirming the information to the  extent needed to positively identify the individual, or implementing  alternative mechanisms to positively identify individuals;    defining the term extensive criminal history for use in the  adjudication process and ensuring that adjudicators follow a clearly  defined and consistently applied process, with clear criteria, in  considering the approval or denial of a TWIC for individuals with  extensive criminal convictions not defined as permanent or interim  disqualifying offenses; and  identifying mechanisms for detecting whether TWIC holders  continue to meet TWIC disqualifying criminal offense and  immigration-related eligibility requirements after TWIC issuance to  prevent unqualified individuals from retaining and using authentic  TWICs.", "Conduct an effectiveness assessment that includes addressing internal  control weaknesses and, at a minimum, evaluates whether use of TWIC  in its present form and planned use with readers would enhance the  posture of security beyond efforts already in place given costs and  program risks.", "Use the information from the internal control and effectiveness  assessments as the basis for evaluating the costs, benefits, security  risks, and corrective actions needed to implement the TWIC program in  a manner that will meet stated mission needs and mitigate existing  security risks as part of conducting the regulatory analysis on  implementing a new regulation on the use of TWIC with biometric card  readers.", "Direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard to design effective methods  for collecting, cataloguing, and querying TWIC-related compliance  issues to provide the Coast Guard with the enforcement information  needed to assess trends in compliance with the TWIC program and  identify associated vulnerabilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of the sensitive version of this report to the Secretary  of Homeland Security for review and comment on March 18, 2011.  DHS  provided written comments on behalf of the Department, the  Transportation Security Administration, and the United States Coast  Guard, which are reprinted in full in appendix IV.  In commenting on our  report, DHS stated that it concurred with our four recommendations and  identified actions planned or under way to implement them.", "While DHS did not take issue with the results of our work, DHS did  provide new details in its response that merit additional discussion.  First,  DHS noted that it is working to strengthen controls around applicant  identity verification in TWIC, but that document fraud is a vulnerability to  credential-issuance programs across the federal government, state and  local governments, and the private sector. DHS further noted that a  governmentwide infrastructure does not exist for information sharing  across all entities that issue documents that other programs, such as  TWIC, use to positively authenticate an individual\u2019s identity. We  acknowledge that such a government-wide infrastructure does not exist,  and, as discussed in our report, recognize that there are inherent  weaknesses in relying on identity documents alone to confirm an  individual\u2019s identity. However, positively identifying individuals\u2014or  confirming their identity\u2014and determining their eligibility for a TWIC is a  key stated program goal. Issuing TWICs to individuals without positively  identifying them and subsequently assuring their eligibility could, counter  to the program\u2019s intent, create a security vulnerability. While we recognize  that additional costs could be imposed by requiring positive identification  checks, taking actions to strengthen the existing identity authentication  process, such as only accepting documents that TSA can and does confirm  to be authentic with the issuing agency, and verifying an applicant\u2019s  business need, could enhance TWIC program efforts to prevent and detect  identity fraud and enhance maritime security.", "Second, DHS stated that it is working to continually verify TWIC-holder  eligibility after issuance but also noted the limitations in the current  process.  While TSA does receive some criminal history records  information when it sends fingerprints to the FBI, the information is not  provided recurrently, nor is the information necessarily complete. DHS  stated that to provide the most robust recurrent vetting against criminal  records, TSA would need access to additional state and federal systems,  and have additional authority to do so. As we reported, FBI and TWIC  officials stated that because the TWIC background check is considered to  be for a noncriminal justice purpose, policy and statutory provisions  hamper the program from running the broader FBI fingerprint-based  check using the fingerprints collected at enrollment on an ongoing basis.  However, we continue to believe that TSA could compensate for this  weakness by leveraging existing mechanisms available to maritime  stakeholders. For example, other governing entities\u2014such as the Alabama  State Port Authority\u2014that have an interest in ensuring the security of the  maritime environment, might be willing to establish a mechanism for  independently sharing relevant information when warranted. Absent  efforts to leverage available information sources, TSA may not be  successful in tempering existing limitations.", "Lastly, DHS sought clarification on the reporting of our investigators\u2019  success at breaching security at ports during covert testing. Specifically, in  its comments, DHS noted that it believes that our report\u2019s focus on access  to port areas rather than access to individual facilities can be misleading.  DHS noted that we do not report on the number of facilities that our  investigators attempted to gain access to within each port area. DHS  stated that presenting the breaches in terms of the number of port areas  breached rather than the number of facilities paints a more troublesome  picture of the actual breaches that occurred.  We understand DHS\u2019s  concern but continue to believe that the results of our investigators\u2019 work,  as reported, fairly and accurately represents the results and significance of  the work conducted.  The goal of the covert testing was to assess whether  or not weaknesses exist at ports with varying characteristics across the  nation, not to define the pervasiveness of existing weaknesses by type of  facility, volume, or other characteristic. Given the numerous differences  across facilities and the lack of publicly available information and related  statistics for each of the approximately 2,509 MTSA-regulated facilities, we  identified covert testing at the port level to be the proper unit of analysis  for our review and reporting purposes. Conducting a detailed assessment  of the pervasiveness of existing weaknesses by type of facility, volume, or  other characteristics as suggested by DHS would be a more appropriate  tasking for the Coast Guard as part of its continuing effort to ensure  compliance with TWIC-related regulations.", "In addition, with regard to covert testing, DHS further commented that the  report does not distinguish among breaches in security using a counterfeit  TWIC or an authentic TWIC card obtained with fraudulent documents.  DHS noted that because there is no \u201cgranularity\u201d with the report as to  when a specific card was used, one can be left with the unsupported  impression that individual facilities in all cases were failing to implement  TWIC visual inspection requirements. For the above noted reason, we did  not report on the results of covert testing at the facility level. However, our  records show that use of counterfeit TWICs was successful for gaining  access to more than one port where our investigators breached security.  Our investigators further report that security officers never questioned the  authenticity of TWICs presented for acquiring access. Our records show  that operations at the locations our investigators breached included cargo,  containers, and fuel, among others.", "In addition, TSA provided written technical comments, which we  incorporated into the report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Homeland  Security, the Assistant Secretary for the Transportation Security  Administration, the Commandant of the United States Coast Guard, and  appropriate congressional committees.
