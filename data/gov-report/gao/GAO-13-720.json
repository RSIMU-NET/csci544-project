Both the Association of American Railroads (AAR) and the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) have reported that most railroads will not have PTC fully implemented by the deadline. Of the four major freight railroads included in GAO's review, only one expects to meet the 2015 deadline. The other three freight railroads report that they expect to have PTC implemented by 2017 or later. Commuter railroads generally must wait until freight railroads and Amtrak equip the rail lines they operate on, and most of the seven commuter railroads included in this review reported that they do not expect to meet the 2015 deadline. To implement PTC systems that meet the requirements of the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008 (RSIA), railroads are developing more than 20 major components that are currently in various stages of development, integrating them, and installing them across the rail network. AAR recently reported that by the end of 2012, railroads had spent $2.8 billion on PTC implementation. To implement PTC, AAR estimates that freight railroads will spend approximately $8 billion in total while the American Public Transportation Association (APTA) estimates that commuter railroads will spend a minimum of $2 billion. Much of the work to implement PTC remains to be done. For example, AAR reported that as of the end of 2012, about a third of wayside interface units, which are needed to communicate data, had been installed and that less than 1 percent of locomotives needing upgrades had been fully equipped.", "Most railroads report they will not complete PTC implementation by the 2015 deadline due to a number of complex and interrelated challenges. Many PTC components continue to be in various stages of development, and in order to ensure successful integration of these components, railroads must conduct multiple phases of testing before components are installed across the network. Also, some railroads raised concerns regarding FRA's limited staff resources in two areas: verification of field tests and timely certification of PTC systems. Commuter railroads face additional challenges such as obtaining radio frequency spectrum, which is essential for PTC communications. By attempting to implement PTC by the 2015 deadline while key components are still in development, railroads could be introducing financial and operational risks. For example, officials from railroads and FRA said that without adequate testing, PTC systems might be more prone to reliability issues. To mitigate risks, provide flexibility in meeting the PTC deadline, and better manage limited resources, FRA has requested that Congress amend RSIA to provide additional authorities in implementing PTC. Specifically, FRA requested authority to extend the deadline on certain rail lines, grant provisional certification of PTC systems, and approve the use of alternative safety technologies in lieu of PTC. Flexibility in extending the deadline for certain railroads acknowledges differences in railroads' implementation schedules and may also help FRA better manage its limited resources by, for example, preventing a potential review backlog resulting from most of the railroads' submitting final safety plans at the same time--a concern raised by both freight railroads and FRA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Given the implementation challenges railroads face in meeting the deadline, and to help FRA manage its limited resources, Congress should consider amending RSIA as FRA has requested.

Freight railroads operate over  approximately 160,000 miles of track and own most of the track in the  United States; a notable exception is the Northeast Corridor, between  Washington, D.C., and Boston, Massachusetts, which Amtrak  predominantly owns. Amtrak provides intercity passenger rail service in  46 states and the District of Columbia and operates on 21,000 miles of  track.

Some railroads also use additional  technologies to improve efficiency and achieve business benefits.  Currently, dispatchers in centralized offices issue train movement  authorities that allow trains to enter specific track segments, or blocks.  These authorities are communicated to train operators through signals  alongside the track, or in non-signaled territory through track warrants  generally issued by verbal radio communication (see fig. 1).Railroads also  use additional technologies to maximize operational efficiencies.

Prior to the enactment of the RSIA in 2008, railroads developed and  tested several PTC systems but deployed them on a limited basis. For  example, in 1998, while Amtrak was upgrading the Northeast Corridor to  enable operation of high-speed passenger trains\u2014a service known today  as Acela\u2014FRA directed Amtrak to install a new train control system on  some portions of the corridor as a safety measure.

RSIA, among other things,  required railroads to install PTC by December 31, 2015, on mainlines  used to transport inter-city rail passengers, commuters, or any amount of  toxic-by-inhalation materials. RSIA requires railroads to install PTC  systems, which are designed to prevent train-to-train collisions and  derailments caused by exceeding safe speeds. PTC must also be  designed to protect rail workers by preventing trains from entering work  zones as well as to prevent the movement of trains through switches left  in the wrong position. PTC\u2019s communications-based system links various  components, namely locomotive computers, wayside units along the side  of the track, and dispatch systems in centralized office locations (see fig.  2). Through these components, PTC is able to communicate a train\u2019s  location, speed restrictions, and movement authorities, and can slow or  stop a train that is not being operated safely. For example, a PTC system  could have prevented the 2008 Chatsworth accident by first alerting the  operator that the train was approaching a red signal and then stopping  the train before passing the red signal. However, it should be noted that  there are types of accidents, such as highway-railroad crossing accidents  and trespasser deaths, that PTC technology is not designed to prevent.  According to FRA, highway-railroad crossing and trespasser deaths  account for 95 percent of all rail-related fatalities.", "RSIA does not require railroads to implement the same PTC system;  however, the various PTC systems must meet the PTC system  functionality requirements. There are two primary ways PTC can be  implemented\u2014as an overlay or as a standalone system. An overlay  system involves installing PTC over existing track equipment to work in  conjunction with the existing signal system and the train\u2019s current method  of operations. A standalone system involves taking information currently  communicated through the signal system and putting it onboard the  locomotive, effectively eliminating the need for the existing signal system.  Whatever PTC system a railroad implements, RSIA requires that systems  be interoperable, meaning they must be able to communicate with one  another so trains can seamlessly move across track owned by different  railroads with potentially different PTC systems. Interoperability is  important given that, according to FRA, there are 37 freight, intercity  passenger, and commuter railroads that are required to implement PTC.", "To implement the requirements of RSIA, FRA has conducted three  rulemakings that resulted in: (1) a 2010 final rule, (2) a 2012 final rule,  and (3) a 2012 Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM), which is  currently not finalized (see fig. 3). In the original 2010 rule, FRA used  facts and data known in 2008 to determine where PTC implementation  should occur. Recognizing that traffic levels and routing could change  between 2008 and the statutory deadline in 2015, the 2010 rule provided  railroads with the option to request an amendment to not equip a track  segment where the railroad was initially required to install PTC, but may  no longer be required to do so. In order for certain rail segments to be  excluded, the segments would need to pass two qualifying tests. After  FRA finalized the 2010 rule, the Association of American Railroads (AAR)  challenged the two qualifying tests in a lawsuit, and FRA and AAR  entered into a settlement agreement in which FRA agreed to propose  elimination of the tests. The two qualifying tests were eliminated in the  2012 final rule; as a result, railroads do not have to implement PTC on rail  segments that will not transport toxic-by-inhalation materials or  passengers as of December 31, 2015. The FRA rulemaking that is  currently under way addresses how railroads will handle en-route failures  of PTC equipment, among other things.", "In accordance with Executive Order 12866, FRA prepared economic  analyses\u2014also known as regulatory impact analyses\u2014to assess the  benefits and costs of PTC before promulgating regulations.

Executive orders and OMB  guidance direct agencies to assess the benefits and costs of regulatory  alternatives. Agencies should generally select the regulatory approach  that maximizes net benefits to society, unless a statute requires  otherwise. OMB developed guidelines to encourage good regulatory  impact analysis and to standardize the way that benefits and costs of  federal regulations are measured and reported. OMB guidelines  generally direct agencies, in analyzing the impacts of rules, to, among  other things: measure the potential social benefits and costs of regulatory  alternatives incremental to a \u201cbaseline,\u201d (i.e., the conditions that would  exist in the absence of the proposed regulation); analyze a range of  alternatives; identify and quantitatively analyze key uncertainties  associated with the estimates of benefits and costs; and provide  documentation that the analysis is based on the best reasonably  obtainable scientific, technical, and economic information available. OMB  guidelines further state that a good regulatory analysis includes  identifying the regulatory alternative with the largest net benefits to  society. It also states that such information is useful for decision makers  and the public, even when economic efficiency is not the only or the  overriding public policy objective.", "As part of overseeing railroads\u2019 progress with PTC implementation, FRA  is also responsible for reviewing railroads\u2019 PTC-related plans.

Amtrak is  implementing Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System (ACSES) on  the Northeast Corridor. Although ACSES and I-ETMS are functionally  similar, they differ technologically. To determine train location, ACSES  relies on track-embedded transponders while I-ETMS uses Global  Positioning System (GPS) information (see fig. 4). Since most commuter  railroads run over tracks owned by freight railroads or Amtrak, they are  largely implementing the same systems developed by the freight railroads  or Amtrak. For example, eight commuter rail systems that operate over  Amtrak infrastructure on the Northeast Corridor\u2014including major  commuter systems in the New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston  areas\u2014are installing ACSES.", "FRA has reported that in order to implement PTC, railroads must design,  produce, and install more than 20 major components such as data radios  for locomotive communication, locomotive management computers, and  back office servers. Once these components are developed and  integrated, PTC must then be installed on rail lines throughout the  country, which involves upgrading and installing thousands of items, as  well as replacing approximately 12,000 signals (see table 1). Adding to  the complexity of PTC installation is the need to ensure that individual  railroad systems are fully interoperable, which requires that the potential  problems across railroads be identified, isolated, and corrected through  testing in labs and in the field.", "Railroads have invested billions in PTC implementation to-date, but  anticipate spending billions more. In May 2013, AAR reported that by  the end of 2012, railroads had spent about $2.8 billion on PTC  implementation. According to AAR, the total cost to freight railroads for  PTC implementation is estimated to be approximately $8 billion. Despite  the billions railroads have invested, much of the work to implement PTC  remains to be done. For example, AAR reported that as of the end of  2012, about a third of wayside interface units\u2014 which are needed to  communicate data\u2014had been installed.

Both AAR and FRA have reported that  most railroads will not have PTC fully implemented by the deadline. Of  the four major freight railroads we included in our review, BNSF is the  only railroad expecting to meet the 2015 deadline. According to BNSF  representatives, it is on schedule to meet the 2015 deadline because of  its extensive experience working on PTC prior to RSIA, its iterative build  and test approach, and the concurrent development of its PTC  dispatching and back office systems. Of the three remaining freight  railroads we spoke to, representatives believe they will likely have PTC  fully implemented by 2017 or later. In addition, while Amtrak officials  report that they anticipate full PTC implementation on their Northeast  Corridor and Michigan lines by the end of 2015, they noted it is unlikely  they will have equipped the approximately 300 locomotives that will run  on I-ETMS freight lines by the deadline. Commuter railroads generally  must wait to equip their locomotives until freight railroads and Amtrak  equip the rail lines that commuter railroads generally operate on. Four of  the seven commuter railroads we included in our review reported that  they will be unable to meet the 2015 PTC implementation deadline.", "Challenges to meeting the 2015 deadline are complex and interrelated.  For instance, many of the PTC components had not been developed  before RSIA was enacted, and some continue to be in various stages of  development. In addition, all components, once developed must be  assembled and integrated to achieve the overall safety function of PTC.  Likewise, the steps involved with implementing PTC are interrelated, with  delays or problems with one component or process resulting in additional  delays. Railroad representatives told us that once all the components  have been assembled, integrated, and tested for reliability, rolling out and  phasing in a PTC system into each railroad\u2019s network will take a  considerable amount of time. For example, Amtrak first conducted a  demonstration test of its PTC system on its Michigan line in 1996, but it  was 5 years later, in 2001, when the system was put into service.  Finally, FRA\u2019s resources and ability to help facilitate implementation by  the 2015 PTC deadline are limited. Below is a discussion of these key  interrelated challenges.", "Developing system components and PTC installation. Some PTC  components are still in development, most notably the I-ETMS back  office server. One or more of these servers will be installed in over a  dozen railroads\u2019 back offices and are needed to communicate vital  information between the back office, locomotives, and waysides.  According to AAR and the railroads, back office system delays are  due to system complexity, interfaces to other systems, and lack of  supplier resources. Nearly all of the freight railroads included in our  review anticipate they will not have a final version of the back office  system until 2014 and have identified it as one of the critical factors  preventing them from meeting the deadline. In addition to component  development, PTC installation is a time- and resource-consuming  process. For example, railroads collectively will have to install  approximately 38,000 wayside interface units. According to AAR and  freight railroads, the volume and complexity of installing these signals  is another significant reason most railroads cannot meet the 2015  deadline. Railroads have also encountered unexpected delays while  installing PTC. For example, the Federal Communications  Commission (FCC) recently requested railroads halt their construction  of radio antennae towers to allow FCC to consider how to implement  oversight of the towers being installed for PTC. According to FRA and  AAR officials, FCC requested that railroads halt construction on  antennae towers that have not gone through the environmental  evaluation process, including tribal notice, while FCC considers ways  to streamline the process. FRA officials told us they did not  anticipate this issue. AAR and FRA officials report they are working  together with FCC to find a solution that meets the goals behind the  process while still allowing for timely PTC deployment. However, the  impact of halting construction on the towers may result in additional  delays in railroads\u2019 time frames.", "System integration and field testing. Successful PTC implementation  will require numerous components to work together, many of which  are first-generation technologies being designed and developed for  PTC. All components must properly function when integrated or the  PTC system could fail. To ensure successful integration, railroads  must conduct multiple phases of testing\u2014first in a laboratory  environment, then in the field\u2014before installation across the network.  Representatives from all of the freight railroads we spoke with  expressed concern with the reliability of PTC and emphasized the  importance of field testing to ensure that the system performs the way  it is intended and that potential defects are identified, corrected, and  re-tested. One railroad representative we spoke with said that in some  field tests, the PTC system components behaved differently than in  the laboratory tests because labs do not reflect field conditions  completely. Identifying the source of these types of problems is an  iterative process; consequently, correcting the problems and re- testing can be time-consuming and potentially further contribute to  railroads not meeting the 2015 deadline.", "FRA resources. Although most railroads we spoke with said they have  worked closely with FRA throughout the PTC implementation process,  some railroads cited concerns with FRA\u2019s limited staffing resources.  These concerns focused on two of FRA\u2019s responsibilities. First, FRA  officials must verify field testing of PTC. However, FRA reported that it  lacks the staffing resources to embed a dedicated FRA inspector at  each railroad for regular, detailed, and unfiltered reporting on  railroads\u2019 PTC progress. To address the lack of staff to verify field- testing, FRA has taken an audit approach to field testing, whereby  railroads submit field test results for approval as part of their safety  plans and FRA staff select plans to evaluate the accuracy of the  results. Second, before a railroad can operate a PTC system in  revenue service, it must be FRA certified, and FRA must approve the  railroad\u2019s final safety plan. FRA set no specific deadline for railroads  to submit the safety plans, and according to FRA, to-date only one  railroad has submitted a final safety plan, which FRA has approved.  As it reported in its 2012 report to Congress, FRA\u2019s PTC staff consists  of 10 PTC specialists and 1 supervisor who are responsible for the  review and approval of all PTC final safety plans. FRA also reported  that this work covers the 37 railroads implementing PTC on over  60,000 miles of track. FRA and railroads have expressed concern that  railroads will submit their final safety plans to FRA at approximately  the same time, resulting in a potential review backlog particularly  since each plan is expected to consist of hundreds of pages of  detailed technical information. FRA officials told us that they are  dedicated to the timely approval of safety plans and that their  oversight will not impede railroads from meeting the deadline.  However, railroads report that their time frames are based on a quick  turnaround in approvals from FRA. If approvals are delayed, it could  be a further setback in railroads\u2019 PTC implementation.", "Generally commuter railroads face these same PTC implementation  challenges, as well as others. First, because commuter railroads are  using the PTC systems developed by freight railroads and Amtrak, they  are captive in many respects to the pace of developments of those  entities and have few means to influence implementation schedules.  Commuter railroads also face challenges in funding PTC implementation  due to the overall lack of federal funding available to make investments in  commuter rail and limited sources of revenue. Most commuter railroads  are non-profit, public operations that are funded by passenger fares and  contributions from federal, state, and local sources. Economic challenges  such as the recession have eroded state and local revenue sources that  traditionally supported capital expenses. In addition, according the  American Public Transportation Association (APTA), commuter railroads  face competing expenses such as state of good repair upgrades, leaving  them with limited funding to implement PTC. According to APTA,  collectively, PTC implementation will cost commuter railroads a minimum  of $2 billion. Finally, commuter railroads report that obtaining radio  frequency spectrum\u2014essential for PTC communications\u2014can be a  lengthy and difficult process. FCC directed commuter railroads to secure  spectrum on the secondary market. According to the FCC, spectrum is  available in the secondary market to meet PTC needs. While freight  railroads have secured most of the spectrum needed for PTC  implementation, commuter railroads have reported difficulty acquiring  spectrum in the 220 megahertz (MHz) band, which is required to operate  the data radios that communicate information between PTC  components. In particular, railroad representatives said that obtaining  spectrum is a critical challenge in high-density urban areas. Without  acquiring sufficient spectrum, railroads may be unable to adequately test  their PTC systems, potentially causing further delays in meeting the 2015  PTC deadline.", "By attempting to implement PTC by the 2015 deadline while key  components are still in development, railroads may be making choices  that could introduce financial and operational risks to PTC  implementation. Representatives from freight railroads and FRA officials  told us that railroads will not compromise the safety functions of the PTC  system and will ensure that systems meet the functionality requirements  in RSIA. However, freight railroad representatives told us that in order to  work towards testing and installation, they compressed time frames and  undertook processes in parallel rather than sequentially. For example, to  begin installation while key components were being developed, railroads  took a \u201cdouble touch\u201d approach to equipping locomotives, which involves  taking locomotives out of service twice to begin installation while software  was being developed. Railroad representatives told us this approach is  more expensive than installing the equipment after the software is fully  mature, as it involves more labor hours and more time that locomotives  are out of service. Our prior work on weapon systems development has  shown that technologies that were included in a product development  program before they were mature later contributed to cost increases and  schedule delays. This work showed that demonstrating a high level of  maturity before new technologies are incorporated into a product  development plan increases the chances for successful implementation.  In 2010, we reported that railroads expected key PTC components to be  available by 2012. Railroads have subsequently reported that PTC  installation has involved many delays, particularly in component  development and many of the essential components are still in  development.

Representatives from  all of the freight railroads we spoke with expressed concern regarding the  reliability of PTC and noted that adequate field testing was important to  identify and correct problems. These representatives noted that without  adequate testing, PTC systems may not perform as planned and may be  more prone to system reliability issues, possibly causing service  disruptions. FRA officials also expressed concern that if pressured to  meet the 2015 deadline, railroads might implement an unreliable PTC  system that breaks down and leads to operational inefficiencies through  slower trains or congestion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FRA\u2019s Request for Legislative Changes to Provide Additional Authority in Overseeing PTC\u2019s Implementation Could Help Manage PTC Implementation", "paragraphs": ["In an August 2012 report to Congress, FRA identified three items for  consideration in the event Congress amends RSIA. FRA officials told us  that if Congress chooses to amend RSIA, additional authority to extend  the deadline on certain rail lines, grant provisional certification of PTC  systems and approve the use of alternative safety technologies in lieu of  PTC would help them to conduct oversight more effectively by providing  FRA flexibility in overseeing PTC. Specifically FRA requested the  authority to:", "Extend the deadline on certain rail lines to grant railroads incremental  deadlines on a case-by-case basis. FRA officials told us they do not  want a deadline extension applied to the whole railroad industry.  Rather, FRA would like flexibility to create new deadlines based on an  individual railroad\u2019s circumstances, particularly a railroad\u2019s due  diligence to achieve the 2015 deadline and efforts to mitigate risks.  FRA officials said currently they are unable to approve implementation  plans that give completion dates beyond 2015. FRA officials said that  such a change would require railroads to update their implementation  plans.", "Grant provisional certification of PTC systems under controlled  conditions before final system completion to allow railroads to operate  PTC in certain places while they are still developing it in other places.  According to FRA, this would provide assurance that the PTC system  was safe, so that a railroad could begin to use the PTC system while  FRA reviewed the railroad\u2019s full safety plan. FRA and railroads told us  the benefit of this authority is that it would allow railroads and the  public to experience the safety benefits of PTC sooner. FRA officials  said they believed this would provide railroads with additional time to  address issues and would lead to the implementation of a more  reliable system.", "Approve the use of alternative safety technologies in lieu of PTC to  allow railroads to improve safety and meet many of the functions of  PTC through other means. FRA officials told us that they would  anticipate using this authority only for commuter and some smaller  railroads and would consider technologies in combination with  operating rules that railroads demonstrate would enhance safety.", "Although some freight railroad representatives we spoke with supported  providing FRA with additional authority, others voiced concerns about  how the authorities would be administered. For example, details such as  how FRA will identify and apply criteria to determine which railroads  should receive extensions would need to be addressed. In addition, one  freight railroad representative raised concerns over timeliness of FRA\u2019s  determinations of deadline extensions. Furthermore, representatives from  another railroad suggested that granting deadline extensions to some  railroads unfairly penalizes those railroads that may meet the PTC  deadline. FRA could not provide us with specific information detailing how  these authorities would be applied. However, if Congress were to amend  RSIA in order to provide FRA additional authorities in implementing PTC,  the Secretary of Transportation would need to direct FRA to develop new  regulations or orders, in order to carry out its duties.", "At a June 2013 hearing on rail safety, AAR and APTA stated their support  for FRA\u2019s request for additional authority and extending the PTC  implementation deadline to December 31, 2018, for all railroads. In  addition, FRA recommended the Secretary of Transportation be given the  authority to grant railroads extensions beyond a December 2018  deadline. In particular, AAR stated its support for FRA\u2019s request for  flexibility to extend the deadline and previously noted that FRA\u2019s request  to provide provisional certification of PTC systems could reduce delays.  According to AAR, these authorities could provide some relief to railroads  experiencing challenges meeting the deadline. APTA, representing  commuter railroads, also supported FRA\u2019s request for additional authority  and specifically stated its support that FRA be allowed to consider  alternative technologies in lieu of a PTC system on specified line  segments. According to APTA\u2019s testimony statement, some commuter  railroads already have collision avoidance systems in place that protect  against train-to-train collisions. According to APTA, allowing FRA to  examine the feasibility of alternative technologies to PTC for some of the  smaller railroads on a line-by-line basis could provide opportunities to free  up PTC components for other railroads to expedite their PTC  implementation.", "While an extension of the PTC implementation deadline may provide  railroads with additional time to implement PTC, it is not clear that all  railroads would be able to meet a revised December 31, 2018 deadline  proposed by AAR and APTA. For example, AAR\u2019s May 2013 report  predicts that, while PTC could be in operation on most mandated PTC  routes by December 31, 2018, the date PTC will be in operation on all  routes would vary by railroad. One freight railroad we spoke to anticipated  it would not be able to fully implement PTC until 2020. In addition, given  that many commuter railroads are waiting for freight railroads to develop  and implement PTC, many commuter railroads will likely have PTC fully  installed after the freight railroads. Furthermore, in a hearing statement,  AAR recommended flexibility beyond December 2018 due to the  unprecedented nature of PTC and the uncertainties \u2014 both known and  unknown\u2014of implementation.", "Given the uncertainties in implementing PTC and the unexpected delays  already encountered, additional challenges could prevent railroads from  meeting a new deadline. However, FRA\u2019s request for additional authority  could provide railroads the flexibility to implement PTC on individual,  case-by-case deadlines, either instead of or in addition to an overall  deadline extension. Additional authority could also assist FRA in  managing its limited staff resources and help railroads mitigate risks and  ensure PTC is implemented in a safe and reliable manner. For example,  although at the June 2013 rail safety hearing concerns were raised that  providing railroads deadline extensions on a case-by-case basis would be  resource-intensive and could provide additional challenges and delays,  we found that railroads were at various stages in their implementation.  Flexibility in extending the deadline for certain railroads acknowledges  these differences and also may help FRA better manage limited  resources by, for example, preventing a potential review backlog resulting  from final safety plans being submitted at the same time\u2014a concern  raised by freight railroads and FRA. In addition, according to FRA,  allowing provisional certification of PTC systems not only helps to  manage limited resources, it also reflects good engineering practice in  implementing wide-ranging, complex systems and is a well documented  risk mitigation strategy.

Specifically, we compared FRA\u2019s regulatory impact analyses  with key elements of OMB guidelines, including establishing a baseline,  considering alternatives, analyzing uncertainty and quantifying key  categories of costs and benefits. We identified some limitations in the  analyses, for example, analyses are not comprehensive in some respects  and the source and quality of some of the underlying data is unclear.  According to FRA officials, the limitations in its analysis and data do not  affect the primary outcome of the analysis\u2014 that total costs are expected  to exceed total safety benefits (i.e., that there are negative net societal  benefits). Based on our review, we also believe the limitations we  identified were not significant enough to affect FRA\u2019s general  determination that PTC\u2019s implementation costs outweigh benefits. (See  app. II for more detail on our assessment of FRA\u2019s regulatory impact  analyses and findings.)", "The PTC mandate limited the flexibility and time available to FRA to  develop a rule and analyze its economic impacts; nonetheless, more  thorough analyses and better quality data could have made the benefit  cost analysis more useful in discussions of PTC implementation. FRA\u2019s  PTC rulemaking was initiated to implement PTC, as required by RSIA.  Specifically, RSIA mandated the installation of a PTC system, which can  achieve certain safety benefits, and specified the system\u2019s functional  requirements and the 2015 implementation deadline. FRA had little  latitude to implement other, non-PTC alternatives that may have been  less costly to achieve the same safety benefits. In addition, FRA officials  told us that because the PTC rulemaking process was expedited, they  had to use the information that was available to them at the time to  conduct their analysis. However, we found that some information was up  to 10 years old and the quality of some of the underlying data was  unclear. Finally, FRA excluded business benefits from its estimates,  instead opting to include a discussion of potential business benefits in an  appendix to its analysis. FRA officials said that they excluded business  benefits from their analysis due to uncertainty about whether and when  business benefits could be achieved. While we found this decision was  appropriate, we found limitations to the discussion of business benefits.  For example, FRA assumed that railroads would achieve business  benefits associated with a standalone PTC system, but did not include  supporting evidence that railroads would likely install such a system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PTC Alone Is Unlikely to Generate Business Benefits, but Opportunities Might Exist to Pursue Business Benefits over Time and with Additional Investment", "paragraphs": ["Although an overlay PTC system alone is not expected to generate  business benefits, over time and with additional investments, there may  be opportunities for railroads to achieve some business benefits. PTC  implementation involves upgrades that railroads could integrate with  existing technologies to provide operational enhancements. As previously  discussed, railroads are making substantial investments in their rail  network infrastructure to implement PTC. These investments include (1)  upgrading existing wayside and office subsystem components; (2)  installing a new communication infrastructure to facilitate the  communication of train speed, train location, work zone and switch  information; (3) and developing detailed geographical information  systems (GIS) mappings of an entire rail network. The first two  investments can help to generate information that can be shared with  other applications, such as train dispatching software and energy  management systems to potentially produce business benefits while the  detailed GIS mapping can be used to support a railroad\u2019s state of good  repair.", "More specific train location and speed data for use in other applications  such as precision dispatching could help to improve train dispatching,  potentially increasing network capacity.  The PTC overlay systems  railroads are installing require changes to most dispatching systems to  account for more precise train location information. For example,  according to AAR and FRA, most railroad dispatching systems, which  currently require location information within one-tenth of a mile, are being  upgraded as part of PTC to require location information of up to a ten- thousandth of a mile. According to a freight railroad representative we  spoke to, using the more detailed train location information from PTC  could help dispatchers better prioritize train movements based on a train\u2019s  delivery schedule and better manage \u201cmeet and pass\u201d operations (when  two trains approach each other on a single track). PTC, however, is not a  prerequisite for precision dispatching. For example, one freight railroad  representative told us that their railroad is already using alternative  means independent of PTC to enable real-time train position reporting to  improve dispatching. Nonetheless, the PTC system that is being installed  is also expected to provide this information. In addition, according to a  supplier we included in our review, PTC could enable development of  additional features, such as precision dispatching. Representatives from  another supplier we spoke with said they anticipate that railroads will use  PTC-generated train location information for improved dispatching in the  future after the initial rollout of PTC.", "PTC-generated information and data also could help railroads achieve  greater fuel savings than they are currently achieving with their energy  management systems. An energy management system is an on-board  technology that uses a variety of information, including train location and  track elevation and curvature, to calculate a train\u2019s most fuel efficient run  and make throttle and braking recommendations to the operator to  minimize a train\u2019s consumption of fuel. PTC can generate information  that could assist energy management systems in two ways. First, PTC  systems are being designed to enforce compliance with safety  parameters, such as speed restrictions, that trains encounter when  traveling from origin to destination. According to an energy management  system supplier and freight railroad representatives we spoke with, these  parameters could be used to make train movement calculations based on  the PTC safety parameters governing the route, which is information  currently unavailable to such systems. Second, railroads are developing  more detailed mapping of their rail networks, including its critical features  such as signals and switches and putting this information into a track  database as part of PTC implementation. According to an energy  management system supplier we spoke with, this more precise  information, which is needed for the PTC system to calculate train safety  stopping distances could enhance railroads\u2019 existing fuel-management  systems\u2019 performance through more accurate information on track  features.", "Representatives from all of the freight railroads we spoke with reported  already achieving fuel savings through energy management systems but  noted that there may be potential for additional savings by integrating  these systems with these PTC components. For example, one freight  railroad representative reported that the railroad\u2019s energy management  system currently provides annual fuel savings of 4 to 6 percent, but that  integrating the system with PTC could lead to an additional 1 to 2 percent  in fuel savings.", "Freight railroad officials we spoke with generally expressed interest in  pursuing PTC-related business benefits, but noted they are currently  focused on installing PTC and are devoting their time and resources to  that effort. For example, one freight railroad representative told us the  railroad has not had time to fully think through how to achieve business  benefits using the PTC system since all resources are currently focused  on implementing PTC and noted that these benefits were incremental and could likely be achieved outside of PTC. However, railroad  representatives from the four freight railroads we spoke with said they  would explore ways to leverage the safety investment they are making in  PTC to obtain additional business benefits once the PTC system is fully  implemented and operating. These railroads emphasized that pursuing  business benefits will involve additional investments beyond their current  investments in PTC installation.", "Nevertheless, railroad representatives also identified a number of  concerns about attempting to achieve business benefits through PTC  systems. First, some business benefits are already being achieved  through existing technologies. Second, the potential for significant PTC  business benefits is still not clear. For example, according to one railroad  representative, despite his railroad\u2019s long history with PTC, it is still  unsure of the potential for PTC to achieve business benefits. PTC is a  new technology, and system components are still being developed. After  the safety functionalities of the system have been tested and deployed,  representatives will be able to determine what additional functionality  (e.g., operational efficiencies) can be achieved through PTC  implementation. In addition, additional functionalities to achieve PTC  business benefits must be done in a way that would not compromise the  system\u2019s underlying safety functions. FRA officials told us that when  integrating PTC with other systems to achieve business benefits,  railroads must be careful not to compromise the integrity of PTC system\u2019s  underlying safety functions. According to a PTC supplier, delaying the  introduction of any business benefit features to the PTC system may help  railroads avoid complicating the initial deployment of PTC.
