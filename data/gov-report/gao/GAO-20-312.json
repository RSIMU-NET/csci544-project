While DOD had improved coordination  across the combatant commands and Joint Chiefs of Staff, Congress was  concerned that the department was continuing to face organizational and  management challenges among the military departments and within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense. In particular, DOD\u2019s military  departments and functional organizations were not always working well  together to accomplish departmental objectives.", "Section 911 of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2017 directed the Secretary of  Defense to, among other things:  formulate and issue an organizational strategy for DOD that identifies  the critical objectives and other organizational outputs that span  multiple functional boundaries and would benefit from the use of  cross-functional teams to ensure collaboration and integration across  the department; establish cross-functional teams that, among other things, address the  critical objectives and outputs outlined in the department\u2019s  organizational strategy;  issue guidance on cross-functional teams and provide training to  members of those established teams and their supervisors on  elements of successful cross-functional teams; and provide training on leadership, modern organizational practice,  collaboration, and the operation of cross-functional teams to  individuals who have been appointed by the President and confirmed  by the Senate to a position within the Office of the Secretary of  Defense, or request waivers from this requirement.", "The John S. McCain NDAA for Fiscal Year 2019 subsequently introduced  new requirements on DOD\u2019s implementation of section 911.

As of  our August 2019 report, DOD had established two cross-functional teams  under section 911: the Electromagnetic Spectrum Operations (EMSO)  cross-functional team, which was formed in February 2019, and one that  has since been disestablished. The disestablished team had been responsible for managing the transfer of background investigations for  certain DOD personnel from the Office of Personnel Management to  DOD. Because those responsibilities were transferred to a newly created  Personnel Vetting Transformation Office within DOD, department officials  made the decision to disestablish the team. The team was disestablished  as of January 2019.

We also reported that DOD had  established its cross-functional team on EMSO, but that funding for the  team was delayed in part because of disagreements over responsibility  for funding the team. We recommended, and DOD concurred, that the  Secretary of Defense ensure that the CMO meets specific internal  deadlines for review and approval of outstanding requirements of section  911, and that DOD clarify roles and responsibilities for providing funding  for the EMSO cross-functional team.

We found that the strategy  addresses key requirements of section 911, including identifying critical  objectives that would benefit from the use of cross-functional teams and  providing for the appropriate use of these teams. As part of the  organizational strategy, DOD also identified the actions it has taken to  streamline the organizational structure and processes of the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, another requirement of section 911. For example,  the strategy states that DOD has delegated authority to approve certain  global force management actions to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  Staff and delegated certain acquisition oversight functions to the military  departments. Further, consistent with our recommendation from our  February 2018 report that the CMO address how the department will  promote and achieve a collaborative culture, the organizational strategy  includes a short reference to our leading practices for mergers and  organizational transformations.", "However, while the approved organizational strategy cites the leading  practices, it does not include specific implementation steps that explain  how DOD will follow these practices. Earlier drafts of the organizational  strategy that we had reviewed included more specific implementation  steps, but those steps were removed during the internal DOD review  process. As we reported in August 2019, a January 2019 draft of the  organizational strategy included practical implementation steps DOD  planned to take to advance a collaborative culture, each of which were  shown to align with our leading practices for mergers and organizational  transformations. For example, consistent with the leading practice for  establishing a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide  the transformation, the January 2019 draft proposed that the CMO  develop an implementation plan with goals and milestones for its efforts  to implement the organizational strategy, communicate those goals and  milestones, and report periodically on the achievement of the goals.  However, in place of these specific steps, the approved organizational  strategy simply lists these leading practices and makes a broad statement  that DOD is committed to further incorporating and institutionalizing these  practices at every opportunity.", "An OCMO official told us these implementation steps were removed as  the OCMO prepared the draft for department-wide coordination and  submission to the Secretary of Defense for review and approval.  According to that official, OCMO officials made this change because the  Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Defense were newly confirmed, and  OCMO officials did not want to commit them to a specific course of action.  That official also told us that DOD might use its senior leadership forums,  such as the Deputy\u2019s Management Action Group (DMAG), to monitor  implementation of the organizational strategy and identify opportunities to  improve collaboration, including implementation of our leading practices.", "However, the official acknowledged that any plan to use such forums for  monitoring implementation has not been finalized.", "As we stated in making our February 2018 recommendation that the  department address how it would promote and achieve a collaborative  culture, section 911 identified several outcomes that DOD should achieve  to advance such a culture. We also noted that DOD could use our  leading practices for mergers and organizational transformations to  address how the department will advance a culture that is collaborative,  team-oriented, results-driven, and innovative. We further stated that DOD  would be better positioned to transform and meet its mission if it  incorporated these leading practices in its organizational strategy as a  way to better articulate how the department will achieve the outcomes  that advance a collaborative culture across DOD and address the  requirements of section 911.", "Specific implementation steps like those included in earlier drafts of the  organizational strategy offered the department a clear path forward for  pursuing the goals of section 911 and promoting a collaborative culture.
