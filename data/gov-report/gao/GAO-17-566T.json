For example, in response to the 2008 Act, SBA appointed an official to head the disaster planning office and annually updates its disaster response plan. SBA also implemented provisions relating to marketing and outreach; augmenting infrastructure, information technology, and staff; and increasing access to funds for nonprofits, among other areas. However, SBA has not yet implemented provisions to establish three guaranteed loan programs. In 2010, SBA received an appropriation to pilot one program and performed initial outreach to lenders. However, in 2014, GAO found that SBA had not implemented the programs or conducted a pilot because of concerns from lenders about loan features. GAO recommended that SBA evaluate lender feedback and report to Congress about implementation challenges. In response, SBA sought comments from lenders and sent a letter to Congress that explained remaining implementation challenges.", "After Hurricane Sandy, SBA further enhanced its planning for disaster response, including processing of loan applications. In a 2014 report on the Disaster Loan Program, GAO found that while SBA encouraged electronic submissions of loan applications, SBA did not expect early receipt of a high volume of applications after Sandy and delayed increasing staffing. SBA also did not update key disaster planning documents to adjust for the effects of such a surge in future disasters. GAO recommended SBA revise its disaster planning documents to anticipate the potential impact of early application submissions on staffing and resources. In response, SBA updated its planning documents to account for such impacts.", "SBA has taken some actions to enhance information resources for business loan applicants but could do more to improve its presentation of online disaster loan-related information. In 2016, GAO found that SBA took or planned to take various actions to improve the disaster loan program and focused on promoting disaster preparedness, streamlining the loan process, and enhancing online application capabilities. However, GAO found that SBA had not effectively presented information on disaster loans (in a way that would help users efficiently find it), had not consistently described key features and requirements of the loan process in print and online resources, or clearly defined financial terminology used in loan applications. Absent better integration of, and streamlined access to, disaster loan-related information, loan applicants may not be aware of key information and requirements for completing the applications. Therefore, GAO recommended that SBA (1) integrate disaster loan-related information into its web portals to be more accessible to users, (2) ensure consistency of content about the disaster loan process across information resources, and (3) better define financial terminology used in the loan application forms. In January 2017, SBA indicated it was working on a glossary for the application.

Applicants for physical  disaster loans have 60 days from the date of disaster declaration to apply  for the loan and applicants for the economic injury disaster loan  applicants have 9 months. Disaster victims may apply for a disaster  business loan through the disaster loan assistance web portal or by paper  submission.

In 2012, SBA completed a marketing and outreach  plan that included strategies for identifying regional stakeholders  (including SBDCs, local emergency management agencies, and other  local groups such as business and civic organizations) and identifying  regional disaster risks. SBA\u2019s plan stated that it would (1) develop  webinars for specific regional risks and promote these before the  traditional start of the season for certain types of disasters such as  hurricanes; and (2) establish a recurring schedule for outreach with  stakeholders when no disaster is occurring. Furthermore, the most  recent Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan from 2016 outlines  specific responsibilities for conducting region-specific marketing and  outreach through SBA resource partners and others before a disaster  as well as plans for scaling communications based on the severity of  the disaster. (See below for more information about SBA\u2019s Disaster  Preparedness and Recovery Plan.)", "Section 12073 states that SBA must assign an individual with  significant knowledge of, and substantial experience in, disaster  readiness and planning, emergency response, maintaining a disaster  response plan, and coordinating training exercises. In June 2008,  SBA appointed an official to head the agency\u2019s newly created  Executive Office of Disaster Strategic Planning and Operations. SBA  officials recently told us that the planning office, now named the Office  of Disaster Planning and Risk Management, is under the office of the  Chief Operating Officer. Although the organizational structure  changed, the role of the director remains the same: to coordinate the  efforts of other offices within SBA to execute disaster recovery as  directed by the Administrator. Among the director\u2019s responsibilities are  to create, maintain, and implement the comprehensive disaster  preparedness and recovery plan, and coordinate and direct SBA  training exercises relating to disasters, including simulations and  exercises coordinated with other government departments and  agencies.", "Section 12075 states that SBA must develop, implement, or maintain  a comprehensive written disaster response plan and update the plan  annually. SBA issued a disaster response plan in November 2009 and  the agency has continued to develop, implement, and revise the  written disaster plan every year since then. The plan, now titled the  Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan, outlines issues such as  disaster responsibilities of SBA offices, SBA\u2019s disaster staffing  strategy, and plans to scale disaster loan-making operations. The plan  is made available to all SBA staff as well as to the public through  SBA\u2019s website.", "SBA has taken actions to fully address other provisions, such as those  relating to augmenting infrastructure, information technology and staff as  well as improving disaster lending. For example, to improve its  infrastructure, information technology, and staff, SBA put in place a  secondary facility in Sacramento, California, to process loans during  times when the main facility in Fort Worth, Texas, is unavailable. SBA  also improved its Disaster Credit Management System, which the agency  uses to process loan applications and make determinations for its  disaster loan program, by increasing the number of concurrent users that  can access it.

SBA  requested funding for the two programs in the President\u2019s budget for  fiscal year 2010 and received subsidy and administrative cost funding of  $3 million in the 2010 appropriation, which would have allowed the  agency to pilot about 600 loans under IDAP. SBA officials also told us  that they performed initial outreach to lenders to obtain reactions to and  interest in the programs. They believed such outreach would help SBA  identify and address issues and determine the viability of the programs. In  May 2010, SBA told us its goal was to have the pilot for IDAP in place by  September 2010. Furthermore, the agency issued regulations for IDAP in  October 2010.", "In 2014, we reported on the Disaster Loan Program (following Hurricane  Sandy) and found that SBA had yet to pilot or implement the three  programs for guaranteed disaster loans. In July 2014, SBA officials told  us that the agency still was planning to conduct the IDAP pilot. However,  based on lender feedback, SBA officials said that the statutory  requirements, such as the 10-year loan, made a product like IDAP  undesirable and lenders were unwilling to participate unless the loan term  was decreased to 5 or 7 years. Congressional action would be required to  revise statutory requirements, but SBA officials said they had not  discussed the lender feedback with Congress. SBA officials also told us  the agency planned to use IDAP as a guide to develop EDALP and  PDAP, and until challenges with IDAP were resolved, it did not plan to  implement these two programs. As a result of not documenting,  analyzing, or communicating lender feedback, SBA risked not having  reliable information\u2014both to guide its own actions and to share with  Congress\u2014on what requirements should be revised to encourage lender  participation. Federal internal control standards state that significant  events should be promptly recorded to maintain their relevance and value  to management in controlling operations and making decisions.", "We concluded that not sharing information with Congress on challenges  to implementing IDAP might perpetuate the difficulties SBA faced in  implementing these programs, which were intended to provide assistance  to disaster victims. Therefore, we recommended that SBA conduct a  formal documented evaluation of lenders\u2019 feedback on implementation  challenges and statutory changes that might be necessary to encourage  lenders\u2019 participation in IDAP, and then report to Congress on these  topics.", "In response to our recommendations, SBA issued an Advance Notice of  Proposed Rulemaking in October 2015 to seek comments on the three  guaranteed loan programs. In July 2016, SBA sent a letter to the Ranking  Member of the House Committee on Small Business that discussed how  the agency evaluated feedback on the three programs and explained the  remaining challenges to address the statutory provisions for the three  programs. Based on this action, we closed the recommendations for SBA  to develop an implementation plan, formally evaluate lender feedback,  and report to Congress on implementation challenges.

In 2014, we found that after Hurricane Sandy, SBA did  not meet its goal to process business loan applications (21 days from  receipt to loan decision). SBA took an average of 45 days for physical  disaster loan applications and 38 days for economic injury applications.  According to SBA, the agency received a large volume of electronic  applications within a few days of the disaster. While SBA created web- based loan applications to expedite the process and encouraged their  use, the agency noted that it did not expect early receipt of such a high  volume of loan applications early in its response and delayed increasing  staffing.", "At the time of our 2014 report, SBA also had not updated its key disaster  planning documents\u2014the Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan and  the Disaster Playbook\u2014to adjust for the effects a large-volume, early  surge in applications could have on staffing, resources, and forecasting  models for future disasters. According to SBA\u2019s Disaster Preparedness  and Recovery Plan, the primary goals of forecasting and modeling are to  predict application volume and application receipt as accurately as  possible. Federal internal control standards state that management  should identify risk (with methods that can include forecasting and  strategic planning) and then analyze the risks for their possible effect.", "Without taking its experience with early application submissions after  Hurricane Sandy into account, SBA risked being unprepared for such a  situation in future disaster responses, potentially resulting in delays in  disbursing loan funds to disaster victims. We therefore recommended that  SBA revise its disaster planning documents to anticipate the potential  impact of early application submissions on staffing, resources, and timely  disaster response.", "In response to our recommendation, SBA updated its key disaster  planning documents, including the Disaster Preparedness and Recovery  Plan and Disaster Playbook, to reflect the impact of early application  submissions on staffing for future disasters. For example, the documents  note that the introduction of the electronic loan application increased the  intake of applications soon after disasters. SBA received 83 percent of  applications electronically in fiscal year 2015 and 90 percent in 2016. The  documents also note that the electronic loan application has reduced the  time available to achieve maximum required staffing and that SBA has  revised its internal resource requirements model for future disasters to  activate staff earlier based on the receipt of applications earlier in the  process.
