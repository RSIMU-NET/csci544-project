The military departments were requested to follow an approach similar to the one used in responding to previously mandated congressional reporting requirements. The military departments and the Defense Logistics Agency developed summary workload distribution reports for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) based on financial information contained in readily available budget data.

In addition, DOD\u2019s data showed that it provided an additional $706 million for work acquired from the private sector through interim contractor support (ICS) and contractor logistics support (CLS) contracts. At the time of our review, the law did not specifically state whether such contractor-provided maintenance should be considered in 60/40 calculations.

In September 1997, the Air Force announced that Warner Robins Air Logistics Center won a public-private competition for the C-5 aircraft depot-level workload. Should the private sector win the remaining competitions, DOD data shows that its share will only exceed 40-percent when ICS and CLS costs are included.", "The percentage of public and private sector depot maintenance work reported by the military departments for fiscal years 1996 through 2002 and the potential impact of including ICS and CLS funding in the private sector workload distribution are shown in table 1.

However, some military department officials responsible for workload allocation data collection told us that OSD had advised them to include such work in quantifying the portion of depot funds provided to the public sector but suggested excluding similar funding from the private sector workload quantification. The military departments spend over a billion dollars annually to install modification kits to upgrade and modernize existing weapon systems in the private sector.", "Due to the ad hoc nature of the data collection process, each of the military departments treated modification, conversion, and upgrade projects differently. For example, the Air Force and the Naval Air Systems Command included funding for installing modification kits provided through procurement appropriations in their quantifications of both the public and private sector workload allocations, while the Naval Sea Systems Command for fleet modernization programs included such funding in public sector expenditures but excluded them for programs performed by private sector activities. The Army excluded such funding for modification programs accomplished by both public and private sector activities.", "Adding the funding for teardown, overhaul, repair, and installation of modification and conversion kits in the Army\u2019s workload mix calculations could show as much as 60 percent of the available fiscal year 1996 depot maintenance funding going to the private sector, rather than the  32 percent the Army reported. For example, audit work being conducted by the Army Audit Agency shows that funding for installing modification and upgrade hardware on two major modification efforts\u2014the M1 Abrams upgrade and Apache Longbow conversion programs\u2014could total more than $700 million in fiscal year 1996, with most work being done by private sector activities.", "Army program officials told us they excluded funding for teardown, overhaul, and repair work involved with modification and conversion programs from 60/40 reporting because (1) they interpreted the 60/40 statute to only address work funded by the operations and maintenance appropriation and (2) OSD data collection guidelines specifically state that modification and conversion work was to be considered  \u201cnon-maintenance\u201d work for purposes of 60/40 reporting.
