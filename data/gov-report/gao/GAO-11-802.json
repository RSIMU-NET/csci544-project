Over decades, federal agencies and watershed states have entered into several agreements to restore the bay, but its health remains impaired. In May 2009, Executive Order 13508 established a Federal Leadership Committee, led by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and directed the committee to issue a strategy by May 2010 to protect and restore the Chesapeake Bay (the Strategy). GAO was directed by the explanatory statement of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, to conduct performance assessments of progress made on bay restoration, and this first assessment examines (1) the extent to which the Strategy includes measurable goals for restoring the bay that are shared by stakeholders and actions to attain these goals; (2) the key factors, if any, federal and state officials identified that may reduce the likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions; and (3) agency plans for assessing progress made in implementing the Strategy and restoring bay health. GAO reviewed the Strategy, surveyed federal officials, and interviewed watershed state officials and subject matter experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Strategy for Protecting and Restoring the Chesapeake Bay Watershed includes 4 broad goals, 12 specific measurable goals with deadlines, and 116 actions to restore the bay by 2025. To achieve the broad and measurable goals, federal agencies, often in collaboration with the watershed states and other entities, are responsible for accomplishing the actions. However, not all stakeholders are working toward achieving the Strategy goals. The watershed states are critical partners in the effort to restore the bay, but state officials told GAO that they are not working toward the Strategy goals, in part because they view the Strategy as a federal document. Instead, most state bay restoration work is conducted according to state commitments made in a previous bay restoration agreement, the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. Even though Strategy and Chesapeake 2000 Agreement goals are similar to some degree, they also differ in some ways. For example, both call for managing fish species, but the Strategy identifies brook trout as a key species for restoration and the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement does not. Federal and state officials said it is critical that all stakeholders work toward the same goals. The Federal Leadership Committee and the Chesapeake Bay Program--a restoration group established in 1983 that includes federal agencies and watershed states--created an action team in June 2010 to work toward aligning bay restoration goals. Officials from the 11 agencies responsible for the Strategy that GAO surveyed identified three key factors that may reduce the likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions: a potential lack of collaboration among stakeholders; funding constraints; and external phenomena, such as climate change. State officials and subject matter experts that GAO interviewed raised similar concerns. Federal officials reported that some form of collaboration is needed to accomplish the Strategy's measurable goals and the vast majority of its actions. In particular, federal-state collaboration is crucial, with federal officials indicating that collaboration with at least one state is necessary to accomplish 96 of the 116 actions in the 12 measurable goals. Federal officials also reported that funding constraints could reduce the likelihood of accomplishing 69 of the actions in 11 of the measurable goals. Furthermore, federal officials reported that external phenomena could reduce the likelihood that 8 of the measurable goals will be achieved. The federal agencies have plans for assessing progress made in implementing the Strategy and restoring bay health, but these plans are limited or not fully developed, and it is unclear what indicators will be used to assess bay health. Per the Strategy, the agencies plan to create 2-year milestones for measuring progress made toward the measurable goals, with the first milestones covering 2012 and 2013. However, establishing milestones for an entire effort can improve the chances the effort can be accomplished efficiently and on time. Also, the Strategy states that the Federal Leadership Committee will develop a process for implementing adaptive management--in which agencies evaluate the impacts of restoration efforts and use the results to adjust future actions--but agency officials told GAO they are still developing this process. Moreover, there are now two groups that plan to assess bay health. The Strategy calls for the Federal Leadership Committee to coordinate with the watershed states to align these assessments. However, the status of this alignment is unclear, and if these groups use different indicators to assess bay health, confusion could result about the overall message of progress made."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that EPA work with federal and state stakeholders to develop common goals and clarify plans for assessing progress."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Chesapeake Bay is the nation\u2019s largest estuary, and its watershed  spans 64,000 square miles across six states\u2014Delaware, Maryland, New  York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia\u2014and the District of  Columbia, which we collectively refer to as watershed states. The bay  provides habitat for a wide variety of animals and plants and supports  local and regional economies. However, concerns about the bay\u2019s overall  health surfaced as early as the 1930s, and signs of deterioration\u2014 declines in water clarity, dwindling oyster populations, and degraded  habitat\u2014became even more apparent in the 1950s and 1960s. In the  1970s and early 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)  found that the primary causes for the decline in the bay\u2019s condition were  excess nutrients from agriculture, such as nitrogen and phosphorus;  population growth; and discharges from sewage treatment plants. More  recently, a 2009 bay health assessment found that despite small  improvements in certain areas, the bay continues to have poor water  quality, low populations of many fish and shellfish species, and degraded  habitats.", "Responding to public outcry about the degraded state of the bay, EPA  and several watershed states first entered into an agreement in 1983 to  restore and protect the bay. Through this agreement, these states and  EPA began to work together as the Chesapeake Bay Program, a  partnership that directs and conducts the restoration of the bay at the  federal, state, and local levels, and also includes academic institutions  and nonprofit organizations. Since then, EPA and several watershed  states have entered into additional bay restoration agreements. The most  recent agreement, Chesapeake 2000, set out an agenda and goals to  guide restoration and protection efforts from 2000 through 2010 and  beyond, and each of the watershed states made commitments to it.  However, in October 2005, we reported that the success of the  restoration effort had been undermined, in part by the lack of a  comprehensive, coordinated implementation strategy and integrated  approaches to measure overall progress. We recommended that EPA  should, among other things, work with the Bay Program to develop an  overall, coordinated implementation strategy and develop and implement  an integrated approach to assess overall restoration progress.  Subsequently, the explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2008, directed EPA, as the lead federal agency in the  Bay Program, to immediately implement all of our recommendations and  to develop a Chesapeake Bay action plan for the remaining years of the  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. In response, the Bay Program submitted  a report to Congress describing the steps it took to implement our  recommendations. We testified in July 2008 that the Bay Program had  taken positive steps, such as identifying key indicators for measuring bay  health and restoration progress, to improve the coordination and  management of the restoration effort, but that additional actions were  needed.", "In May 2009, the administration stated that, despite decades of efforts by  federal agencies, state and local governments, and other interested  parties, bay restoration was not expected for many years. As a result, the  President issued Executive Order 13508 to take further actions to restore  and protect the bay. The executive order established a Federal  Leadership Committee to oversee the development and coordination of  federal restoration programs and activities and called for the development  by May 2010 of a strategy to protect and restore the bay. The Federal  Leadership Committee is chaired by the EPA Administrator, and includes  senior representatives from the U.S. Departments of Agriculture,  Commerce, Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, and  Transportation. The executive order noted that although the federal  government should assume a strong leadership role in the restoration of  the bay, success depends on a collaborative effort involving each  watershed state, local governments, and other organizations. The order  stated that the committee shall consult extensively with the watershed  states in the development of the strategy to ensure that federal actions  are closely coordinated with actions by state and local agencies and that  resources; authorities; and expertise of federal, state, and local agencies  are used as efficiently as possible. The committee issued the Strategy for  Protecting and Restoring the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (the Strategy)  in May 2010.", "The explanatory statement accompanying the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2008, directed EPA to develop a Chesapeake Bay  action plan and GAO to conduct periodic performance assessments of  progress made on this plan. Because EPA officials told us that the  Strategy is the current plan to restore the bay, as agreed with your  offices, this first performance assessment in response to the mandate  focuses on the Strategy. This report examines (1) the extent to which the  Strategy includes measurable goals for restoring the Chesapeake Bay  that are shared by stakeholders and actions to attain these goals; (2) the  key factors, if any, federal and state officials identified that may reduce  the likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions; and (3) agency  plans for assessing progress made in implementing the Strategy and  restoring bay health.", "To determine the extent to which the Strategy includes measurable goals  for restoring the Chesapeake Bay that are shared by stakeholders and  actions to attain these goals, we reviewed the Strategy to understand its  structure and identify goals and actions. For the actions, we focused on  the 116 actions that are designed to lead directly to the Strategy\u2019s goals.  We also reviewed previous bay restoration agreements, such as  Chesapeake 2000, to identify previous bay restoration goals. In addition,  we interviewed federal and watershed state officials and representatives  of organizations involved with bay restoration to gain an understanding of  the Strategy and bay restoration efforts. To examine the key factors  federal and state officials identified that may reduce the likelihood of  achieving Strategy goals and actions, we conducted an electronic survey  of the 11 federal agencies responsible for creating and implementing the  Strategy: EPA; the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Forest Service and  Natural Resources Conservation Service; the Department of Commerce\u2019s  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration; the Department of  Defense\u2019s Navy and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers; the Department of  Homeland Security; the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife  Service, National Park Service, and U.S. Geological Survey; and the  Department of Transportation. In addition, we interviewed officials from  each watershed state to obtain their views on factors that could reduce  the likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions. We also  interviewed a nonprobability sample of members of academia with bay- related subject matter expertise. Because we used a nonprobability  sample, the information obtained from these interviews is not  generalizable to other members of academia with bay-related expertise.  However, these interviews provided us with information on these  individuals\u2019 views on the attainability of the Strategy\u2019s measurable goals.  We selected these experts primarily through GAO\u2019s prior Chesapeake  Bay work. To examine what plans are in place to assess progress made  in implementing the Strategy and restoring the bay, we reviewed the  Strategy and Strategy-related assessment documents and interviewed  federal officials. A complete description of our scope and methodology is  in appendix I. The questions from our electronic survey of federal agency  officials are available in appendix II.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2010 to September  2011 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Chesapeake Bay is the nation\u2019s largest estuary, measuring nearly  200 miles long and 35 miles wide at its widest point. The bay\u2019s watershed  covers 64,000 square miles and, as shown in figure 1, spans parts of six  states\u2014Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West  Virginia\u2014and the District of Columbia. The Chesapeake Bay tributaries  and watershed make up one of the most biologically productive systems  in the world, with more than 3,600 species of plants, fish, and wildlife. The  ecosystem also provides a variety of benefits to the almost 17 million  people who live in the watershed, such as protecting drinking water,  minimizing erosion and flood events related to stormwater runoff, and  numerous recreational opportunities.", "Over time, however, the bay\u2019s ecosystem has deteriorated. As mentioned  previously, water quality has deteriorated primarily because of excess  amounts of nutrients entering the bay, which lead to the damage of  animal and plant populations. According to a 2010 EPA bay document,  the single largest source of these pollutants is agricultural runoff. In  addition, population growth and development have further stressed the  ecosystem. The population of the bay watershed has doubled since  1950, adding approximately 1.5 million people every decade, and is  expected to approach 20 million by 2030. With this population increase,  open spaces are being paved and developed, creating hardened surfaces  that send an increasing amount of polluted stormwater into the bay and  its rivers. Furthermore, sediment in the bay, stemming in part from  agriculture and urban lands, has had harmful effects on the bay and its  watershed, such as preventing light from penetrating to the leaves and  stems of underwater grasses that provide habitat and stability to the bay.", "The deterioration of the bay\u2019s ecosystem has been the cause for a great  deal of public and political attention. Efforts to manage the bay\u2019s  ecosystem and protect its living resources began as early as the 1930s  and continue today. These efforts include the following:  In 1980, Maryland and Virginia, later joined by Pennsylvania,  established the Chesapeake Bay Commission to serve as an advisory  body on the Chesapeake Bay to their state legislatures and as a  liaison to Congress.", "In 1983, Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania, the District of Columbia,  EPA, and the Chair of the Chesapeake Bay Commission signed the  first Chesapeake Bay agreement, formalizing the Chesapeake Bay  Program. The Bay Program is a partnership of federal agencies,  states, academic institutions, and others that directs and conducts the  restoration of the bay. EPA represents the federal government within  the Bay Program and supports the partnership through its  Chesapeake Bay Program Office. The signatories to the agreement  reaffirmed their commitment to restore the bay in 1987 and again in  1992.", "In 2000, the Bay Program signatories signed the most current  agreement, known as the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. It outlined  five broad goals and 102 commitments for the restoration effort.  Delaware, New York, and West Virginia later signed a memorandum  of understanding agreeing to work cooperatively to achieve the  pollution reduction targets identified to meet the water quality goals in  the agreement. The end dates in the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement  commitments largely expired in 2010 or earlier. Some of these  commitments have been renewed, but many have not. \uf0b7  Also in 2000, Congress passed the Estuaries and Clean Waters Act,  which directed EPA to take various actions to coordinate the  Chesapeake Bay Program and to support the implementation of the  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement. The act also required other federal  agencies with facilities in the bay watershed to participate in  restoration efforts.", "In 2005, we examined the Bay Program\u2019s implementation of the  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement to determine, among other things, the  extent to which appropriate measures for assessing restoration progress  had been established and how effectively the effort was being  coordinated and managed. Among other things, we found that the Bay  Program lacked a comprehensive, coordinated implementation strategy to  better enable it to achieve the goals outlined in the agreement and  assessment reports did not effectively communicate the status of the  bay\u2019s health. We made several recommendations to the Administrator of  EPA, including to instruct the Chesapeake Bay Program Office to (1) work  with the Bay Program to develop a comprehensive, coordinated  implementation strategy and (2) to develop and implement an integrated  approach to assess overall restoration progress. EPA took several  actions to incorporate our recommendations, such as reducing more than  100 bay health and restoration indicators into three indices of ecosystem  health and five indices of restoration effort.", "Subsequently, in the explanatory statement of the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2008, Congress directed EPA to implement  immediately all the recommendations in our report, and to develop a  Chesapeake Bay action plan for the remaining years of the Chesapeake  2000 Agreement. The Bay Program responded to the Consolidated  Appropriations Act with a July 2008 report to Congress that described the  program efforts to implement our recommendations, and the development  of an action plan for the Chesapeake Bay. We testified in July 2008 that  the Bay Program had taken several actions in response to our  recommendations, such as developing a strategic framework to unify  planning documents and identify how it will pursue its goals. However,  we also testified that additional actions were needed before the program  had the comprehensive, coordinated implementation strategy we  recommended.", "On May 12, 2009, the President issued Executive Order 13508,  Chesapeake Bay Protection and Restoration. The executive order noted  that despite significant efforts, water pollution in the Chesapeake Bay  prevents the attainment of state water quality standards, and that  restoration of the bay was not expected for many years. It also stated that  bay restoration will require restoring habitat and living resources,  conserving lands, and improving management of natural resources. The  executive order established the Federal Leadership Committee and  required the committee to develop a strategy to guide efforts to restore  and protect the bay. According to the order, the strategy was to define  environmental goals for the Chesapeake Bay and describe the specific  programs and strategies to be implemented, among other things. The  Federal Leadership Committee published the Strategy in May 2010.", "On December 29, 2010, EPA established a total maximum daily load  (TMDL)\u2014a \u201cpollution diet\u201d\u2014for the Chesapeake Bay and the region\u2019s  streams, creeks, and rivers in response to consent decrees stemming  from litigation against the agency. A TMDL is the calculation of the  maximum amount of pollution a body of water can receive and still meet  state water quality standards, and the Clean Water Act requires the  creation of TMDLs for water bodies not attaining their water quality  standards. The bay TMDL was also influenced by a settlement resolving  a lawsuit filed against EPA in which the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and  other entities alleged that EPA had failed to comply with the Clean Water  Act by not taking steps to achieve some of the Chesapeake 2000  Agreement goals. The bay TMDL is the largest ever developed by EPA,  encompassing the entire 64,000-square-mile watershed. It identifies the  necessary pollution reductions from major sources of nitrogen,  phosphorus, and sediment across the District of Columbia and large  sections of Delaware, Maryland, New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and  West Virginia, and sets pollution limits necessary to meet water quality  standards in the bay and its tidal rivers. To implement the TMDL, EPA is  taking steps to ensure that each watershed state develops a Watershed  Implementation Plan that details how and when it will meet pollution  allocations laid out in the TMDL. Each watershed state submitted its  phase one implementation plan to EPA for review in November 2010, and  must submit a phase two plan by March 2012 and a phase three plan in  2017. If EPA concludes that a watershed state has taken insufficient  steps to implement its Watershed Implementation Plans or to reduce  pollution, the agency is prepared to take one or more actions, including  expanding coverage of wastewater permits to sources that are currently  unregulated. The TMDL marks a change from the historic nature of the  effort, which was based primarily on stakeholder agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Restoration Strategy Includes Measurable Goals and Actions to Achieve Them, but Not All Bay Restoration Stakeholders Are Working toward These Goals", "paragraphs": ["The Strategy articulates broad restoration goals, specific measurable  goals, and actions to achieve those goals. Specifically, it includes 4 broad  goals, 12 measurable goals with deadlines, and 116 actions to restore the  bay by 2025. The 4 broad goals\u2014restore clean water, recover habitat,  sustain fish and wildlife, and conserve land and increase public access\u2014 are identified in the Strategy as the most essential priorities for a healthy  Chesapeake system. To meet these 4 broad goals, the Strategy identifies  12 measurable goals that contain numeric descriptions of results\u2014or  outcomes\u2014to be achieved by 2025 (see table 1). For example, to help  meet the recover habitat broad goal, the Strategy identifies a fish passage  measurable goal to restore historical fish migratory routes by opening  1,000 additional stream miles by 2025, with restoration success indicated  by the presence of river herring, American shad, or American eel. The  Strategy also identifies four supporting strategies\u2014expand citizen  stewardship, develop environmental markets, respond to climate change,  and strengthen science\u2014that were designed, in part, to provide cross- cutting support for attaining the Strategy\u2019s broad goals.", "In turn, the 12 measurable goals were designed to be achieved through  the accomplishment of 116 actions. These actions describe activities to  be taken by federal agencies, often in collaboration with the watershed  states and other entities. For example, one action in the fish passage  measurable goal\u2014remove stream barriers and provide fish passage\u2014 calls for two federal agencies to work with state and local partners to,  among other things, prioritize stream barriers that inhibit fish passage.  Figure 2 illustrates the relationship of the recover habitat broad goal and  its measurable goals and selected actions. Federal officials we surveyed  reported that about 95 percent of the actions in the Strategy could  definitely or probably be accomplished, assuming current and expected  budget and staff levels, and generally agreed that accomplishing the  actions will lead to the achievement of the measurable and broad goals  by 2025.", "Even though the federal agencies have developed a plan with  measurable goals and actions, we found that not all stakeholders are  working toward achieving these measurable goals. The watershed states  are critical partners in the effort to restore the bay, but officials from each  of the states told us that even though their states are conducting bay  restoration work, their states are not working toward the Strategy goals, in  some cases because they view the Strategy as a federal document. As of  July 2011, the watershed states have not committed to the Strategy.  Instead, most watershed state officials told us that their bay restoration  work is conducted according to their commitments to the Chesapeake  2000 Agreement. Federal and state officials told us that Strategy and  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement goals are similar to some degree. For  example, both identify phosphorus and nitrogen reduction as necessary  steps for improving water quality. However, the goals also differ in some  ways. For example, both the Strategy and the Chesapeake 2000  Agreement call for managing fish species, but the Strategy identifies  brook trout as a key species for targeted restoration efforts and the  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement does not. Both agreements also have  oyster restoration goals, but the Strategy identifies a number of tributaries  to be restored and the Chesapeake 2000 Agreement focuses on an  increase in the number of oysters in the bay.", "In addition, officials from most of the watershed states told us that they  are focused on accomplishing tasks associated with the bay TMDL, such  as developing their Watershed Implementation Plans. Officials from  several federal agencies also observed that the watershed states are fully  occupied with efforts to comply with the TMDL. The bay TMDL was  incorporated into the Strategy\u2019s water quality broad goal, which means  that the pollution reduction steps that the states plan to implement in  order to achieve the TMDL should contribute to the accomplishment of  that Strategy goal. Similarly, each watershed state has identified pollution  reduction activities in its phase one Watershed Implementation Plan that  could contribute incidentally to other Strategy goals, even though the  activities were created to achieve water quality standards and  development on them began before the publication of the Strategy. For  example, each watershed state has identified wetland restoration as part  of its phase one Watershed Implementation Plan, and the Strategy\u2019s  recover habitat goal contains a measurable goal to restore wetlands.  However, it is unclear whether the watershed states\u2019 wetland restoration  activities will be sufficient to help meet the Strategy\u2019s measurable goal for  wetlands. For example, not all of the Watershed Implementation Plans  identify the total wetland acreage to be restored.", "It is important for all partners in the restoration effort to be working toward  the same goals. We have previously reported that identifying common  goals is a key characteristic of successful collaborative efforts.  Specifically, we found that having common goals, among other factors,  can help lead to increased participation and cooperation among groups  involved in a collaborative effort and to improve natural resource  conditions. Several of the federal and state officials we interviewed also  said that they believe it is critical that all stakeholders in the bay  restoration effort are working toward the same goals and following the  same plan. For example, a federal official told us that alignment between  the Strategy and state actions would allow for the most integrated,  efficient way of restoring the bay. In addition, a state official told us that  the lack of alignment leads to a lack of support for the Strategy from the  states.", "In June 2010, the Federal Leadership Committee and the Bay Program  created an alignment action team to work toward aligning Strategy  restoration efforts with those of the Bay Program, including Chesapeake  2000 Agreement efforts. In addition to the lack of common goals, the  team also identified several other reasons for alignment, including  restoration tracking and communication difficulties caused by  stakeholders focusing on different goals, and that limited resources are  being diverted to addressing organizational confusion rather than  implementation of bay restoration efforts. In January 2011, the alignment  action team proposed developing a new restoration plan to provide a  blueprint for the future of the restoration effort that will align Strategy and  Bay Program goals. The Federal Leadership Committee and Bay  Program have not yet agreed to develop this new plan. Under a process  that was agreed to by both groups, they will work within preexisting Bay  Program groups, called Goal Implementation Teams, to, among other  things, refine priorities and areas of programmatic focus, guided by the  Chesapeake 2000 Agreement and the Strategy. As part of this process, if  the groups decide to negotiate a new agreement, it would not be  negotiated until 2013, according to a July 2011 Bay Program document."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal and State Officials Identified Three Key Factors That May Reduce the Likelihood of Achieving Strategy Goals and Actions", "paragraphs": ["Officials we surveyed from the 11 federal agencies responsible for the  Strategy identified three key factors that may reduce the likelihood of  achieving Strategy goals and actions, and state officials and subject  matter experts we interviewed raised similar concerns. We identified as  key those factors most frequently identified by federal officials:  collaboration, funding constraints, and external phenomena.", "Collaboration. First, most of the federal officials we surveyed indicated  that a potential lack of collaboration among stakeholders could reduce the  likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions. They reported that  some form of collaboration is necessary to accomplish all of the  Strategy\u2019s measurable goals and the vast majority of its actions. This  collaboration could be between federal agencies, federal and state  agencies, or federal agencies and other entities. In particular, federal- state collaboration is crucial to accomplishing the Strategy\u2019s goals and  actions. In their survey responses, federal officials indicated that  collaboration with at least one state is necessary to accomplish 96 of the  116 actions in all 12 of the measurable goals. For example, the Strategy\u2019s  measurable goal for blue crab calls in part for the development of a new  blue crab population target for 2012 through 2025, but a federal official  reported that setting such a target is a matter of state, not federal,  jurisdiction. The official indicated that the federal agency responsible for  the action will facilitate state agreement on a new target, but that securing  agreement is in the hands of the states, not the agencies. Table 2 shows  the number of actions that, according to federal officials\u2019 survey  responses, need state participation in order to be accomplished.  Appendix III provides additional information on the extent to which  collaboration between federal agencies and watershed states is needed  to accomplish strategy actions.", "Even though the watershed states are critical partners in the restoration  effort, most watershed state officials told us that they are generally  unaware of what federal agencies may require of them to implement the  Strategy. Specifically, officials from six of the seven watershed states  noted that they were not aware of the extent to which federal agencies  needed their participation when we told them the number of actions  federal officials had identified that would need state participation to be  accomplished. Some federal and state officials noted that their agencies  are working on bay issues through the Goal Implementation Teams.  Some of these groups are discussing the Strategy, but, according to a  January 2011 Bay Program memorandum, specific state contributions  toward the measurable goals have not been determined.", "In addition to the need for federal-state collaboration, collaboration  between two or more federal agencies is necessary to accomplish 40 of  the actions in 8 of the measurable goals, according to our survey results.  Some federal officials told us that collaboration among federal agencies  increased during the development and implementation of the Strategy.  According to some federal officials, this has resulted in closer  relationships between some agencies and more tools and perspectives  being used to restore the watershed. Other officials expressed concern  that recent bay restoration meetings have focused largely on bay water  quality issues with less time spent on other restoration activities and  needs, such as restoring brook trout populations or increasing public  access to the bay.", "Funding constraints. The second key factor stakeholders identified that  may reduce the likelihood of achieving Strategy goals and actions is  funding constraints. Specifically, in their survey responses, federal  officials indicated that funding constraints at the federal and state levels,  and among other partners, such as academic institutions, could reduce  the likelihood of accomplishing 69 of the actions in 11 of the measurable  goals. Some federal officials told us that increased federal funding will be  critical to accomplishing the actions and measurable goals. For example,  a federal official reported that achieving the measurable goal for land  conservation is contingent upon increased federal funding, in part  because the recent economic crisis has reduced state land conservation  funding. State land conservation funding is necessary to accomplish  several land conservation actions in the Strategy, according to federal  survey responses. In addition, another federal official told us that the  measurable goal of restoring oyster habitat and populations has been  delayed because of late allocations of fiscal year 2011 funding.", "Officials from each of the watershed states also told us that funding  constraints may reduce their ability to restore the bay. For example,  officials from one state told us that their state needs about $38 billion in  wastewater treatment infrastructure to reduce water pollution, and noted  that overall challenging fiscal circumstances mean the state has a limited  capacity to conduct additional bay restoration activities. Similarly, officials  from another state told us that their state has experienced budget cuts in  recent years and that funding constraints could reduce the likelihood of  conducting restoration activities. In addition, fish passage experts we  interviewed told us that states will have to contribute significant funding  for stream restoration projects if the measurable goal of increasing fish  passages is to be achieved. However, states\u2019 current fiscal conditions  may reduce their ability to do so.", "External phenomena. The third key factor that may reduce the likelihood  of achieving Strategy goals and actions, according to federal agency  survey responses and subject matter experts, is external phenomena that  are outside the control of the agency, such as climate change or  population growth. Even though the Strategy addresses some external  phenomena, for example, by including a supporting strategy for  responding to climate change, federal officials told us that effects beyond  what was planned for in developing the Strategy could affect the  likelihood of achieving the measurable goals. Specifically, federal officials  reported that external phenomena could reduce the likelihood that 8 of  the measurable goals will be achieved even if all of the actions in those  measurable goals were accomplished. For example, according to one  federal agency\u2019s survey response and a subject matter expert we  interviewed, both climate change and increased development in the  watershed could reduce the likelihood of achieving the measurable goal  to restore naturally reproducing brook trout populations in headwater  streams by 2025. The brook trout expert explained that climate change  may affect stream temperature, which can result in a loss of brook trout.  In addition, the expert told us that an increase in the amount of  impervious surfaces in the watershed as a result of development can  increase polluted runoff and degrade habitat, resulting in a loss of brook  trout. As another example, insufficient or degraded breeding habitat  outside of the bay watershed could reduce the likelihood of achieving the  measurable goal of restoring a 3-year average wintering black duck  population of 100,000 birds by 2025, according to this agency\u2019s survey  response and two subject matter experts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Plans for Assessing Progress on Implementing the Strategy and Restoring Bay Health Are Limited or Not Fully Developed, and It Is Unclear What Indicators Will Be Used to Assess Progress on Bay Health", "paragraphs": ["The Strategy calls for the federal agencies to, among other things,  develop 2-year milestones, an adaptive management process, and  annual progress reports to assess progress made in implementing the  Strategy and restoring the health of the bay.

However, setting the milestones every 2 years allows for the  possibility of moving the target date to the next 2-year milestone period if  the milestone could not be met in those 2 years, thereby prolonging the  time it will take to meet the Strategy\u2019s goals. In addition, without a  blueprint of milestones for the entire restoration effort, it is unclear how  the agencies will determine whether they are on track to achieve the 12  measurable goals and 4 broad goals by 2025. Some restoration activities  may not result in immediate improvements to the health of the bay, and it  may be reasonable to expect slower progress toward a measurable goal  initially, with faster progress made after a number of years into the  restoration effort. On the other hand, some restoration activities may be  easier to accomplish than others, and it may be reasonable to expect  faster progress made toward a measurable goal initially and slower  progress made after a number of years into the effort. By identifying a  blueprint of milestones for the entire restoration effort, the agencies can  show when the actions are expected to result in progress toward the  measurable goals, determine whether these actions are having their  intended result, and make changes to these actions if needed.

The Strategy states that  the Federal Leadership Committee will develop a process for  implementing adaptive management, but officials from EPA and other  committee agencies told us that they are still developing this process.  According to EPA officials, the Federal Leadership Committee agreed to  the seven-step adaptive management decision framework that the Bay  Program adopted in May 2011. This framework, however, was developed  for the Bay Program and does not include clear linkages to the Strategy  actions and measurable goals. It is unclear how it will be used by the  Federal Leadership Committee agencies to adaptively manage Strategy  actions and meet Strategy goals (see app. IV). In August 2011, EPA  officials noted that a fully developed adaptive management process is  needed. A fully developed adaptive management process should allow  the agencies to evaluate whether Strategy actions are leading to the  measurable goals and, if needed, adjust their efforts. This approach  includes assessing the problem, designing a plan that includes  measurable management objectives, monitoring the impacts of the  selected management actions, and evaluating and using the results to  adjust management actions. In 2004, the National Research Council  defined adaptive management as a process that promotes flexible  decision making in the face of uncertainties, as outcomes from  management actions and other events become better understood. In  2011, the National Research Council looked at the Chesapeake Bay  Program\u2019s nutrient reduction program and found that neither EPA nor the  watershed states exhibit a clear understanding of how adaptive  management might be applied in pursuit of the Bay Program\u2019s water  quality goals. We believe a fully developed adaptive management  process is essential to Strategy success because the agencies can  improve bay restoration efforts by learning from management outcomes.  We have previously reported that the lack of a well-developed adaptive  management process impaired the success of collaborative restoration  efforts, such as restoring the South Florida ecosystem and restricting  bison movement in Montana to prevent the spread of disease.", "The Strategy also calls for the Federal Leadership Committee to develop  an annual progress report that would, in part, assess the progress made  in implementing the Strategy in the previous year. According to EPA  officials, the agencies will report progress on the actions quarterly to the  committee, and the agencies will use these quarterly reports to develop  an annual progress report that will be issued to the public. In a fiscal year  2011 action plan, the Federal Leadership Committee identified which  federal agency is responsible for implementing each Strategy action and  what the agencies are expected to accomplish in that year. The  committee has also separately designated a lead federal agency for  assessing progress toward each measurable goal, and that progress will  also be included in the annual progress report. According to the Strategy,  the Federal Leadership Committee plans to issue the first annual  progress report in early 2012. The committee has not developed a  template for the annual progress report, however, and federal officials  were unable to tell us what performance data will be collected and  reported in it to gauge progress. Performance information provided by the  agencies in the first quarterly report on progress made during the first  quarter of fiscal year 2011 varies.

To restore the bay in the most  efficient and effective manner, these parties must work together toward  the same goals. The Strategy that federal agencies developed for  protecting and restoring the bay in response to Executive Order 13508  identifies measurable bay restoration goals and actions to achieve these  goals. State participation in the Strategy is necessary to achieve these  goals, yet the watershed states are not committed to the Strategy.  Currently, federal agencies are generally working toward the Strategy  goals, while states are largely focused on accomplishing tasks associated  with the bay TMDL, which supports one of the Strategy goals.

We agree. As we noted in the draft report,  restoring the bay is a massive, complex, and difficult undertaking that  requires the concerted effort of many parties. To restore the bay in the  most efficient and effective manner, these parties must work together  toward the same goals. Having common goals, among other factors, can  help lead to increased participation and cooperation among the groups  involved in the effort. In its comments, EPA stated that the draft report did  not highlight where common goals and common directions are already  present in the Chesapeake Bay Program. We noted in the draft report  that the bay TMDL was incorporated into the Strategy\u2019s water quality  broad goal, which means that the pollution reduction steps that the states  plan to implement to achieve the TMDL should contribute to the  accomplishment of the Strategy goal. In commenting on our  recommendation that the Administrator of EPA work collaboratively with  federal and state bay restoration stakeholders to establish milestones for  gauging progress toward measurable goals for the entire restoration  effort, EPA recognized that a blueprint of milestones through 2025 would  be useful. EPA expressed concern about locking in a too detailed plan for  the entire time period, because it does not wish to limit its ability for  adaptive management. We believe that a blueprint of milestones can  assist in the adaptive management process. As we noted in the draft  report, a blueprint of milestones would allow agencies to show when the  actions are expected to result in progress toward the measurable goals,  determine whether these actions are having their intended result, and  make changes to these actions as needed.

These steps included  conducting three pretests in person prior to distributing the survey to  ensure that our questions were clear, precise, and consistently  interpreted; reviewing responses to identify obvious errors or  inconsistencies; and conducting follow-up interviews with officials to  review and clarify responses. We determined the survey data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.", "In addition to conducting the survey mentioned above, we interviewed  officials from each of the watershed states to determine their knowledge  of and involvement with the Strategy; to identify the factors, if any, that  state officials believe could reduce the likelihood of both Strategy and bay  restoration success; and to ask about state-related federal official survey  responses. We also interviewed a nonprobability sample of individuals  who have expertise in the subject matter of the Strategy\u2019s measurable  goals and solicited their views on the likelihood that the measurable goals  could be achieved.

Interior disagreed with our recommendation to EPA to work with  federal and state bay restoration stakeholders to establish milestones  for gauging progress toward measurable goals for the entire  restoration effort. Interior further commented that the 12 measurable  goals provide a blueprint for the long-term success of the program. As  we noted in the draft report, the 12 measurable goals contain numeric  descriptions of results to be achieved by 2025. However, these  measurable goals do not provide a blueprint of milestones to be met  prior to 2025 that would allow the agencies to determine whether they  are on track to meet these measurable goals. We agree that 2-year  milestones can contribute to an adaptive management approach, and  as we noted in the draft report, a blueprint of milestones for the entire  restoration effort can allow the agencies to show when the actions are  expected to result in progress toward the measurable goals,  determine whether the actions are having their intended results, and  make changes to these actions as needed. 5.  Interior commented that we did not include information on the Bay  Program\u2019s seven-step adaptive management decision framework. In  response to this comment, we modified the report to include  information about this framework. However, as we note in the report,  this framework was developed for the Bay Program and does not  include clear linkages to the Strategy actions and measurable goals. It  is unclear how it will be used by the Federal Leadership Committee  agencies to adaptively manage Strategy actions and meet Strategy  goals. In August 2011, EPA officials told us that a fully developed  adaptive management process is needed. 6.  Interior commented that the annual progress report is on schedule to  be completed by January 2012 and that the Council on Environmental  Quality and Office of Management and Budget approved an outline for  the report on August 12, 2011. According to an EPA official, the  outline that Interior refers to in its comments did not address what  performance information will be collected. We continue to believe that  plans for the annual progress report are not fully developed.  7.  Interior commented that a Bay Program team is working to improve  the Bay Barometer publication, which reports on the overall health of  the bay. We noted in our draft report that there are two groups that  plan to assess bay health. The Federal Leadership Committee will  review indicators of environmental conditions in the bay through its  annual progress report, and the Bay Program will report on bay health  and restoration efforts through its Bay Barometer. As we reported, the  content of the next Bay Barometer report has not yet been  determined, and it is unclear if the groups will assess the same or  different indicators of progress."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix VIII: Comments from the State of New York", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IX: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Barbara Patterson, Assistant  Director; Lucas Alvarez; Elizabeth Beardsley; Mark Braza; Russ Burnett;  David Dornisch; Lina Khan; Marietta Mayfield Revesz; Ben Shouse; Kiki  Theodoropoulos; and Michelle K.
