When used appropriately, peer review can result in both immediate and long-term improvements in patient care. However, when used inappropriately, it can prevent the detection of poorly performing practitioners and cause severe quality of care problems for patients. An essential element of peer review is management support for actions recommended by the peer review process. Without such support, peer review is a meaningless activity because no action is taken on the peer reviewers\u2019 recommendations.", "In response to your request, we have examined the relationship between problem identification and problem resolution as it pertains to the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) physician peer review. Specifically you asked (1) how the results of VA peer review are being used in the process of reprivileging and disciplining physicians with performance problems; (2) what are the impediments to effective peer review; and (3) whether VA was taking action to identify, follow up on, and report to state medical boards and the National Practitioner Data Bank on the actions of those physicians who are not performing in accordance with professional standards.", "Our review was conducted at VA\u2019s Central Office and six VA medical centers during the period January 1994 through March 1995. At each location we (1) reviewed peer review policies, procedures, and documentation; (2) examined quality assurance files; and (3) interviewed physicians involved in the peer review process. We also examined malpractice claims paid on behalf of physicians at these medical centers. The quality assurance data that we reviewed are considered confidential and privileged under the provisions of Title 38, U.S.C. \u00a75705. Thus, we are not incorporating in this report any examples of cases that VA peer reviewers believed an experienced, competent practitioner would have handled differently.

An integral part of VA\u2019s process is physician peer review\u2014physicians evaluating the medical care provided by other physicians.", "Peer review in VA is used by medical centers to determine if practitioner care is less than optimal and is initiated when an occurrence screen identifies potential quality of care problems. Peer review is also used to establish the basis for the granting of privileges to physicians and to examine malpractice claims made against health care professionals in the medical center. No disciplinary action is taken against a physician\u2019s privileges after a peer review following an occurrence screen. This is because quality assurance information, such as occurrence screen peer review data, is confidential and cannot be used in disciplinary proceedings. However, peer review findings can be used by medical center management to initiate a formal investigation of a physician\u2019s performance or conduct after which disciplinary action can be taken.", "VA guidance, issued in April 1994, presents various methods for conducting peer review but does not mandate a specific peer review technique. Specifically, the guidance discusses the disadvantages of the single reviewer approach and presents three types of multiple reviewer techniques: (1) committee review, (2) multiple independent review, and (3) discussion to consensus. At the six medical centers we visited, two methods of peer review were being utilized: multiple independent review and committee review. (See app. II for a discussion of these approaches.)", "Regardless of the approach used, the result of any peer review is an evaluation of the care provided by a practitioner and a preliminary determination as to how, in the reviewer\u2019s opinion, other physicians would have handled the case. Cases rated as a level 1 (most experienced, competent practitioners would handle case similarly) usually receive no further action. Cases rated as a level 2 (most experienced, competent practitioners might handle the case differently) or a level 3 (most experienced, competent practitioners would handle the case differently) receive a supervisory review by the responsible clinical service chief, such as the chief of surgery.", "All physicians and dentists employed by VA are subject to privileging procedures. Privileging is the process by which a practitioner is granted permission by the institution to provide medical or other patient care services within defined limits on the basis of an individual\u2019s clinical competence as determined by peer references. Privileging is done at the time of employment and every 2 years thereafter. However, a physician\u2019s privileges can be examined at any time if a question about his or her performance or competence is raised.", "The National Practitioner Data Bank was created under Title IV of Public Law 99-660, the Health Care Quality Improvement Act of 1986. The act calls for (1) insurance companies and certain self-insured health care entities to report malpractice payments made for the benefit of a physician, dentist, or other licensed health care practitioner to the Data Bank and (2) hospitals and other authorized health care entities, licensing boards, and professional societies to report professional review actions relating to possible incompetence or improper professional conduct adversely affecting the clinical privileges, licensure, or membership in a professional society of a practitioner for longer than 30 days to the Data Bank.", "The intent of the act is to improve the quality of medical care by encouraging physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners to identify and discipline those who engage in unprofessional behavior and to restrict the ability of incompetent physicians, dentists, and other health care practitioners to move from state to state without disclosure or discovery of their previous damaging or incompetent performance. The Data Bank acts as a clearinghouse for information about licensed practitioners\u2019 paid malpractice claims and adverse actions on licensure, clinical privileges, and professional society membership.

If no action is considered necessary, a notation to that effect should be made by the service chief. However, VA guidance does not explicitly state the extent to which (1) discussions with a practitioner should be documented or (2) the reasons for no action being taken should be justified. As a result, the worksheets provided to the occurrence screen coordinator generally contained no elaboration on the action taken.

But in 32 of the 50 level 3 cases in which a discussion took place, when we asked for documentation about what was actually discussed with the practitioner about the peer review findings or what, if any, corrective actions were agreed upon, we were told by staff that they could not find information in either the occurrence screen worksheets or minutes of the service meetings. Further, in the 4 cases we reviewed in which no action was taken by a service chief on peer reviewers\u2019 findings, there was no indication in the occurrence screen worksheets as to why a decision to take no action was justified.", "VA regulations require cases meeting the occurrence screen criteria to be entered into an ongoing occurrence screen database, which is reviewed and analyzed regularly to identify patterns that may be problematic.

Specifically, in 8 cases, medical center management revised certain policies and procedures to ensure that the problems identified by peer reviewers would not recur. In 6 cases, physicians were provided counseling on the basis of the peer reviewer\u2019s findings and a record of the incident was placed in the physician\u2019s privileging file.

For example, practice guidelines could reduce the tendency on the part of some peer reviewers to focus on the effect of a bad patient outcome rather than whether the standard of care was met.", "In a 1992 Journal of the American Medical Association article, an official in VA\u2019s Office of Quality Management stated that the development of practice guidelines would be a great aid to improve peer review. In a corroborating article, the physician writing about peer review states that peer judgments regarding appropriateness of care are strongly influenced by perceived outcomes. This suggests that the standard of care is often unclear to reviewers. Practice guidelines are being developed with increasing frequency in both VA and the medical community as a whole. However, at least one expert does not believe that it will be possible to design guidelines that will take into account every possible factor that might constitute an exception to the standard. \u201cpicking skilled physician-reviewers may be the central and critical step. Simply choosing a peer physician may not be the best strategy; rather, identifying an expert in both the condition under study and in quality assessment purposes and techniques may be required.\u201d", "At the six medical centers we visited, we found that classification of peer review findings is a highly subjective activity because no systemwide clinical criterion exists for peer reviewers to determine whether physicians would or would not have performed in the same manner as the physician under review. As indicated above, such a situation is not unique to VA and will be resolved only when a complete set of practice guidelines is used routinely. Until such criteria are generally available, a case that might be a level 1 in VA medical center A might be a level 3 in VA medical center F.

Although we found differences among services within medical centers, four of the six VA medical centers we visited are using peer review primarily to evaluate physician performance and identify physicians who may have contributed to adverse patient outcomes. This approach is resulting in negative perceptions of the peer review process and is impeding its acceptance among physicians. At these facilities, several physicians questioned the usefulness of the peer review process and did not view it as having an important role in identifying opportunities for improving care.", "These physicians contend that peer review duplicates other quality assurance monitors. For example, the medical service units at each of the VA medical centers we visited hold morbidity and mortality conferences to discuss all deaths and clinical complications that occurred during the week preceding the meeting. Some of these cases are later selected for peer review. But, according to physicians involved in peer review, the peer reviews do not identify any issues that are not identified and discussed in the morbidity and mortality conferences.", "Physicians also told us that peer review committee findings have more credibility than the findings of a single peer reviewer because the subjectivity inherent in determining quality of care is reduced. Other benefits of the committee approach include identifying the underlying problem that led to an adverse outcome and greater physician acceptance of peer review. Physicians told us that by focusing on the identification of system issues, they are better able to identify the underlying cause of an adverse outcome and prevent it from occurring again.", "Physicians who are members of peer review committees also told us that the anonymity associated with peer review committees allows them to be open and honest in their evaluations. Officials from one VA medical center that switched from using a single reviewer to a peer review committee stated that the number of cases rated level 2 or 3 rose when they began using a peer review committee. Specifically, during the first 5 months of 1994, the committee assigned more level 3 designations to cases than did individual reviewers in all of 1993.

Thus, before reporting a practitioner to the Data Bank after a malpractice payment is made, VA is in effect requiring the peer review panel to make a determination that either the standard of care was not met or that a practitioner was guilty of professional incompetence or misconduct. Adherence to these procedures results in VA medical centers\u2019 not reporting to the Data Bank all malpractice payments made on behalf of their practitioners.", "The process followed by VA medical centers to deal with malpractice claims is as follows: Within 30 days of a claim being filed, the appropriate VA district counsel notifies the medical center involved in providing the medical care identified in the allegations that a claim has been filed. Medical center personnel then conduct a peer review to determine if the appropriate standards of care were met. These standards can relate to any part of the system (for example, hospital, outpatient care, equipment, systems in place, and practitioners). The medical center forwards the results of the peer review along with a copy of the Tort Claim Information System data and a copy of the patient\u2019s medical record to both the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology and the appropriate VA district counsel. Upon receipt of the results of the initial peer review, the district counsel can make a request for the medical opinion of an external expert. Finally, the VA district counsel can settle or deny a claim.", "If a payment is made on the claim, the responsible medical center director will convene a second peer review panel to determine if an identifiable licensed health care practitioner is involved in the case. During this review, a determination is made as to whether the acts or omission of the practitioners in relation to the patient injury for which the settlement or judgment was made constituted care that did not meet generally accepted standards of professional competence or conduct. The recommendations of this panel should determine whether the practitioner involved in the incident is reported to the Data Bank. However, before approving the report, the director will notify the practitioner to be reported and provide him or her with an opportunity to discuss the situation with appropriate medical center officials, including the director.", "At the six medical centers we visited, we reviewed 53 paid claim files in which the claim alleged that an adverse patient outcome was caused by a licensed practitioner(s). We found that it was possible to determine the practitioner(s) associated with the adverse patient outcome in each of the 53 claims. However, only four of these individuals were reported to the Data Bank. The remaining practitioners were not reported for a variety of reasons, including determination by the panel that the standard of care was met (13); inability to identify the practitioner responsible for the patient (3); problem was considered to be a system failure (4); belief that the resident rather than the attending physician was to blame for the incident (3); patient was at fault (2); no evidence of misconduct, negligence, or malpractice (6); panel split on the need to report (1); and practitioner behavior was not clearly outside the standards of practice (1). Further, from October 28, 1991, to September 30, 1994, only 73 practitioners from 1,047 paid claims for all VA medical centers were reported to the Data Bank.

The Under Secretary concluded that (1) the VA peer review process is necessary to determine if there is an identifiable licensed health care provider for whom it can be said that payment was made and (2) only if there is an identifiable practitioner can it be said that the payment was on his or her behalf.", "We agree that malpractice claims are filed against the United States of America and not against individual practitioners. We found, however, that identifying practitioners involved in a malpractice claim and on whose behalf it can be said payment was made is not difficult. Our review of 558 malpractice claims involving VA that were paid during fiscal years 1992 and 1993 shows that 422, or 76 percent, involved claims in which it was alleged that an adverse patient outcome was caused by a licensed practitioner(s).

However, regardless of the length of time an individual\u2019s privileges have been affected, VA will not report adverse actions, including suspensions lasting longer than 30 days, to the Data Bank until all internal appeals have been satisfied. Such a policy is not required by the act and can delay reporting for a considerable time. For example, one VA medical center we visited suspended the privileges of two physicians in 1993 and terminated their employment in 1994. One of these physicians was reinstated in March 1995 with a formal reprimand. As of April 4, 1995, the other was still involved in the internal appeals process.

It also includes consideration of any information related to medical malpractice allegations or judgments, loss of medical staff membership, loss or reduction of clinical privileges, or challenges to licensure. In addition, the evaluation must be determined using evidence of an individual\u2019s current competence. Initial privileging is done at the time of employment and every 2 years thereafter. However, a physician\u2019s privileges can be examined at any time if the situation requires it; for example, when there is a question of physician competency or professional conduct.", "From October 28, 1991, through September 30, 1994, nine medical centers reported 11 adverse actions to the Data Bank. However, our analysis shows that the adverse reporting rate for VA medical centers is lower than the adverse reporting rate of community hospitals. For example, in California, VA has 4,008 beds and reported 2 adverse actions for an average reporting rate of 0.50 reports per 1,000 beds. Conversely, community hospitals in California have 105,270 beds and reported 390 adverse actions for an average reporting rate of 3.7 reports per 1,000 beds. (See app. IV for a complete reporting comparison by state.)", "The Under Secretary for Health, in responding to this report, stated that VA reporting rates are not comparable with community hospital rates because VA practitioners are employees of VA, not independent entrepreneurs. The Under Secretary believes that through appropriate supervision, service chiefs at the medical centers are identifying problems and through supervision and progressive discipline, if necessary, issues are handled before formal privileging actions occur. Conversely, in a community hospital, practitioners are not typically employees of the organization, and the formal privileging review process is the only legitimate process for review. The Under Secretary noted, however, that VA policy requires that licensed health care practitioners who leave VA employment while under investigation be reported to the Data Bank immediately.", "Service chiefs at the medical centers we visited told us that they use formal and informal processes to deal with physicians who have performance problems. Formal procedures require due process hearings that (1) take time to administer, (2) require much documentation, and (3) involve extensive understanding of the regulations and guidelines governing such actions. For example, in fiscal years 1993 and 1994, action was taken to officially remove three physicians at the medical centers we visited. The time involved from the initiation of disciplinary action to ultimate removal ranged from 5-1/2 months to a little over 1 year. Reasons for the varying time frames include complexity of the issues involved (such as professional misconduct versus quality of care), multiple independent peer reviews necessary in two cases and not in the other, and the extent to which the physicians fought the disciplinary actions. In each case, the physician\u2019s privileges were restricted for more than 30 days; however, only one of the three cases was reported to the Data Bank. VA policy requires that the appeals process be completed before any case is reported to the Data Bank, and these physicians had appealed the suspension and revocation of their privileges and the termination of their employment.", "Service chiefs at the medical centers we visited also used an informal process to remove physicians who had performance problems. However, the effect is that physicians who may have performance problems are not reported to the Data Bank. Further, one service chief told us that he tends to hire part-time physicians to avoid having to adhere to the formal procedures for dealing with problem physicians. The following is an example of a situation that resulted in the removal of a problem physician through informal means.", "A service chief reduced a physician\u2019s privileges and personally supervised the physician for 6 months to determine the physician\u2019s competence level. The service chief concluded that the physicians\u2019 medical skills did not improve during the time of observation and recommended to the physician that he resign.

Such information could allow management to track the performance of practitioners over time and help ensure that any pattern of less than optimal care is quickly identified. Documentation also establishes the degree to which management addressed the issues raised by peer reviewers. From an organizational perspective, this establishes accountability on the part of service chiefs, increases practitioner awareness of the importance that the medical center places on the delivery of quality care, and is a good risk-management tool because it requires managers to go on record as to how a potential problem was addressed.", "By establishing restrictive Data Bank reporting procedures, VA has shielded its physicians from the professional accountability that is required of private sector practitioners. In so doing, VA could be facilitating the delivery of substandard care outside the VA health care system by allowing practitioners with poor performance records to leave its employment with no record of having been involved in a malpractice claim or an adverse action.

While he does not believe that a change in policy is needed for the reporting of malpractice payments, he does agree that more timely reporting of initial summary suspensions of physician privileges lasting longer than 30 days is an option. In this regard, he said that a group of knowledgeable program staff will explore all policy options and report their recommendations to him by the end of September 1995.", "Under VA\u2019s current procedures, the postpayment peer review is made to determine if there is an identifiable licensed health care practitioner responsible for a breach in care. The Under Secretary stated that effective May 19, 1995, these reviews will be completed outside of the medical center for which payment was made (for example, in another medical center). This is an interim measure, and VA is in the process of pursuing peer review options that are external to the VA system, such as utilization of the clinical reviewers participating in VA\u2019s External Peer Review Program.", "We disagree with the Under Secretary\u2019s contention that no policy change is needed with respect to the reporting of malpractice payments. VA\u2019s policy of reporting only those malpractice payments involving practitioners who have been determined to have breached the standard of care remains more restrictive than required under Public Law 99-660. The law requires only that all malpractice payments made on behalf of a physician or licensed health care practitioner be reported to the Data Bank. In addition, the law states that payment of a claim should not be construed as creating a presumption that medical malpractice has occurred. Thus, any post-payment peer review need only determine that the payment was for the benefit of a practitioner, not that it results from a breach in care.", "We also believe that reporting initial summary suspensions rather than only final actions should be viewed as more than an option.
