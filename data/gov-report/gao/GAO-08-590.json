GAO was asked to report on (1) how IRA assets compare to assets in other retirement plans, (2) what barriers may discourage small employers from offering IRAs to employees, and (3) the adequacy of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) and the Department of Labor's (Labor) oversight of and information on IRAs. GAO reviewed reports from government and financial industry sources and interviewed experts and federal agency officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Individual retirement accounts, or IRAs, hold more assets than any other type of retirement vehicle. In 2004, IRAs held about $3.5 trillion in assets compared to $2.6 trillion in defined contribution (DC) plans, including 401(k) plans, and $1.9 trillion in defined benefit (DB), or pension plans. Similar percentages of households own IRAs and participate in 401(k) plans, and IRA ownership is associated with higher educational and income levels. Congress created IRAs to provide a way for individuals without employer plans to save for retirement, and to give retiring workers or those changing jobs a way to preserve retirement assets by rolling over, or transferring, plan balances into IRAs. Rollovers into IRAs significantly outpace IRA contributions and account for most assets flowing into IRAs. Given the total assets held in IRAs, they may appear to be comparable to 401(k) plans. However, 401(k) plans are employer-sponsored while most households with IRAs own traditional IRAs established outside the workplace. Several barriers may discourage employers from establishing employer-sponsored IRAs and offering payroll-deduction IRAs to their employees. Although employer-sponsored IRAs were designed with fewer reporting requirements to encourage participation by small employers and payroll-deduction IRAs have none, millions of employees of small firms lack access to a workplace retirement plan. Retirement and savings experts and others told GAO that barriers discouraging employers from offering these IRAs include costs that small businesses may incur for managing IRA plans, a lack of flexibility for employers seeking to promote payroll-deduction IRAs to their employees, and certain contribution requirements of some IRAs. Information is lacking, however, on what the actual costs to employers may be for providing payroll-deduction IRAs and questions remain on the effect that expanded access to these IRAs may have on employees. Experts noted that several proposals exist to encourage employers to offer and employees to participate in employer-sponsored and payroll-deduction IRAs, however limited government actions have been taken. The Internal Revenue Service and Labor share oversight for all types of IRAs, but gaps exist within Labor's area of responsibility. IRS is responsible for tax rules on establishing and maintaining IRAs, while Labor is responsible for oversight of fiduciary standards for employer-sponsored IRAs and provides certain guidance on payroll-deduction IRAs, although Labor does not have jurisdiction. Oversight ensures the interests of the employee participants are protected, that their retirement savings are properly handled, and any applicable guidance and laws are being followed. Because there are very limited reporting requirements for employer-sponsored IRAs and none for payroll-deduction IRAs, Labor does not have processes in place to identify all employers offering IRAs, numbers of employees participating, and employers not in compliance with the law. Obtaining information about employer-sponsored and payroll-deduction IRAs is also important to determine whether these vehicles help workers without DC or DB plans build retirement savings. Although IRS collects and publishes some data on IRAs, IRS has not consistently produced reports on IRAs nor shared such information with other agencies, such as Labor. Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics National Compensation Survey surveys employer-sponsored benefit plans but collects limited information on employer-sponsored IRAs and no information on payroll-deduction IRAs. Since IRS is the only agency that has data on all IRA participants, consistent reporting of these data could give Labor and others valuable information on IRAs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Individual retirement accounts\u2014popularly known as IRAs\u2014have grown in  importance and become key retirement savings vehicles for many  individuals, including small business owners, independent contractors,  and other workers who are not covered by an employer-sponsored  retirement plan.

Experts advocating for expanded payroll-deduction IRAs reported  that most employers would incur little to no costs since most employers  already make payroll deductions for Social Security and Medicare, as well  as federal, state, and local taxes. According to these experts, payroll- deduction IRAs function similarly to existing payroll tax withholdings and  adding another deduction would not be a substantial requirement.  However, other experts reported that costs to employers may be  significant. One report indicated that costs to employers for managing  payroll-deduction IRAs were substantial, particularly for employers  without electronic payrolls; however, the study did not estimate what the  actual costs to employers may be on a per account basis.

One reason payroll-deduction IRA programs have not  been widely adopted by employers may be a lack of awareness about how  payroll-deduction and other IRAs work.

However, Labor has produced educational materials describing  the payroll-deduction and employer-sponsored IRA options available to  employers and employees, and one Labor official told us that that Labor  has received positive feedback from small businesses for their efforts.

Many low- and moderate-income workers are  already eligible to contribute to IRAs, but have chosen not to do so  because they lack sufficient income to save for retirement. Experts raised  doubts that payroll-deduction IRA programs would lead to adequate  retirement savings, as low-income individuals would be unable to  contribute to these IRAs consistently. Further, experts said that  individuals with low-balance IRAs would be inclined to make early  withdrawals and be subject to additional income taxes. Experts also  reported that because the incentives for tax-deferred IRA contributions  are based on marginal tax rates, lower-income individuals receive a lower  immediate tax subsidy than higher income individuals.

Experts said the higher contribution limits and flexible  employer contribution options of SEP and SIMPLE IRAs offer greater  savings benefits to employers and employees than payroll-deduction  IRAs. For example, the 2007 SIMPLE contribution limit of $10,500 per  year for individuals under age 50 is more than twice the amount allowed in  2007 in payroll-deduction IRAs. In 2007, SEP IRAs allowed employers to  contribute the lesser of 25 percent of an employee\u2019s compensation or up to  $45,000. Moreover, because SIMPLE IRAs require employers to match the  contributions of participating employees or to make \u201cnonelective\u201d  contributions to all employee accounts, employees are able to save  significantly more per year in SIMPLE accounts than they are in payroll- deduction IRAs. Under SEP rules, employers must set up SEP IRAs for all  employees working for them in at least 3 of the past 5 years who have  reached age 21 and received at least $500 in compensation in 2007, and  employees may not contribute to their own accounts. Annual employer  contributions are not mandatory; however, if an employer decides to  contribute, they must make contributions to the SEP IRAs of all employees  performing services in that year. Because annual contributions are not  mandatory for SEP IRAs, employers have the flexibility to adjust  contributions depending on business revenues. Employers offering  SIMPLE IRAs must either make a nonelective contribution of 2 percent of  each eligible employee\u2019s compensation or a minimum of a 1 percent match  to the SIMPLE IRAs of those employees who choose to contribute to their  accounts.", "Certain factors may limit employer sponsorship of SIMPLE and SEP IRAs.  Small business groups told us that the costs of managing SEP and SIMPLE  IRAs may be prohibitive for small employers. Experts also pointed out that  contribution requirements for SIMPLE and SEP plans may, in some cases,  limit employer sponsorship of these plans. For example, because SIMPLE  IRAs require employers to make contributions to employee accounts,  some small firms may be unable to commit to these IRAs. Small business  groups and IRA providers told us that small business revenues are  inconsistent and may fluctuate greatly from year to year, making required  contributions difficult for some firms. In addition, employers offering  SIMPLE IRAs must determine before the beginning of the calendar year  whether they will match employee contributions or make nonelective  contributions to all employees\u2019 accounts. According to IRA providers, this  requirement may discourage some small employers from offering these  IRAs, and if employers had the flexibility to make additional contributions  to employee accounts at the end of the year, employers may be  encouraged to contribute more to employee accounts.", "With regard to SEP IRAs, two experts said small firms may be discouraged  from offering these plans because of the requirement that employers must  set up a SEP IRA for all employees performing service for the company in  3 of the past 5 years and with more than $500 in compensation for 2007.  These experts stated that small firms are likely to hire either seasonal  employees or interns who may earn more than $500, and these employers  may have difficulty finding an IRA provider willing to open an IRA small  enough for these temporary or low-earning participants."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals Exist to Encourage Employers to Offer and Employees to Participate in IRAs", "paragraphs": ["Retirement and savings experts reported that several legislative proposals  could encourage employers to offer and employees to participate in IRAs.

Several retirement and savings  experts said additional incentives should be in place to increase employer  sponsorship of IRAs. For example, experts suggested tax credits should be  made available to defray start-up costs for small employers of payroll- deduction IRAs, particularly for those without electronic or automatic  payroll systems. These credits should be lower than the credits available  to employers for starting SIMPLE, SEP, and 401(k) plans to avoid  competition with those plans, these experts said. IRA providers and small  business groups said increasing contribution limits for SIMPLE IRAs to  levels closer to those for 401(k) plans would encourage more employers to  offer these plans. Other experts said doing so could provide incentives to  employers already offering 401(k) plans to switch to SIMPLE IRAs, which  have fewer reporting requirements.", "Employee incentives to participate in IRAs. Experts offered several  proposals to encourage workers to participate in IRAs, including: (1)  expanding existing tax credits  for moderate- and low-income workers, (2)  offering automatic enrollment in payroll-deduction IRAs, and (3)  increasing public awareness about the importance of saving for retirement  and how to do so. Several experts said expanding the scope of the  Retirement Savings Contribution Credit, commonly known as the saver\u2019s  credit, could encourage IRA participation among workers who are not  covered by an employer-sponsored retirement plan. They said expanding  the saver\u2019s credit to include more middle-income earners and making the  credit refundable\u2014available to tax filers even if they do not owe income  tax\u2014could encourage more moderate- and low-income individuals to  participate in IRAs. However, an expanded and refundable tax credit  would have revenue implications for the federal budget. Other experts told  us that automatically enrolling workers into payroll-deduction and  SIMPLE IRAs could increase employee participation; however, small  business groups and IRA providers said that mandatory automatic  enrollment could be burdensome to small employers. In addition, given  the lack of available income for some, several experts told us that low- income workers may opt out of automatic enrollment programs or be  more inclined to make early withdrawals, which can result in additional  income taxes. Experts also said increasing public awareness of the  importance of saving for retirement and educating individuals how to do  so could increase IRA participation.

Although studies show that individuals find it difficult to save for  retirement on their own, millions of U.S. workers have no retirement  savings plan at work. Employer-sponsored and payroll-deduction IRAs  afford an easier way for workers, particularly those who work for small  employers, to save for retirement. They also offer employers less  burdensome reporting and legal responsibilities than defined benefit  pension plans and defined contribution plans, such as 401(k) plans.  Yet, encouraging employers to offer IRAs to their employees will not be  productive if Congress and regulators do not make sure that there is also  adequate information and improved oversight of employer-sponsored and  payroll-deduction IRAs. Given that limited reporting requirements for  employer-sponsored IRAs and the absence of reporting requirements for  payroll-deduction IRAs were meant to encourage small employers to offer  retirement plans to employees, providing more complete and consistent  data on IRAs would help ensure that regulators have the information they  need to make informed decisions about how to increase coverage and  facilitate retirement savings.

Even though Labor\u2019s Interpretive Bulletin addresses  some costs related to payroll-deduction programs, because we do not  know the actual costs of managing a payroll-deduction IRA program, it is  difficult to determine if these remedies are sufficient.

IRA providers told us that Labor\u2019s guidance lacks  adequate flexibility for employers to promote these IRAs to their  employees, without operating outside of the safe harbor and potentially  becoming subject to ERISA Title I requirements.  In addition, as we noted  in our report, employers have indicated that they are hesitant to offer  payroll-deduction IRAs due to the possibility that ERISA fiduciary  responsibilities could apply.", "In response to our second recommendation that Labor evaluate ways to  determine whether employers who establish employer-sponsored IRAs  and offer payroll-deduction IRAs are in compliance with law, while taking  employer burden into account, Labor simply described its enforcement  program and its reliance on targeting, and stated that during the past three  fiscal years, 170 SIMPLE IRAs and SEP plans had been investigated with  approximately $1.2 million obtained in monetary results.", "We acknowledge that Labor\u2019s enforcement program for employer- sponsored IRAs has led to investigations and has produced monetary  results.  However, as indicated in our report, Labor has primarily relied on  the complaints of participants as sources for its investigations, as about 90  percent of its investigations into employer-sponsored IRAs were the result  of participant complaints.  In addition, our report indicates that because of  the limited reporting requirements for employer-sponsored IRAs, Labor  does not have specific information on employers that sponsor such IRAs,  or even how many there are.  Because Labor lacks such information, it is  unable to target and investigate potential ERISA violations for employer- sponsored IRAs.  We do not believe the information provided by Labor on  its enforcement activities precludes our recommendation and we believe  our recommendation remains valid.", "Regarding our third recommendation that Labor evaluate ways to collect  additional information on employer-sponsored and payroll-deduction  IRAs, Labor\u2019s comments focused on statutory requirements and policy  considerations, and stated that any collection of information on employer- sponsored and payroll-deduction IRAs should not impose burdens on  employers to report information. The intent of our recommendation was  to evaluate alternative, less burdensome approaches to obtain important  information, such as through the Bureau of Labor Statistics National  Compensation Survey.  As we noted in our report, key information on  IRAs is currently not reported and ensuring that such information is  obtained can help determine valuable information about whether  employers are choosing to sponsor employer-sponsored IRAs or offer  payroll-deduction IRAs, and whether individuals are able to build  retirement savings through these vehicles.  We do not believe the  information provided by Labor makes our recommendation less important  and we believe our recommendation remains valid.", "In response to our recommendation that IRS provide Labor with summary  information on IRAs and information collected on employers that sponsor  IRAs, and release its reports on IRA contributions, accumulations, and  distributions on a consistent basis, IRS stated that it recognizes the need  for federal agencies and others to have access to routine and timely  information on IRAs and then listed the information it currently provides.   IRS also stated that it will continue to provide data and ensure that Labor  receives information on IRAs on the same day that such information is  published or otherwise made available to the public.  Although IRS will be  providing summary information on all IRAs to Labor and for public  information, we stand by our recommendation that IRS should also  consider providing information to Labor and others on employers that  sponsor IRAs, such as the number of employers that sponsor SEP and  SIMPLE IRAs, which is currently absent in the information IRS stated it  would provide to Labor.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Commissioner of Internal  Revenue, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury;  appropriate congressional committees; and other interested parties.
