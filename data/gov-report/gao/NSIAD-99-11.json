The Chief of Staff stressed that Congress and the Army could accelerate the development of new technologies by making funds available more quickly than is normally required in the budget process for new programs. The Army proposed WRAP as a tool that would help jump-start technologies that were still under development but nearing the production phase.", "These new technologies were being tested in Army experiments designed to support a new warfighting concept called Force XXI. Force XXI embodies the Army\u2019s vision of how military operations will be carried out in the 21st century and relies heavily on the fielding in the year 2000 of the 4th Infantry Division, the Army\u2019s first digitized division. The Army selected technologies slated for WRAP funding from those tested in the Task  Force XXI Advanced Warfighting Experiment (AWE), completed in March 1997 and carried out to support the first digitized division.", "Congress added $50 million to the Army\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget. The money eventually funded the first 11 WRAP initiatives. However, the House Committee on Appropriations, in its report on the fiscal year 1997 defense appropriations bill, expressed concern that WRAP funds might be used for limited fielding of unbudgeted items that had not competed for funds and would not be affordable in future budgets. Therefore, it required notification to the defense committees prior to the obligation of WRAP funds and stipulated that these funds could not be used to field interim Land Warrior prototypes.", "When it established the program in early 1996, the Army planned to request $100 million per year from fiscal year 1998 to 2003. In its guidance for the program, the Army established the condition that these funds could not be used for technologies requiring \u201cindefinite experimentation\u201d and that WRAP candidates must be a compelling experimental success, urgently needed, ready for production within 2 years, and sufficiently funded in the out-years. Technologies requiring \u201ccontinued experimentation\u201d were to be allowed to receive WRAP funding. According to the Army, these differ from technologies needing indefinite experimentation in that they are not mature but are expected to start production within 2 years.", "Selected initiatives are funded from the Force XXI Initiatives (WRAP) budget, which is a holding account created expressly for WRAP initiatives. In fiscal year 1998, Congress appropriated $99.9 million for WRAP: $61 million for the second year of the first 11 initiatives and $38.9 million for the first year of new 1998-99 initiatives. However, recent actions taken by the Department of Defense (DOD) and the congressional appropriations committees will affect funding for new initiatives. For example, DOD reduced fiscal year 1998 WRAP funding for 1998-99 initiatives to $8.6 million (see app. I), and the appropriations conference committee reduced fiscal year 1999 WRAP funding by $35 million to $64.5 million.", "On July 16, 1998, the Army submitted 6 new candidates for funding in fiscal years 1998-99 and 4 new ones for funding in fiscal years 1999-2000 (detailed descriptions of the 21 initiatives and candidates are in app. I). On September 25, 1998, the appropriations conference committee denied funding for two of the four fiscal year 1999-2000 candidates. The Army plans to submit additional fiscal year 1999-2000 candidates by December 1998. The Army is also required by the Senate Armed Services Committee to submit quarterly reports on the status of obligated funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WRAP Implementation to Date", "paragraphs": ["WRAP has experienced growing pains in its first 2 years. While evolving, the program has lacked focus in the selection of initiatives. The assumptions and expectations that drove WRAP at its inception have not been clearly stated. As a result, we were unable to determine whether the results are consistent with congressional intent. However, we found that (1) some initiatives do not support the first digitized division, although the Army initially justified WRAP funding on the basis of the need to urgently field technologies associated with the first digitized division; (2) funds have been used both for production items and development work; and (3) future initiatives may not have sufficient test data for proper evaluation. Furthermore, the Army is still trying to refine its selection process so as to avoid the delays that so far have hindered the program\u2019s implementation. Meanwhile, Congress is not being informed of the program\u2019s progress or of changes in some ongoing initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Wide Range of Initiatives Were Funded", "paragraphs": ["WRAP criteria for selection of initiatives allow considerable room for interpretation. Therefore, the WRAP initiatives funded so far are quite different from each other. Some initiatives did not meet all the Army\u2019s criteria for WRAP funding, and others will not be fielded with the first digitized division in 2000. They were approved, however, because they fit the general description of urgently needed new technologies that the Army is trying to field as quickly as possible. WRAP funds were also used to purchase production items rather than to develop new technologies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "WRAP\u2019s Link to the Digitized Division Is Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Neither congressional restrictions nor the Army\u2019s criteria specify whether WRAP funds should be used only to support the Army\u2019s first digitized division. However, the Army initially justified WRAP funding on the basis of the urgent need to field technologies associated with the first digitized division, and appropriation of that funding occurred in a strategic environment dominated by development of the first digitized division. For example, the Task Force XXI AWE was carried out to support the digitized division, the first 11 WRAP initiatives were tested in the Task Force XXI AWE, the Army\u2019s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) cited support for the first digitized division as the top priority when selecting WRAP candidates, about two thirds of fiscal year 1997 funding was for initiatives that support the first digitized division, and the Army initially placed WRAP funds under the digitization budget before establishing a separate Force XXI initiatives budget.", "There is disagreement within the Army about whether WRAP should be directly linked to the first digitized division. An Operational Test and Evaluation Command (OPTEC) official believes that WRAP is directly related to digitization, while the Director of the Acquisition Reform Reinvention Lab, Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Army for Research, Development, and Acquisition, believes that WRAP is an acquisition streamlining tool that may or may not support digitization. He views WRAP as part of the Army\u2019s efforts to field needed technologies more rapidly, regardless of their relationship to the digitized division.", "We found that 3 of the first 11 initiatives, accounting for about one third of all WRAP funds, will not be part of the first digitized division. These initiatives, the Mortar Fire Control System, the Gun Laying and Positioning System, and the Avenger Slew-to-Cue, together received $14.3 million in WRAP funds in fiscal year 1997 and are slated to receive $22.5 million in fiscal year 1998. However, all six of the WRAP candidates submitted for fiscal years 1998-99 funding are considered critical for the first digitized division."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All Initiatives Met Production Criterion", "paragraphs": ["Two initiatives, Applique and Tactical Internet, did not meet the Army\u2019s criterion that WRAP candidates be ready for production within 2 years, but as the backbone of the Army\u2019s first digitized division, they were justified on the basis of urgent need.  Both were approved as continued experimentation initiatives and are not expected to begin production until fiscal year 2004. An OPTEC official told us that other initiatives were clearly closer to fielding but that the Army approved Applique and Tactical Internet because it believed they were worth the expense of additional development work. They received $12.3 million (about 26 percent) of the $47.7 million of fiscal year 1997 WRAP funds and will receive $8.6 million (about 14 percent) of the $61 million of fiscal year 1998 WRAP funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Purchases of Production Items", "paragraphs": ["WRAP funds have also been used to purchase substantial quantities of production items (finished products ready for fielding). The Army allocated $17.6 million of $61 million (about 29 percent) of WRAP funds in fiscal year 1998 to procure production items. For example, the Army will use 1998 WRAP funds to procure 432 Movement Tracking Systems, enough to fully equip 2 Army divisions.", "WRAP was created to help jump-start new technologies that require developmental work and that must be fielded quickly. But production items by definition do not require further testing or development. Army criteria allow the use of WRAP funds for operational prototypes but do not specify what distinguishes a prototype from a finished production item.", "In our opinion, using WRAP funds to purchase large quantities of finished products (more than are needed for operational prototypes) is not consistent with the WRAP goal of developing new technologies until they are ready for production. In response to our questions about this issue, the Director of the Acquisition Reform Reinvention Lab told us that the Army now acknowledges that the practice should be discontinued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reduced Testing and Experimentation for Future Candidates", "paragraphs": ["The Army has not scheduled any AWEs through 1999 to test new technologies. Consequently, it may be forced to rely increasingly on candidates that have not proven themselves through prior testing, require long-term experimentation, or may not be ready to begin production within 2 years. Officials have expressed concern that this approach may eventually lead to candidates that are less developed and take longer to field. Some approved initiatives have not been proven in testing and are less developed. While only 2 of 11 WRAP initiatives in fiscal years 1997-98 were defined as requiring continued experimentation, 3 of 10 candidates in fiscal years 1998-99 fell into this category.", "OPTEC was the lead evaluator for the Task Force XXI AWE. It evaluated the 72 participating initiatives and prepared ratings for 13 WRAP candidates.However, two of the three new continued experimentation WRAP candidates (Close Combat Tactical Trainer XXI and Global Combat Service Support System-Army) have not provided enough test and experimentation data to allow OPTEC to carry out a thorough evaluation and rating. They were still unrated as of July 1998. On September 25, 1998, the appropriations conference committee denied funding for both candidates.", "OPTEC may decline to issue a rating if it does not have enough data to conclude that the candidate is a compelling experimental success as required by Army criteria. An OPTEC official said that the Army will find it increasingly difficult to demonstrate such success because it has not scheduled any AWEs or similar large-scale exercises through fiscal year 1999. Without AWEs, he added, it will be difficult to find new candidates at the same level of development and experimental testing as the first group of candidates. He said that evaluation criteria may need to be changed to introduce other ways of qualifying candidates. In our opinion, this could result in more candidates that need continued experimentation.", "Meanwhile, the Army is trying to fill the gap created by the absence of AWEs. The Director of the Army Acquisition Reform Reinvention Lab said the Army is seeking alternatives to AWEs to expand its pool of WRAP candidates. The alternatives could include advanced technology and advanced concept technology demonstrations, concept experimentation programs, and battle lab warfighting experiments. Such candidate technologies could then use WRAP funds to move more quickly through development and into production. However, in our opinion, these demonstrations may involve technologies that require lengthy testing and experimentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Program Delays Have Affected the Goal of Early Fielding", "paragraphs": ["The key to securing timely congressional approval of WRAP candidates is the Army\u2019s ability to finalize its selection early enough in the budget cycle. To date, this has not happened. In requesting the release of fiscal year 1997 funds from DOD, the Army did not initially justify the need for or indicate the ultimate destination of the funds, delaying the start-up and implementation of programs. As a result, approval of WRAP funds was delayed until very late in the fiscal year (see app. II for a description of the Army\u2019s process for WRAP candidate selection). Additionally, funding reductions have also affected implementation. In the end, for most initiatives, WRAP probably will not speed up fielding as much as initially hoped.", "The 1997 WRAP selection and approval process lasted most of fiscal year 1997. The Army narrowed its list of candidates from 300 to 15 and made its final selection after reviewing the results of a March 1997 Task Force XXI AWE evaluation. The Army did not present the final 11 candidates to Congress until May 30, 1997. But even after the candidates were selected, DOD withheld $47.7 million for several months in fiscal year 1997 because the Army had not clearly stated which programs would receive the funds and how the funds would be used. DOD released $17.5 million of the funds in August 1997 and the remainder in late September 1997. In fiscal year 1998, DOD again withheld funds, saying it wanted to be certain they were needed. As of October 8, 1998, $36.9 million of fiscal year 1998 funds still had not been released.", "The Army has been trying to speed up its selection process in order to receive WRAP funds earlier in the fiscal year, but with little success. The fiscal year 1998 selection process took even longer than it had the previous year and the Army did not present its list of candidates to Congress until July 1998. This time the process was reportedly delayed by continuing debate within the Army over candidates, insufficient test data, and indecision about whether to submit candidates all at once or in batches, as they were selected. The Army has acknowledged the need to start candidate selection earlier. For fiscal year 1999, it plans to convene the next Army Systems Acquisition Review Council in November 1998,  2 months earlier than the previous year, and submit the last batch of 1999 candidates to Congress no later than December 1998.", "Funding cuts by DOD also affected the program. DOD reprogrammed WRAP funds to other operations, such as the Small Business Innovation Research Program. In fiscal years 1997 and 1998, DOD reprogrammed $2.3 million and $5 million, respectively, from WRAP to other programs. In addition, a June 1998 omnibus reprogramming action further reduced fiscal year 1998 WRAP funds for new initiatives by $27.8 million, leaving funding for new initiatives at $8.6 million. Army Airborne Command and Control System officials estimated that the loss of about $0.6 million of an $11 million WRAP allocation in fiscal year 1998 could delay the program by about 3 months. In another program, officials agreed that even losses as small as $0.2 million can have a negative effect on program plans.", "Although there have been delays, we believe that many WRAP-funded technologies may be fielded sooner because of the program. The Army initially estimated that 9 of the first 11 WRAP initiatives would accelerate the fielding of new technologies by an average of about 20 months. In its justification to Congress, the Army did not provide accelerated fielding estimates for two initiatives. Most estimates were made by the Army before the initiatives were approved and had to be revised because the selection and approval process took too long and funds were not released when planned. According to the latest fielding projections by program officials, six of the nine programs may not save as much time as originally claimed, two may accelerate fielding as originally estimated, and one may actually be ahead of the original fielding estimate (see table 1). Fielding could be postponed further if there are more delays or funding shortfalls."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Congress Not Notified of Program Changes", "paragraphs": ["The Army made substantial changes to some WRAP initiatives. These changes prolonged implementation. The Army concluded, for example, that the design of Avenger Slew-to-Cue was deficient and that the technology would become obsolete before it would be fielded. In fiscal year 1997, the Army thus made major changes in the design and acquisition strategy of the program; this led to additional development work and testing. Because of these changes, DOD has been withholding 1998 WRAP funding for the initiative. The Gun Laying and Positioning System also experienced a schedule slippage that will delay fielding. According to the program manager, the slippage will make it necessary to alter funding (for example, by shifting funds from the out-years to underfunded or unfunded years) in order to accelerate fielding. The congressional defense committees were not informed of these developments.", "The Army is not required to issue progress reports or to notify Congress of changes in ongoing programs. The only formal feedback mechanism is a congressional requirement that the Army submit quarterly funding reports to the Senate Armed Services Committee on the obligation of funds for WRAP initiatives.

In the absence of more precise selection criteria, disagreements over which candidates are most appropriate for WRAP funding will likely continue.", "The Army may find it increasingly difficult to identify candidates that are sufficiently developed in the near future because it has reduced large-scale test and experimentation exercises and will thus have less data with which to assess new WRAP candidates.", "The Army has not presented its slate of WRAP candidates for congressional approval early enough in the fiscal year to permit timely obligation of funds. This has led directly to delays in fielding because estimates were predicated on earlier availability of funds. Although some technologies may be fielded sooner because of WRAP, in most cases the program will not speed up fielding as much as originally expected.", "The Army is required to report quarterly on the status of funding obligations to the Senate Armed Services Committee. To date, it has not met this requirement, and there is no other requirement for reporting on program performance or status.
