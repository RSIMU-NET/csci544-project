This report specifically examines (1) the extent to which DOD and VA have resolved persistent problems facing recovering servicemembers and veterans as they navigate the recovery care continuum, and (2) the reasons DOD and VA leadership have not been able to fully resolve any remaining problems. To address these objectives, GAO visited 11 DOD and VA medical facilities selected for population size and range of available resources and met with servicemembers and veterans to identify problems they continue to face. GAO also reviewed documents related to specific DOD and VA programs that assist recovering servicemembers and veterans and interviewed the leadership and staff of these programs to determine why problems have not been fully resolved."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Deficiencies exposed at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in 2007 served as a catalyst compelling the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA) to address a host of problems for wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers and veterans as they navigate through the recovery care continuum. This continuum extends from acute medical treatment and stabilization, through rehabilitation to reintegration, either back to active duty or to the civilian community as a veteran. In spite of 5 years of departmental efforts, recovering servicemembers and veterans are still facing problems with this process and may not be getting the services they need. Key departmental efforts included the creation or modification of various care coordination and case management programs, including the military services' wounded warrior programs. However, these programs are not always accessible to those who need them due to the inconsistent methods, such as referrals, used to identify potentially eligible servicemembers, as well as inconsistent eligibility criteria across the military services' wounded warrior programs. The departments also jointly established an integrated disability evaluation system to expedite the delivery of benefits to servicemembers. However, processing times for disability determinations under the new system have increased since 2007, resulting in lengthy wait times that limit servicemembers' ability to plan for their future. Finally, despite years of incremental efforts, DOD and VA have yet to develop sufficient capabilities for electronically sharing complete health records, which potentially delays servicemembers' receipt of coordinated care and benefits as they transition from DOD's to VA's health care system.", "Collectively, a lack of leadership, oversight, resources, and collaboration has contributed to the departments' inability to fully resolve problems facing recovering servicemembers and veterans. Initially, departmental leadership exhibited focus and commitment--through the Senior Oversight Committee--to addressing problems related to case management and care coordination, disability evaluation systems, and data sharing between DOD and VA. However, the committee's oversight waned over time, and in January 2012, it was merged with the VA/DOD Joint Executive Council. Whether this council--which has primarily focused on long-term strategic planning--can effectively address the shorter-term policy focused issues once managed by the Senior Oversight Committee remains to be seen. Furthermore, DOD does not provide central oversight of the military services' wounded warrior programs, preventing it from determining how well these programs are working across the department. However, despite these shortcomings, the departments continue to take steps to resolve identified problems, such as increasing the number of staff involved with the electronic sharing of health records and the integrated disability evaluation process. Additionally, while the departments' previous attempts to collaborate on how to resolve case management and care coordination problems have largely been unsuccessful, a joint task force established in May 2012 is focused on resolving long-standing areas of disagreement between VA, DOD, and the military services. However, without more robust oversight and military service compliance, consistent implementation of policies that result in more effective case management and care coordination programs may be unattainable. GAO recommends that DOD provide central oversight of the military services' wounded warrior programs and that DOD and VA sustain high-level leadership attention and collaboration to fully resolve identified problems. DOD partially concurred with the recommendation for central oversight of the wounded warrior programs, citing issues with common eligibility criteria and systematic monitoring. DOD and VA both concurred with the recommendation for sustained leadership attention."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD provide central oversight of the military services\u0092 wounded warrior programs and that DOD and VA sustain high-level leadership attention and collaboration to fully resolve identified problems.

Several review groups were subsequently tasked with  investigating the reported problems and identifying recommendations.  These groups identified common areas of concern including: inadequate  case management to ensure continuity of care, confusing disability  evaluation systems, and insufficient sharing of servicemembers\u2019 health  records and other data between DOD and VA\u2014all long-standing  problems that we have reported on extensively.", "To elevate the response to concerns raised by these review groups, DOD  and VA established the Wounded, Ill, and Injured Senior Oversight  Committee (Senior Oversight Committee) in May 2007. The committee  was intended to operate on a short-term basis to review and implement  the recommendations made by the various review groups and improve  seamlessness in the provision of care for recovering servicemembers and  veterans. It was cochaired by the Deputy Secretaries of Defense and  Veterans Affairs and included the military service Secretaries and other  high-ranking officials within the departments. Congress subsequently  passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008  (NDAA 2008) requiring the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of  Veterans Affairs to jointly develop and implement policy, to the extent  feasible, to improve the care, management, and transition of recovering  servicemembers.

In 2007, one of the review groups, the  President\u2019s Commission on Care for America\u2019s Returning Wounded  Warriors\u2014commonly referred to as the Dole-Shalala Commission\u2014noted  that recovering servicemembers depend on the effective and efficient  provision of medical services and benefits across the recovery care  continuum, which is separated into three phases:  recovery, when wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers are  stabilized and receive acute inpatient medical treatment at an MTF,  VAMC, or private medical facility;  rehabilitation, when recovering servicemembers with complex trauma,  such as missing limbs, receive medical and rehabilitative care; and  reintegration, when servicemembers either return to active duty or to  the civilian community as veterans.", "A recovering servicemember or veteran may not experience the recovery  care continuum as a linear process, and may move back and forth across  the continuum over time, depending on his or her medical needs.

As an initial step, the departments established the  Senior Oversight Committee to coordinate and oversee DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s  efforts to jointly resolve these problems. Through this committee, DOD  and VA created programs and initiatives to assist recovering  servicemembers and veterans as they navigate the recovery care  continuum. Key efforts included the establishment of the integrated  disability evaluation system (IDES), the Federal Recovery Coordination  Program (FRCP), the Recovery Coordination Program (RCP), and the  Interagency Program Office.

The Senior Oversight Committee was  responsible for ensuring that the recommendations\u2014which totaled more  than 600 from the various review groups\u2014were properly reviewed,  coordinated, implemented, and resourced. Supporting the Senior  Oversight Committee was an Overarching Integrated Product Team, the  membership of which included the Assistant Secretaries of Defense, the  military departments\u2019 Assistant Secretaries for Manpower and Reserve  Affairs, and various senior officials from DOD and VA. This team  coordinated, integrated, and synchronized the work of the eight \u201cLines of  Action\u201d (LOA) that focused on specific issues, including case  management, disability evaluation systems, and data sharing between  DOD and VA. (See fig. 2.)", "Each LOA included representation from DOD, including each military  service, and VA. They performed the bulk of the work to address the  issues and recommendations of the various review groups, including  establishing plans, setting and tracking milestones, and identifying and  enacting early and short-term solutions.

Through LOA 1, DOD  and VA jointly began to develop and pilot IDES to improve the disability  evaluation process by eliminating duplication in DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s separate  evaluation systems and expediting the receipt of VA benefits. Specifically,  IDES merges DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s separate medical exams for  servicemembers into a single exam process; consolidates DOD\u2019s and  VA\u2019s separate disability rating decisions into a single VA rating decision;  and provides staff to perform outreach and nonclinical case management  and explain VA results and processes to servicemembers. By October  2011, DOD and VA had fully deployed IDES at 139 MTFs in the United  States and several other countries.", "Care Coordination Programs. LOA 3 took the lead role in addressing  problems with uncoordinated case management for recovering  servicemembers and veterans through the establishment of two care  coordination programs\u2014the FRCP and the RCP. The FRCP was based  on a recommendation from the Dole-Shalala Commission that a single  individual\u2014a recovery coordinator\u2014would work with existing DOD and  VA case managers to ensure that servicemembers had the resources  needed for their care. LOA 3 designed the FRCP to assist \u201cseverely\u201d  wounded, ill, and injured OEF and OIF servicemembers, veterans, and  their families with access to care, services, and benefits. This population  includes servicemembers and veterans who suffer from traumatic brain  injuries, amputations, burns, spinal cord injuries, visual impairment, and  PTSD. The program uses federal recovery coordinators to monitor and  coordinate clinical services, including facilitating and coordinating medical  appointments, and nonclinical services, such as providing assistance with  obtaining financial benefits or special accommodations, needed by  program enrollees and their families. Federal recovery coordinators, who  are senior-level registered nurses and licensed clinical social workers,  were intended to serve as the single point of contact among all of the  case managers of DOD, VA, and other governmental and  nongovernmental programs that provide services directly to  servicemembers and veterans. Although the FRCP was designed as a  joint program, it is administered by VA, and the federal recovery  coordinators are VA employees.", "LOA 3 subsequently developed the RCP in response to a requirement in  the NDAA 2008. The RCP is a DOD-specific program that uses recovery  care coordinators to coordinate nonclinical services and resources for  \u201cseriously\u201d wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers who may return to  active duty, unlike those categorized as \u201cseverely\u201d wounded, ill, and  injured, who are not likely to return to duty and would be served by the  FRCP. The military services were responsible for separately  implementing the RCP through each of their existing wounded warrior  programs as a means of providing care coordination services to program  enrollees.", "Electronic Sharing of Health Records. LOA 4 was focused on addressing  issues related to the electronic exchange of DOD and VA health records.  However, this effort was superseded by the NDAA 2008, which required  the establishment of the Interagency Program Office to serve as a single  point of accountability for both departments in the development and  implementation of interoperable electronic health records.DOD and VA retained the responsibility for the development and   Although  management of the information technology systems, the Interagency  Program Office was responsible for ensuring the implementation of an  electronic health records system or capabilities that allowed for the  complete sharing of health care information for the provision of clinical  care.

The military services\u2019  wounded warrior programs were established to assist recovering  servicemembers during their recovery, rehabilitation, and initial  reintegration back to active duty or to civilian life. Most of these programs  provide nonclinical case management services to the recovering  servicemembers; that is, they help to resolve issues related to finances,  benefits and compensation, administrative and personnel paperwork,  housing, and transportation. In addition, the wounded warrior programs  serve as the central point of access to other types of services or  resources that support recovering servicemembers, such as clinical case  management, care coordination, and career, education, and readiness  services. (See table 1.) If a wounded warrior program does not directly  provide a service or resource, it can facilitate servicemembers\u2019 access to  that service or resource.

As of August 2012, the Liaison for Healthcare Program employed  33 liaisons at 18 MTFs nationwide. After a DOD or VA treatment team  determines that a recovering servicemember is medically ready to  transition to a VAMC, a VA liaison facilitates the transfer from an MTF to  a VAMC closest to their homes or to the most appropriate locations for  the specialized services their medical condition requires. VA liaisons  follow recovering servicemembers as they enter the VA health care  system, ensuring that their first VA appointments are scheduled.

The military  services\u2019 wounded warrior programs primarily use referrals to identify  recovering servicemembers that might be eligible for enrollment.  However, we found that the methods for referral, which include casualty  reports and direct referrals, are imprecise, such that all servicemembers  who could benefit from being enrolled in these programs are not  necessarily identified and referred.", "Officials from three wounded warrior programs told us that casualty  reports are the primary method for receiving referrals. Casualty reports  are initial alerts to military personnel, including wounded warrior program  officials, that a servicemember has been injured. These reports can be  initiated by unit commands or other military personnel as a method of  referral to the wounded warrior programs. However, wounded warrior  program officials from four wounded warrior programs told us that  casualty reports are not created after every injury or may be created late  in a servicemember\u2019s recovery. In particular, some of these officials said  that military service unit command staff may delay or not create casualty  reports for servicemembers not injured in combat, such as for injuries that  occur stateside or while on leave, because servicemembers\u2019 units may  not find out about such incidents immediately.", "We found that referrals by unit command staff are most likely, because they have the  most knowledge about servicemembers\u2019 conditions, injuries, and treatment locations. their recovery as a result of staying in their units and not being referred to  a wounded warrior program earlier. For example, a recovering  servicemember told us that despite having been recently discharged from  a hospital for arm injuries, he was required to operate a floor buffing  machine in his unit, which was difficult for him as a result of his injuries.  He did not receive rehabilitative treatment for his injuries until he was  assigned to a wounded warrior program. Furthermore, we found that most  of the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs do not always track  the number of referrals to their programs, including data on whether or  not servicemembers referred to the programs were actually enrolled. (See  table 14 in app. I for additional information about referral data.) Without  this information, it is not clear whether all those who could benefit from a  wounded warrior program are being enrolled.", "Referral to the FRCP. In addition to problems with referrals to wounded  warrior programs, wounded warrior program officials sometimes delay or  fail to make referrals of potentially eligible servicemembers to the FRCP,  which coordinates care across the departments and throughout the  recovery care continuum. As we have previously reported, the FRCP  relies predominantly on referrals from other sources, including wounded  warrior program officials and clinical treatment teams, because it does not  have a systematic way to identify potential enrollees. Referrals to the  FRCP are important because federal recovery coordinators are intended  to provide continuity of care throughout servicemembers\u2019 recovery,  starting with their initial treatment at an MTF and throughout the recovery  care continuum. They can also assist in facilitating recovering  servicemembers\u2019 access to VA services and benefits while  servicemembers are still on active duty, according to VA officials.  However, we found that officials from wounded warrior programs view the  jointly created and established FRCP as a VA program and, therefore,  delay their referrals until it is certain that the servicemember will become  a veteran.", "Referrals for certain servicemember populations. We found that certain  servicemember populations may be at greater risk for not being identified  for DOD and VA case management and care coordination programs.", "Specifically, according to wounded warrior program officials,  servicemembers who have undiagnosed, \u201cinvisible\u201d wounds, such as  PTSD and TBI, may be at greater risk of not being referred to a wounded  warrior program or the FRCP until it becomes apparent that the  servicemember cannot be deployed. For example, a servicemember told  us that although he was experiencing anxiety every time he put on his  uniform, it was not until he had a severe anxiety attack, as a result of his  PTSD, that he was hospitalized and then referred to a wounded warrior  program. According to officials representing military advocacy  organizations, National Guard and Reserve servicemembers may be  particularly reluctant to identify injuries and illnesses because they are  eager to return home and do not want to be delayed at the installation for  an evaluation of any conditions they may have. However, these officials  said that when these servicemembers have been deactivated and  problems manifest themselves later on, they may experience difficulties  establishing that their injuries or illnesses are a result of their service in  the military, which could make it difficult for them to access services and  programs provided by DOD and VA.", "Because of variations in eligibility criteria among the military services\u2019  wounded warrior programs, DOD cannot assure that similarly situated  servicemembers have equitable access to these programs, leading to  disparities in the level of assistance provided across the military services.  (See table 2.) For example, servicemembers can only be eligible for the  Air Force Wounded Warrior Program if they have a combat-related injury  or illness, whereas servicemembers with combat or non-combat-related  injuries or illnesses can be eligible for the Army\u2019s Warrior Transition Units.", "As a result of these differences in eligibility criteria, recovering  servicemembers in one military service may qualify for entry in their  wounded warrior program while similarly situated servicemembers in  another military service do not have access to their program.  Consequently, according to wounded warrior program officials, some  recovering servicemembers do not have access to services that would  otherwise be available to them, including the RCP and Operation  Warfighter. Additionally, because wounded warrior programs facilitate  access to other programs and services, including the VA Liaison for  Healthcare Program and the Warrior Athlete Reconditioning Program,  not being eligible for a particular wounded warrior program could preclude  a servicemember from receiving the services of these other programs.  Military coalition officials who advocate for recovering servicemembers  and their families told us the lack of standardization across similar  programs, such as the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs, is  one of the main reasons recovering servicemembers \u201cfall through the  cracks\u201d or do not get the services that they need when they are  navigating the recovery care continuum.", "DOD is aware of inconsistencies in eligibility criteria among the military  services\u2019 wounded warrior programs and the potential for disparities in the  provision of services and assistance that may result. DOD has not taken  action to correct this, however, despite the identification of this issue as a  potential problem for recovering servicemembers by a congressionally  mandated DOD task force. Specifically, in its 2011 annual report to  congressional committees, the Recovering Warrior Task Force noted that  as a result of differences in eligibility criteria among the military services,  certain subpopulations of recovering servicemembers may be at a  disadvantage. In response to this report, DOD stated that although there  are no DOD-wide criteria for entry into wounded warrior programs, the  individual military services already have policies in place as a result of the  flexibility given to them by DOD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Delays in DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s Integrated Disability Evaluation System Persist, Limiting Recovering Servicemembers\u2019 Ability to Plan for Their Future", "paragraphs": ["Although IDES provides improved timeliness over the separate DOD and  VA disability evaluation systems, processing times have continued to  increase since its implementation in November 2007, resulting in  frustration and uncertainty for servicemembers going through the  process.

Similarly, a wounded warrior  program official also told us that her program has had several  servicemembers lose job opportunities because they applied for positions  thinking that they would be through the IDES process by a certain date,  but when that date was pushed back, the employers rescinded their  offers.", "Wounded warrior program officials from some of the sites we visited told  us that extended waiting periods resulting from the disability process also  may lead to some recovering servicemembers engaging in negative  behavior, including drug use. Wounded warrior program officials told us  that after waiting for so long in the wounded warrior barracks due to the  lengthy disability process, servicemembers can get depressed, resist or  just stop going to medical appointments, and stop working on their  recovery. Similarly, the DOD Inspector General has reported that lengthy  IDES processing times has contributed to a negative and even  counterproductive environment, which was not conducive to  servicemembers\u2019 recovery and transition. To prevent these problems,  we found that two wounded warrior programs require recovering  servicemembers to participate in programs such as the Warrior Athlete  Reconditioning Program and Operation Warfighter. A recovering  servicemember told us that soon after being assigned to the wounded  warrior program, he was referred to the Warrior Athlete Reconditioning  Program, which gave him something to do other than \u201csitting around.\u201d  Another recovering servicemember told us that the Warrior Athlete  Reconditioning Program is an effective motivator for recovery.", "Conversely, the servicemembers could take actions that may impact their  own processing times in IDES and, therefore, their length of stay in a  wounded warrior program. We found that some servicemembers may  appeal their disability decisions to prolong their own recovery and  transition out of the military. According to wounded warrior program  officials from some of the sites we visited, some servicemembers resist  their transfer out of the wounded warrior program and the military  because they want to continue to take advantage of the opportunities and  services available to them, including the financial security of a regular  paycheck. For example, a wounded warrior program official and a VA  official told us that some servicemembers will purposefully miss  appointments to delay the IDES process because they feel that they are  not ready to leave the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and VA Have Yet to Develop Sufficient Capability to Electronically Share Health Records, Potentially Delaying Servicemembers\u2019 Receipt of Coordinated Care and Benefits", "paragraphs": ["The departments have not yet developed sufficient capability to  electronically share servicemembers\u2019 and veterans\u2019 complete health  records, which can delay the receipt of care and benefits for recovering  servicemembers and veterans. As we have previously reported, for over a  decade DOD and VA have undertaken several efforts to improve the  ability of their information technology systems to electronically share  health records. For example, the Federal Health Information Exchange,  which was started in 2001 and completed in 2004, allows DOD to  electronically transfer servicemembers\u2019 health information to VA when  they leave active duty. In addition, the departments\u2019 Bidirectional Health  Information Exchange was established in 2004 to allow clinicians in both  departments to view limited health information on patients who receive  care from both departments. More recently, the departments have  undertaken two new joint initiatives, the Virtual Lifetime Electronic Record  and an integrated electronic health records system, in an effort to  increase electronic health record interoperability and modernize their  systems.", "We found that although DOD and VA care providers were expected to  have access to some electronic health record information across the  departments, the DOD and VA care providers that we spoke to still did  not have the ability to electronically share complete health records for  recovering servicemembers who were transferring between DOD\u2019s and  VA\u2019s health care systems, and therefore they had to use other methods.", "For example, wounded warrior program and VA officials told us that they  had to resort to copying and faxing recovering servicemembers\u2019 health  records to VAMC staff in preparation for a servicemember\u2019s transition  from DOD\u2019s to VA\u2019s health care system because there was not an  automatic, electronic way to transfer them. In addition to copying and  faxing health records, according to VA officials we spoke with, DOD and  VA staff may hold a video-teleconference between the transferring MTF  and receiving VA health care facilities to exchange information.", "In addition, wounded warrior program and VA officials who help  servicemembers transition from DOD to VA told us that they only share  with VA facilities the health records necessary for the treatment of a  recovering servicemember\u2019s current condition. As a result,  servicemembers\u2019 and veterans\u2019 complete health records are not always  shared between departments when transferring facilities, and ultimately,  the responsibility to collect and provide a complete health record to the  VA facility can fall on the recovering servicemember and veteran. A VA  official told us that this process can be complicated because DOD  separately maintains servicemembers\u2019 inpatient, outpatient, and  behavioral health records and does not have a single database that can  identify all of the medical facilities where a servicemember received  treatment. Further, according to VA and DOD officials, delaying the  collection and assembly of a servicemember\u2019s complete medical history  until the start of the disability process could result in servicemembers  having to be reexamined when they are demobilized, needing to establish  that their injuries were connected to their time in the military, thus possibly  delaying a servicemember\u2019s or veteran\u2019s receipt of VA benefits.", "Both departments have needed to create programs and provide staff to  assist recovering servicemembers during their transition from a DOD MTF  to a VAMC. For example, VA Liaisons and DOD nurse case managers  help recovering servicemembers transition from DOD to VA by  assembling their health records and sharing them with the VAMC where  the servicemember will be receiving treatment. According to DOD and VA  staff that assist servicemembers in their transition from one system to  another, DOD nurse case managers at installations that do not have VA  Liaisons do not always have the same knowledge of VA services and  benefits, and may not be informed of the appropriate referral methods or  contacts used by VA Liaisons to provide a servicemember with a  seamless transition to a VAMC. A DOD official told us that at locations  where the VA Liaison program is not available, the transition process for  recovering servicemembers from DOD to VA is more difficult.

The Senior Oversight Committee\u2019s working groups for care  coordination and the integrated disability evaluation system were  realigned within the Joint Executive Council, and a Wounded, Ill, and  Injured Council was established under the Joint Executive Council to  oversee emerging issues for recovering servicemembers and veterans.", "Whether the Joint Executive Council can effectively address the issues  once managed by the Senior Oversight Committee has yet to be seen.  Several DOD and VA officials expressed concern to us about the ability of  the Joint Executive Council to focus on rapid, short-term policy decision  making rather than the longer-term strategic planning role that it has  traditionally played. For example, according to a DOD official, historically,  the Joint Executive Council has not been able to drive policy decision  making, and therefore, issues that should have been decided by the Joint  Executive Council were taken directly to the Secretaries for resolution,  raising doubts about the ability of the Joint Executive Council to function  effectively. A former Senior Oversight Committee executive noted that the  Joint Executive Council cochairs are not of equivalent rank, another  challenge that may serve as a barrier to the council\u2019s ability to make  decisions and drive policy changes. Specifically, the VA cochair is the  Deputy Secretary, who has control over all relevant offices within VA,  while the DOD cochair is the Deputy Undersecretary of Defense for  Personnel and Readiness, whose responsibilities include establishing  health and benefit policies affecting recovering servicemembers and  directing the military services to comply with such policies but lacks  authority in enforcing the military services\u2019 implementation of these  policies. The Recovering Warrior Task Force also cited concerns about  the rank of the DOD cochair of the Joint Executive Council, stating that a  higher level of leadership is needed to sustain departmental attention on  key initiatives such as IDES and electronic health records. Furthermore,  as of August 2012, DOD officials told us that the Joint Executive Council  is operating under the original procedures that were in place prior to the  entities merging. As a result, it is unclear at this time how the Joint  Executive Council will provide oversight and accountability for issues  once addressed by the Senior Oversight Committee.", "In 2008, WWCTP became responsible for overseeing the RCP among  other programs that provide assistance to recovering servicemembers.  However, WWCTP\u2019s ability to oversee the RCP, including its ability to  monitor program performance and ensure compliance with DOD policy, is  limited by its lack of operational authority, such as budget and tasking  authority, over the military services that implement the program.  According to WWCTP officials, this lack of operational authority  challenges WWCTP\u2019s ability to direct the military services on their  implementation of the program. For example, although WWCTP has been  responsible for RCP oversight since 2008, the office was not able to  collect basic program data, such as monthly enrollment numbers, on a  consistent basis until October 2011. According to a WWCTP official,  although WWCTP requested monthly data submissions from the military  services, the information was provided on an ad hoc basis; sometimes  the services would submit it, and other times they would not. Data- collection efforts still remain a challenge for WWCTP. For example, the  Army\u2019s Wounded Warrior Program, which serves as the Army\u2019s care  coordination program, only agrees to share partial data with WWCTP,  arguing that the Army is only obligated to share data on servicemembers  served by WWCTP-contracted personnel.", "Getting the military services to implement consistent care coordination  policies also poses a challenge for WWCTP. WWCTP officials said that  while WWCTP can develop policy to guide the military services, the  military services may interpret that policy and implement their programs  differently. Consequently, some DOD officials assert that the military  services have not consistently implemented the RCP in accordance with  DOD policy\u2014an observation that is shared by the Recovering Warrior  Task Force. DOD policy requires that care coordination should be  provided to those who are \u201cseriously\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d wounded, ill, and  injured, but the Army only provides care coordination to recovering  servicemembers who are \u201cseverely\u201d wounded, ill, and injured. As a  result, some servicemembers who could benefit from having someone  coordinate their care and benefits as they navigate the recovery care  continuum do not have access to those services.", "Some WWCTP officials with whom we spoke expressed the view that the  military services have been inconsistent in their cooperation with  WWCTP, with cooperation being better on issues that represent priorities  of top leadership. Specifically, WWCTP officials told us that top DOD  leadership has not been pressured to resolve lingering care coordination  issues as much as other more visible issues, such as IDES and electronic  medical record interoperability problems confronting the departments.  Consequently, WWCTP officials said that the military services cooperate  with WWCTP\u2019s efforts to oversee IDES and to monitor whether the  military services achieve their goals for timely completion of the IDES  process. Although these goals have not consistently been achieved,officials told us that military service cooperation has not been an  impediment to overseeing IDES as it has been for overseeing care  coordination. Conversely, the military services have not been as inclined  to cooperate with WWCTP on its oversight of the RCP relative to these  other issues.", "In addition to limited operational authority over the military services,  turnover in leadership and other staffing changes have also limited  WWCTP\u2019s ability to provide consistent direction and oversight for the  RCP, according to WWCTP officials. Specifically:", "Three different DOD officials have led WWCTP since its inception in  2008. According to WWCTP staff, each of these officials had different  visions and priorities for the office, which led to disruptions in RCP  oversight. For example, a major oversight initiative\u2014to collect  satisfaction survey data across the RCP\u2014was abandoned when a  new official was appointed. In addition, the RCP has been led by three  different directors, with the most recent director leaving in June 2012.", "In September through December 2011, WWCTP\u2019s contracted staffing  was temporarily reduced by 70 percent when a contract expired and  was not immediately renewed, according to DOD. Staff reductions  primarily impacted WWCTP\u2019s ability to oversee the RCP, since many  RCP support staff members were lost. For example, according to a  WWCTP official, the office was no longer able to make monitoring  visits to the RCP program sites. However, in July 2012 a contract was  awarded that allowed WWCTP to engage additional staff to support  the RCP, according to a WWCTP official.", "In June 2012, DOD changed the name of the WWCTP office to the  Office of Warrior Care Policy and moved it under the Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs. According to a DOD official,  the change was made as part of a realignment of DOD\u2019s  organizational structure in response to statutory requirements. An  official in Health Affairs said that the move will be beneficial because it  will provide greater access to resources, including human resources  and information technology, among others. However, it is too early to  determine the full effect of this change.", "There is currently no central office or authority that oversees or collects  common data on the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs,  preventing DOD from both assessing how well the programs are working  across the department and leveraging the strengths of each program by  sharing proven best practices across the military services.", "Each of the military service Secretaries created their own wounded  warrior programs to meet their military service\u2019s unique needs. Because  each service developed its own policy to govern its wounded warrior  programs and no central, unified DOD policy exists to govern these  programs, no central DOD office\u2014such as WWCTP\u2014may direct how  these programs operate. This lack of central oversight over the wounded  warrior programs has been one of the main reasons for the large  discrepancies between these programs. The 2011 Recovering Warrior  Task Force report recommended that the Secretary of Defense enforce  the existing policy guidance regarding the Army\u2019s and Marines\u2019 wounded  warrior transition units\u2019 entrance criteria. However, in its response to this  recommendation, DOD supported the military service Secretaries\u2019  discretion in establishing their own policies in this regard, saying that  there is no central DOD policy on the establishment of transition units and  entrance criteria, and that the policies were established by the  Secretaries for their specific populations.", "While no common data are collected on the performance of wounded  warrior programs across the military services, each individual program  has initiated internal efforts to collect and analyze performance data. The  type and quality of data vary by program, however. For example, the  largest of the wounded warrior programs, the Army Warrior Care and  Transition Program, has collected wounded warrior program performance  survey data on a continuous basis since March 2007 and has developed  outcome measures to determine the impact of its services. However,  smaller programs, such as the Air Force Wounded Warrior Program and  the United States Special Operations Command\u2019s Care Coalition have  measured baseline program satisfaction levels, but they do not have  additional years of survey data to monitor any changes over time. (See  table 3 for information about the types of performance data collected by  each of the wounded warrior programs.)", "Some DOD officials with whom we spoke questioned why common  measures have not been developed. For example, a DOD official in  charge of wounded warrior care at an MTF suggested developing a  measurement tool to determine what aspects of the programs help  recovering servicemembers. Another DOD official involved with wounded  warrior program performance measurement commented that it is common  practice for DOD to share performance measurement practices and  standard metrics across the military services.", "In September 2011, citing wide disparity across the military services in  their implementation of wounded warrior programs and policies, the  Recovering Warrior Task Force made four recommendations for creating  common standards to ensure parity in the programs and services  provided to recovering servicemembers across DOD. For example, the  first recommendation called for a common nomenclature, or consistent  definitions to be used in DOD policy to identify recovering  servicemembers who may require and be eligible for assistance. The task  force concluded that common definitions are needed to promote  consistent levels of care among the military services and would better  enable DOD to compare across programs and identify best practices. In  its response to the task force, DOD acknowledged that some of these  recommendations were valid and that DOD should take actions to  address them.

Shortly after the RCP was established, DOD sent a report to  congressional committees outlining a medical category assignment  process that was based on the severity of each servicemember\u2019s medical  condition, along with input from the servicemember and his or her unit  commander, to determine whether servicemembers would be directed to  either the FRCP or to the RCP for care coordination services. In concept,  the medical category assignment process would have resulted in  wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers being assigned to one of three  categories: \u201cmild,\u201d \u201cserious,\u201d or \u201csevere.\u201d Under this approach, the FRCP  would provide care coordination services for \u201cseverely\u201d wounded, ill, and  injured servicemembers and the RCP would serve those who were  \u201cseriously\u201d wounded, ill, and injured. (See app. II for additional information  on the intended medical category assignment process for DOD and VA  care coordination programs.)", "Despite DOD\u2019s attempt to define the populations served by the FRCP and  the RCP, neither the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs, which  implement the RCP, nor VA, which administers the FRCP, implemented  DOD\u2019s assignment process. Instead, these programs expanded their  enrollment to include both \u201cseriously\u201d and \u201cseverely\u201d recovering  servicemembers and veterans, which resulted in both programs serving  the same populations, thereby setting up the likelihood of overlap and  duplication of services. As we have previously reported, this duplication  issue is compounded by the numerous other programs that also provide  services to recovering servicemembers and veterans and have  overlapping roles as well. It is not uncommon for recovering  servicemembers to be enrolled in more than one case management or  care coordination program and end up with multiple care coordinators and  case managers\u2014each of whom develop different care plans for the same  servicemember. The care plans may even conflict with one another,  which could conceivably adversely affect the servicemember\u2019s recovery  process. In fact, in the course of previous work, we found instances  where inadequate information exchange and poor coordination between  these programs resulted not only in duplication of effort and overlap of  services, but also confusion and frustration for servicemembers and their  families. In addition, DOD and VA officials acknowledge that the  multiplicity of care coordination and case management programs causes  confusion even among members of care coordination teams. In October  2011, we recommended that the Secretaries of Defense and Veterans  Affairs direct the Senior Oversight Committee to expeditiously develop  and implement a plan to strengthen functional integration across all DOD  and VA care coordination and case management programs to reduce  redundancy and overlap.", "Although DOD and VA have not yet aligned care coordination policy for  the FRCP and RCP, we have found indications that care coordinators and  case managers at some locations have been cooperating to some degree  and trying to work more closely with one another. In the course of our  visits to 11 DOD and VA facilities during this review, we found that care  coordinators and case managers in many locations had attempted\u2014with  some success\u2014to clarify their roles and to limit the degree of overlap and  duplication in the services they provide to recovering servicemembers  and veterans. However, such local attempts to improve the degree of  cooperation and coordination among the programs are not systemic and  depend on individual personalities and circumstances. They may not be  sustainable without agreement by DOD and VA and the alignment of  policy governing case management and care coordination programs.", "Another critical issue on which DOD and VA have disagreed pertains to  the stage in a servicemember\u2019s recovery when the FRCP should get  involved in the coordination of services. Because the FRCP depends on  referrals from other programs as a basis for becoming involved with  recovering servicemembers, this can be a significant issue. Currently,  neither DOD nor VA policy clearly defines when referrals are to be made;  consequently, most wounded warrior programs delay referrals to the  FRCP until it becomes clear that the servicemember will be separated  from the military. Senior DOD officials stated that wounded warrior  program officials justify this practice on the basis that referring a recently  wounded servicemember to the FRCP\u2014a VA-operated program\u2014sends  a negative message to a recovering servicemember that his or her  military career has ended, even though the FRCP was designed as a joint  program. Additionally, the belief among the military that they should \u201ctake  care of their own,\u201d contributes to the reluctance to involve the FRCP. On  their part, VA maintains that its point of engagement should be in the  early stage of medical treatment to build rapport and trust and to begin  coordinating the services needed by severely wounded servicemembers.", "Despite multiple efforts over the last several years to align their care  coordination and case management programs, DOD and VA have failed  to implement lasting measures to resolve underlying problems concerning  the aligning of roles and responsibilities of the FRCP, RCP, and case  management programs.

After completing its initial assessment, VA briefed WWCTP officials on  the process it was using to review its care coordination and case  management activities, but chose not to discuss realignment of the  FRCP and RCP at that time, according to DOD officials who attended  this briefing.

We continue to believe that the  departments\u2019 success ultimately depends on sustained attention,  systematic oversight, and sufficient resources from both DOD and VA.  However, this has not yet occurred, and as a result, after 5 years,  recovering servicemembers and veterans are still facing problems as they  navigate the recovery care continuum, including access to some of the  programs designed to assist them. The transition period from DOD\u2019s to  VA\u2019s health care system is particularly critical, as servicemembers  continue to experience delays in the disability evaluation system and the  departments continue to use methods other than a common information  technology system to share servicemembers\u2019 health information.

A key  element in resolving current care coordination issues in particular is  eliciting the cooperation of the military services, which are responsible for  implementing various wounded warrior programs and ensuring that these  programs operate as intended\u2014which has sometimes not been the case,  as with the RCP. Also, absent clear direction and central oversight and  accountability among the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs,  true cooperation and program effectiveness may be in jeopardy.", "We believe that at the heart of the problem is the need for strong and  unwavering leadership to bring about changes that best serve our  nation\u2019s recovering servicemembers and veterans. This leadership should  be united across both DOD and VA and centered on the individual  servicemember\u2019s or veteran\u2019s recovery. Many task forces\u2014including the  VA/DOD Warrior Care and Coordination Task Force and the Recovering  Warrior Task Force\u2014have already attempted to bring a spirit of  cooperativeness and clear direction and purpose among the different  programs providing services to this population.

Certainly, the fluidity and focus of the departments\u2019 leadership over the  last several years, especially related to care coordination, have added to  the challenges of developing consistent policy, effective oversight, and  mechanisms to monitor progress and hold programs accountable. The  departments have recently taken steps to improve problems related to  care coordination, disability evaluations, and the electronic sharing of  health records, through concerted efforts to coordinate on policy, increase  staffing resources, and provide control over the budget, respectively.  However, it is too early to determine the effectiveness of these efforts,  and sustained leadership attention will be critical to their success.

In its comments, DOD explained that the three military service  Secretaries should have the ability to control entrance criteria into their  wounded warrior programs and added that it does not believe that  differences in eligibility criteria for these programs results in noticeable  differences in access to these programs by recovering servicemembers  or their families. DOD did not offer a rationale, however, as to why the  military service Secretaries should unilaterally determine eligibility criteria  for their wounded warrior programs, other than to suggest that flexibility is  important and necessary. Moreover, as we have reported, DOD does not  systematically assess or monitor these programs across the department,  and as a result, we believe that DOD has no basis to assert that there are  no noticeable differences in access to these programs. Overall, we  believe that similarly situated wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers  should be given the same access to wounded warrior programs and the  assistance these programs provide, regardless of their branch of military  service.", "With respect to developing a common mechanism to systematically  monitor the performance of the wounded warrior programs, DOD  responded that the Interagency Care and Coordination Committee will  conduct an inventory of all wounded warrior programs to identify  duplication and areas for gaining efficiencies. In commenting on our  recommendation to also report its performance information on the  wounded warrior programs to the Armed Services Committees on a  biannual basis, DOD stated that the department reports progress through  the Joint Executive Council\u2019s annual strategic planning report and any  additional reporting would be redundant and of limited value. We  disagree. The Joint Executive Council\u2019s strategic planning and annual  reports focus on joint efforts between the departments and do not report  on the performance of the military services\u2019 wounded warrior programs.  Therefore, we do not believe that the performance information on the  wounded warrior programs would be redundant or of limited value given  that the department itself is currently unable to systematically determine  how well these programs are functioning. As we reported, one of the key  problems hindering a department-wide assessment of these programs is  the lack of common terms and definitions used by the military services.  Although DOD acknowledges that this is an issue, it asserts that it has  instituted some common definitions through the Senior Oversight  Committee and through its instruction for the RCP and that it will work  towards a common understanding and use of these approved definitions.  Although we are aware of efforts to define some terms, on the basis of  our work, it does not appear that the military services are using them  consistently. Therefore, substantial progress towards a common  understanding and use will be critical to the department\u2019s ability to  oversee these programs.", "DOD did not respond directly to our recommendation for developing a  common mechanism for performance measurement, which we found is  not systematically conducted across the wounded warrior programs.  During our collection of performance data from the wounded warrior  programs, we found that the programs vary in their ability to report  performance outcome measures on the basis of what each program  chooses to track. In addition, we found that some of the programs had  difficulty reporting basic data, such as enrollment numbers, and only  compiled these data following our request\u2014sometimes taking about   5 months to do so. Lastly, our recommendation is consistent with the call  of the Interagency Care and Coordination Committee that the military  programs develop more useful quantitative and qualitative metrics that  would effectively demonstrate their performance. Until DOD takes the  necessary steps to assess these programs department-wide, it will never  know with certitude whether these programs are meeting the needs of its  recovering servicemember population.", "DOD and VA both concurred with our second recommendation that the  departments ensure that care coordination, disability evaluation, and  electronic health record sharing receive sustained leadership attention  and collaboration at the highest levels, with a singular focus on what is  best for the individual servicemember or veteran to ensure continuity of  care and a seamless transition from DOD to VA.", "In addition to its comments on our recommendation, VA asserted that the  care coordination challenges facing both departments are broader and  more complex than issues concerning just the FRCP and RCP and that  our overall analysis and conclusions are over simplified. VA stated that  through its recently formed task force, both departments identified over   40 programs that provide some level of coordination or management of  care and services across the continuum of care and acknowledged that  there is no common operational picture that facilitates collaborative  planning or situational awareness.

The scope of our review was directed by Congress, who  required us to report on the progress DOD and VA in implementing the  programs involved with the care, management, and transition of  wounded, ill, and injured servicemembers that they established. Our  specific discussion of the FRCP and RCP served to illustrate, until  recently, a continued lack of collaboration between the departments to  better align these programs and better serve recovering servicemembers  and veterans. Furthermore, during detailed discussions with top-level VA  and DOD officials, they focused on the FRCP and RCP issue as the main  sticking point in achieving coordination and cooperation among the two  departments with respect to care coordination and case management.  We are encouraged that the departments are now taking steps to identify  all programs that need better alignment and integration.

While  we understand that DOD and VA now intend to harmonize care  coordination policies within a broader context of interdepartmental  care coordination and case management practice, many of the  proposed revisions\u2014including the role to be played by the FRCP\u2014 are neither fully developed nor implemented by the separate DOD and  VA programs at this time.", "In our report, we explain that VA declined DOD\u2019s requests to discuss  care coordination and case management policy issues\u2014for the better  part of 1 year\u2014on the basis that VA was conducting an internal  review of its care coordination and case management activities.

On the basis of work done for the  committee, the Department of Defense (DOD) sent a report to  congressional committees in 2008 outlining a medical category  assignment process based on the severity of each servicemember\u2019s  medical condition, along with input from the servicemember and his or her  unit commander, to determine whether servicemembers would be  directed either to the FRCP or to the RCP programs for care coordination  services.", "In concept, the medical category assignment process would have  resulted in wounded, injured, or ill servicemembers being assigned to one  of three categories. Servicemembers designated as Category 1 were  those who were found to have mild injury or illness, who were expected to  return to duty in less than 180 days of medical treatment, and primarily  received local outpatient and short-term inpatient treatment and  rehabilitation. Servicemembers designated as Category 2 were those with  serious injury or illness, who were unlikely to return to duty in less than  180 days, and may be medically separated from the military.  Servicemembers designated as Category 3 were those with severe injury  or illness, who were highly unlikely to return to duty, and were most likely  to be medically separated from the military. The category designation was  intended to be used to determine whether the recovering servicemember  was subsequently referred to a care coordination program, in that  Category 1 servicemembers would not be referred to a care coordination  program, unless their medical or psychological conditions worsen;  Category 2 servicemembers would be referred to the RCP; and   Category 3 servicemembers would be referred to the FRCP.
