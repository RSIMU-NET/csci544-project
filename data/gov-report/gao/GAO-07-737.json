These breaches have raised concerns in part because they can result in identity theft--either account fraud (such as misuse of credit card numbers) or unauthorized creation of new accounts (such as opening a credit card in someone else's name). Many states have enacted laws requiring entities that experience breaches to notify affected individuals, and Congress is considering legislation that would establish a national breach notification requirement. GAO was asked to examine (1) the incidence and circumstances of breaches of sensitive personal information; (2) the extent to which such breaches have resulted in identity theft; and (3) the potential benefits, costs, and challenges associated with breach notification requirements. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed available reports on data breaches, analyzed 24 large data breaches, and gathered information from federal and state government agencies, researchers, consumer advocates, and others."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While comprehensive data do not exist, available evidence suggests that breaches of sensitive personal information have occurred frequently and under widely varying circumstances. For example, more than 570 data breaches were reported in the news media from January 2005 through December 2006, according to lists maintained by private groups that track reports of breaches. These incidents varied significantly in size and occurred across a wide range of entities, including federal, state, and local government agencies; retailers; financial institutions; colleges and universities; and medical facilities. The extent to which data breaches have resulted in identity theft is not well known, largely because of the difficulty of determining the source of the data used to commit identity theft. However, available data and interviews with researchers, law enforcement officials, and industry representatives indicated that most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft, particularly the unauthorized creation of new accounts. For example, in reviewing the 24 largest breaches reported in the media from January 2000 through June 2005, GAO found that 3 included evidence of resulting fraud on existing accounts and 1 included evidence of unauthorized creation of new accounts. For 18 of the breaches, no clear evidence had been uncovered linking them to identity theft; and for the remaining 2, there was not sufficient information to make a determination. Requiring affected consumers to be notified of a data breach may encourage better security practices and help mitigate potential harm, but it also presents certain costs and challenges. Notification requirements can create incentives for entities to improve data security practices to minimize legal liability or avoid public relations risks that may result from a publicized breach. Also, consumers alerted to a breach can take measures to prevent or mitigate identity theft, such as monitoring their credit card statements and credit reports. At the same time, breach notification requirements have associated costs, such as expenses to develop incident response plans and identify and notify affected individuals. Further, an expansive requirement could result in notification of breaches that present little or no risk, perhaps leading consumers to disregard notices altogether. Federal banking regulators and the President's Identity Theft Task Force have advocated a notification standard--the conditions requiring notification--that is risk based, allowing individuals to take appropriate measures where the risk of harm exists, while ensuring they are only notified in cases where the level of risk warrants such action. Should Congress choose to enact a federal notification requirement, use of such a risk-based standard could avoid undue burden on organizations and unnecessary and counterproductive notifications of breaches that present little risk."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As a result of advances in computer technology and electronic storage,  As a result of advances in computer technology and electronic storage,  many different sectors and entities now maintain electronic records  many different sectors and entities now maintain electronic records  containing vast amounts of personal information on virtually all American  containing vast amounts of personal information on virtually all American  consumers.

We  also collected information on breaches experienced by federal agencies  compiled by the House Government Reform Committee in 2006 and by the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS). In addition, we conducted a  literature search of relevant articles, reports, and studies.

As of April 2007, at least 36 states had enacted  some form of law requiring that affected individuals be notified in the  event of a data breach; California\u2019s law, enacted in 2002, was the first such  state requirement. States\u2019 notification requirements vary, particularly with  regard to the applicable notification standard\u2014the event or circumstance  that triggers a required notification. Requirements also vary in terms of the  data to which they apply\u2014for example, some apply to paper documents as  well as electronic records.", "There is currently no federal statute that requires most companies and  other entities that experience a data breach to notify individuals whose  personal information was lost or stolen. However, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley  Act established requirements for federally supervised financial institutions  to safeguard customer information. To clarify these requirements, the  federal banking regulators issued interagency guidance in 2005 to the  banks, thrifts, and credit unions they supervise related to their handling of  data breaches. Under this guidance, these institutions are expected to  develop and implement a response program to address unauthorized  access to customer information maintained by the institution or its service  providers; and if they experience a breach, they are to notify their primary  federal regulator as soon as possible and\u2014depending on the  circumstances of the incident\u2014notify their affected customers. In  addition, in September 2006 the President\u2019s Identity Theft Task Force  developed guidance for federal agencies on responding to breaches  involving agency data, including the factors to consider in determining  whether to notify affected individuals. The task force released a strategic  plan for combating identity theft in April 2007, which contained among its  recommendations a proposal for establishing a national breach  notification requirement. Further, in December 2006, the Department of  Veterans Affairs Information Security Enhancement Act of 2006 became  law, which, among other things, requires VA to prescribe regulations  providing for the notification of data breaches occurring at the  department. A number of bills have been introduced in Congress that  would more broadly require companies and other entities to notify  individuals when such breaches occur, and Congress has held several  hearings related to data breaches.", "Identity theft occurs when individuals\u2019 identifying information is used  without authorization in an attempt to commit fraud or other crimes.  There are two primary forms of identity theft. First, identity thieves can  use financial account identifiers, such as credit card or bank account  numbers, to take over an individual\u2019s existing accounts to make  unauthorized charges or withdraw money. Second, thieves can use  identifying data, which can include such things as SSNs and driver\u2019s  license numbers, to open new financial accounts and incur charges and  credit in an individual\u2019s name, without that person\u2019s knowledge. This  second form of identity theft is potentially the most damaging because,  among other things, it can take some time before a victim becomes aware  of the problem, and it can cause substantial harm to the victim\u2019s credit  rating. While some identity theft victims can resolve their problems  quickly, others face substantial costs and inconvenience repairing damage  to their credit records. According to FTC, millions of Americans have their  identities stolen each year. Roughly 85 percent of these cases involve the  misuse of existing accounts and 35 percent involve new account creation  or other fraud. (Twenty percent of the total involve both.) Identity thieves  obtain sensitive personal information using a variety of methods. One  potential source is a breach at an organization that maintains large  amounts of sensitive personal information. However, identity theft can  also occur as a result of the loss or theft of data maintained by an  individual, such as a lost or stolen wallet or a thief digging through  household trash.", "The Identity Theft and Assumption Deterrence Act of 1998 made identity  theft a federal crime and charged FTC with taking complaints from  identity theft victims; sharing these complaints with federal, state, and  local law enforcement agencies; and providing the victims with  informational materials to assist them. Because identity theft is typically  not a stand-alone crime but rather a component of one or more crimes  such as bank fraud, credit card fraud, and mail fraud, a number of federal  law enforcement agencies can have a role in investigating identity theft  crimes, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), U.S. Postal  Inspection Service (USPIS), U.S. Secret Service (Secret Service), the  Office of the Inspector General of the Social Security Administration, and  Immigration and Customs Enforcement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Available Evidence Indicates That Data Breaches Occur Frequently and Under Varying Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["Available evidence from media reports, federal and state agencies, and  private institutions, collectively, suggests that data breaches occur with  some frequency.

Representatives of all of these agencies told us that their  investigations of data breaches do not typically allow them to fully  ascertain how stolen data are used. Similarly, they noted that  investigations of identity theft do not always reveal the source of the data  used to commit the crime.", "However, the representatives were able to provide us with a limited  number of examples in which data breaches they investigated had  allegedly resulted in some form of identity theft. For example, in a 2006  investigation by USPIS, an employee of a credit card call center allegedly  compromised at least 35 customers\u2019 accounts and used some of the  information to purchase approximately $65,000 in gift cards. The  representatives of federal law enforcement agencies noted that cases in  which data breaches have been linked to identity theft often have involved  instances of unauthorized access by employees. For example, an official at  Immigration and Customs Enforcement stated that her agency, in  cooperation with other agencies, has investigated cases in which  government employees allegedly had improperly accessed and sold  sensitive personal information that was then used by illegal immigrants to  secure employment.", "In addition, in 2005 FTC settled charges with BJ\u2019s Wholesale Club in which  alleged security breaches resulted in several million dollars in fraudulent  purchases using customers\u2019 credit and debit card data. As discussed later  in this report, FTC has also taken enforcement actions related to data  breaches at several other companies, including ChoicePoint, CardSystems,  and DSW, in which it uncovered evidence that the breaches resulted in  identity theft.", "Many of the law enforcement officials said that, based on their experience,  data breaches that result in harm have usually involved fraud on existing  accounts (such as credit card fraud) rather than the unauthorized creation  of new accounts. Secret Service representatives noted that using illicit  credit and debit card numbers and bank account information is much  easier and less labor intensive than using personally identifiable  information to fraudulently open new accounts. Officials at Secret Service,  FBI, and USPIS all said that identity theft involving the creation of new  accounts often results not from data breaches, but from other sources,  such as retrieving personal information by sifting through a family\u2019s  household trash.", "In examining a selection of five breaches that occurred from 2003 through  2005 that were reported as having involved five federal agencies\u2014 Department of Justice, FDIC, Internal Revenue Service, National Park  Service, and the Navy\u2014we found that the circumstances behind these  breaches varied widely. At least two of the breaches occurred at vendors  or contractors that held sensitive data on agency employees, rather than at  the agency itself. In addition, we found that a breach reported in the news  media as having involved the National Park Service actually involved a  not-for-profit organization that manages eParks, according to a  representative of that organization. Four of the five breaches reported as  having involved federal agencies were not believed to have resulted in  identity theft, according to officials of the entities involved. The breach at  FDIC resulted in an estimated 27 cases of identity theft when data  inappropriately accessed by a former FDIC intern were used to take out  more than $425,000 in fraudulent loans in the names of FDIC employees,  according to agency officials.", "Industry and trade associations representing entities that maintain large  amounts of information\u2014banks, retailers, colleges, information resellers,  and hospitals\u2014told us that they had limited knowledge about the harm  caused by data breaches that occur in their industries. However, in some  cases, they provided information or anecdotal evidence on the extent to  which such breaches may have led to some form of identity theft. For  example, the 46 hospitals that the American Hospital Association surveyed  at our request reported that of 17 breaches that had occurred since 2003,  three had resulted in fraudulent activity on existing accounts and another  three resulted in other forms of identity theft, including one case where  the information was used to file false income tax refunds. The identity  theft in these cases involved small numbers of victims\u2014usually just one.", "Representatives of the American Council on Education and two other  higher education associations stated that while data breaches at colleges  and universities were not uncommon, they were aware of little to no  identity theft that had resulted from such breaches. Representatives of the  American Bankers Association, the National Retail Federation, and the  Consumer Data Industry Association told us they were unable to  determine how prevalent data breaches are among their institutions or  how often such breaches lead to consumer harm.

To gather information on these incidents, we interviewed or  collected written responses from representatives of the entity  experiencing the breach and reviewed publicly available information, such  as media reports, news releases, testimonies, and court documents. In  some cases, when feasible, we also spoke with law enforcement  investigators. We identified those cases where this information collectively  indicated that the breach appeared to have resulted in some form of  identity theft. Ultimately, the determination of whether particular conduct  violated a law prohibiting identity theft would be a matter of law for the  courts.", "Although these lists characterized each of these 24 incidents as data  breaches, the circumstances of the incidents varied. While 19 of the  incidents clearly met our definition of data breach (i.e. unauthorized or  unintentional exposure, disclosure, or loss of sensitive personal  information), four cases involved hackers who may or may not have  actually accessed sensitive information. In one other incident, a university  employee with access to sensitive personal data was indicted on unrelated  fraud charges. A university official told us he did not believe this incident  should necessarily be characterized as a data breach since there was no  evidence the employee actually misused university data.", "The available evidence that we reviewed indicated that 18 of these 24  breaches were not known to have resulted in any identity theft. As shown  in table 1, three breaches were believed to have resulted in account fraud  and one resulted in the unauthorized creation of new accounts. In two  other cases, we were not able to gather sufficient information on whether  harm appeared to have resulted from the breach. Further, because of the  challenges in linking data breaches with identity theft, in some cases our  review may not have uncovered instances of harm potentially resulting  from these breaches. In some instances, investigators or company  representatives reported that they were able to determine with a high  degree of certainty\u2014through forensic investigation or other means\u2014that  unauthorized parties had not accessed the data. In other instances, these  representatives said that they were not aware of any account fraud that  resulted, but they acknowledged that there was no way to know for sure.  Moreover, determining potential harm may be particularly challenging  with very large breaches because the volume of records involved can  make it difficult to link individual victims to the breach.", "The one large breach we identified that apparently resulted in the  unauthorized creation of new accounts involved ChoicePoint, an  information reseller. In 2005, the company acknowledged that the personal  records it held on approximately 162,000 consumers had been  compromised by individuals who posed as legitimate subscribers to the  company\u2019s information services.

FTC staff alleged in a 2006 civil complaint that the  breach had compromised data associated with tens of millions of credit  and debit cards, but a CardSystems official stated in congressional  testimony that only 239,000 accounts were compromised. Officials of  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency\u2014who surveyed the  national banks they supervise in order to determine the amount of  fraudulent charges that resulted from the breach\u2014said that customers  of 110 banks were affected by this incident and losses of more than $13  million in fraudulent charges on customers\u2019 cards were reported by 24  of these institutions.", "DSW, a shoe retailer, said in an April 2005 news release that it had  experienced a data breach in which a hacker accessed the names and  card numbers associated with 1.4 million credit and debit card  transactions at 108 of its stores, as well as checking account numbers  and driver\u2019s license numbers from 96,000 check transactions.  According to a complaint filed by FTC in March of 2006, there allegedly  have been fraudulent transactions on some of these accounts.", "CD Universe, an Internet-based music store, reportedly experienced a  breach in December 1999 in which a hacker accessed as many as  300,000 names, addresses, and credit card numbers from the company  Web site, according to media reports and a company official.

First, identity theft victims often do not  know how their personal information was obtained. According to FTC, in  approximately 65 percent of the identity theft complaints it received from  October 1, 2005, through August 31, 2006, the victim did not know or  report how the information was compromised. Second, victims may  misattribute how their data were obtained. For example, federal officials  and representatives of a private group that assists victims said that  consumers who are notified of a breach often assume that any perceived  mistakes on their credit card statements or credit report were a result of  the breach. As a result, no government agency maintains comprehensive  data on the underlying cause of identity theft. FTC told us that its Identity  Theft Data Clearinghouse is limited to self-reported complaints and  therefore does not contain statistically reliable information that would  allow the agency to determine a link between data breaches and identity  theft. Similarly, according to FBI, data maintained by the Internet Crime  Complaint Center does not include information sufficient to determine the  link between data breaches and identity theft.", "Third, law enforcement officials told us that in some cases, stolen data  may be held for up to a year or more before being used to commit identity  theft. Further, once stolen data have been sold or posted on the Web,  fraudulent use of that information may continue for years. As a result,  studies that attempt to measure the harm resulting from data breaches  cannot necessarily rule out all future harm. Finally, conducting  comprehensive studies of data breaches and identity theft can be hindered  by issues of privacy and confidentiality. For example, companies that have  experienced breaches may be unable or unwilling to provide information  about affected individuals to researchers.", "Some studies conducted by private researchers have sought to determine  the extent to which data breaches result in identity theft, but our review  found them to contain methodological limitations. One research firm  conducted a study of four data breaches, analyzing credit and other  application data for suspicious relationships that indicated fraud. The  study estimated that no more than 0.10 percent of individuals whose data  had been breached experienced resulting identity theft in the form of  unauthorized new account creation. However, because the study reviewed  only four data breaches, it cannot be considered representative of other  breaches. Moreover, two of these breaches did not involve personally  identifiable information and thus would not be expected to create a risk of  fraud involving new account creation.", "Another private research firm surveyed approximately 9,000 individuals  about whether they had ever received a notification from an organization  about the loss or theft of their personal information. Of the  approximately 12 percent of individuals who reported they had received  such a notification, 3 percent\u2014or 33 people\u2014said they believed they had  suffered identity theft as a result. However, these data are subject to  limitations; among other things, individuals are often unaware of whether  any fraud they have suffered was, in fact, due to a data breach. A third firm  projected in a study that 0.8 percent of consumers whose information a  data breach compromised would experience fraud as a result. However,  we question the reliability of this estimate, in part because of assumptions  made about the number of consumers affected by data breaches."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Type of Data Compromised and Other Factors Influence Potential for Resulting Consumer Harm", "paragraphs": ["The type of data compromised in a breach can effectively determine the  potential harm that can result. For example, credit or debit card  information such as card numbers and expiration dates generally cannot  be used alone to open unauthorized new accounts.

As  a result, these breaches put affected consumers at risk of account fraud  but not necessarily at risk of fraud involving unauthorized creation of new  accounts\u2014the type of identity theft generally considered to have a more  harmful direct effect on consumers. While credit and debit card fraud is a  significant problem\u2014the FTC estimates it results in billions of dollars in  losses annually\u2014existing laws limit consumer liability for such fraud and,  as a matter of policy, some credit and debit card issuers may voluntarily  cover all fraudulent charges. In contrast, the unauthorized creation of  new accounts\u2014such as using someone else\u2019s identity to open credit card  or bank accounts, originate home mortgages, file tax returns, or apply for  government benefits\u2014can result in substantial financial costs and other  hardships.", "In addition to the type of data compromised in a breach, several additional  factors can influence the extent to which a breach presents the risk of  identity theft. These include the following:  Intent. Breaches that are the result of intentional acts\u2014such as  hacking into a server to obtain sensitive data\u2014generally are considered  to pose more risk than accidental breaches such as a lost laptop or the  unintentional exposure of sensitive data on the Internet, according to  federal agency officials.

Breach notification  requirements can provide an incentive for companies and other entities  to increase their data security measures to avoid the possible financial  and reputational risks that can be associated with a publicly reported  data breach. Representatives we contacted in the private, nonprofit,  and government sectors told us that they believe that existing breach  notification requirements in state laws, or the breach notification  provisions in federal banking regulatory guidance, have provided  entities with incentives to improve data security practices. For  example, some representatives of companies and other organizations  noted that passage of state notification laws led to companies  reexamining data security procedures and making improvements, such  as encrypting sensitive data and restricting consumer data that can be  accessed online. Similarly, federal banking regulators told us that they  believe their notification guidance has motivated regulated institutions  to enhance data security. For example, according to officials at the  Office of Thrift Supervision, its institutions have taken steps such as  improving electronic firewalls and implementing formal incident  response reporting systems.", "Prevention of Identity Theft. Breach notification can provide  consumers with the opportunity to take steps to protect themselves  from possible identity theft. For example, consumers whose account  information has been breached can monitor their bank or credit card  statements for suspicious activity or close the affected accounts.  Consumers whose personally identifiable information, such as SSN, has  been breached can review their credit reports for suspicious activity or  may choose to purchase a credit monitoring product that alerts them to  changes that could indicate identity theft. In addition, affected  consumers can place a fraud alert on their credit reports, which  requires businesses to take certain identity verification steps before  issuing credit. In some states, consumers can implement credit  freezes, which block unauthorized third parties from obtaining the  consumer\u2019s credit report or score. Limited information exists on the  steps individuals actually take when notified of a breach. In the 2005  Ponemon Institute survey of individuals that received notification  letters, 50 percent said they did nothing, while the rest indicated they  took actions such as monitoring their credit reports, canceling credit or  debit cards, or closing bank accounts.", "Respecting Consumers\u2019 Right to Know. Some consumer advocates and  others have argued that consumers have a right to know how their  information is being handled. According to this view, basic rights of  privacy dictate that consumers should be informed when their personal  information has been compromised, even if the risk of harm is minimal.  The principle that individuals should have ready means of learning  about the use of their personal information is embedded in the Fair  Information Practices, a set of internationally recognized privacy  protection principles.", "Improving Public Awareness. Public reporting of data breaches may  raise general awareness among consumers about the risks of identity  theft and ways they can mitigate these risks, such as periodically  reviewing their credit reports. In addition, publicity surrounding a data  breach resulting from notification can serve to deter the use of stolen  information because presumably the thief knows that the breach is  likely being investigated and the stolen data are being carefully  monitored."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Breach Notification Requirements Present a Variety of Potential Costs", "paragraphs": ["According to company representatives, researchers, regulators, and  others, there are several different types of costs that may be associated  with breach notification requirements. To begin with, entities subject to  breach notification requirements may incur certain costs, regardless of  whether they actually suffer a breach, or\u2014if they do\u2014regardless of  whether they have to notify consumers. For example, entities may incur  costs for developing and formalizing incident response plans.", "There are also the costs associated with actual notifications\u2014potentially  including printing, postage, legal, investigative, and public relations  expenses. Although comprehensive data on these costs do not exist, a  2006 Ponemon Institute survey of companies experiencing a data breach  found that 31 companies that responded incurred an average of $1.4  million per breach, or $54 per record breached, for costs related to mailing  notification letters, call center expenses, courtesy discounts or services,  and legal fees. Similarly, a study by Gartner Research found that  ChoicePoint spent $79 per affected account following its 2005 breach for  professional fees, legal expenses, and communications to affected  customers. A representative of the San Jose Medical Group told us it  spent $100,000 to send notification letters to 187,000 patients following a  data breach that occurred in 2005. Entities also may incur costs related to  staffing call centers to field inquiries from consumers about the breach.  For example, representatives of the University of California at Berkeley  told us that following a 2005 breach of 98,000 records, the university spent  $75,000 in staffing, telecommunications, and other call center costs.", "Finally, banks whose customers\u2019 account information is breached also  may incur costs for remedial steps such as canceling existing accounts or  replacing affected customers\u2019 credit or debit cards\u2014although such steps  may not be required by the applicable breach notification requirements.", "Entities experiencing a breach also often provide affected individuals with  free credit monitoring services.

Entities subject to breach  notification requirements sometimes face challenges interpreting  certain terms or provisions of notification laws. For example, an  information security expert told us that some laws do not adequately  define encryption, which could refer to anything from simple password  protection to complex coding. Similarly, federal banking regulators  acknowledged that their institutions sometimes face difficulty  determining whether misuse of breached information is \u201creasonably  possible,\u201d such as when little information exists about the location of  the data, the intent of a criminal who stole data, or the effectiveness of  security features designed to render data inaccessible.", "Addressing who is responsible. Notification requirements do not  always fully address who should bear the cost of and responsibility for  notification, particularly in cases where a third party is responsible for  the breach. For example, representatives of some federal banking  regulators and industry associations cited particular challenges  associated with breaches of credit and debit card information by  retailers. Banks that issue credit and debit cards compromised by a  merchant that is not the bank\u2019s service provider are generally not  required by the banking regulators\u2019 guidance to notify their customers,  but nevertheless in some cases, they feel obliged to do so. Bank  representatives with whom we spoke expressed concern that breaches  of credit card information by third parties can adversely affect a bank\u2019s  reputation and result in costs related to notifying customers and  reissuing cards.", "Identifying affected consumers. Some entities we interviewed said  that it can be difficult to identify which consumers may have been  affected by a breach and obtain their contact information. For example,  one representative at a state agency involved in a breach told us  officials were unsure what data had been downloaded among records  that may have been accessed on 600,000 people.

We have noted in  the past that public notices should be useful and easy to understand if  they are to be effective. However, the 2005 study conducted by the  Ponemon Institute found that 52 percent of survey respondents who  received a notification letter said the letter was not easy to  understand. In addition, consumers might be confused by other mail  solicitations that may resemble notification letters. For example,  officials at one large national bank noted that marketing solicitations  for credit monitoring services often are made to resemble breach  notification letters, potentially desensitizing or confusing consumers  when a true notification letter arrives.", "Complying with multiple state laws. Officials of companies with  customers in multiple states and their trade associations noted that  they face the challenge of complying with breach notification  requirements that vary among the states, including who must be  notified, the level of risk that triggers a notice, the nature of the  notification, and exceptions to the requirement.

The standards vary in terms of  what is required in cases where the risk of harm is unknown. For example,  Vermont requires notification unless an entity can demonstrate that  misuse of the breached data \u201cis not reasonably possible.\u201d In contrast,  North Carolina requires notification only when it has been determined that  the breach has resulted, or is reasonably likely to result, in illegal use of  the data or creates a material risk of harm to a consumer. As shown in  figure 1, whether or not a breach is subject to notification can depend on  the specific notification standard.", "Because of the difficulty of complying with multiple state requirements,  many companies and industry representatives have argued for a consistent  federal standard for breach notification that would preempt state  notification laws. However, the National Association of Attorneys General,  as well as some consumer and privacy groups, have expressed concern  that a federal breach notification law could weaken consumer protections  if it were to preempt stronger state laws. These groups have advocated a  strong notification standard because, they say, the link between breaches  and identity theft is not always clear and entities are not well equipped to  assess the risk of harm resulting from a given breach. As a result, too  narrow a notification standard may prevent consumers from taking action  in cases that do in fact present some risk. Also, as noted earlier, some  privacy groups and others believe that consumers have basic rights to be  notified when their personal information has been breached, no matter  what the circumstances. Moreover, they say that fears of  \u201covernotification\u201d\u2014where consumers are inundated by frequent  notifications\u2014are unfounded, given that they are aware of no evidence of  this occurring in states that currently have strict notification requirements.", "By contrast, some representatives of the federal banking regulatory  agencies, FTC, private companies, and other experts have expressed  concern about overly expansive breach notification standards. They say  that such standards may require businesses to notify consumers about  minor and insignificant breaches. This in turn could eventually lead to  overnotification and cause consumers to spend time and money taking  proactive steps that are not necessary or, alternatively, to ignore notices  when action is warranted. In addition, businesses and federal banking  regulators have expressed concern about the financial burden that  overnotification could cause. Overly broad notification standards could  also have the effect of limiting entities\u2019 reputational incentives for  improving data security, if nearly all entities regularly issue notifications  as a result of minor breaches. Representatives of the federal banking  regulatory agencies have noted that they sought to strike an appropriate  balance with their notification standard. Their guidance provides that,  when a financial institution becomes aware of an incident of unauthorized  access to sensitive customer information, the institution should conduct a  reasonable investigation to promptly determine the likelihood that the  information has been or will be misused. If the institution determines that  misuse of the information has occurred or is reasonably possible, it should  notify affected customers as soon as possible. The guidance is intended to  provide notice to customers only when there is a reasonable expectation  of misuse.", "Similarly, the guidance for federal agencies developed by the President\u2019s  Identity Theft Task Force recommended that if an agency experiences a  breach, it should analyze the risk of identity theft and tailor its response\u2014 which may include notifying individuals\u2014to the nature and scope of the  risk presented. The guidance noted that such a risk assessment can  minimize the potentially significant costs of notification where little risk  exists. The task force\u2019s April 2007 strategic plan recommended the  development of a national standard requiring all entities that maintain  sensitive consumer information, in both the public and private sectors, to  provide notice to consumers and law enforcement in the event of a breach.  As with its guidance to federal agencies, the task force recommended that  the standard be risk based to provide notice when consumers face a  significant risk of identity theft but to avoid excessive notification.", "As we have noted in the past, care is needed in defining appropriate  criteria for data breaches that merit notification. The frequency of data  breaches identified in this report suggests that a national breach  notification requirement may be beneficial, in large part because of its role  in further encouraging entities to improve their data security practices.  However, because breaches vary in the risk they present, and because  most breaches have not resulted in detected incidents of identity theft, a  notification that is risk based appears appropriate. Should Congress  choose to enact a federal breach notification requirement, use of the risk- based approaches that the federal banking regulators and the President\u2019s  Identity Theft Task Force advocate could avoid undue burden on  organizations and unnecessary and counterproductive notifications to  consumers."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FTC, which provided technical  comments that were incorporated in this report as appropriate.

We use the term \u201cdata breach\u201d to refer to the  unauthorized or unintentional exposure, disclosure, or loss of sensitive  personal information by a company, government agency, university, or  other public or private entity. Our scope was limited to breaches involving  personal data, including financial data, that could be used to commit  identity theft or other related harm, and we excluded breaches involving  other types of sensitive data, such as medical records or proprietary  business information. For the purposes of this report, the term \u201cidentity  theft\u201d is used broadly to refer to both fraud on existing accounts and the  unauthorized creation of new accounts.", "To address all three objectives, we conducted a literature search of  relevant articles, reports, and studies. We also collected and analyzed  documents from, and interviewed, officials of government agencies that  investigate and track data breaches, including the Federal Trade  Commission, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of  Justice, the U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and the Social Security  Administration. We also interviewed staff at the five federal banking  regulators\u2014the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the  Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of  the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit  Union Administration. In addition, we spoke with representatives of the  National Association of Attorneys General and organizations that address  consumer protection and privacy issues, including Consumers Union,  Electronic Privacy Information Center, Privacy Rights Clearinghouse,  Attrition, and the Identity Theft Resource Center. We also spoke with  three academic researchers who study issues related to data breaches and  notification and an attorney who helps companies address data privacy  and security issues. In addition, we reviewed studies on data breaches  conducted by private and nonprofit research organizations, including the  Ponemon Institute, ID Analytics, and Javelin Strategy and Research. We  interviewed the studies\u2019 authors and took other steps to ensure that the  data and methodologies were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also spoke with representatives of the California Office of Privacy  Protection and its advisory group and reviewed the office\u2019s recommended  practices for notification.", "To address the first objective on the incidence and circumstances of data  breaches, we reviewed lists of news media-reported data breaches that are  compiled and maintained by three private research and advocacy  organizations\u2014Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, Attrition, and the Identity  Theft Resource Center. We analyzed the three independent lists to create a  single, nonduplicative list of data breaches that had been reported in the  news media from January 2005 through December 2006. We took  measures to ensure the lists were of sufficient quality for our purposes,  including spot checking selected data and interviewing representatives of  the three organizations on their methodologies. The Privacy Rights  Clearinghouse, Attrition, and Identity Theft Resource Center lists  contained 436, 453, and 462 breaches, respectively, for the time period we  analyzed. Of the 572 breaches they collectively compiled, 59 percent  appeared on all three lists, 19 percent appeared on two, and 22 percent  appeared on one. Our analysis was based on the lists as they stood on  February 15, 2007; these data may have changed because the lists are  occasionally updated when the compilers learn of new breaches that may  have occurred in the past.", "We also collected available data from federal law enforcement agencies on  the breaches they have investigated in recent years. In addition, the five  federal banking regulators provided, at our request, data on the breaches  of which they have been notified by the institutions they supervise. These  data varied in usefulness and comprehensiveness because of the  regulators\u2019 differing methods of counting and tracking breaches and  maintaining data on them. We also gathered data from two states, New  York and North Carolina, which were selected because they were two  large states that maintain centralized information on breaches. Further, we  obtained available data from industry and trade associations representing  key sectors\u2014such as financial services, retail sales, higher education,  hospitals, and information services\u2014that have experienced data breaches.  We also collected information on breaches experienced by federal  agencies compiled by the House Government Reform Committee and the  U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, a component of the  Department of Homeland Security.", "To address the second objective, we selected for more detailed  examination the 24 largest (in terms of number of records breached) data  breaches reported in the news media from January 2000 through June  2005. We selected these breaches in August 2006 using the lists maintained  by Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Identity Theft Resource Center, as  well as a similar compilation of breaches collected by the Congressional  Research Service. We were not aware of the Attrition list at the time we  made our selection. For each of these breaches, we reviewed news reports  as well as publicly available documents such as testimonies and criminal  indictments. We also conducted interviews, where possible, with  representatives of the entities that experienced the breach and law  enforcement agencies that investigated the breach. We identified those  cases where this information collectively indicated that the breach  appeared to have resulted in some form of identity theft. Ultimately, the  determination of whether particular conduct violated a law prohibiting  identity theft would be a matter of law for the courts. We did not directly  contact individuals whose data had been affected by the breaches because  of privacy concerns and because we did not have a systematic means of  identifying them. We also reviewed five breaches that reportedly involved  federal agencies\u2014the Navy; the Internal Revenue Service; the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation; the National Park Service; and the  Department of Justice. These were selected to represent breaches that  included different causes, types of data, and involvement by third-party  vendors.", "To examine the potential benefits, costs, and challenges associated with  breach notification requirements, we reviewed the federal banking  regulators\u2019 proposed and final guidance related to breach notification, and  interviewed representatives of each agency regarding their consideration  of potential costs, benefits, and challenges during development of the  guidance. Further, we reviewed the strategic plan and other documents  issued by the President\u2019s Identity Theft Task Force. In addition, we  conducted a review of the effects of California\u2019s breach notification law.  We interviewed representatives of, and gathered information from, seven  organizations to learn about their experiences complying with California\u2019s  breach notification law. These organizations were selected to represent a  range of organization sizes and industry sectors. We also interviewed  representatives of the California State Information Security Office,  California State Assembly, California Office of Privacy Protection, and  California Bankers Association.", "We conducted our review from August 2006 through April 2007 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jason Bromberg, Assistant  Director; Randy Fasnacht; Marc Molino; Kathryn O\u2019Dea; Carl Ramirez;  Linda Rego; Barbara Roesmann; and Winnie Tsen made key contributions  to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
