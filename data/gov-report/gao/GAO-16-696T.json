Given the magnitude of these investments, it is important that agencies effectively manage their IT O&M investments.", "GAO was asked to summarize its report being released today that (1) assesses federal agencies' IT O&M spending, (2) evaluates the oversight of at-risk legacy investments, and (3) assesses the age and obsolescence of federal IT.", "In preparing the report on which this testimony is based, GAO reviewed 26 agencies' IT O&M spending plans for fiscal years 2010 through 2017 and OMB data. GAO further reviewed the 12 agencies that reported the highest planned IT spending for fiscal year 2015 to provide specifics on agency spending and individual investments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The federal government spent more than 75 percent of the total amount budgeted for information technology (IT) for fiscal year 2015 on operations and maintenance (O&M) investments. Specifically, 5,233 of the government's approximately 7,000 IT investments are spending all of their funds on O&M activities. Such spending has increased over the past 7 fiscal years, which has resulted in a $7.3 billion decline from fiscal years 2010 to 2017 in development, modernization, and enhancement activities.", "Many IT O&M investments in GAO's review were identified as moderate to high risk by agency CIOs and agencies did not consistently perform required analysis of these at-risk investments. Until agencies fully review their at-risk investments, the government's oversight of such investments will be limited and its spending could be wasteful.", "Federal legacy IT investments are becoming increasingly obsolete: many use outdated software languages and hardware parts that are unsupported. Agencies reported using several systems that have components that are, in some cases, at least 50 years old. For example, the Department of Defense uses 8-inch floppy disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the nation's nuclear forces. In addition, the Department of the Treasury uses assembly language code\u2014a computer language initially used in the 1950s and typically tied to the hardware for which it was developed. OMB recently began an initiative to modernize, retire, and replace the federal government's legacy IT systems. As part of this, OMB drafted guidance requiring agencies to identify, prioritize, and plan to modernize legacy systems. However, until this policy is finalized and fully executed, the government runs the risk of maintaining systems that have outlived their effectiveness. The following table provides examples of legacy systems across the federal government that agencies report are 30 years or older and use obsolete software or hardware, and identifies those that do not have specific plans with time frames to modernize or replace these investments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In the report being released today, GAO is making multiple recommendations, one of which is for OMB to finalize draft guidance to identify and prioritize legacy IT needing to be modernized or replaced. In the report, GAO is also recommending that selected agencies address obsolete legacy IT O&M investments. Nine agencies agreed with GAO's recommendations, two partially agreed, and two stated they had no comment. The two agencies that partially agreed, the Departments of Defense and Energy, outlined plans that were consistent with the intent of GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on the  federal government\u2019s legacy information technology (IT) systems. The  President\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request for IT was more than $89  billion, with over 70 percent reportedly for operating and maintaining  existing IT systems. Given the size and magnitude of these investments,  it is important that agencies effectively manage the operations and  maintenance (O&M) of existing investments.", "As requested, this statement summarizes our report being released today  that (1) assesses federal agencies\u2019 IT O&M spending, (2) evaluates the  oversight of at-risk legacy investments, and (3) assesses the age and  obsolescence of federal IT.", "In that report, our review of O&M spending included the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) and the 26 agencies that report to  OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard. For specific information on individual systems or  investments, we focused on the 12 agencies that reported the highest  planned IT spending for fiscal year 2015, given that these agencies make  up over 90 percent of reported federal IT spending.", "To assess federal agencies\u2019 IT O&M spending, we reviewed data  reported to OMB as part of the budget process for fiscal years 2010  through 2017. We analyzed that data to determine whether spending had  changed over those years and compared OMB\u2019s associated performance  measure to federal best practices.", "We evaluated the extent to which the 12 selected federal agencies are  performing oversight on their existing legacy investments by reviewing  agency IT Dashboard data to identify investments in O&M that had been  designated as being moderate to high risk. We also reviewed agency  documentation such as TechStat documentation and operational  analyses, as available.", "To assess the age and obsolescence of federal IT, we reviewed agency  documentation, such as operational analyses and enterprise architecture  documents, and interviewed agency officials. We also requested that the  12 agencies provide a list of their three oldest systems. We compared  OMB and agencies\u2019 current practices with federal guidance to determine  whether OMB and agencies are adequately managing the age and  obsolescence of federal IT.", "To assess the reliability of the OMB budget data and IT Dashboard data,  we reviewed related documentation, such as OMB guidance on budget  preparation, capital planning, and IT Dashboard submissions. In addition,  we corroborated with each agency that the data downloaded were  accurate and reflected the data it had reported to OMB. We determined  that the data were reliable for the purposes of our reporting objectives.", "The work upon which this testimony is based was conducted in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. A more detailed description of  the scope and methodology of our work is provided in our report being  issued today."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the last three decades, Congress has enacted several laws to assist  agencies and the federal government in managing IT investments. For  example, to assist agencies in managing their investments, Congress  enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996. More recently, in December  2014, Congress enacted IT acquisition reform legislation (commonly  referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act  or FITARA) that, among other things, requires OMB to develop  standardized performance metrics, including cost savings, and to submit  quarterly reports to Congress on cost savings.", "In carrying out its responsibilities, OMB uses several data collection  mechanisms to oversee federal IT spending during the annual budget  formulation process. Specifically, OMB requires federal departments and  agencies to provide information related to their Major Business Cases  (previously known as exhibit 300) and IT Portfolio Summary (previously  known as exhibit 53).", "OMB directs agencies to break down IT investment costs into two  categories: (1) O&M and (2) development, modernization, and  enhancement (DME). O&M (also known as steady-state) costs refer to  the expenses required to operate and maintain an IT asset in a  production environment. DME costs refers to those projects and activities  that lead to new IT assets/systems, or change or modify existing IT  assets to substantively improve capability or performance.", "In addition, OMB has developed guidance that calls for agencies to  develop an operational analysis policy for examining the ongoing  performance of existing legacy IT investments to measure, among other  things, whether the investment is continuing to meet business and  customer needs.", "Nevertheless, federal IT investments have too frequently failed or  incurred cost overruns and schedule slippages while contributing little to  mission-related outcomes. The federal government has spent billions of  dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments which often  suffered from ineffective management, such as project planning,  requirements definition, and program oversight and governance.", "Accordingly, in February 2015, we introduced a new government-wide  high-risk area, Improving the Management of IT Acquisitions and  Operations. This area highlights several critical IT initiatives underway,  including reviews of troubled projects, an emphasis on incremental  development, a key transparency website, data center consolidation, and  the O&M of legacy systems.", "To make progress in this area, we identified actions that OMB and the  agencies need to take. These include implementing the recently-enacted  statutory requirements promoting IT acquisition reform, as well as  implementing our previous recommendations. In the last 6 years, we  made approximately 800 recommendations to OMB and multiple  agencies to improve effective and efficient investment in IT. As of October  2015, about 32 percent of these recommendations had been  implemented."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Has Reported on the Need to Improve Oversight of Legacy IT", "paragraphs": ["We have previously reported on legacy IT and the need for the federal  government to improve its oversight of such investments. For example, in  October 2012, we reported on agencies\u2019 operational analyses policies  and practices. In particular, we reported that although OMB guidance  called for each agency to develop an operational analysis policy and  perform such analyses annually, the extent to which the selected federal  agencies we reviewed carried out these tasks varied significantly. The  Departments of Defense (Defense), the Treasury (Treasury), and  Veterans Affairs (VA) had not developed a policy or conducted  operational analyses.", "As such, we recommended that the agencies develop operational  analysis policies, annually perform operational analyses on all  investments, and ensure the assessments include all key factors. Further,  we recommended that OMB revise its guidance to include directing  agencies to post the results of such analyses on the IT Dashboard. OMB  and the five selected agencies agreed with our recommendations and  have efforts planned and underway to address them. In particular, OMB  issued guidance in August 2012 directing agencies to report operational  analysis results along with their fiscal year 2014 budget submission  documentation (e.g., exhibit 300) to OMB. Thus far, operational analyses  have not yet been posted on the IT Dashboard.", "We further reported in November 2013 that agencies were not conducting  proper analyses. Specifically, we reported on IT O&M investments and  the use of operational analyses at selected agencies and determined that  of the top 10 investments with the largest spending in O&M, only a  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) investment underwent an  operational analysis. DHS\u2019s analysis addressed most, but not all, of the  factors that OMB called for (e.g., comparing current cost and schedule  against original estimates). The remaining agencies did not assess their  investments, which accounted for $7.4 billion in reported O&M spending.  Consequently, we recommended that seven agencies perform  operational analyses on their IT O&M investments and that DHS ensure  that its analysis was complete and addressed all OMB factors. Three of  the agencies agreed with our recommendations; two partially agreed; and  two agencies had no comments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Government-wide Spending on IT Operations and Maintenance Is Increasing", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in our report, federal agencies reported spending the  majority of their fiscal year 2015 IT funds on operating and maintaining a  large number of legacy (i.e., steady-state) investments. Of the more than  $80 billion reportedly spent on federal IT in fiscal year 2015, 26 federal  agencies spent about $61 billion on O&M, more than three-quarters of  the total amount spent. Specifically, data from the IT Dashboard shows  that, in 2015, 5,233 of the government\u2019s nearly 7,000 IT investments were  spending all of their funds on O&M activities. This is a little more than  three times the amount spent on DME activities (see figure 1).", "According to agency data reported to OMB\u2019s IT Dashboard, the 10 IT  investments spending the most on O&M for fiscal year 2015 total $12.5  billion, 20 percent of the total O&M spending, and range from $4.4 billion  on Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for  Medicare and Medicaid Services\u2019 Medicaid Management Information  System to $666.1 million on HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare and Medicaid  Services IT Infrastructure investment (see table 1)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Spending on O&M Has Increased over 7 Years", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 7 fiscal years, O&M spending has increased, while the  amount invested in developing new systems has decreased by about  $7.3 billion since fiscal year 2010. (See figure 2.)", "Further, agencies have increased the amount of O&M spending relative  to their overall IT spending by 9 percent since 2010. Specifically, in fiscal  year 2010, O&M spending was 68 percent of the federal IT budget, while  in fiscal year 2017, agencies plan to spend 77 percent of their IT funds on  O&M. (See figure 3.)", "Further, 15 of the 26 agencies have increased their spending on O&M  from fiscal year 2010 to fiscal year 2015, with 10 of these agencies  having over a $100 million increase. The spending changes per agency  range from an approximately $4 billion increase (HHS) to a decrease of  $600 million (National Aeronautics and Space Administration).", "OMB staff in the Office of E-Government and Information Technology  have recognized the upward trend of IT O&M spending and identified  several contributing factors, including (1) the support of O&M activities  requires maintaining legacy hardware, which costs more over time, and  (2) costs are increased in maintaining applications and systems that use  older programming languages, since programmers knowledgeable in  these older languages are becoming increasingly rare and thus more  expensive. Further, OMB officials stated that in several situations where  agencies are not sure whether to report costs as O&M or DME, agencies  default to reporting as O&M. According to OMB, agencies tend to  categorize investments as O&M because they attract less oversight,  require reduced documentation, and have a lower risk of losing funding."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many O&M Investments Were at Risk and Lacked Proper Oversight", "paragraphs": ["According to OMB guidance, the O&M phase is often the longest phase  of an investment and can consume more than 80 percent of the total  lifecycle costs. As such, agencies must actively manage their investment  during this phase. To help them do so, OMB requires that CIOs submit  ratings that reflect the level of risk facing an investment.", "In addition, in instances where investments experience problems,  agencies can perform a TechStat, a face-to-face meeting to terminate or  turn around IT investments that are failing or not producing results. In  addition, OMB directs agencies to monitor O&M investments through  operational analyses, which should be performed annually and assess  costs, schedules, whether the investment is still meeting customer and  business needs, and investment performance.", "Several O&M investments were rated as moderate to high risk in fiscal  year 2015. Specifically, CIOs from the 12 selected agencies reported  that 23 of their 187 major IT O&M investments were moderate to high risk  as of August 2015. They requested $922.9 million in fiscal year 2016 for  these investments. Of the 23 investments, agencies had plans to replace  or modernize 19 investments. However, the plans for 12 of those were  general or tentative in that the agencies did not provide specificity on time  frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be replaced or  enhanced. Further, agencies did not plan to modernize or replace 4 of the  investments (see table 2). The lack of specific plans to modernize or  replace these investments could result in wasteful spending on moderate  and high-risk investments.", "While agencies generally conducted the required operational analyses,  they did not consistently perform TechStat reviews on all of the at-risk  investments. Although not required, agencies had performed TechStats  on only five of the 23 at-risk investments. In addition, operational  analyses were not conducted for four of these investments (see table 3).", "Agencies provided several reasons for not conducting TechStats and  required assessments. For example, according to agency officials,  several of the investments\u2019 risk levels were reduced to low or moderately  low risk in the months since the IT Dashboard had been publicly  updated. Regarding assessments, one official stated that, in place of  operational analyses, the responsible bureau reviews the status of the  previous month\u2019s activities for the development, integration, modification,  and procurement to report issues to management. However, this monthly  process does not include all of the key elements of an operational  analysis. Until agencies ensure that their O&M investments are fully  reviewed, the government\u2019s oversight of old and vulnerable investments  will be impaired and the associated spending could be wasteful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Investments Are Becoming Obsolete and Agencies Are Not Required to Identify Investments That Need Attention", "paragraphs": ["Legacy IT investments across the federal government are becoming  increasingly obsolete. Specifically, many use outdated languages and old  parts. Numerous old investments are using obsolete programming  languages. Several agencies, such as the Department of Agriculture  (USDA), DHS, HHS, Justice, Treasury, and VA, reported using Common  Business Oriented Language (COBOL)\u2014a programming language  developed in the late 1950s and early 1960s\u2014to program their legacy  systems. It is widely known that agencies need to move to more modern,  maintainable languages, as appropriate and feasible. For example, the  Gartner Group, a leading IT research and advisory company, has  reported that organizations using COBOL should consider replacing the  language and in 2010 noted that there should be a shift in focus to using  more modern languages for new products.", "In addition, some legacy systems may use parts that are obsolete and  more difficult to find. For instance, Defense is still using 8-inch floppy  disks in a legacy system that coordinates the operational functions of the  United States\u2019 nuclear forces. (See figure 4.)", "Further, in some cases, the vendors no longer provide support for  hardware or software, creating security vulnerabilities and additional  costs. For example, each of the 12 selected agencies reported using  unsupported operating systems and components in their fiscal year 2014  reports pursuant to the Federal Information Security Management Act of  2002. Commerce, Defense, Treasury, HHS, and VA reported using 1980s  and 1990s Microsoft operating systems that stopped being supported by  the vendor more than a decade ago.", "Lastly, legacy systems may become increasingly more expensive as  agencies have to deal with the previously mentioned issues and may pay  a premium to hire staff or contractors with the knowledge to maintain  outdated systems. For example, one agency (SSA) reported re-hiring  retired employees to maintain its COBOL systems.", "Selected agencies reported that they continue to maintain old  investments in O&M. For example, Treasury reported systems that were  about 56 years old.", "Table 4 shows the 10 oldest investments and/or systems, as reported by  selected agencies.

However, the plans for  five of those were general or tentative in that the agencies did not provide  specific time frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be  replaced or enhanced.", "Separately, in our related report, we profiled one system or investment  from each of the 12 selected agencies. The selected systems and  investments range from 11 to approximately 56 years old, and serve a  variety of purposes. Of the 12 investments or systems, agencies had  plans to replace or modernize 11 of these. However, the plans for 3 of  those were general or tentative in that the agencies did not provide  specificity on time frames, activities to be performed, or functions to be  replaced or enhanced. Further, there were no plans to replace or  modernize 1 investment.", "We have previously provided guidance that organizations should  periodically identify, evaluate, and prioritize their investments, including  those that are in O&M; at, near, or exceeding their planned life cycles;  and/or are based on technology that is now obsolete, to determine  whether the investment should be kept as-is, modernized, replaced, or  retired. This critical process allows the agency to identify and address  high-cost or low-value investments in need of update, replacement, or  retirement.", "Agencies are, in part, maintaining obsolete investments because they are  not required to identify, evaluate, and prioritize their O&M investments to  determine whether they should be kept as-is, modernized, replaced, or  retired. According to OMB staff from the Office of E-Government and  Information Technology, OMB has created draft guidance that will require  agencies to identify and prioritize legacy information systems that are in  need of replacement or modernization. Specifically, the guidance is  intended to develop criteria through which agencies can identify the  highest priority legacy systems, evaluate and prioritize their portfolio of  existing IT systems, and develop modernization plans that will guide  agencies\u2019 efforts to streamline and improve their IT systems. The draft  guidance includes time frames for the efforts regarding developing  criteria, identifying and prioritizing systems, and planning for  modernization. However, OMB did not commit to a firm time frame for  when the policy would be issued. Until this policy is finalized and carried  out, the federal government runs the risk of continuing to maintain  investments that have outlived their effectiveness and are consuming  resources that outweigh their benefits.", "Regarding upgrading obsolete investments, in April 2016, the IT  Modernization Act was introduced into the U.S. House of  Representatives. If enacted, it would establish a revolving fund of $3  billion that could be used to retire, replace, or upgrade legacy IT systems  to transition to new, more secure, efficient, modern IT systems.

Defense and Energy partially agreed  with our recommendation. Defense stated that it planned to continue to  identify, prioritize, and manage legacy systems, based on existing  department policies and processes, and consistent to the extent  practicable with OMB\u2019s draft guidance. Energy stated that while the  department continues to take steps to modernize its legacy investments  and systems, it could not agree fully with our recommendation because  OMB\u2019s guidance is in draft and the department has not had an  opportunity to review it. Defense and Energy\u2019s comments are consistent  with the intent of our recommendation. Upon finalization of OMB\u2019s  guidance, we encourage both agencies to implement OMB\u2019s guidance.
