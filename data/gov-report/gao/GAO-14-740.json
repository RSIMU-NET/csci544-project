As of 2012, the latest year for which data were available, national freight rail and truck traffic had approached levels of 2007 prior to the economic recession. Certain trends related to specific commodities have affected rail flows, including increases in domestic crude oil production. A key negative impact of increasing freight flows is congestion at highway-rail grade crossings, where road traffic must wait to cross the tracks when trains are passing. For example, a Miami-area study found that rail crossings in the area caused delays of roughly 235,000 person-hours per year at a cost of $2.4 million. Although several communities we visited had documented long-standing concerns over freight-related traffic congestion, state and local stakeholders we met with had varying levels of quantified information regarding the extent of the impacts or costs to the community. For example, in contrast to the Miami study, another study we reviewed included some information on train counts, but did not document hours of delay or any costs associated with such delays.", "The Department of Transportation's (DOT) efforts to implement the freight-related provisions of the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (MAP-21) are still underway but so far do not fully consider freight-related traffic congestion.

Freight travels over  an extensive network that consists of approximately 4 million miles of  highways and roads and 140,000 miles of rail lines, as well as inland  waterways, pipelines, and airways. Based on tonnage, trucks transport  most freight in the United States (about 70 percent), but railroads also  carry significant volumes over long distances. Freight trucks and trains  both carry a variety of commodities. These include bulk goods\u2014such as  gravel, coal, and cereal grains\u2014and consumer goods packed in  containers as intermodal shipments that can be transferred among trains,  trucks, and ships.

A map  of 2010 freight flow volumes across the U.S. shows that many states had  at least 100 million tons of freight annually flowing over some highways,  railways, or inland waterways (see fig. 1).", "Recent commodity trends, such as the increase in domestic crude oil  production from shale formations, have affected freight movements.", "According to the Energy Information Administration, oil production from  shale formations, such as North Dakota\u2019s Bakken region, has increased 6  fold between 2007 and 2012, and is expected to continue to increase\u2014by  48 percent from 2012 to 2019\u2014and remain above 2012 levels through  2040.", "While vital to our nation\u2019s economy, freight movements can contribute to  two types of congestion impacts, which can be temporary or more  permanent in nature. The first is congestion on the freight network itself,  such as when congested rail corridors and highways result in delays for  freight shippers. The second, which is the focus of this report, is freight- related traffic congestion in communities. Unlike congestion on the freight  network, freight-related traffic congestion may not delay or affect freight  shippers but results in delays and congested road conditions for  passenger and emergency response vehicles. For example, such  vehicles may experience delays at highway-rail grade crossings or near  rail yards and transfer facilities. In addition, delays and congested road  conditions can occur when freight trucks must traverse local streets to  access major freight centers, such as ports or distribution warehouses.", "Depending on the specific circumstances in a community, various types  of projects can be undertaken to help alleviate freight-related traffic  congestion (see fig. 2). For instance, grade separation projects\u2014such as  overpasses and underpasses\u2014can eliminate congestion issues  associated with heavily traveled highway-rail grade crossings. In addition,  signalization projects, including the use of intelligent transportation  systems (ITS), can help reduce delays at highway-rail grade crossings by  providing drivers with advanced warning of approaching trains or  extending green lights after a train has cleared an intersection. To  reduce truck traffic on local roads, communities may build direct freeway  connections between freight centers and nearby highways (connector  roads or tunnels), redirect freight trucks around towns (bypass routes), or  improve the ability of local roads to manage truck traffic\u2014for example, by  widening lanes and adding passing lanes and traffic lights.", "Multiple stakeholders play a role in mitigating the impacts of freight- related traffic congestion in communities. At the federal level, DOT and its  component agencies develop and enforce regulations, advance national  strategic goals by providing technical assistance and leadership through  collaboration with various transportation stakeholders, and oversee  federal-funding programs that can be used to mitigate freight-related  traffic congestion (see table 1 below for brief descriptions of selected  programs).

These entities\u2014including trucking companies, railroads, airlines,  pipeline companies, and terminal and distribution-center operators\u2014often  compete with each other for freight-shipping business and make key  routing, operating, and equipment investment decisions. Some private  entities, such as railroad and pipeline companies, own the freight  infrastructure they are dependent upon to facilitate freight movements;  other private entities, such as trucking firms and terminal operators, rely  on what is primarily publicly-owned freight infrastructure, including the  National Highway System.", "To mitigate freight-related traffic congestion and meet other transportation  infrastructure needs, public and private transportation stakeholders may  enter into what are referred to as public-private partnerships. As we have  previously reported, these partnerships can offer benefits to the public  sector, such as the sharing or transferring of projects\u2019 financial risk to the  private sector and increased operational and management efficiency of  publicly-owned infrastructure, depending on the specific partnership  agreement.partnerships, private sector entities may provide direct funding to publicly- sponsored infrastructure projects, or enter into contracts with public  agencies to design and construct these projects. Other partnerships can  be more complex. For example, a private entity may assume control over  the operations and maintenance of an existing public asset, such as a toll  road, for a fixed period of time as part of a revenue-sharing agreement  with the public sector. Alternatively, a private entity may take  responsibility for all aspects of a new, publicly-sponsored infrastructure  project\u2014including design, finance, construction, and operations and  maintenance\u2014in exchange for periodic, performance-based payments  from the public sector, from which the private sector expects to profit. In   In more straightforward examples of public-private  prior work, we have noted that there is no \u201cfree\u201d money in public-private  partnerships\u2014for example, while highway public-private partnerships can  be used to obtain financing for highway infrastructure without the use of  public sector funding, this funding is a form of privately issued debt that  must be repaid to private investors seeking a return on their investment  by collecting toll revenues.", "In recent years, the federal government has placed an increasing  emphasis on the nation\u2019s freight transportation system in its surface  transportation authorizing legislation.

One of the goals is to  invest in infrastructure improvements and implement operational  improvements that reduce congestion\u2014which could potentially  incorporate local traffic congestion caused by freight flows. However,  according to DOT officials, DOT has generally treated congestion as a  source of delay in the delivery of freight shipments and hence as a factor  that reduces economic productivity, not as a factor that produces adverse  community impacts.

The national freight network is to include a  primary freight network and critical rural freight corridors to assist states in  strategically directing resources toward improved system performance for  efficient movement of freight on highways. The act established a deadline  of October 1, 2013 for DOT to designate the highway primary freight  network. In November 2013, DOT released for comment a draft primary  freight network. MAP-21 also requires DOT to develop a freight  transportation conditions and performance report by October 1, 2014,  which is to feed into the development of a national freight strategic plan  by October 1, 2015. Moreover, MAP-21 requires DOT to encourage each  state to develop a freight advisory committee and a state freight plan.

For example, CSX officials told us that, among  other factors, they consider the potential operational benefits to the  company when determining whether to participate in a public-private  partnership. They noted that if they find that a project has value to the  company and the overall partnership makes sense, CSX will provide  funding commensurate with its private benefit. In their view, contributions  beyond that amount would be paying for benefits to the environment or  the community, but not the railroad. Similarly, as part of its framework for  public-private partnerships, Union Pacific Railroad includes the following  principles: 1) the railroad pays for private benefits that will accrue to the  company and 2) public entities pay for the benefits that are enjoyed by  the public at large through public or general revenue sources.", "Federal regulations pertaining to railroads\u2019 contributions for grade  crossing elimination projects\u2014such as grade separations or crossing  closures\u2014also reflect the estimated operational benefit of these projects  to the railroads.

For instance,  according to Chicago Transportation Coordinating Office representatives,  although grade separation projects result in some benefit to the railroads,  the bulk of the benefits accrue to the community in the form of safety  improvements and congestion relief. In addition, BNSF representatives  told us that the company typically expects to contribute the required 5  percent to grade separation projects funded by the Railway-Highways  Crossings Program, since crossing closures generally do not produce  significant financial benefits to the company. However, according to  BNSF officials, if the results of the company\u2019s cost-benefit analysis  indicate that a crossing closure would produce benefits greater than 5  percent, either through cost avoidance or increased revenues, BNSF  would be willing to negotiate a contribution greater than the minimum  amount required.", "In certain circumstances, STB\u2014which issues licenses to railroads for rail  construction and acquisition projects\u2014can order a railroad to contribute  more than 5 percent towards a grade separation project as a condition of  its license approval. STB can impose this license condition on a railroad  only if:  the railroad is applying for a license from STB to construct a new line  that is extending into new territory, or is merging, consolidating, or  acquiring control of a rail carrier that is under the jurisdiction of STB;  and the transaction is consistent with the public interest. STB makes the  determination based on whether its environmental review of the  proposed construction or acquisition would result in environmental  impacts that justify a grade separation.", "For example, STB used this authority to order Canadian National Railroad  to pay for most of the costs of two grade separation projects (67 percent  and 78.5 percent respectively) as part of its acquisition of the Elgin, Joliet,  and Eastern Railway rail line. According to STB officials, in this case,  their review determined that the railroad would receive substantial  economic benefits from STB\u2019s approval of the acquisition and the  community would experience significant environmental impacts due to the  additional trains operating on the line. As a result, STB determined it was  appropriate to require the railroad to incur the majority of the grade  separations\u2019 cost. STB officials informed us that during the environmental  review process, rail applicants often offer voluntary environmental  mitigation measures to respond to community concerns, including freight- related traffic congestion. In several cases, STB has not had to impose  grade separation conditions due to railroads\u2019 voluntary mitigation.", "STB officials emphasized that STB has no authority to require railroads to  pay for grade separations along existing lines unless they are part of a  construction or acquisition project that necessitates an environmental  review by STB.

Several of the communities we visited with ongoing or recently  completed projects also had additional planned projects that were not yet  funded. For example, Chicago\u2019s CREATE Program lacks about $2.0  billion to complete 22 remaining projects, 13 of which are grade  separations.", "At the federal level, funding programs that can be used to address freight- related traffic congestion have broader goals and objectives that do not  always align with communities\u2019 congestion mitigation needs (see table 1  above for descriptions of these programs). For instance, DOT\u2019s Railway- Highway Crossings Program\u2014which provides funding to states for  highway-rail grade crossing improvements\u2014is focused on addressing  safety issues, not congestion. According to DOT officials, Railway- Highway Crossings Program funds can be used to address freight-related  traffic congestion so long as the congestion also presents a safety  issue. However, stakeholders noted that communities\u2019 congestion and  safety issues do not always intersect. For instance, Washington State  DOT (WSDOT) officials told us that while the Railway-Highway Crossings  Program\u2019s focus on safety is important, some communities face major  congestion issues that cannot be easily incorporated into a safety-related  project. They also noted that the concerns about highway-rail grade  crossings that WSDOT hears from communities across the state primarily  involve congestion issues, not safety issues. In cases when there is  overlap between congestion and safety issues, it can be difficult for states  to fund qualifying grade separation projects using these funds. The  average cost of the seven grade-separation projects we reviewed was  $37 million, yet most states receive less than $10 million from this  program annually and 50 percent of states\u2019 funds must be spent on  grade-crossing warning devices.", "At the state and local level, several transportation agencies told us that  much of their funding is needed to operate and maintain existing  infrastructure.

Consequently, the number of new projects NJ DOT can undertake to  address congestion is low. Similarly, an official in Billings, Montana, told  us that local transportation agencies are reluctant to undertake major new  projects, including those that are aimed at alleviating freight-related traffic  congestion, because funding is limited and one major project can tie up 5  or 6 years worth of available funds. In addition, local transportation  officials in Miami stated that it is almost impossible for many communities  to come up with a local match for freight-related projects because most  local revenues are used to operate and maintain existing infrastructure  and fund other priorities.", "We have previously found that freight projects may not compete well with  other types of transportation projects for limited available public funds  because their benefits are not always obvious to the public.  We have also found that public planners are wary of providing public support for  projects that directly benefit the private sector, a wariness that may make  it less likely that metropolitan planning organizations or state departments  of transportation will prioritize freight projects. Although projects to  mitigate freight-related traffic congestion in communities may have more  discernible public benefits than other freight projects, other factors can  affect their ability to compete or receive priority for funding. For example,  local transportation officials in Spokane, Washington, told us that  progress on the Bridging the Valley project has stalled because they have  been unable to secure funding for the project and operational  commitments from the two railroad companies involved. Local officials in  Billings stated that efforts to resolve long-standing traffic congestion  issues at highway-rail grade crossings in the city have been stalled both  by a lack of funding and by a lack of consensus on the best alternative for  addressing these issues. In addition, officials with the Port Authority of  New York and New Jersey told us that it is difficult for the Port Authority to  invest in roads that connect highways to ports because\u2014unlike the  tunnels and bridges it operates\u2014it doesn\u2019t own or receive revenue from  these roads. To address challenges associated with funding connector  roads, the National Freight Advisory Committee recommended in June  2014 that DOT develop federal-funding programs that support and  prioritize connectors that are part of regionally or nationally significant  freight networks.", "Data limitations may also make it challenging for project sponsors to fully  document the impacts of freight movements and compete for limited  available funding. As described previously, communities we visited had  varying levels of data on local impacts of freight-related traffic congestion,  with some communities lacking specific information on train or vehicular  movements to effectively measure these impacts.

In contrast to this centerline  approach, DOT has at times used a corridor approach in past  transportation work, in which the mileage of a transportation corridor  (such as the corridor between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore,  Maryland) would be counted towards the mileage of a network, while  allowing multiple roads\u2014or even rail lines, if the corridor was  multimodal\u2014along that corridor to also be included as part of a network.", "In fact, when it issued the draft primary freight network of 27,000  centerline miles for comment, DOT also identified a broader draft network  of more than 41,000 centerline miles that, according to DOT\u2019s analysis,  would be necessary to establish a primary freight network that consisted  of a comprehensive, connected set of roads for transporting goods  efficiently on highways throughout the nation. The comment period on the  draft primary freight network closed on February 15, 2014. According to  DOT officials, DOT is in the process of reviewing comments on the  highway primary freight network.", "Several organizations representing public or private freight-related  officials also commented that the prescribed mileage limit and centerline  approach had contributed to the selection of a network in which the roads  connecting ports or other freight centers to the Interstate Highway System  were not included. For example, according to the National Freight  Advisory Committee, few ports are connected to the proposed network,  including some of the busiest ports. One analysis found that 82 percent of  the over 150 policy-related comments submitted stated that freight  intermodal connectors\u2014such as roads connecting ports to freeways\u2014 should be included in the highway primary freight network. The National  Freight Advisory Committee commented that the draft primary freight  network fell short in part because it generally does not include these  connector roads, and the roads that trucks use to carry freight from and  into communities\u2014the roads where community impacts are most directly  experienced. Similarly, the I-95 Corridor Coalition criticized the draft,  stating that it omitted roads connecting major metropolitan areas and  roads serving important resource areas, such as those connecting the  New York State and Pennsylvania gas and oil fields to the region\u2019s  processing and population centers. These types of roads, which were  largely not included in the network in order to meet the mileage limit, are  all areas in which freight movement is likely to cause local traffic  congestion. In addition, the American Association of State Highway and  Transportation Officials stated that after seeing DOT\u2019s draft highway  primary freight network, it became apparent that a 27,000 mile network  based on centerline miles is far too small\u2014and it urged Congress to  adopt a corridor-based approach which incorporates multiple highway  facilities rather than highway centerline miles.", "In addition, the highway-focused and centerline approach precludes  including those rail line corridors where high levels of rail traffic going  through communities are likely to lead to local traffic impacts at highway- rail grade crossings. Railroad and DOT officials we spoke to told us that  grade crossing separations are considered largely a highway, not a  railroad issue. If those roadways where highway-rail grade crossings  cause delays are not included in the highway primary freight network, it  may limit states\u2019 flexibility to mitigate them if, for example, funding were to  be attached to the primary freight network.", "DOT and the National Freight Advisory Committee expressed the concern  that without clear goals for the highway primary freight network\u2014and in  the context of the mileage limitation\u2014it was difficult to select or comment  on which roads should be included in the network. As stated above,  Congress provided a general overarching vision for the national freight  network\u2014to assist states in strategically directing resources toward  improved system performance for efficient movement of freight on  highways. However, as the National Freight Advisory Committee stated in  its comments on the draft primary freight network, the intended purpose  of the primary freight network was not defined, including such questions  as how the primary freight network will be used and whether it will be  used to prioritize needs, justify future investment, or to develop rules or  regulations specific to the freight industry. DOT stated that without a  better understanding of the goals for the highway primary freight network,  it was challenging to gauge whether the resulting network would meet  future public planning and investment needs.", "Leading practices in capital planning emphasize that vision is a critical  success factor\u2014and that in establishing a vision, a defined purpose and  goals are critical for determining which areas should receive increased  emphasis and funding and which areas should remain stable or receive  reduced emphasis.

These principles include creating well-defined  goals based on identified areas of national interest and establishing and  clearly defining the federal role in achieving each goal in relation to the  roles of state and local governments and other stakeholders. In line with  this framework, in prior work, we found that clearly defining the federal  interest allows policymakers to clarify the goals for federal involvement  and can clearly define the roles of federal, state, and local government in  working toward each goal. The lack of a clearly defined purpose for the  highway primary freight network, combined with the mileage limit  imposed, resulted in a draft network that omits certain types of freight- related roads, such as roads connecting ports to freeways, while including  others, such as major Interstate freeways with heavy truck volumes,  without a clear understanding that this was the network Congress  intended or of the ramifications of these choices. According to DOT  officials, the omission of certain types of freight-related roads from the  national freight network\u2014of which the primary freight network is one  part\u2014was driven by several factors, including the requirement that all  interstate highways be included in the national freight network. DOT  stated that the non-inclusion of roads connecting ports to freeways was  due to the fact that MAP-21 allows rural freight connectors to be  designated by the states as part of the national freight network but did not  allow urban freight connectors to be designated by the states as part of  the national freight network. Moreover, DOT cited a lack of data on these  roads connecting ports to the Interstate Highway System that makes it  difficult to identify at the federal level which ones should be a part of the  national freight network.", "DOT\u2019s surface transportation reauthorization proposal, GROW America,  which was introduced in the House of Representatives in June 2014,  could address concerns about establishing a clear purpose for the  primary freight network and the mileage limit requirement of 27,000  centerline miles.

However,  DOT\u2019s interim guidance to states on state freight plans did not identify  specific goals, objectives, or performance measures for addressing  freight-related congestion in local communities, and does not provide  details on how states could consider documenting or addressing  community impacts such as freight-related traffic congestion.", "According to DOT officials, DOT did not include details in its state freight  plan guidance on how states could consider documenting or addressing  community impacts because MAP-21 does not require state freight plans  to consider community impacts, and because states are not required to  adopt federal goals and are not required to prepare a state freight plan.  Moreover, DOT officials stated that it should be up to the states to identify  goals, objectives, and performance measures in their state freight plans.  However, without specific guidance related to how to consider community  impacts amongst other freight priorities, it may be difficult for those states  with concerns related to the local traffic congestion impacts of freight to  fully incorporate these concerns and issues in their state freight plans.  This difficulty, in turn, could reduce the usefulness of state freight plans to  DOT in considering these issues for the National Freight Strategic Plan in  order to more clearly articulate the federal and state roles in this area.", "In addition, DOT has begun work on the required Freight Transportation  Conditions and Performance Report, which is due in October 2014, and  which will also eventually feed into the National Freight Strategic Plan.  According to DOT officials, for the Freight Transportation Conditions and  Performance Report, DOT is developing performance measures in six  areas, one of which\u2014reducing adverse environmental and community  impacts\u2014relates to the impacts of freight on local communities.  However, DOT officials stated that they have not established a clear  vision of the federal role in this area because of a lack of national data on  these issues. For example, DOT officials stated that while they have  been working to develop quantitative measures in each of the six areas  established for the Freight Transportation Conditions and Performance  Report, they do not have national data on adverse environmental and  community impacts and will probably discuss these issues anecdotally.", "As a result, in the Freight Transportation Conditions and Performance  Report, DOT is not planning to identify specific goals, objectives, or  measures for addressing freight-related congestion in local communities.", "DOT also expressed concerns about the availability of national freight  data in its comments on the draft primary freight network. Specifically,  DOT expressed concern that data limitations could reduce the likelihood  that certain types of roads where freight-related congestion impacts are  likely to be felt would be included in the highway primary freight network.  DOT stated that the data utilized for the development of the draft primary  freight network comprises the best information available on freight  behavior at a national level. However, DOT commented that urban and  rural areas that are the site of significant freight facilities where highway  freight intersects with other modes, such as ports, do not always show up  well in the available national data sets it used for developing the highway  primary freight network.", "In June 2014, the National Freight Advisory Committee cited the lack of  data for monitoring and analyzing the freight system as a barrier to  improved system performance and made several recommendations  related to improving data. These recommendations included, among  other things, that data collection efforts should be tailored to performance  measures that are in line with specific outcomes that DOT and Congress  want to obtain, with increased emphasis on the multimodal national  freight system, and that DOT should partner with objective third party  organizations to facilitate data collection agreements with private  industry.", "Leading practices in capital planning emphasize that another important  success factor in effective decisionmaking is the availability of good  information. Good data and information systems are essential to  supporting sound capital planning and decision-making. The data and  information provided by well-planned information systems give  organizations the ability to build comprehensive measures, collect  relevant data, and perform analyses that can be used to support strategic   As previously described, we  as well as operational budgeting decisions.also found that data limitations reduced our ability to analyze highway  freight trends\u2014information that could be key to helping states and the  federal government establish relevant goals and prioritize mitigation  efforts in these areas. We found the following causes of these data  limitations:", "While states are required to annually submit information on highway  traffic counts for DOT\u2019s Highway Performance Monitoring system (a  national level highway information system that includes data on the  extent, condition, performance, use, and operating characteristics of  the nation\u2019s highways), some DOT officials cautioned against using  this information as a measure of freight flows because of concerns  that information on truck traffic percentages is not consistently  recorded. Moreover, the truck volume information submitted by states  is not separated out by freight truck versus other types of trucks, but  rather by vehicle class, such as light truck, single unit, or combination  unit. DOT does present data on national freight truck flows through its  freight analysis framework, which, according to DOT, integrates data  from a variety of sources to create a comprehensive picture of freight  movement among states and major metropolitan areas by all modes  of transportation. DOT considers this data to be reliable, but this  framework depends, in part, on Census data and additional analysis  by DOT, and is updated only every 5 years, with over a 2-year  reporting lag. In other words, the currently available freight analysis  framework data is from 2007, and the updated freight analysis  framework data, which will be based on 2012 data, is not expected to  be released until 2015.", "While DOT officials stated that they consider the Highway  Performance Monitoring System data on vehicle counts for general  vehicular (not specifically truck) traffic to be reliable for roads that  receive federal aid, very limited data on roads off the national highway  system is collected; thus, DOT officials do not consider Highway  Performance Monitoring System data a good tool with which to  understand specific local impacts of freight traffic.", "According to some DOT, state, and local officials, private railroads are  often unwilling to provide detailed information on train counts, lengths,  speed, and times to local communities to help them quantify traffic  impacts at highway-grade rail crossings. Some state officials had  received much of this specific information for certain highway-rail  grade crossings, while others we spoke to said they had been unable  to get this information. As previously described, BNSF officials stated  they plan to work with communities to provide relevant information,  and that they refer communities to FRA\u2019s Grade Crossing Inventory,  but this inventory includes only average daily train numbers and the  timetable (not actual) speed, and, as previously described, may not be  current.", "DOT officials stated that in the absence of reliable national data related to  potential adverse environmental and community impacts of freight, DOT  will likely discuss this anecdotally in the Freight Transportation Conditions  and Performance Report being developed. They stated that they planned  to outline categories of community impacts that might be significant,  including noise, heavy freight traffic on community streets, and railroads  blocking highway-rail grade crossings and interfering with operations of  emergency vehicles. DOT\u2019s efforts may represent the beginning of  defining a national role related to the traffic-related congestion impacts of  freight on communities. For example, the categories DOT told us they  were considering align well with some of the areas that stakeholders told  us were most problematic in terms of impacts on the community and with  the areas where communities\u2019 mitigation efforts have been focused.  According to DOT officials, DOT plans to attempt to define national data  limitations in the Freight Transportation Conditions and Performance  Report and to describe what actions DOT is taking to reduce these  limitations. However, DOT stated that it was not planning to put forward a  strategy to improve the availability of national data to quantify and assess  freight trends and impacts on local traffic congestion because of the  difficulty of doing so. DOT stated that national data are, by definition,  national, and cannot quantify impacts on local traffic congestion. DOT  also stated that the question of how to aggregate local data to produce  national measures is a difficult one, and it is not yet clear how this can be  accomplished. We understand that improving the availability of national  data to quantify and assess freight trends and impacts on local  congestion is a difficult and complex task.  Moreover, we understand that  such an effort could involve some combination of improving the level of  detail of national data or aggregating local data to produce national  measures, and that efforts in each of these areas are likely to involve  resolving many underlying issues.  At the same time, DOT has developed  guidance to help improve the granularity of national data in ways that  could help improve the national understanding of local traffic congestion  impacts.  For example, in its current guidance to states on the Highway  Performance Monitoring System (under frequently asked questions), DOT  includes information on how states can work to improve the information  they provide for this national data set on the percentage of trucks on road  sample sections.  In our Executive Guide on the Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA), we found that a key step for  agencies to take to become more results-oriented was to define clear  missions and desired outcomes\u2014corresponding to the requirement in  GPRA for federal agencies to develop strategic plans. Without a  strategy defining clear missions and desired outcomes related to  improving data that would help quantify freight-related traffic congestion,  DOT may miss the opportunity to build on its current data-improvement  efforts and identify future data-improvement efforts that could help  establish and clarify the national role in this area.", "In addition, as previously described in this report, we found data  limitations at the state or local level that reduced state or local officials\u2019  ability to quantify rail-related freight impacts on local communities. As a  result, we found that communities we visited had varying levels of  quantified information on impacts such as traffic delay times or costs. The  inconsistency and incompleteness of such information at the state or local  level is likely to reduce the ability of states to appropriately prioritize  efforts to mitigate such impacts against other types of funding priorities  and measure progress towards goals\u2014and could also hamper DOT\u2019s  efforts to consider these issues from a national perspective. Without  reliable national and state data on the community impacts of freight,  measuring the extent of freight-related traffic congestion and tracking the  progress of efforts to mitigate the impacts will be difficult to do. However,  DOT\u2019s interim guidance on state freight plans did not provide specific  suggestions as to what data states could collect, report, or analyze in  order to improve their ability to prioritize impacts of freight on local traffic  congestion or other freight-related issues.", "DOT\u2019s efforts as previously described do not yet fully establish the federal  role in this area, which could limit the usefulness of the eventual National  Freight Strategic Plan in laying out a strategy related to these issues. In  our Executive Guide on the Government Performance and Results Act  (GPRA), we found that a key step for agencies to take to become more  results-oriented was to define clear missions and desired outcomes\u2014 corresponding to the requirement in GPRA for federal agencies to  develop strategic plans. The National Freight Strategic Plan is therefore  an appropriate document for DOT to incorporate the key principles  previously described for assessing surface transportation programs,  including creating well-defined goals based on identified areas of national  interest, which involves examining the relevance and relative priority of  existing programs in light of 21st century challenges and identifying  emerging areas of national importance. The extent to which local traffic- congestion impacts of freight are of national importance has not been  clearly established. However, it is clear that these impacts are caused by  national freight movement that has national benefits\u2014but, especially in  the case of pass-through traffic\u2014does not necessarily have benefits for  the communities experiencing the congestion or other negative impacts.  Moreover, as described earlier, it appears that freight traffic may increase  in coming years, particularly in certain states and along certain corridors,  and these increases, if they occur, are likely to increase certain national  benefits while also increasing negative local impacts in affected  communities. The development of the National Freight Strategic Plan  provides an opportunity to more clearly focus the federal role in this area.  As we have concluded in prior work, without a clearly defined federal role,  policymakers lack clarity on how to allocate scarce federal resources  according to the level of national interest."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Freight-related traffic congestion affects communities of all sizes in the  U.S. In some locations, communities have struggled for decades to  address long-standing freight-related traffic congestion issues due to  funding and other challenges; elsewhere, such as in North Dakota\u2019s  Bakken Region, these impacts have emerged relatively recently. Given  that freight volumes are expected to continue to increase over the next 25  years and beyond, a growing number of communities will likely be  seeking to devise and fund solutions to mitigate the impacts of freight- related traffic congestion.", "The implementation of MAP-21\u2019s requirements provides an opportunity to  consider the extent to which there should be a national role in addressing  freight-related traffic congestion. Although it is known that national freight  movements contribute to local freight-related traffic congestion, neither  MAP-21 nor DOT has yet established a clear federal role in mitigating or  helping communities address these impacts. Defining this role is likely to  be more important in coming years if freight traffic, in particular related to  the movement of oil and coal for export by train and the intermodal  movement of goods in and out of ports by truck or train, increases as  expected. However, DOT\u2019s efforts related to the development the  National Freight Strategic Plan\u2014including its interim guidance to states  on state freight plans\u2014so far have not established a clear federal role by  identifying specific goals, objectives, and measures for addressing freight- related congestion in local communities. These limitations could limit the  usefulness of the eventual National Freight Strategic Plan in laying out a  strategy related to these issues. Moreover, underlying any efforts to  address freight-related traffic congestion are a number of data limitations  both national and local, which if resolved, may assist in better defining the  extent of freight-related congestion and its impacts and also assist in  prioritizing projects to mitigate such impacts at both the state and national  level. Finally, in its draft primary freight network, DOT was hampered in  attempting to take into consideration all eight factors Congress provided  as guidance by the lack of a clear purpose established for the highway  primary freight network and by the mileage limit imposed. Consequently,  it is unclear how the primary freight network will eventually be used or  what Congress intended to be included or excluded from the primary  freight network. Clarifying the purpose and goals of the network and  determining the extent to which local roads and connectors should be  included\u2014and the extent to which the mileage requirements prohibit the  inclusion of freight-important roads, including those where communities  often experience freight related traffic congestion\u2014would help to  establish the federal role in freight-related traffic congestion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In reauthorizing the federal highway program, Congress should consider  establishing a clear purpose for the national freight network and primary  freight network that incorporates inclusion of the types of roads where  communities are likely to experience significant freight-related traffic  congestion, and, as relevant to this purpose, consider revising certain  requirements such as the mileage limit of 27,000 miles or changing the  requirement from a centerline to a corridor approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to clarify the federal role related to freight-related local traffic  congestion, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation take the  following two actions in implementing MAP-21 and any subsequent  reauthorization:  in its final guidance on state freight plans, incorporate additional  information to help states define and prioritize local community  impacts of national freight movements, including traffic-congestion  impacts, and to establish what data could be consistently collected  and analyzed in order to prioritize impacts of freight on local traffic  congestion;  include in the National Freight Strategic Plan a written statement  articulating the federal role in freight-related local congestion impacts,  by clearly identifying potential objectives and goals (under the general  area DOT has established for the Freight Transportation Conditions  and Performance Report of reducing adverse environmental and  community impacts) for mitigating local congestion caused by national  freight movements and the type of role federal and state stakeholders  could play in achieving each objective and goal, and including a  written strategy for improving the availability of national data needed  to quantify, assess, and establish measures on freight trends and  impacts on local traffic congestion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to DOT.

DOT also stated that in developing the National Freight  Strategic Plan, DOT has heard from the National Freight Advisory  Committee and other stakeholders recommending that DOT articulate a  clear federal role in the movement of freight, including addressing first  and last mile connectors in both urban and rural areas where community  impacts are often most acutely felt.

We selected carloads as a measure because of its  relevance to traffic congestion at highway-rail grade crossings. We chose  to analyze STB data beginning in 2007 after being advised by STB  officials that to examine recent trends, 2007 was more indicative than  2008 of rail traffic before the recent U.S. economic recession. We focused  on trends related to intermodal, coal, and crude oil transportation by rail  because they were emphasized by STB and AAR officials as having a  significant impact on changes in rail traffic in recent years. In addition,  intermodal and coal carloads are the only two product types to make up  at least 20 percent of all rail carloads in 2012, and, while crude oil  represented only about 1 percent of all rail carloads in 2012, the  percentage increase in crude oil carloads from 2007 to 2012\u2014of  approximately 3,188 percent\u2014was far higher than the percentage change  of any other commodity. We also looked at trends in carloads at the  national and state level, using the STB data\u2019s state-through indicator as  the measure of whether a carload was in a state. We reviewed the  reliability of STB\u2019s data by reviewing related documentation, examining  the data for irregularities, and interviewing agency officials about their  data collection procedures and controls for maintaining the data. Carload  figures are considered estimates because they are based on data  sampling rather than complete reporting. We estimated that for 2007- 2012, the margin of error for carloads of all commodities we examined  was less than 5 percent except crude oil, which had a higher margin of  error until 2012. Crude oil carloads, which existed in small numbers in  2007-2011, had for those years a declining margin of error that started at  26 percent in 2007 and went down to about 8 percent in 2011. For 2012,  the margin of error for crude oil carloads was less than 5 percent. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  our review. We also received information from the Association of  American Railroads (AAR) on rail carload levels in 2013, according to  AAR data.", "To provide context on freight flow volumes in the U.S., we reviewed the  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) methodology for a map it had  published showing freight flow tonnage on highways, rail, and inland  waterways for 2010. This map used a combination of DOT\u2019s 2007 Freight  Analysis Framework data, updated through additional analysis involving  DOT\u2019s Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) truck flow data  and economic information in order to present information on highway  freight flows; STB data on rail volumes in 2010 as flowed over the rail  network by DOT\u2019s Federal Railroad Administration (FRA); and Army  Corps of Engineers\u2019 2010 data on freight tonnage on inland waterways.  We investigated whether we could update this map to 2012 but learned  that we could not because 2010 was the most recent year available for  sufficiently reliable information on highway freight flows. We therefore  analyzed these data to present a map of 2010 freight flows. We reviewed  the reliability of these data by examining documentation from the agency,  interviewing knowledgeable agency officials about the data collection  procedures, and discussing with FRA officials their procedure for flowing  STB rail data on rail lines. We concluded that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes used in our report.", "To determine how truck freight flows are changing, we investigated  whether we could use a federal data source on truck flows, but on  reviewing the options with DOT officials, learned that the main federal  source of data, HPMS, could not reliably be used to analyze freight truck  trends from 2007 to 2012 because, among other things, the data do not  sufficiently distinguish among classes of trucks. As a result, to provide  general information on trends in truck flows from 2007 to 2012, we  reported information available in studies by the ATA and the American  Transportation Research Institute, the research arm of ATA, which  performs some of its studies in partnership with the Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA). We reviewed DOT\u2019s evaluation of the ATA truck  tonnage data and the methodologies used in the American Transportation  Research Institute studies and determined that they were sufficiently  reliable to use to provide contextual information. We also obtained some  information on freight truck levels in 2013 from ATA and ATRI and  interviewed ATRI, ATA, Owner-Operator Independent Drivers  Association, and DOT officials.", "To present a map of public highway-rail grade crossings that had over  certain thresholds of both rail and vehicular traffic, we analyzed data from  three sources: FRA\u2019s National Grade Crossing Inventory for the location  of highway-rail grade crossings, DOT\u2019s 2012 HPMS data on average  annual daily traffic (AADT) for vehicular traffic, and STB\u2019s 2012 data on  rail carloads annually, as flowed over the rail lines by FRA. We used  DOT\u2019s 2012 HPMS data and STB\u2019s 2012 rail data after determining that it  was the most recent, reliable national data available for each type of  traffic. Through discussions with DOT officials, we determined that  HPMS\u2019s vehicular count data as measured by AADT (as opposed to its  truck count data discussed above) are sufficiently reliable for purposes of  our review. Our analysis showed that 44,982 grade crossings identified in  FRA\u2019s National Grade Crossing Inventory were on roads for which 2012  HPMS data included AADT information (all federal-aid highways and  highways designated on the National Highway System, covering about 25  percent of all public roads) and on rail lines that were included in FRA\u2019s  flow of STB rail data for 2012 (rail lines used by rail carriers terminating  4,500 or more revenue carloads annually). Because of the lack of data on  congestion at rail crossings, we were unable to identify the thresholds for  levels of vehicular traffic or of train carload traffic above which a highway- rail grade crossing becomes problematic to a community due to local  traffic congestion impacts. Moreover, from our interviews and case  studies, we had determined that there are a number of factors that feed  into how problematic a community considers a highway-rail grade  crossing, such as the centrality of the crossing to a community and the  extent to which emergency vehicles are located on one side of the  crossing. Furthermore, our data selection, as described, only includes  certain highways and railways, and there may be other roads and  railways where communities experience local traffic congestion impacts of  rail traffic. Nonetheless, we determined that it would be useful to display  the geographic distribution of crossings that exceed these thresholds of  vehicular and rail carload traffic.", "After considering the thresholds used to by FRA to identify ranges of  carload numbers presented in national maps of rail flows, and after  considering AADT volume group ranges as identified by DOT in its HPMS  field guide, we selected the threshold of 200,000 or more rail carloads  annually and 10,000 or more AADT. We selected these thresholds  because they represented crossings with higher vehicular and train  carload traffic levels and because higher traffic levels are related to  congestion. Because we lacked data that would directly link these  thresholds to congestion, however, it is possible that some crossings  above these thresholds do not experience congestion while other  crossings below these thresholds do experience congestion. Selecting  lower thresholds would produce more crossings and selecting higher  thresholds would produce fewer crossings and would result in different  spatial patterns. We identified that 3,762 crossings met both of these  thresholds. These crossings represent about 8 percent of all crossings in  our population. We reviewed the reliability of these data by reviewing  documentation from the agency on the collection of this data and  interviewing agency officials about their data collection procedures. We  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes they  were used for in this report.", "To determine how freight-related traffic congestion impacts communities,  how communities have funded mitigation efforts for freight-related traffic  congestion, and what challenges, if any, exist, we selected twelve  locations in seven states: Chicago, Illinois; Seattle, Spokane, and  Edmonds, Washington; Billings and Glendive, Montana; Williston (and  surrounding communities in the Bakken oil field region), North Dakota;  Gulfport and Pascagoula, Mississippi; Miami, Florida; Paulsboro, New  Jersey and the New York City metropolitan region, including projects for  New Jersey and New York. We selected these locations to provide a  range of population sizes and geographic locations. Sizes include a mix  of three large cities (population greater than 500,000); three medium  cities (population between 100,000 and 500,000); and six small,  communities (population less than 100,000). The locations are in the  east/mid Atlantic, south, mid-west, west and northwest regions of the  country. We also selected locations with differing types of federal funding  obtained, such as Transportation Infrastructure Finance and Innovation  Act (TIFIA) assistance or Transportation Investment Generating  Economic Recovery (TIGER) grants, and locations with and without  marine ports.", "Where feasible, at each location, we interviewed state and local officials,  railroads, metropolitan planning organizations (MPO), port officials, and  private contractors, and toured congested areas with mitigation activities,  such as improved intermodal connections, the relocation of rail  interchanges, and grade separation projects. Where available we  obtained information on the costs of mitigation projects and studies  documenting and measuring freight congestion impacts. We reviewed the  methodology and assumptions of these studies. We also reviewed  information on transportation trends and conditions and state and local  impacts of transporting certain commodities such as coal and oil, as well  as the local impacts from rail and highway freight-transportation  operations including plans by localities for new truck routes to bypass  their downtown. Where available we obtained state level documents and  plans including state freight and rail plans.
