DOD expects to spend more than $1 billion to develop and deploy DMSS over 10 years from fiscal years 1993 through 2003. In its report on the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1995, the Committee expressed concern that despite spending billions of dollars for information technology over the last few years, DOD had not achieved significant quality improvements, cost savings, and productivity gains in service operations. The Committee directed the Secretary of Defense to conduct a study to determine the best prototype depot maintenance system and directed GAO to assess the soundness of the study\u2019s conclusions.", "The Department, however, has not done a study in response to this requirement. DOD officials stated that, in their opinion, two studies done by the Logistics Management Institute during 1994 comparing the services depot maintenance automated systems would meet the legislative requirement.

The depots have primary responsibility for the maintenance, overhaul, and repair of large items, such as tanks, ships, and airplanes, and small and intricate ones, such as communications and electronic components. Depot maintenance consists of three basic business processes: project management (maintenance of major-end items, such as airplanes, ships, and tanks), reparables management (maintenance of items, such as engines, transmissions, and radios), and specialized support (various individual functions, such as tracking hazardous materials, tools, and test samples).", "For years, GAO and DOD have reported on major problems facing the depot maintenance area, principally that DOD\u2019s depot management structure has not resulted in substantial competition, interservicing, or reduction of excess capacity and duplication of effort. For example: In 1983, GAO testified that DOD had not moved quickly to eliminate duplicate capability and excess capacity within depot maintenance because of (1) parochial interests, (2) lack of central authority, and (3) absence of DOD-wide planning. In 1993, the Joint Chiefs of Staff reported that closing a significant number of depots was needed to reduce excess capacity and that significant savings could come from consolidating depot workload across service boundaries. In May 1993, we testified, that the Joint Chiefs of Staff identified 25 to 50 percent more depot capacity than will be needed in the future and that this problem had been exacerbated by (1) the end of the cold war, (2) reduction of defense systems and equipment, (3) retirement of less reliable and more maintenance-intensive systems, and (4) the private sector\u2019s push for a greater share of the depot maintenance workload. In 1993, we reported that internal controls at Army depots did not adequately safeguard millions of dollars of weapons and equipment during the maintenance processes. Specifically, we reported that poor storage practices increased maintenance costs, depot inventory records were not accurate, and the Army\u2019s depot cost accounting system did not capture actual job costs. In 1995, DOD reported to the Congress that its financial systems and databases were inadequate to provide the type of information to determine the cost-effectiveness of greater public-private competition for providing depot maintenance services.", "Over the last several years, DOD has taken a number of actions to correct these problems. One of these actions is its Corporate Information Management initiative, which was established to prepare DOD for future budget reductions and post-cold war readiness requirements through (1) streamlining business processes, (2) integrating essential data systems, and (3) eliminating duplicate or redundant information systems across the Department. The DMSS project was undertaken as part of this effort."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategy for Addressing Depot Maintenance Problems", "paragraphs": ["To improve its depot maintenance operations and manage its resources more efficiently, the Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) for logistics, in November 1991, established the Joint Logistics System Center (JLSC). JLSC is to facilitate the improvement of depot maintenance processes by identifying business process improvements and managing the development and deployment of a standard depot maintenance system to replace service-unique systems currently used.", "In January 1994, JLSC prepared an economic analysis recommending development and deployment of a standard depot maintenance information system\u2014called the Depot Maintenance Resource Planning (DMRP) system, which consisted of four system components. Currently, the standard information system consists of eight components and is called DMSS. The following table identifies the core depot maintenance business processes and the eight system components selected to support them.", "By implementing DMRP, DOD expected a return on its investment of $2.6 billion through business process improvements and savings derived from replacing more than 60 service-unique automated depot maintenance information systems. Specifically, these benefits are to be derived from (1) reduced direct and indirect labor costs, (2) reduced direct and indirect material costs, (3) reduced costs associated with shutting down old information technology (legacy) systems, (4) shorter cycle time for certain types of maintenance and inspections, and (5) automation of many currently paper-based work processes.", "Our concerns with this strategy are twofold. First, DOD did not base its decision to develop and deploy DMSS on convincing analyses of expected system development and deployment costs or detailed assessments of DMSS\u2019s economic and technical risks. Further, Defense did not obtain the independent reviews by the MAISRC and approvals by the MDA of the project\u2019s milestones, which are designed to ensure the decision was consistent with sound business practice. Second, we believe that DOD needs to consider reengineering entire processes before implementing system changes if it is to achieve the dramatic reductions in operational support costs called for by CIM."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DUSD(L) Did Not Use Sufficient Analyses in Selecting DMSS", "paragraphs": ["In selecting DMSS as DOD\u2019s initial step toward improving defense maintenance depot operations, the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics (DUSD(L)) did not base its decision on sufficient analyses of expected system development and deployment costs or detailed assessments of DMSS\u2019s economic and technical risks. Further, DUSD(L) did not obtain independent milestone reviews and approvals which are designed to ensure (1) decisions are consistent with sound business principles and (2) risks inherent in large information systems projects are adequately managed. Thus, even the marginal improvements Defense expects from DMSS may never be achieved.", "Defense directives require that decisions to develop and deploy information systems be based on convincing, well-supported estimates of project costs, benefits, and risks. These directives establish a disciplined process for selecting the best projects based on comparisons of competing alternatives.", "Defense\u2019s principal means for comparing various alternatives is a functional economic analysis. For each alternative, it identifies resource, schedule, and other critical project characteristics and presents estimates of the costs, benefits, and risks. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation is required to validate these estimates to help ensure that the economic analysis presents compelling quantitative data for each of the alternatives being evaluated. Once an alternative is chosen, the analysis becomes the basis for project approval. Any significant change in the project\u2019s expected costs, benefits, or risks requires that the project selection and direction be reevaluated.", "Also, DOD directives established the Major Automated Information System Review Council (MAISRC) to provide oversight of individual major information system projects. At each development milestone for proposed information system projects, MAISRC reviews these projects to determine if they are consistent with DOD policies and directives. MAISRC then recommends continuation, redirection, or termination of each project to the project\u2019s Milestone Decision Authority (MDA). DOD\u2019s current policy is to ensure that funds are not obligated for any automated information system until the MAISRC milestone review and MDA approval are complete.", "In January 1994, following the logistics CIM migration strategy, the JLSC evaluated three alternatives for improving the core Defense depot maintenance functions. The alternatives considered involved (1) maintaining status quo by allowing each service to continue to operate its own information system with some new development under JLSC\u2019s purview, (2) choosing a corporate information system from among the services and establishing it as the DOD-wide standard system\u2014deploying it either immediately and then enhancing it over a 3-year period or deploying it after enhancements, and (3) developing a new system.", "In selecting an alternative, DUSD(L) did not evaluate sufficiently accurate cost data and detailed assessment of risks, nor did it obtain milestone reviews and approvals designed to ensure automated information systems are selected consistent with sound business practices."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DUSD(L) Selected DMSS Without Sufficient Cost Data", "paragraphs": ["DUSD(L) selected DMSS without analyzing the system\u2019s full development and deployment costs. Instead, it relied on a functional economic analysis of a previously proposed project\u2014the Depot Maintenance Resource Planning (DMRP) system. This analysis significantly understated DMSS costs by including costs for only some components, and it understated costs for the components it did include. In early 1994, the JLSC Commander recognized that the DMRP economic analysis did not reflect DMSS as defined.", "According to JLSC officials, DUSD(L) used the DMRP functional economic analysis as a basis for selecting DMSS because it was the best available at the time. The DMRP analysis estimated project costs at $988 million\u2014$582 million to develop and deploy and $406 million to operate and support over a 10-year period. These officials stated that the DMRP analysis fairly represented the DMSS project. However, the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation reviewed this analysis and found its level of detail insufficient to validate either cost or benefit estimates.", "Although we also found insufficient details supporting cost and benefit estimates, we believe that DMSS will cost significantly more than the DMRP. As shown in table 2, the DMRP economic analysis included costs for only three of the eight DMSS system components. Therefore, the analysis understated DMSS costs by the amount necessary to develop and deploy the five additional system components. As of February 1995, JLSC had not completed a cost estimate for these five additional components.", "In addition, the DMRP economic analysis underestimated costs for system components common to both DMRP and DMSS projects. Specifically, it underestimated licensing costs for using commercially owned software, costs to exchange data with other information systems, and costs to install the system.", "One example of underestimated licensing costs is in a key DMSS component\u2014the Air Force\u2019s Depot Maintenance Management Information System (DMMIS). Over the last 10 years, the Air Force spent over $200 million to develop DMMIS for use in its maintenance depots. Originally designed around a core of commercially available application and database software, the Air Force chose to extensively modify this proprietary software to better meet its unique depot maintenance requirements. However, all software versions remain the sole property of the commercial developers. As a result, to use the DMMIS system, DOD will have to pay license fees to several commercial software developers.", "Although the DMRP economic analysis did not specify DMMIS license fee costs, JLSC officials stated that $1.6 million per site was included in the deployment cost totals. In February 1995, JLSC estimated that DMMIS license fees for just the development facility and two operational sites would exceed $13 million, including a one-time payment of over $5 million and nearly $850,000 each year over the system\u2019s life. As of April 1995, JLSC expected to run DMMIS at three additional sites. Licensing agreements had yet to be negotiated for these sites.", "The DMRP analysis also underestimated costs to develop interfaces needed to allow system components to exchange data with the information systems currently used by the services to accomplish their missions. While the analysis recognized that system components must interface with other systems, it did not include the full cost of these interfaces. According to JLSC officials, some costs to interface the DMMIS and Programmed Depot Maintenance Scheduling System were included in the $37.7 million estimate for developing the system\u2019s software applications. However, they did not specify these costs.", "Although JLSC has yet to identify them, DMSS will require numerous system interfaces if it is to be the corporate depot maintenance system. For example, prior work done by the Air Force to deploy DMMIS, before it was selected as a DMSS component, identified 73 required interfaces just to meet Air Force requirements. As a DMSS system component, additional DMMIS interfaces will be needed to meet Army, Navy, and Marine Corps requirements. Further, interfaces for the remaining seven DMSS system components must be identified and developed. In February 1995, JLSC\u2019s Deputy Director for Depot Maintenance estimated that $70 million not included in the DMRP economic analysis would be needed to develop the DMSS interfaces.", "Finally, the DMRP economic analysis underestimated costs for deploying the system. The analysis estimates $497 million for system deployment. This estimate includes nonrecurring costs of $17 million to install the system at each operational site. Since DMSS was initiated, JLSC has identified that an additional $60 million would be needed to deploy the system.", "In May 1994, the JLSC Commander told the DOD Comptroller about the DMRP economic analysis. The Commander stated that the economic analysis briefed to DUSD(L) in December 1993 and submitted for the DOD Comptroller\u2019s review in early 1994 did not reflect DMSS as it was then defined. Further, he stated that to accommodate changes requested by the Comptroller and the office of Program Analysis and Evaluation and to reflect the current DMSS, JLSC was developing a new analysis. According to JLSC officials, the final economic analysis is expected to be completed in July 1995. However, by this time Defense will have spent more than $200 million to develop and deploy DMSS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DUSD(L) Selected DMSS Without Fully Assessing Risks", "paragraphs": ["Although any large automated information system development project is inherently a high-risk venture, DUSD(L) decided to develop and deploy DMSS without first fully assessing the risks to the project\u2019s success. Without a detailed risk assessment, DOD has no assurance that DUSD(L) selected the best information system alternative for improving defense depot maintenance operations, nor can it plan actions designed to avoid or lessen the potential for project delay, overspending, or failure.", "DOD has long recognized that project success relies on its ability to manage risk. The Defense Systems Management College guide on risk management states that, as a minimum, a prudent manager should attempt to understand system specific risks and quantify their potential impact for each alternative. While the earlier DMRP analysis identified several potential risks associated with each alternative being considered, it did not quantitatively or qualitatively compare these risks. Additionally, it did not contain any plans to mitigate potential project risks.", "After DUSD(L) selected DMSS, JLSC convened a customer advisory team in April 1994 to identify and generate ideas on how to mitigate DMSS risks. This team, with membership from all the military services, identified a number of risks facing DMSS, such as (1) incomplete design and testing of the two core DMSS systems\u2014Depot Maintenance Management Information System and the Baseline Advanced Industrial Management System, (2) not enough personnel to implement and maintain the system, (3) inability to obtain service cooperation needed to successfully build and deploy the system, (4) numerous external and internal interface issues, and (5) depot maintenance workers\u2019 reluctance to work with an entirely new system.", "JLSC requested another high-level risk analysis of the depot maintenance standard system strategy from the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s Center For Integration & Interoperability (CFI&I). In a July 1994 briefing to JLSC, CFI&I said that program management posed the greatest risks to DMSS success. CFI&I said the project lacked (1) integrated detailed planning specifying the activities and milestones to be achieved at each depot and (2) coordination of events necessary to implement the system, and that, as a result, there was no assurance that DMSS could meet cost, schedule, and performance expectations.", "In addition, CFI&I identified a number of technical risks to DMSS implementation, including (1) no encompassing data migration strategy, (2) incomplete and inadequate understanding of the requirement to interface DMSS with other current service systems, (3) difficulties associated with maintaining modified commercially owned software, and (4) incomplete development and testing of two of the system components.", "In October 1994, JLSC began an iterative detailed assessment of DMSS to quantify risks, identify possible mitigation or avoidance steps, and develop a risk management plan.

Despite this DOD policy, DUSD(L) spent nearly $180 million in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 on DMSS, and budgeted $111.2 million in fiscal year 1995 and $95.1 million in fiscal year 1996. These budgeted amounts are for the development and deployment of DMSS and do not include amounts to maintain and operate the current systems.", "According to the director of logistics systems development within DUSD(L), DMSS will be submitted for MAISRC review and MDA approval during 1995. However, we found that as of February 1995, DMSS was on the MAISRC review schedule for 1995 but no date for the review had been established. The director also indicated that continued implementation of DMSS at selected prototype sites is justified based on past MAISRC reviews and MDA approvals of the DMMIS component of the project. However, Defense directives require programs which consist of a number of component systems to be reviewed by MAISRC and approved by MDA as a single project. Without these reviews and approvals, DOD has less assurance that the decision to select DMSS was consistent with sound business practices.

The Deputy Secretary understood that DOD would have to improve the way it does business to achieve dramatic cost reductions and productivity increases and that it could not merely standardize old, inefficient processes and systems. Simply stated, doing the same thing faster will not provide dramatic improvement.", "Though reengineering efforts in DOD have been limited in scope and represent a small portion of operations, significant improvements have been achieved through reengineering specific logistics business areas. For example, in 1980, the Defense Construction Supply Center established a contractor-operated parts depot program that reduced order and delivery time from 70 to 35 days\u2014a 50-percent reduction.", "In addition, the private sector, which also has major industrial centers that use similar maintenance and repair supplies for regularly scheduled maintenance of equipment, has undergone successful reengineering efforts when faced with increasing costs associated with acquiring supplies, spare parts, and raw materials. For example, since 1986, through customized agreements with suppliers and the use of new inventory management practices, an Ohio steel firm, Timken Company, reduced maintenance and repair inventories by $4 million (32 percent). The company also eliminated six inventory storerooms, improved inventory availability, and increased the accuracy of physical inventories.", "We have also reported that by adopting certain commercial practices, Defense could similarly dramatically improve depot maintenance. In 1993, for example, we found that a number of private firms provide third-party logistics transportation services, such as freight bill processing, pre-auditing, verifying, and generating management reports with freight payment. Two of these firms proposed to perform transportation services for DOD at a cost ranging to $.75 to $1.25 per government bill of lading. DOD spends about $5.70 per freight bill to provide these same services.

Currently, DMSS deployment is expected to be completed by fiscal year 1999. Accordingly, fundamental and dramatic changes to the depot maintenance processes will be delayed for years.", "According to DOD officials, the vast number of different logistics processes and supporting information systems across the Department must be reduced before significant improvements can be made.

This foundation will eliminate the need to implement major changes across a multitude of information systems and business processes that exist throughout the services.", "Additionally, JLSC officials emphasized that improvements are being made to depot maintenance processes as DMSS is being deployed. According to these officials, benefits being achieved from these improvements include (1) cost reductions of $7 million in shop floor material recovered at the Air Logistics Center in Ogden, Utah, and a $8 million reduction in purchase of hazardous material at Hill Air Force Base and (2) performance increases from a 30-percent reduction in labor hours for overhauls of the Los Angeles class submarine, and two additional B-1 bombers processed through the Oklahoma City Air Logistics Center.", "While these examples show that incremental improvements are being made, JLSC estimated that, overall, the DMSS project would reduce depot operational costs by $2.6 billion over a 10-year period ending in fiscal year 2003 from $112.9 billion to $110.3 billion over this period\u2014a net cost reduction of about 2.3 percent.", "We believe that standardizing existing information systems and incrementally improving business processes will not position DOD for reengineering its processes or dramatically improve their operations.

Information system initiatives that do not first reengineer business processes typically fail or attain only a fraction of their potential.

They spend billions of dollars to automate existing processes so they can perform the same work faster. Companies that initially focused on information technology managed only to entrench inefficient processes and made future change to these processes more difficult. ...Defense has focused on trying to pick the best of its hundreds of existing automated systems and standardizing their use across the military components without thoroughly analyzing the technical, cost, and performance risks of this approach.

To identify expected DMSS costs and benefits, we analyzed available functional economic analyses (FEA). We did not validate the costs and benefits presented in the FEA used to justify DMSS since (1) our objective was to examine DOD\u2019s decision given the cost and benefit information available to it at the time and (2) the FEA was based on a different project\u2014the DMRP. We interviewed JLSC officials to determine changes made to project scope, costs, or benefits occurring since early 1994 and any additional analyses currently being done. We also met with numerous program and functional officials, including JLSC managers responsible for implementing the eight DMSS system components, and depot officials at the Air Force\u2019s repair depot in Ogden, Utah, and the Army\u2019s depot in Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania.", "To determine whether the Department had fully assessed economic and technical risks threatening the successful implementation of DMSS and identified actions to avoid or mitigate these risks, we reviewed risk assessments available when DUSD(L) decided to develop and deploy DMSS. Additionally, we examined risk analyses conducted by the Joint Logistics Systems Center, other Defense organizations, and industry experts completed since the DMSS selection was made. We interviewed program and technical officials to obtain opinions on the potential impact of risks identified by these analyses on project success and to identify actions for avoiding or mitigating those risks most likely to result in project failure, delay, and overspending.", "To determine whether the Department selected a strategy that would dramatically improve depot maintenance processes, we reviewed DOD documents detailing challenges of meeting the defense mission in the post-cold war environment, CIM goals and objectives to meet these challenges, and the plans and strategies for implementing CIM across the Department. We compared these DOD strategies and plans to the Logistics Migration Approach established to implement the CIM initiative in the logistics business area. We then compared the level of improvement expected from a standard depot maintenance information system to the DOD stated requirement to meet the challenges of the future defense environment. To identify alternatives to information system approaches, we reviewed private industry studies and past GAO reports of lessons learned by private and public organizations that have successfully improved their business processes. We compared these lessons learned and case studies with the approach being implemented through the development and deployment of DMSS.", "Our work was performed between April 1994 and March 1995 primarily at the offices of the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics in the Pentagon, Washington D.C., and the Joint Logistics Systems Center, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Ohio. We also performed work at the offices of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence in Washington D.C.; the Center for Integration & Interoperability, Defense Information Systems Agency, Blacklick, Ohio; the Air Force Air Logistics Center, Hill Air Force Base, Utah; and the Tobyhanna Army Depot, Tobyhanna, Pennsylvania."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the Department of Defense\u2019s letter dated May 30, 1995."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Comments", "paragraphs": ["1. The March 1993 Phase I Functional Economic Analysis (FEA) and January 1994 Phase II FEA for the DMRP processes did not provide well-supported estimates of project costs, benefits, and risks upon which to approve the Depot Maintenance Standard System (DMSS). As stated in our report, there are three reasons why these FEAs did not sufficiently support the DMSS selection.", "First, these FEAs did not include cost and benefit estimates for the DMSS. The DMSS was not defined as a project until March 1994\u2014more than a year after the Phase I FEA was completed and 2 months after the Phase II FEA was submitted for review. The Commander of Joint Logistics Systems Center told the DOD Comptroller that the functional economic analysis briefed to DUSD(L) and submitted for the Comptroller\u2019s review in early 1994 did not include DMSS. The Commander also stated that JLSC was developing a new economic analysis to (1) accommodate changes requested by the Comptroller and the Office of Program Analysis and Evaluation and (2) reflect the current DMSS.", "Secondly, the analyses contained estimates of questionable accuracy. The Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Program Analysis and Evaluation, which is required to validate automated information system project estimates to help ensure that the economic analyses present compelling quantitative data for project selection, found that the level of detail was insufficient to validate either cost or benefit estimates. Even with this limitation, we determined that the Phase II FEA underestimated the cost to develop and deploy the three system components that later became part of DMSS by at least $100 million.", "Information system options and opportunities that support the functional management strategy and process improvement efforts are evaluated based on technical feasibility, cost, schedule, performance, risk, and conformance to architectural guidelines and standards. Information system development/modernization must comply with life cycle management policy...The SDP  will be part of the approval decision package supporting the designation of the AIS  as a migration system by the OSD Principal Staff Assistant.

Under these procedures, a project should be reviewed and approved at each of five decision milestones before substantial funds are obligated. Despite this policy, DUSD(L) spent over $200 million to implement the DMSS initiative without receiving approval for even the initial milestone decision point.", "Also, DUSD(L)\u2019s claim that the MAISRC did review the DMSS initiative on March 16, 1993, is not accurate. On this date the MAISRC completed an In-Process Review (IPR) of the overall Logistics CIM strategy. An IPR is defined as \u201cAn LCM review between LCM milestones to determine the current program status, progress since the last LCM review, program risks and risk-reduction measures, and potential program problems.\u201d Further, as admitted by DUSD(L), the DMSS initiative was not approved until early 1994\u2014more than a year after this review.", "For the purpose of determining whether an AIS is major, the separate AISs that constitute a multi-element program, or that make up an evolutionary or incremental development program, or make up a multi-component AIS program, shall be aggregated and considered a single AIS.", "Based on these directives, DUSD(L) is required to obtain MAISRC review and approval for the entire DMSS initiative at each of five milestone decision points before any additional funds are spent. 3. DUSD(L) officials contend that reengineering of depot maintenance processes is occurring concurrently with the deployment of the DMSS. Further, they assert that these reengineering efforts will provide dramatic economic benefits, and cite cost savings and productivity increases accrued from initial implementation of four DMSS system components as support. DUSD(L)\u2019s approach focuses on the selection of the best currently operating information systems and implementation of these selected system across all Defense components. While this approach may improve overall DOD business processes and may provide incremental benefits, it is not the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of depot maintenance processes and will not provide the dramatic cost reductions and productivity gains available from process reengineering. At best, it will allow DOD to accomplish current depot maintenance processes faster and more efficiently. At worst, DUSD(L)\u2019s focus on information system selection and implementation will make future reengineering efforts more difficult by entrenching current work processes.", "In January 1991, the Deputy Secretary of Defense endorsed a Corporate Information Management initiative implementation plan that directed business processes be reengineered before information systems are standardized. However, DUSD(L) did not consider reengineering opportunities as alternatives to the DMSS initiative. As discussed in the report, the functional economic analysis used by DUSD(L) to approve the DMSS initiative compared only three alternatives. All three of these alternatives focused on using automated information systems to improve current depot maintenance functions.", "Further, as stated in DMSS documentation, the initiative is designed to provide only incremental improvements to existing business processes. It is clear from Defense\u2019s own benefit projections that DMSS will not result in dramatic improvements possible from consideration of reengineering-based solutions. DUSD(L) projected DMSS would reduce the costs to DOD depot maintenance operational costs over a 10-year period from $112.9 billion to $110.3 billion. A cost reduction of $2.6 billion or only 2.3 percent over this period does not constitute a dramatic increase in efficiency.", "In late 1994, the Office of the Secretary of Defense for Command, Control, Communications, and Intelligence, responsible for CIM initiatives across DOD, found major flaws in the overall implementation. It concluded that, as opposed to the private sector which uses a very different approach, \u201cDOD has virtually no chance of making high impact/quantum changes using the current approach.\u201d Further, the Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces, charged by the Congress to provide an independent review of the roles and missions of the armed services, has found that \u201cather than reengineering its processes, DOD has spent its energies in closing excess capacity (base and facilities) and in standardizing its management information systems\u201d and concluded that DOD will achieve a more compact, more standardized version of its traditional logistics approach.The Commission confirmed that DOD must radically reengineer its logistics processes to achieve meaningful improvements. 4. While information technology is critical to any reengineering effort because it provides a tool for breaking old rules and creating new ways of working, it should not be the driver of the reengineering effort. Such an approach may make future reengineering efforts more difficult by entrenching inefficient and ineffective work processes. Reengineering offers order-of-magnitude improvement compared to the incremental improvements DMSS is designed to provide. DUSD(L) can not afford to deploy DMSS departmentwide beyond the first five prototype sites until it has first determined which old rules need to be broken and what new ways of accomplishing depot maintenance are most efficient and effective. The Commission on Roles and Missions of the Armed Forces has identified a number of alternatives for changing the way DOD conducts its depot maintenance. These alternatives could serve as a starting point for a thorough study by DUSD(L) of its reengineering opportunities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Description of DMSS Component Systems", "paragraphs": ["This appendix provides brief descriptions of the eight information systems selected as Depot Maintenance Standard System components to support the DOD-wide depot maintenance function.", "Baseline Advanced Industrial Management System: Supports allocation decisions on resource application, schedules, and job management of maintenance projects.
