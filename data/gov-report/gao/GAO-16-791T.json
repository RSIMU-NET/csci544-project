In May 2012, GAO reported that various factors influence whether CI owners and operators participate in voluntary assessments that DHS uses to identify security gaps and potential vulnerabilities, but that DHS did not systematically collect data on reasons why some owners and operators of high-priority CI declined to participate. GAO concluded that collecting data on the reason for declinations could help DHS take steps to enhance the overall security and resilience of high-priority CI crucial to national security, public health and safety, and the economy, and made a recommendation to that effect. DHS concurred and has taken steps to address the recommendation, including developing a tracking system in October 2013 to capture declinations.", "Establishing guidance for areas of vulnerability covered by assessments. In September 2014, GAO reported that the vulnerability assessment tools and methods DHS offices and components use vary with respect to the areas of vulnerability\u2014such as perimeter security\u2014assessed depending on which DHS office or component conducts or requires the assessment. As a result it was not clear what areas DHS believes should be included in its assessments. GAO recommended that DHS review its vulnerability assessments to identify the most important areas of vulnerability to be assessed, and establish guidance, among other things.

For example, in 2013, the President issued Presidential Policy  Directive/PPD-21: Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience to  increase the overall security and resilience of U.S. critical infrastructure.  In addition, in 2013, DHS issued an update to its National Infrastructure  Protection Plan (NIPP), which provides the overarching approach for  integrating the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure security and resilience  activities into a single national effort. A fundamental component of DHS\u2019s  efforts to protect and secure our nation\u2019s infrastructure is its reliance on  voluntary collaboration between private sector owners and operators of  critical infrastructure and their government counterparts. The NIPP  outlines the roles and responsibilities of DHS with regard to critical  infrastructure protection and resilience and sector-specific agencies  (SSA)\u2014federal departments and agencies responsible for critical  infrastructure protection and resilience activities in 16 critical  infrastructure sectors.

Specifically, DHS officials representing the National Protection and  Programs Directorate (NPPD), Transportation Security Administration  (TSA), and the Coast Guard conducted more than 5,300 assessments  using six different voluntary assessment tools and methods covering  various types of assets and systems. During the same time period, as  many as 7,600 asset owners and operators were required to perform self- assessments to comply with Coast Guard requirements pursuant to  Maritime Transportation Security Act (MTSA) and NPPD\u2019s Infrastructure  Security Compliance Division (ISCD) requirements pursuant to Chemical  Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (CFATS).", "My testimony today describes (1) progress made by DHS in addressing  barriers to conducting voluntary assessments and sharing information,  and (2) the extent to which DHS provided guidance for DHS\u2019s CI  vulnerability assessment activities and to address potential duplication  and gaps in assessment efforts.

To perform the work for our  previous reports, among other things, we reviewed applicable laws,  regulations, and directives as well as policies and procedures for selected  programs to protect critical infrastructure. We interviewed DHS officials  responsible for administering these programs and obtained and assessed  data on the conduct and management of DHS\u2019s security-related  programs.

According to  the Homeland Security Act of 2002, as amended, DHS is to, among other  things, carry out comprehensive vulnerability assessments of CI; integrate  relevant information, analyses, and assessments from within DHS and  from CI partners; and use the information collected to identify priorities for  protective and support measures. Assessments include areas that can be  assessed for vulnerability (hereinafter referred to as \u201careas\u201d), such as  perimeter security, the presence of a security force, or vulnerabilities to  intentional acts, including acts of terrorism. Presidential Policy  Directive/PPD-21 directs DHS to, among other things, provide strategic  guidance, promote a national unity of effort, and coordinate the overall  federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the nation\u2019s CI.  Related to PPD-21, the NIPP calls for the CI community and associated  stakeholders to carry out an integrated approach to (1) identify, deter,  detect, disrupt, and prepare for threats and hazards (all hazards); (2)  reduce vulnerabilities of critical assets, systems, and networks; and (3)  mitigate the potential consequence to CI to incidents or events that do  occur. According to the NIPP, CI partners are to identify risk in a  coordinated and comprehensive manner across the CI community;  minimize duplication; consider interdependencies; and, as appropriate,  share information within the CI community.", "Within DHS, NPPD is responsible for working with public and industry  infrastructure partners and leads the coordinated national effort to  mitigate risk to the nation\u2019s infrastructure through the development and  implementation of the infrastructure security program. NPPD\u2019s Office of  Infrastructure Protection (IP) has overall responsibility for coordinating  implementation of the NIPP across the 16 CI sectors, including providing  guidance to SSAs and CI owners and operators on protective measures  to assist in enhancing the security of infrastructure and helping CI sector  partners develop the capabilities to mitigate vulnerabilities and identifiable  risks to the assets. The NIPP also designates other federal agencies, as  well as some offices and components within DHS, as SSAs that are  responsible for, among other things, coordinating with DHS and other  federal departments and agencies and CI owners and operators to  identify vulnerabilities, and to help mitigate incidents, as appropriate. DHS  offices and components or asset owners and operators have used  various assessment tools and methods, some of which are voluntary,  while others are required by law or regulation, to gather information about  certain aspects of CI. For example, Protective Security Coordination  Division (PSCD), within NPPD, relies on Protective Security Advisors  (PSA) to offer and conduct voluntary vulnerability assessments to  owners and operators of CI to help identify potential security actions;  Infrastructure Security Compliance Division, within NPPD, requires  regulated chemical facilities to complete a security vulnerability  assessment pursuant to CFATS;TSA conducts various assessments of  airports, pipelines, and rail and transit systems; and Coast Guard  requires facilities it regulates under the Maritime Transportation Security  Act of 2002 (MTSA) to complete assessments as part of their security  planning process. In addition, SSAs external to DHS also offer  vulnerability assessment tools and methods to owners or operators of CI  and these assessments include areas such as resilience management or  perimeter security. For example, the Environmental Protection Agency,  the SSA for the water sector, provides a self-assessment tool for the  conduct of voluntary security-related assessments at water and  wastewater facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Made Addressing Barriers to Conducting Voluntary Assessments and Sharing Information", "paragraphs": ["DHS\u2019s took steps to address barriers to conducting critical infrastructure  vulnerability assessments and sharing information, in response to findings  from our previous work. Specifically, DHS has made progress in the  following areas:  Determining why some industry partners do not participate in  voluntary assessments. DHS supports the development of the national  risk picture by conducting vulnerability assessments and security surveys  to identify security gaps and potential vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s high- priority critical infrastructure. In a May 2012 report, we assessed the  extent to which DHS had taken action to conduct security surveys using  its Infrastructure Survey Tool (IST) and vulnerability assessments among  high-priority infrastructure, shared the results of these surveys and  assessments with asset owners or operators, and assessed their  effectiveness.", "We found that various factors influence whether industry owners and  operators of assets participate in these voluntary programs, but that DHS  did not systematically collect data on reasons why some owners and  operators of high-priority assets declined to participate in security surveys  or vulnerability assessments. We concluded that collecting data on the  reason for declinations could help DHS take steps to enhance the overall  protection and resilience of those high-priority critical infrastructure assets  crucial to national security, public health and safety, and the economy.  We recommended, and DHS concurred, that DHS design and implement  a mechanism for systematically assessing why owners and operators of  high-priority assets decline to participate.", "In response to our recommendations, in October 2013 DHS developed  and implemented a tracking system to capture and account for  declinations. In addition, in August 2014 DHS established a policy to  conduct quarterly reviews to, among other things, track these and other  survey and assessment programs and identify gaps and requirements for  priorities and help DHS better understand what barriers owners and  operators of critical infrastructure face in making improvements to the  security of their assets.", "Sharing of assessment results at the asset level in a timely manner.  DHS security surveys and vulnerability assessments can provide valuable  insights into the strengths and weaknesses of assets and can help asset  owners and operators that participate in these programs make decisions  about investments to enhance security and resilience. In our May 2012  report, we found that, among other things, DHS shared the results of  security surveys and vulnerability assessments with asset owners or  operators. However, we also found that the usefulness of security  survey and vulnerability assessment results could be enhanced by the  timely delivery of these products to the owners and operators. We  reported that the inability to deliver these products in a timely manner  could undermine the relationship DHS was attempting to develop with  these industry partners. Specifically, we reported that, based on DHS  data from fiscal year 2011, DHS was late meeting the 30-day time frame  for delivering the results of its security surveys required by DHS guidance  60 percent of the time. DHS officials acknowledged the late delivery of  survey and assessment results and said they were working to improve  processes and protocols. However, DHS had not established a plan with  time frames and milestones for managing this effort. We recommended,  and DHS concurred, that it develop time frames and specific milestones  for managing its efforts to ensure the timely delivery of the results of  security surveys and vulnerability assessments to asset owners and  operators. In response to our recommendation, DHS established  timeframes and milestones to ensure the timely delivery of assessment  results of the surveys and assessments to CI owners and operators. In  addition, in February 2013, DHS transitioned to a web-based delivery  system, which, according to DHS, has since resulted in a significant drop  in overdue deliveries.", "Sharing certain information with critical infrastructure partners at  the regional level. Our work has shown that over the past several years,  DHS has recognized the importance of and taken actions to examine  critical infrastructure asset vulnerabilities, threats, and potential  consequences across regions. In a July 2013 report, we examined DHS\u2019s  management of its Regional Resiliency Assessment Program (RRAP)\u2014a  voluntary program intended to assess regional resilience of critical  infrastructure by analyzing a region\u2019s ability to adapt to changing  conditions, and prepare for, withstand, and rapidly recover from  disruptions\u2014and found that DHS has been working with states to improve  the process for conducting RRAP projects, including more clearly defining  the scope of these projects. We also reported that DHS shares the  project results of each RRAP project report, including vulnerabilities  identified, with the primary stakeholders\u2014officials representing the state  where the RRAP was conducted\u2014and that each report is generally  available to SSAs and protective security advisors within DHS.", "Sharing information with sector-specific agencies and state and  local governments. Federal SSAs and state and local governments are  key partners that can provide specific expertise and perspectives in  federal efforts to identify and protect critical infrastructure. In a March  2013 report, we reviewed DHS\u2019s management of the National Critical  Infrastructure Prioritization Program (NCIPP), and how DHS worked with  states and SSAs to develop the high-priority CI list. The program  identifies a list of nationally significant critical infrastructure each year that  is used to, among other things, prioritize voluntary vulnerability  assessments conducted by PSAs on high-priority critical infrastructure.  We reported that DHS had taken actions to improve its outreach to SSAs  and states in an effort to address challenges associated with providing  input on nominations and changes to the NCIPP list. However, we also  found that most state officials we contacted continued to experience  challenges with nominating assets to the NCIPP list using the  consequence-based criteria developed by DHS. Among other actions, we  recommended that DHS commission an independent, external peer  review of the NCIPP with clear project objectives. In November 2013,  DHS commissioned a panel that reviewed the NCIPP process, guidance  documentation, and process phases to provide an evaluation of the  extent to which the process is comprehensive, reproducible, and  defensible. The panel made 24 observations about the NCIPP; however,  panel members expressed different views regarding the classification of  the NCIPP list, and views on whether private sector owners of the assets,  systems, and clusters should be notified of inclusion on the list. As of  August 2014, DHS officials reported that they are exploring options to  streamline the process and limit the delay of dissemination among those  who have a need-to-know."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Guidance and Coordination to Address Potential Duplication and Gaps Needed for CI Vulnerability Assessment Activities", "paragraphs": ["Our previous work identified a need for DHS vulnerability assessment  guidance and coordination. Specifically, we found:  Establishing guidance for areas of vulnerability covered by  assessments. In a September 2014 report examining, among other  things, the extent to which DHS is positioned to integrate vulnerability  assessments to identify priorities, we found that the vulnerability  assessment tools and methods DHS offices and components use vary  with respect to the areas assessed depending on which DHS office or  component conducts or requires the assessment. As a result, it was not  clear what areas DHS believes should be included in a comprehensive  vulnerability assessment. Moreover, we found that DHS had not issued  guidance to ensure that the areas it deems most important are captured  in assessments conducted or required by its offices and components. Our  analysis of 10 vulnerability assessment tools and methods showed that  DHS vulnerability assessments consistently included some areas that  were assessed for vulnerability but included other areas that were not  consistently assessed. Our analysis showed that all 10 of the DHS  assessment tools and methods we analyzed included areas such as  \u201cvulnerabilities from intentional acts\u201d\u2014such as terrorism\u2014and \u201cperimeter  security\u201d in the assessment. However, 8 of the 10 assessment tools and  methods did not include areas such as \u201cvulnerabilities to all hazards\u201d such  as hurricanes or earthquakes while the other 2 did. These differences in  areas assessed among the various assessment tools and methods could  complicate or hinder DHS\u2019s ability to integrate relevant assessments in  order to identify priorities for protective and support measures.", "We found that the assessments conducted or required by DHS offices  and components also varied greatly in their length and the detail of  information to be collected. For example, within NPPD, PSCD used its  IST to assess high-priority facilities that voluntarily participate and this tool  was used across the spectrum of CI sectors. The IST, which contains  more than 100 questions and 1,500 variables, is used to gather  information on the security posture of CI, and the results of the IST can  inform owners and operators of potential vulnerabilities facing their asset  or system. In another example from NPPD, ISCD required owners and  operators of facilities that possess, store, or manufacture certain  chemicals under CFATS to provide data on their facilities using an online  tool so that ISCD can assess the risk posed by covered facilities. This  tool, ISCD\u2019s Chemical Security Assessment Tool Security Vulnerability  Assessment contained more than 100 questions based on how owners  respond to an initial set of questions. Within DHS, TSA\u2019s Office of  Security Operations offered or conducted a number of assessments, such  as a 205-question assessment of transit systems called the Baseline  Assessment for Security Enhancements that contained areas to be  assessed for vulnerability, and TSA\u2019s 17-question Freight Rail Risk  Analysis Tool was used to assess rail bridges.", "In addition to differences in what areas were included, there were also  differences in the detail of information collected for individual areas,  making it difficult to determine the extent to which the information  collected was comparable and what assumptions and/or judgments were  used while gathering assessment data. We also observed that  components used different questions for the same areas assessed.  These variations, among others we identified, could impede DHS\u2019s ability  to integrate relevant information and use it to identify priorities for  protective and support measures regarding terrorist and other threats to  homeland security. For example, we found that while some components  asked open-ended questions such as \u201cdescribe security personnel,\u201d  others included drop-down menus or lists of responses to be selected.", "We recommended that DHS review its vulnerability assessments to  identify the most important areas to be assessed, and determine the  areas and level of detail that are necessary to integrate assessments and  enable comparisons, and establish guidance, among other things. DHS  agreed with our recommendation, and established a working group in  August 2015 to address this recommendation and others we made. As of  March 2016 these efforts are ongoing and DHS intends to provide an  update in the summer of 2016.", "Establishing guidance on common data standards to help reduce  assessment fatigue and improve information sharing. As we reported  in September 2014, federal assessment fatigue could impede DHS\u2019s  ability to garner the participation of CI owners and operators in its  voluntary assessment activities. During our review of vulnerability  assessments, the Coast Guard, PSCD, and TSA field personnel we  contacted reported observing what they called federal fatigue, or a  perceived weariness among CI owners and operators who had been  repeatedly approached or required by multiple federal agencies and DHS  offices and components to participate in or complete assessments. One  official who handles security issues for an association representing  owners and operators of CI expressed concerns at the time about his  members\u2019 level of fatigue. Specifically, he shared observations that DHS  offices and components do not appear to effectively coordinate with one  another on assessment-related activities to share or use information and  data that have already been gathered by one of them. The official also  noted that, from the association\u2019s perspective, the requests and  invitations to participate in assessments have exceeded what is  necessary to develop relevant and useful information, and information is  being collected in a way that is not the best use of the owners\u2019 and  operators\u2019 time. As figure 1 illustrates, depending on a given asset or  facility\u2019s operations, infrastructure, and location, an owner or operator  could be asked or required to participate in multiple separate vulnerability  assessments.", "DHS officials expressed concern at the time that this \u201cfatigue\u201d may  diminish future cooperation from asset owners and operators. We  recommended in September 2014 that DHS develop an approach for  consistently collecting and maintaining data from assessments conducted  across DHS to facilitate the identification of potential duplication and gaps  in coverage. Having common data standards would better position DHS  offices and components to minimize the aforementioned fatigue, and the  resulting declines in CI owner and operator participation, by making it  easier for DHS offices and components to use each other\u2019s data to  determine what CI assets or facilities may have been already visited or  assessed by another office or component. They could then plan their  assessment efforts and outreach accordingly to minimize the potential for  making multiple visits to the same assets or facilities. DHS agreed with  our recommendation, and as of March 2016 DHS had established a  working group to address the recommendations from our report and  planned to provide us with a status update in the summer of 2016.", "Addressing the potential for duplication, overlap, or gaps between  and among the various efforts. As with the sharing of common  assessment data, we found in our 2014 review of vulnerability  assessments that DHS also lacks a department-wide process to facilitate  coordination among the various offices and components that conduct  vulnerability assessments or require assessments on the part of owners  and operators. This could hinder the ability to identify gaps or potential  duplication in DHS assessments. For example, among 10 different types  of DHS vulnerability assessments we compared, we found that DHS  assessment activities were overlapping across some of the sectors, but  not others. Given the overlap of DHS\u2019s assessments among many of the  16 sectors, we attempted to compare data to determine whether DHS had  conducted or required vulnerability assessments at the same critical  infrastructure within those sectors. However, we were unable to conduct  this comparison because of differences in the way data about these  activities were captured and maintained. Officials representing DHS  acknowledged at the time they encountered challenges with the  consistency of assessment data and stated that DHS-wide interoperability  standards did not exist for them to follow in recording their assessment  activities that would facilitate consistency and enable comparisons among  the different data sets.", "The NIPP calls for standardized processes to promote integration and  coordination of information sharing through, among other things, jointly  developed standard operating procedures. However, DHS officials stated  at the time that they generally relied on field-based personnel to inform  their counterparts at other offices and components about planned  assessment activities and share information as needed on what assets  may have already been assessed. For example, PSAs may inform and  invite CI partners to participate in these assessments, if the owner and  operator of the asset agrees. PSAs may also alert their DHS counterparts  depending on assets covered and their areas of responsibility. However,  we found that absent these field-based coordination or sharing activities,  it was unclear whether all facilities in a particular geographic area or  sector were covered. For example, after CFATS took effect, in 2007,  ISCD officials asked PSCD to stop having PSAs conduct voluntary  assessments at CFATS-regulated chemical facilities to reduce potential  confusion about DHS authority over chemical facility security and to avoid  overlapping assessments. In response, PSCD reduced the number of  voluntary vulnerability assessments conducted in the chemical sector.  However, one former ISCD official noted that without direct and  continuous coordination between PSCD and ISCD on what facilities are  being assessed or regulated by each division, this could create a gap in  assessment coverage between CFATS-regulated facilities and facilities  that could have participated in PSCD assessments given that the number  of CFATS-regulated facilities can fluctuate over time.", "Without processes for DHS offices and components to share data and  coordinate with each other in their CI vulnerability assessment activities,  DHS cannot provide reasonable assurance that it can identify potential  duplication, overlap, or gaps in coverage that could ultimately affect  DHS\u2019s ability to work with its partners to enhance national CI security and  resilience, consistent with the NIPP. We recommended in September  2014 that DHS develop an approach to ensure that vulnerability data  gathered on CI be consistently collected and maintained across DHS to  facilitate the identification of potential duplication and gaps in CI  coverage. As of March 2016, DHS has begun a process of identifying the  appropriate level of guidance to eliminate gaps or duplication in methods  and to coordinate vulnerability assessments throughout the department.", "We also recommended that DHS identify key CI security-related  assessment tools and methods used or offered by SSAs and other  federal agencies, analyze them to determine the areas of vulnerability  they capture, and develop and provide guidance for what areas should be  included in vulnerability assessments of CI that can be used by DHS and  other CI partners in an integrated and coordinated manner. DHS  concurred with our recommendations and stated that it planned to take a  variety of actions to address the issues we identified, including conducting  an inventory survey of the security-related assessment tools and methods  used by SSAs to address CI vulnerabilities. As of March 2016, DHS has  established a working group, consisting of members from multiple  departments and agencies, to enhance the integration and coordination of  vulnerability assessment efforts. These efforts are ongoing and we will  continue to monitor DHS\u2019s progress in implementing these  recommendations.", "In addition to efforts to address our recommendations, DHS is in the  process of reorganizing NPPD to ensure that it is appropriately positioned  to carry out its critical mission of cyber and infrastructure security. Key  priorities of this effort are to include greater unity of effort across the  organization and enhanced operational activity to leverage the expertise,  skills, information, and relationships throughout DHS. The NPPD  reorganization presents DHS with an opportunity to engage stakeholders  in decision-making and may achieve greater efficiency or effectiveness by  reducing programmatic duplication, overlap, and fragmentation. It also  presents DHS with an opportunity to mitigate potential duplication or gaps  by consistently capturing and maintaining data from overlapping  vulnerability assessments of CI and improving data sharing and  coordination among the offices and components involved with these  assessments.", "Chairman Ratcliffe, Ranking Member Richmond, and members of the  sub-committee, this completes my prepared statement.
