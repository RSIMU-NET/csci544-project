Further, officials stated that DOD did not include full-time equivalents (FTEs) for contracted services in the report as required because they were unable to provide an accurate number. In December 2015 GAO recommended that DOD include costs savings for civilian personnel in its reports, and DOD concurred.

Section 955 requires DOD to develop an efficiencies plan to reduce civilian personnel and costs for FYs 2012\u20142017, and for each FY through 2018 to submit a report that describes the implementation of the efficiencies plan. Furthermore, section 955 allows for DOD to grant civilian and contractor workforce exclusions from section 955 required reductions for areas identified as critical. For example, DOD reported that it excluded about 538,000 of 776,000 civilian FTEs. However, its reports do not provide a description indicating why these exclusions were chosen. In December 2015 GAO recommended that DOD include a comprehensive description of the efficiencies plan to achieve savings, and DOD concurred.

DOD excluded approximately 71.6 percent, or about 530,000,  of its civilian workforce from the reductions required by statute in fiscal  year 2017. These exclusions include workforces in the areas of  acquisition, cyber, medical, and safety and security, among others.  Because DOD excluded segments of the civilian workforce that may not  cost the same as the average full-time equivalent position, its cost  estimation calculations may not reflect actual savings.

As mentioned above, DOD  did not include actual civilian workforce savings from fiscal years 2012  through 2015, and officials noted that even if DOD had included actual  civilian personnel cost savings, it would only be an estimation based on  their calculation. The officials said that DOD does not have the ability to  identify savings for the applicable workforce because of broader  limitations inherent in the department\u2019s accounting methodology. For  example, the officials stated that the exclusion categories are not part of  DOD\u2019s accounting structure and therefore DOD does not have the ability  to report specific positions excluded and their associated costs.

For example,  section 955 requires DOD to submit status reports each fiscal year  through 2018 that describe the implementation of the efficiencies plan to  reduce costs for the civilian and contracted service workforces, and states  that in the development and implementation of the efficiencies plan, DOD  may exclude certain civilian and contractor workforces from reporting  required reductions. DOD excluded approximately 538,000 civilian full- time equivalents of its approximately 776,000 civilian full-time equivalents  from required reductions for fiscal year 2012. While its report states that  the civilian workforce exclusions were selected because they are critical  to the mission of the department, it does not describe how this criticality  selection was determined, or whether DOD has assessed the need for  changing the workforces it excludes.", "In response to the recommendation in our December 2015 report to  include in its status reports the costs in civilian personnel and military  basic pay for fiscal years 2012 through 2017, DOD stated in its written  comments that it included in its February 2016 status report the number  and cost of military and civilian personnel reduced. As we discuss in our  report, DOD partially implemented the recommendation in its 2016 status  report and included the actual and estimated numbers of military and  civilian full-time equivalent reductions, and the costs associated with the  workforces in FY 2012 and FY 2017. However, DOD did not include the  costs associated with the workforces for each fiscal year in between, as  we recommended. Therefore, DOD has not yet fully implemented the  recommendation.", "In response to the recommendation in our December 2015 report to  provide an explanation for any shortfall in its reduction for the civilian and  contracted services workforces, as well as a description of actions DOD is  taking to achieve the required savings, DOD stated in its written  comments it has met its civilian personnel cost reduction requirement,  and thus no explanation of any shortfall was required. In its February  2016 report DOD partially implemented our recommendation by providing  an explanation for estimated shortfalls for contracted services. In addition,  as we state in our report, DOD is estimating that it is on track to meet its  civilian personnel cost savings requirement in fiscal year 2017 and thus  did not need to include a description of any shortfalls. However, our  recommendation also was to include a description of the specific actions  DOD is taking to achieve the required savings.  DOD did not include such  a description in its February 2016 report and therefore DOD has not yet  fully implemented our recommendation.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller); and the Under Secretary of Defense (Personnel and  Readiness).

We then assessed  DOD\u2019s February 2016 status report to determine what savings information  were included in its report for the civilian and contracted services  workforces. We compared savings information included against  information requirements in section 955. We also compared DOD\u2019s actual  and projected fiscal years 2012 through 2017 reductions in military basic  pay against information included in DOD\u2019s February 2016 status report on  (1) DOD\u2019s actual and projected civilian workforce cost and full-time  equivalent reductions from fiscal years 2012 through 2017; and (2) DOD\u2019s  actual and projected contracted services cost reductions from fiscal years  2012 through 2017. We also assessed the methodology for how DOD  calculated its actual and estimated civilian workforce savings to determine  whether DOD\u2019s calculations accounted for exclusions to its workforce  reductions requirements. We reviewed our December 2015 report that  used workforce data and discussed the reliability of the data with OUSD  (Comptroller) officials. We determined that these data were sufficiently  reliable for the purpose of reporting on and analyzing reductions to the  civilian workforces.", "To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s February 2016 report  demonstrates DOD\u2019s development and implementation of its efficiencies  plan that is consistent with workforce management laws in fiscal year  2015, as required by section 955 of the Fiscal Year 2013 NDAA, we  reviewed section 955 of the Fiscal Year 2013 NDAA to identify  requirements for DOD\u2019s report. We reviewed and analyzed DOD\u2019s  February 2016 status report to determine how, if at all, it demonstrated  the implementation of an efficiencies plan. We interviewed officials from  the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to determine the types  of guidance they received from OSD, if any, and the extent to which they  established their own guidance on developing and implementing DOD\u2019s  plan required by section 955. We also reviewed DOD\u2019s February 2016  status report to determine whether DOD excluded workforces from the  civilian and contractor workforce reduction requirement. We interviewed  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) officials and  officials from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to gain  an understanding of how these workforces were excluded, the basis for  such exclusions, and when the exclusions were identified. We spoke with  officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller)  and officials from the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force  regarding what guidance was provided for the exclusions and how the  process took place in order to determine the exclusions. Further, we  requested documentation on the process that took place in order to  determine such exclusions. To determine the extent to which DOD\u2019s  February 2016 report demonstrates that its reductions are consistent with  workforce management laws as required by section 955 we reviewed  DOD\u2019s February 2016 status report and materials listed in the report and  interviewed officials at OUSD. We determined that the level of detail  included in DOD\u2019s February 2016 report were not sufficient to conclude  whether or not DOD was in compliance with workforce management laws.  For both objectives, we identified actions taken, if any, in response to our  2015 report.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2016 to October  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
