(See textbox below.) Buyers  and sellers in international transactions face unique risks, such as foreign  exchange risk, difficulties in settling disputes when damages to shipments  occur, or instability in the buyer\u2019s country. For these reasons, lenders may  be reluctant to finance a buyer\u2019s purchase of foreign goods. Export credit  products are meant to facilitate international transactions by mitigating  these risks.

EDC takes the following steps under the Canadian  Benefits model:  1.  Calculate economic benefits. The economic benefits are based on the amount of gross domestic product (GDP) in the exports it  finances by determining the amount of Canadian content in the export. The Canadian content is provided by Statistics  Canada\u2019s Input/Output Model, which tracks the production chain of Canadian industries, and identifies and measures inputs  and outputs.  2.

We also reviewed ECAs\u2019 websites  for additional information regarding product offerings. We interviewed  officials from each of the G-7 ECAs and government organizations that  have oversight over the ECAs. These organizations included Ex-Im in the  United States; Export Development Canada (EDC), Department of  Foreign Affairs and International Trade and Department of Finance in  Canada; Coface and the Ministry of Economy, Finance and Industry in  France; Euler Hermes, PricewaterhouseCoopers and the Interministerial  Council, represented by the Federal Ministry of Economics and  Technology, in Germany; Servizi Assicurativi del Commercio Estero  (SACE) and the Ministry of Economic Development in Italy; Japan Bank  for International Cooperation (JBIC) and Nippon Export and Investment  Insurance (NEXI) (via telephone) in Japan; and the Export Credits  Guarantee Department (ECGD) in the United Kingdom. We also  interviewed officials from the U.S. Departments of Treasury and State, as  well as the OECD and the Berne Union. In addition, we spoke with  several institutions that work in conjunction with official ECAs: Societa  Italiana per le Imprese all\u2019Estero (SIMEST) in Italy and KfW IPEX-Bank in  Germany.", "To assess how Ex-Im\u2019s policy requirements compared with those of the  other G-7 ECAs, we first examined Ex-Im\u2019s policy requirements by  reviewing Ex-Im annual reports; Ex-Im Competitiveness Reports; Ex-Im\u2019  2010-2015 Strategic Plan; GAO reports on Ex-Im\u2019s small business  mandate, environmentally beneficial mandate, and economic impact  analysis requirement; Congressional Research Service (CRS) reports;  testimony from congressional hearings; and academic articles. We also  interviewed Ex-Im officials to talk about the various policy requirements,  and we interviewed officials from the Small Business Administration  (SBA) to discuss Ex-Im\u2019s small business mandate. To examine the other  G-7 ECAs\u2019 policy requirements and how they compared with those of Ex- Im, we interviewed officials from the G-7 ECAs, as well as any  government organizations that play an oversight role for these ECAs. We  asked them directly whether they shared any of Ex-Im\u2019s policy  requirements, and more generally, whether they had other policy  requirements, such as requirements to focus on promoting certain types  of exports, export destinations, or exporters, and whether this resulted  from external directives or internal decisions. We also asked about the  nature of their relationships with oversight organizations and the extent to  which they received external policy guidance from these organizations or  their legislatures. In cases where ECA officials told us that there was  legislation that authorized or otherwise governed their activities, and there  were English versions available, we reviewed this legislation. We also  reviewed ECA annual reports. We sent follow-up questions to all of the  ECAs to confirm the information they had given us during interviews  regarding their policy requirements. We also provided ECAs the  opportunity to provide technical comments on portions of the report that  contain information pertaining to the ECA.", "To examine how Ex-Im\u2019s domestic content policy compares with those of  other G-7 ECAs, we first collected information on Ex-Im\u2019s policy from its  competitiveness reports and website. We reviewed testimony transcripts  from congressional hearings and literature on domestic content of exports  and global manufacturing production patterns. We also interviewed Ex-Im  officials responsible for administering the policy, as well as officials at the  Treasury Department and the Coalition for Employment through Exports,  an advocacy organization on matters affecting U.S. government export  finance. To obtain information on other G-7 ECAs\u2019 domestic content  policies, we reviewed their annual reports. We interviewed G-7 ECA  officials, who explained their policies and provided additional  documentation. We analyzed global manufacturing production trends  using OECD data on the foreign content of the United States\u2019 and other  countries\u2019 exports by sector, from the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s. To  assess the reliability of the OECD data, we reviewed the data  documentation, tested for internal consistency of the data, and compared  the trends with other sources. We found that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of presenting global manufacturing trends,  demonstrating country and sector variances. We collected data from Ex- Im on the percentage of foreign content in the exports it finances. Ex-Im  reports this data annually in its Competitiveness Report. We found that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of presenting the  amount of foreign versus domestic content in exports it finances.", "To analyze the role of the OECD Arrangement in governing ECA  activities, we reviewed the text of the OECD Arrangement as well as a  variety of OECD and other reports on the Arrangement, Export Credit  Group, and export credit activities. We interviewed OECD officials, as well  as G-7 ECA officials, to discuss the history and evolving role of the  Arrangement as well as current challenges. We conducted a literature  search and reviewed academic literature on the Arrangement and ECAs.  To obtain information on China\u2019s export credit activities, we met with U.S.  Treasury and State Department officials in Washington and Beijing and  interviewed experts, including academic experts at American University  and the Brookings Institution. We also discussed China\u2019s activities with G- 7 ECA and other officials. To obtain data on China\u2019s, India\u2019s, and Brazil\u2019s  ECA activities, we reviewed information from the International Monetary  Fund, ECA annual reports, and Ex-Im\u2019s 2010 Competitiveness Report.  We also used data published in the annual reports from China\u2019s and  India\u2019s Ex-Im Banks to compare the growth of export financing from China  and India to that of the U.S. Ex-Im Bank. We found the data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of comparing levels of growth.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 to February  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the U.S. Export- Import Bank", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the person named above, Jos\u00e9 Alfredo G\u00f3mez (Acting  Director), Celia Thomas (Assistant Director), Jennifer Young, Vaughn  Baltzly, Ming Chen, Laura Erion, and Arthur Lord made key contributions  to this report.
