For example, CMS's guidance incorrectly informs states that providers do not need to seek third-party payments before the state pays for some prenatal services. In addition, CMS has not determined the extent to which states are meeting third-party liability requirements. CMS officials stated that they expect states to comply with current law for Medicaid third-party liability and that they do not verify whether states have implemented the required third-party liability changes unless the agency is made aware of non-compliance. However, this approach is inconsistent with CMS's Medicaid oversight responsibilities, including its responsibility to ensure federal funds are appropriately spent.", "Medicaid experts and other stakeholders told GAO that the third-party liability changes could affect some health care providers in ways that could result in decreased beneficiary access to care, because some providers might be less willing to see Medicaid patients.

This formula provides for a match that is no lower  than 50 percent of a state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures and no higher than 83  percent. States can receive a 90 percent federal match for the costs  associated with the development of each state\u2019s Medicaid Management  Information System (MMIS), a claims processing and retrieval system  supporting the administration of the state\u2019s Medicaid program. States  also receive a 75 percent match for the costs associated with ongoing  MMIS maintenance and operations. States use their MMIS systems to  process provider claims, including claims for prenatal care services,  pediatric preventive services, and services provided to CSE beneficiaries.", "The Medicaid program is administered at the state level and overseen at  the federal level by CMS, which, among other things, ensures that funds  are used appropriately and beneficiaries have access to covered  services. Medicaid allows significant flexibility for states to design and  implement their programs. Within broad federal parameters, states have  discretion in, among other things, setting Medicaid eligibility standards  and provider payment rates; determining the amount, scope, and duration  of covered benefits; and developing their own administrative structures.", "States may also decide how Medicaid-covered services provided to  beneficiaries will be delivered. For example, states may pay health care  providers for each service they provide\u2014fee-for-service\u2014or contract with  MCOs to provide a specific set of Medicaid-covered services to  beneficiaries and pay them a set amount per beneficiary, typically per  month. While most states use both delivery systems, the percentage of  beneficiaries served through MCOs has grown in recent years, and  represented nearly 70 percent of all Medicaid beneficiaries in 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Third-Party Liability Requirements", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid beneficiaries across various eligibility categories may have  access to private health insurance or other sources of third-party  coverage. For example, some adult beneficiaries may be covered by  employer-sponsored private health insurance even though they also  qualify for Medicaid. Children, similarly, may be eligible for Medicaid,  while also being covered as a dependent on a parent\u2019s private health  plan. As such, federal law requires states to perform various activities to  ensure that Medicaid is the payer of last resort, including taking all  reasonable measures to identify Medicaid beneficiaries\u2019 other potential  sources of health coverage and their legal liability. Specifically, states  must ensure that the following steps, among others, are taken.  1.  Coverage identification. To identify beneficiaries with third-party  health coverage, states are required to request coverage information  from potential Medicaid beneficiaries at the time the agency makes  any determination or redetermination of eligibility. States are also  required to obtain and use information pertaining to third-party liability,  for example, by conducting data matches with state wage information  agencies, Social Security Administration wage and earning files, state  motor vehicle accident report files, or state workers\u2019 compensation  files.  2.  Coverage verification. When other health coverage is identified,  states often verify the information, including the services covered  through the other insurance and the dates of eligibility.  3.  Cost avoidance payment procedures. As a general rule, federal law  requires states to apply cost avoidance payment procedures to claims  for most Medicaid items and services. Under cost avoidance  procedures, the state must reject claims for which a third party is or is  probably liable, and the agency instructs the provider to collect from  the third party. Once the provider determines the amount of the third  party\u2019s liability, the provider submits a claim to the state Medicaid  agency for any remaining balance, up to the maximum amount  allowed under the state\u2019s payment schedule. States are then  required to make timely payment to the provider, generally within 30  days from the date the claim for the balance is filed.  4.  Pay-and-chase payment procedures. The Consolidated Omnibus  Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985 made an exception to cost  avoidance procedures for three types of services: prenatal care  services, pediatric preventive services, and services provided to CSE  beneficiaries. It required states to pay such claims without regard to  the liability of the third party, a procedure CMS calls \u201cpay and chase.\u201d  Under the pay-and-chase payment procedure, the state Medicaid  agency is generally required to make a timely payment to the provider  within 30 days, and then the state, instead of the provider, will seek to  recover payment from any potentially liable third parties within 60  days. According to CMS, cost avoidance does not apply to these  claims because there is a risk some providers might not participate in  Medicaid to avoid dealing with the administrative burden of cost  avoidance. (See fig. 1.)", "The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 amended various sections of the  Medicaid third-party liability statute, including the required processes  states must follow when paying claims with probable third-party liability for  the following three types of services:", "Prenatal care services. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018  eliminated, effective February 2018, the statutory exception for  prenatal care services that had required states to apply pay-and- chase procedures to such claims. Thus, under the amended statute,  states must apply cost avoidance procedures to claims for prenatal  care services when it is apparent that a third party is or may be liable  at the time the claim is filed. Additionally, to the extent states had  opted under CMS regulations to apply pay-and-chase procedures to  claims for labor, delivery, or postpartum care services\u2014which CMS  calls \u201cpregnancy-related services\u201d\u2014states must now apply cost  avoidance procedures to those as well.", "Pediatric preventive services. Beginning in October 2019, under  federal law as amended by the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, states  are no longer required to pay claims for pediatric preventive services  immediately. While states will still have the option to apply pay-and- chase procedures to these claims, a state may instead choose\u2014if it  determines doing so is cost-effective and will not adversely affect  access to care\u2014to require the provider to first submit the claim to the  third party and wait 90 days for payment by the third party before  seeking Medicaid payment.

As of May 2019, CMS anticipated that it  would release updated regulations in early 2020.", "Because CMS has not monitored states\u2019 compliance with federal third- party liability requirements, the agency does not know whether states  have applied the federally required third-party liability procedures to  certain Medicaid claims as required by federal law. In the case of prenatal  care services claims, the failure to implement cost avoidance payment  procedures could result in unnecessary Medicaid expenditures, to the  extent that Medicaid pays providers for services for which a third party is  liable. To the extent that states are not properly applying pay-and-chase  procedures to pediatric preventive service claims, children\u2019s access to  such services could be impacted."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Anticipate Third-Party Liability Changes Could Affect Beneficiary Access to Care; Selected States Discussed Using Existing Methods to Assess Effects of Changes", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Most Stakeholders Anticipate Increased Administrative Requirements for Providers and a Possible Decrease in Beneficiary Access to Care", "paragraphs": ["According to most of the stakeholders we interviewed, Medicaid  providers\u2014especially prenatal care and rural providers\u2014could face  increased administrative requirements or delays in payments for services  as a result of the third-party liability payment changes to the three service  categories in the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018. Several stakeholders  agreed that the tasks associated with identifying sources of third-party  liability and attempting to collect from third parties would shift from state  Medicaid agencies to providers as a result of the payment changes,  although opinions differed on the extent to which this shift would affect  providers.", "Several stakeholders said that the third-party liability changes could  increase administrative requirements for providers, because obtaining  accurate information on third-party liability sources for Medicaid  beneficiaries and resubmitting claims that result from incorrect or  outdated third-party liability information can be resource intensive and  time consuming. One provider and officials from one state Medicaid  agency noted that providers may lack the administrative resources or  claims-processing expertise to deal with these changes. Officials from  one state Medicaid agency, two state provider associations, and an  organization advocating for Medicaid beneficiaries also noted that  providers may encounter Medicaid beneficiaries who may be unaware  or may not disclose that they have other insurance policies; for  example, children who are covered under multiple insurance policies  by custodial and non-custodial parents or experience insurance  transitions following birth. These issues may increase the amount of  time and resources providers spend on processing and resubmitting  claims.", "Other stakeholders were less certain that the added requirements  would cause difficulties for providers. Officials from one state  Medicaid agency and one MCO said that the payment changes would  not be difficult to implement, because providers were familiar with  billing third parties for medical services for other beneficiaries.  Officials from four state Medicaid agencies and two MCOs noted that  providers may prefer to submit claims to commercial insurers,  because these insurers pay at a higher rate compared with state  Medicaid programs.", "Several stakeholders we interviewed agreed that providers could wait  longer periods of time for payment as they track down third-party insurers  or wait up to 100 days for potential payment from these insurers before  seeking payment from the state Medicaid agency. According to one  provider and officials from two provider associations and one MCO, these  delays could put providers at risk of not receiving payments for services  or not having enough cash on hand to sustain operations. Additionally,  officials from three provider associations noted that payment delays  would affect pediatric providers in particular, because the majority of the  services that pediatricians provide are preventive care\u2014which would be  affected by the third-party liability changes.", "According to several stakeholders we interviewed, smaller or independent  providers and those located in rural areas could be more affected by the  third-party liability changes compared with providers affiliated with  managed care systems or those located in urban areas. Officials from  one state Medicaid agency, two provider associations, and one MCO  noted that smaller or rural-based providers generally have fewer staff and  resources to deal with the larger volume of administrative paperwork and  delays in payment for services that could result from the payment  changes.", "Most of the stakeholders we interviewed said that providers might be less  willing to serve Medicaid beneficiaries due to the administrative and  payment issues, potentially reducing access to care or delaying services  for children and pregnant women. However, some other stakeholders  said that the third-party liability changes would have little to no effect on  Medicaid beneficiaries. Officials from one state Medicaid agency and one  MCO noted that third-party liability payment practices for other Medicaid  populations and services have been in place for many years, and  providers would already be familiar with processing claims with third-party  liability.", "Several stakeholders said that providers may opt to reduce or eliminate  the number of Medicaid beneficiaries they serve, because of actual or  perceived increase in administrative requirements or payment delays.  Officials from three state provider associations speculated that the  potential for additional delays in payment for services could be the \u201cfinal  straw\u201d in providers\u2019 decision to stop serving Medicaid beneficiaries. Other  stakeholders, including a Medicaid expert, one provider, and officials from  one state provider association noted that providers may decide to see  fewer Medicaid beneficiaries, but are unlikely to stop seeing them entirely,  because some providers are reluctant to deny care to these beneficiaries.", "Payment delays could also lead to delays in beneficiaries receiving time- sensitive services, such as immunizations, as well as reduced access to  specialists, such as midwives or mental health professionals, according to  several stakeholders. Officials from one national provider association and  an organization advocating for Medicaid beneficiaries noted that providers  may seek to identify sources of third-party liability before providing  services to beneficiaries. In addition, officials from one state Medicaid  agency, a state provider association, and an organization advocating for  Medicaid beneficiaries expressed concern that the third-party liability  changes had the potential to reduce access to care for populations, such  as children and pregnant women, that already faced challenges in  accessing adequate, timely, or quality health care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Discussed Using Existing Methods for Assessing Provider Availability and Beneficiary Access to Care Once Payment Changes Are Implemented", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid officials we interviewed from seven of the nine selected states  said that their agencies will\u2014or could\u2014use existing methods to assess  the effects of the third-party liability changes on provider availability and  beneficiary access to prenatal care services, pediatric preventive  services, and services for CSE beneficiaries.

According to officials from two state  Medicaid agencies and a Medicaid expert, many other factors could  potentially affect provider availability and beneficiary access, making it  difficult or impossible to pinpoint if a decline in provider availability or  beneficiary utilization of services was the result of the third-party liability  changes or something else\u2014such as changes in the managed care  market or levels of private coverage among beneficiaries.", "We found other evidence suggesting that it might be challenging for some  states to assess the effects of the third-party liability changes.  Specifically, Medicaid officials from eight of the nine selected states did  not readily identify the number of beneficiaries in their state that had third- party liability and would be affected by the changes. Moreover, officials  from two states noted that obtaining this data would require a \u201csignificant\u201d  effort.", "Officials from five states shared information on the number of children,  pregnant women, or births covered by Medicaid in their state, but did  not specify how many of these beneficiaries had other insurance  coverage.", "Seven of the nine selected states had no data readily available on  CSE beneficiaries who were also covered by Medicaid.
