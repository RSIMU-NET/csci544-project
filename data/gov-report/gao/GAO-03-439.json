Many facilities exist in populated areas where a chemical release could threaten thousands. EPA reports that 123 chemical facilities located throughout the nation have toxic \"worst-case\" scenarios where more than a million people in the surrounding area could be at risk of exposure to a cloud of toxic gas if a release occurred. To date, no one has comprehensively assessed the security of chemical facilities. No federal laws explicitly require that chemical facilities assess vulnerabilities or take security actions to safeguard their facilities from attack. However, a number of federal laws impose safety requirements on facilities that may help mitigate the effects of a terrorist-caused chemical release. EPA believes that the Clean Air Act could be interpreted to provide authority to require chemical facilities to assess their vulnerabilities and to make security enhancements that protect against attacks. However, EPA has not attempted to use these Clean Air Act provisions because of concerns that this interpretation would pose significant litigation risk and has concluded that chemical facility security would be more effectively addressed by passage of specific legislation. The federal government has not comprehensively assessed the chemical industry's vulnerabilities to terrorist attacks. EPA, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice have taken preliminary steps to assist the industry in its preparedness efforts, but no agency monitors or documents the extent to which chemical facilities have implemented security measures. Consequently, federal, state, and local entities lack comprehensive information on the vulnerabilities facing the industry. To its credit, the chemical industry, led by its industry associations, has undertaken a number of voluntary initiatives to address security at facilities. For example, the American Chemistry Council, whose members own or operate 1,000, or about 7 percent, of the facilities subject to Clean Air Act risk management plan provisions, requires its members to conduct vulnerability assessments and implement security improvements. The industry faces a number of challenges in preparing facilities against attacks, including ensuring that all chemical facilities address security concerns. Despite the industry's voluntary efforts, the extent of security preparedness at U.S. chemical facilities is unknown. Finally, both the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Administrator of EPA have stated that voluntary efforts alone are not sufficient to assure the public of industry's preparedness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the events of September 11, 2001, showed, terrorists can cause  enormous damage to our country by attacking infrastructure essential to  our economy and jeopardizing public health and safety.

One of the  sectors identified\u2014the nation\u2019s $450 billion chemical industry\u2014produces  the chemicals needed to manufacture thousands of products, such as  those used in agriculture, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles. Furthermore,  the federal government has identified 140 toxic and flammable chemicals  that, in certain amounts, would pose the greatest risk to human health and  the environment if they were accidentally released into the air. The  chemical industry is not the only U.S. industry that houses these  hazardous chemicals. Other industries, such as agricultural retailers,  drinking water and wastewater treatment systems, food processors and  distributors who have ammonia refrigeration systems, and petroleum  refineries, also house these chemicals. In all, the federal government  estimates that a total of 15,000 facilities in the United States produce, use,  or store more than threshold amounts of these 140 hazardous chemicals.", "Even before September 11, 2001, protecting chemical facilities was the  shared responsibility of federal, state, and local governments in  partnership with the private sector. However, attention was focused  largely on the risks of accidental, rather than intentional, chemical  releases. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), under the Clean  Air Act, requires that about 15,000 facilities with more than threshold  amounts of chemicals posing the greatest risk to human health and the  environment take a number of steps to prevent and prepare for an  accidental chemical release. These facilities must develop a risk  management program, which includes an assessment of the off-site  consequences of an accidental chemical release and an accident  prevention program, and an emergency response plan. The events of  September 11, 2001, brought heightened attention to chemical facility  security and the possibility of an intentional terrorist-caused chemical  release.", "The federal government\u2019s role in protecting facilities from terrorist attack  has been much debated since September 11, 2001. Debate has focused on  whether the federal government should impose security requirements on  chemical facilities or whether voluntary industry actions are sufficient.  Congress is currently considering several legislative proposals that  address the protection of critical infrastructure, including mandating  security measures at chemical facilities.", "As agreed with your offices, we examined a number of issues surrounding  the security of the chemical industry. In this report, we (1) summarize  available information on the threats and risks from terrorism that U.S.  chemical facilities face; (2) describe federal requirements for security  preparedness and the safe management of chemicals at these facilities;   (3) describe actions federal agencies have taken to assess the vulnerability  of the chemical industry or to address security preparedness; and   (4) describe the voluntary actions the chemical industry has taken to  address security preparedness, and the challenges it faces in protecting its  assets and operations. To determine the threats and risks from terrorism  faced by U.S. chemical facilities, we interviewed officials at the  Department of Defense\u2019s Army Office of the Surgeon General and the  Defense Threat Reduction Agency. We also interviewed officials in the  Department of Justice\u2019s (Justice) National Institute of Justice and several  units of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) including the Hazardous  Materials Response Unit, the National Infrastructure Protection Center,  and the Weapons of Mass Destruction Unit. We interviewed officials at  EPA headquarters, including those from the Chemical Emergency  Preparedness and Prevention Office, and we reviewed risk management  plan (RMP) data. We also collected and reviewed available reports.", "To determine the federal requirements for security preparedness and the  safe management of chemicals at these facilities, we interviewed officials  from the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) and EPA on safety standards and legal authority.  We reviewed statutes and regulations to determine the relevant statutory  framework. To determine the actions taken by federal agencies to assess  the vulnerability of the chemical industry or to address security  preparedness, we reviewed the National Strategy for Homeland Security  and several Justice reports. We interviewed officials at the Departments of  Energy and Justice, at EPA, and at OSHA. We also attended EPA- sponsored training classes on vulnerability assessments taught by officials  from the Department of Energy\u2019s Sandia National Laboratories. We also  discussed the voluntary actions the chemical industry has taken to address  security preparedness and the challenges it faces in protecting its assets  and operations with these agencies. In addition, we interviewed the U.S.  Chemical Safety and Hazards Investigation Board, the Center for Chemical  Process Safety, and numerous industry associations including the  American Chemistry Council (ACC), the American Petroleum Institute, the  Chlorine Institute, Inc., the Fertilizer Institute, the Gas Processors  Association, the International Institute of Ammonia Refrigeration, the  National Petroleum and Refiners Association, and the Synthetic Organic  Chemical Manufacturers Association. We attended security conferences  held by the ACC and the American Petroleum Institute.", "We also interviewed industry officials at a number of facility locations. To  select the facilities for our visits, we used EPA\u2019s RMP database to select  facilities in the highest-risk tier in states with facilities storing the largest  quantities of hazardous chemicals. We selected 27 facilities that  represented various chemical manufacturing industry sectors, such as  industrial gases and plastics and resins. We provided this list of facilities to  the ACC, which then contacted facility officials and identified 8 facilities  willing to host our visits. We visited 6 of these facilities. In addition, we  visited another facility that we contacted independently. We recognize that  there are risks associated with the transportation sector, but it was not  within the scope of our review. We limited our review of security issues to  stationary chemical facilities and did not address security concerns  surrounding the transportation of hazardous chemicals.

Under these provisions, EPA identified 140 toxic and  flammable chemicals that, when present above certain threshold amounts,  would pose the greatest risk to human health and the environment if  released. According to EPA, approximately 15,000 facilities in a variety of  industries produce, use, or store one or more of these chemicals beyond  threshold amounts in one or more processes (e.g., single or interconnected  vessels or tanks).  Table 1 outlines the number and percent of processes in  different industry sectors that maintain more than threshold amounts of  these hazardous chemicals.", "In July 2002, the President issued the National Strategy for Homeland  Security, which spells out the activities that must be accomplished or  coordinated to improve the nation\u2019s readiness to address terrorism. The  strategy designated EPA as the lead agency for interacting with the  chemical industry and the hazardous materials sector. Although the  strategy outlines a framework for agencies\u2019 activities by setting forth  overarching goals, the specific roles and responsibilities for achieving  these goals are still being debated. In November 2002, Congress created  the Department of Homeland Security to consolidate many homeland  security activities and coordinate the efforts of federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector.", "A number of other critical infrastructures have federal security  requirements. For example, all commercial nuclear power plants licensed  by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are subject to a number of security  requirements, including placing physical barriers outside the operating  reactor area, limiting access to vital areas, maintaining a trained security  force, and conducting simulated terrorist attack exercises. Congress  passed the Aviation and Transportation Security Act of 2001, which  transferred aviation security from the Federal Aviation Administration to  the newly created Transportation Security Administration and directed the  agency to take over responsibility for airport screening. The Public Health  Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002  requires community water systems serving more than 3,300 people to  conduct a vulnerability assessment to terrorist attacks, prepare an  emergency response plan that incorporates the results of the vulnerability  assessment, certify to EPA that the vulnerability assessment and  emergency response plan have been completed, and provide a copy of the  assessment to EPA. To improve security in our nation\u2019s ports, the  Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 directs the Secretary of the  Department of Homeland Security to identify vessels and port facilities  that pose a high risk of being involved in a transportation security incident  and to conduct a vulnerability assessment of these facilities and vessels.", "Congress is considering several legislative proposals that would grant EPA  authority to require chemical facilities to take security steps. The 108th  Congress has introduced S. 6 and S. 157 that direct EPA, in consultation  with the Department of Homeland Security, to identify \u201chigh-priority\u201d  chemical facilities based on the severity of the threat and require these  facilities to identify hazards; perform vulnerability assessments; and  develop and implement prevention, preparedness, and response plans to  address vulnerabilities and hazards.

Alternatively, terrorists could steal chemicals, which could be  used to create a weapon capable of causing harm. Justice has been  warning of the terrorist threat to chemical facilities for a number of years  and has concluded that the risk of an attempt in the foreseeable future to  cause an industrial chemical release is both real and credible. In fact,  according to Justice, domestic terrorists plotted to use a destructive  device against a U.S. facility that housed millions of gallons of propane in  the late 1990s. In testimony on February 6, 2002, the Director of the  Central Intelligence Agency warned of the potential for an attack by   al Qaeda on chemical facilities.", "Some chemical facilities may be at higher risk of a terrorist attack than  others when they contain large amounts of toxic chemicals and are  located near population centers assuming that the objective is a  catastrophic release. Attacks on such facilities could harm a large number  of people, with health effects ranging from mild irritation to death, cause  large-scale evacuations, and disrupt the local or regional economy. No  specific data are available on what the actual effects of successful terrorist  attacks on chemical facilities would be. However, facilities subject to the  RMP provisions submit to EPA estimates of the potential consequences to  surrounding communities of hypothetical accidental \u201cworst-case\u201d  chemical releases from their plants. These estimates include the  residential population located within the range of a toxic gas cloud  produced by a \u201cworst-case\u201d chemical release, called the \u201cvulnerable zone.\u201d  According to EPA, 123 chemical facilities located throughout the nation  have toxic \u201cworst-case\u201d scenarios where more than one million people  would be in the \u201cvulnerable zone\u201d and could be at risk of exposure to a  cloud of toxic gas. About 600 facilities could each potentially threaten  between 100,000 and a million people, and about 2,300 facilities could each  potentially threaten between 10,000 and 100,000 people within these  facilities\u2019 \u201cvulnerable zones.\u201d Figure 1 shows the residential population  within the \u201cvulnerable zone\u201d that could potentially be threatened by an  accidental toxic chemical release from a U.S. facility under a \u201cworst-case\u201d  scenario.", "According to EPA, \u201cworst-case\u201d scenarios do not consider the potential  causes of a release or how different causes or other circumstances, such  as safety features, could lessen the consequences of a release.  Hence, the  \u201cworst-case\u201d scenario calculations would be overstating the potential  consequences.  However, the RMP regulation requires facilities to estimate  the effects of a toxic chemical release involving the greatest amount of the  toxic chemical held in a single vessel or pipe\u2014not the entire quantity on  site. Therefore, for some facilities it is conceivable that an attack, where  multiple chemical vessels were breached simultaneously, could result in  an even larger release, involving more severe potential consequences, than  those estimated in the RMP \u201cworst-case\u201d scenarios. Other factors could  also make a facility a more attractive target. For example, a facility that is  widely recognizable, located near a historic or iconic symbol, or critical to  supporting other infrastructures could be at higher risk.", "The Army has also estimated high potential damage to the population from  a toxic chemical release. During a 2001 informal meeting with a number of  agencies, the Army Office of The Surgeon General proposed, based on  generic estimates, that it was conceivable that as many as 2.4 million  people could request medical treatment if a terrorist caused a release of a  toxic chemical. According to officials from that office, these estimates  include anyone who seeks medical attention as a result of the release\u2014 including people with minor irritations or concerns. Finally, a 2002  Brookings Institution report ranks an attack on toxic chemical plants  behind only biological and atomic attacks in terms of possible fatalities.", "Currently, no one has comprehensively assessed security across the nation  at facilities that house chemicals. According to a 1999 study by the Agency  for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR), security at chemical  plants in two communities was fair to very poor. ATSDR observed security  vulnerabilities such as freely accessible chemical barge terminals and  chemical rail cars parked near residential areas in communities where  plants are located. Furthermore, during a limited review of chemical  industry vulnerabilities conducted primarily before September 11, 2001,  Justice found that security at 11 chemical facilities was comparable to  security found at other industrial facilities. According to Justice, some  facilities may need to implement more effective security systems and  develop alternative means to reduce the potential consequences of a  successful attack. The effectiveness of security at some facilities may also  be in doubt as evidenced by several media accounts of reporters and  environmental activists gaining access to chemical tanks and computer  centers that control manufacturing processes at these facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "No Federal Requirements Specifically Require Chemical Facilities to Address the Threat of Terrorism", "paragraphs": ["No federal laws explicitly require that chemical facilities take security  actions to safeguard their facilities against a terrorist attack.

However, these requirements do not cover a wide  range of chemical facilities and may do little to actually prevent a terrorist  attack. For example, under EPA\u2019s regulations implementing the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, facilities that house hazardous  waste generally must take certain security actions, such as posting  warning signs and using a 24-hour surveillance system or surrounding the  active portion of the facility with a barrier and controlled entry gates.  However, according to EPA, these requirements would be applicable to  only approximately 21 percent of the 15,000 RMP facilities because this   21 percent is also subject to the Resource Conservation and Recovery  Act\u2019s requirements. Moreover, while a facility\u2019s use of a 24-hour  surveillance system or a means to control entry may help impede a  terrorist\u2019s access to a facility, these security measures are aimed at  keeping out trespassers or wanderers, not intentional intruders, according  to EPA.", "Several statutes, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the  Clean Air Act, and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know  Act, impose safety and emergency response requirements on chemical  facilities that may incidentally reduce the likelihood and mitigate the  consequences of terrorist attacks. The Occupational Safety and Health  Act imposes a number of safety requirements, including a general duty to  furnish a workplace free from recognized hazards that may cause death or  serious physical harm to employees. The 1990 amendments to the Clean  Air Act also include safety requirements, including a general duty to  prevent and mitigate accidental chemical releases.  Specifically, section  112(r) of the Clean Air Act includes a general duty clause directing owners  and operators of facilities that produce, use, handle, or store listed or  other extremely hazardous substances to identify hazards, design and  maintain a safe facility to prevent releases, and minimize the  consequences of any accidental releases that occur.", "Section 112(r) also directs EPA to establish regulations under which  owners and operators of facilities that handle listed (or \u201cregulated\u201d)  extremely hazardous substances over a threshold amount are required to  prepare and implement a risk management plan to detect and prevent or  minimize accidental releases. Facility owners and operators must  conduct a hazard assessment that includes an evaluation of worst-case  accidental release scenarios. They must also implement a program to  prevent accidental releases that includes safety precautions and  maintenance, monitoring, and training measures, and have an emergency  response plan with specific actions to be taken in response to an  accidental release. In addition, these facilities must coordinate their  activities with community emergency response organizations. Facility  owners or operators must generally discuss these activities in an RMP and  submit it to EPA.", "The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 also call for OSHA to establish a  standard to protect employees from hazards associated with accidental  releases of highly hazardous chemicals in the workplace. OSHA\u2019s process  safety management standard (on which EPA\u2019s RMP regulations are  modeled) requires facilities to assess and address the hazards of their  chemical process.  Implementation of the standard makes facilities safer  and could help mitigate the consequences of a terrorist attack. Regulated  companies in over 95 different industry sectors, including chemical  manufacturing, must conduct hazard evaluations, known as process  hazard analyses, for every step of a covered manufacturing process.  These analyses must include hazards of the process, engineering and  administrative controls applicable to the hazards, facilities siting, and  evaluation of the range of possible health and safety effects of failures of  controls on employees. Based on these analyses, employers must take  action to address the findings. Examples of measures that facilities could  take include storing smaller amounts of chemicals, substituting less  dangerous chemicals for chemicals currently in use, installing automatic  shutdown systems, and installing pipes and other critical equipment that  are stronger and better-shielded.", "The Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act focuses on  understanding hazards and planning for emergencies to ensure that if a  release occurs, local responders will be able to take quick, effective  actions to protect public health and the environment. Under this act,  owners of facilities that maintain specified quantities of certain extremely  hazardous chemicals must submit information annually on their chemical  inventory to state and local emergency response officials. The act also  requires that each state establish a State Emergency Response  Commission to oversee local emergency planning and create local  emergency planning committees. Local emergency planning committee  members include local police, fire fighters, health officials, representatives  from government and media, community groups, and representatives from  facilities. These committees must develop and periodically review their  communities\u2019 emergency response plans, including the identification of  chemical facilities, and outline procedures for response personnel to  follow in the event of a chemical incident.", "All of these requirements could potentially mitigate a terrorist attack in a  number of ways. First, because some of these requirements only apply to  facilities with more than threshold quantities of certain chemicals, facility  owners have an incentive to reduce or eliminate these chemicals, which  may make the facility a less attractive target or minimize the impact of an  attack. Second, both the RMP and process safety management hazard  analyses require operators to identify the areas of their plants that are  vulnerable to a chemical release. When facilities implement measures to  improve the safety of these areas, such as installing sensors and  sprinklers, the impact of a terrorist-caused release may be lessened. Third,  the emergency response plans increase preparedness for a chemical  release\u2014whether intentional or unintentional. More coordinated and  immediate emergency response could mitigate the consequences of a  terrorist attack.", "In addition to these federal safety requirements, some states and localities  have imposed additional safety requirements on chemical facilities and, in  some instances, have addressed the security of chemical facilities from  terrorism. For example, Contra Costa County, California, in implementing  EPA\u2019s RMP provisions, requires that chemical facilities incorporate  inherently safer technologies. Specifically dealing with the threat of  terrorism, New Jersey has implemented criminal penalties for any toxic  chemical manufacturer who recklessly allows an unauthorized individual  to obtain access to the chemical. In addition, Baltimore, Maryland, passed  a city ordinance addressing the threat of terrorism that requires chemical  manufacturers to follow a set of safety and security regulations devised by  its fire and police commissioners. Companies that fail to comply with the  ordinance may face penalties such as the withholding or suspension of  facility operating permits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA\u2019s Views of Its Authority to Require Chemical Facilities to Prepare for Terrorist Acts", "paragraphs": ["EPA believes that the Clean Air Act could be interpreted to provide  authority to address site security from terrorist attack at chemical  facilities.

Arguably, any chemical release caused  by a terrorist attack would be unanticipated and thus could be covered  under the Clean Air Act. An interpretation of an unanticipated emission as  including an emission due to a terrorist attack would provide EPA with  authority under Section 112(r)\u2019s RMP provisions and the general duty  clause to require security measures or vulnerability assessments with  regard to terrorism.", "The Clean Air Act\u2019s RMP provisions could be interpreted to provide EPA  authority to require facilities to take actions to improve their security.  Under the RMP provisions, owners and operators of facilities producing,  processing, handling, or storing more than a threshold quantity of a  regulated chemical must detect and prevent or minimize \u201caccidental  releases\u201d and provide prompt emergency response to a release to protect  human health and the environment. For example, EPA could require  facilities to include security vulnerability assessments as part of their RMP  hazard assessments, identifying the potential public exposure that could  result from a terrorist attack and incorporating the threat of terrorism into  the \u201cworst-case\u201d release scenario. However, current EPA regulations do  not require facilities to assess their vulnerability to terrorist attack as part  of their RMP. EPA would need to revise its regulations to require that  facilities take the threat of terrorism into account.", "EPA could also interpret the Clean Air Act\u2019s general duty clause to address  chemical facility security from terrorism. The general duty clause requires  owners and operators of stationary sources producing, processing,  handling, or storing listed or other extremely hazardous substances to   (1) identify hazards that may result from releases using appropriate hazard  assessment techniques; (2) design and maintain a safe facility, taking the  steps necessary to prevent releases; and (3) minimize the consequences of  accidental releases that do occur. According to EPA, it would not have to  make any regulatory changes as it currently implements the general duty  clause through guidance. Thus, EPA could revise its existing guidance or  issue new guidance to include managing the risk of terrorism as within  owners and operators\u2019 responsibility under the general duty clause.  Second, the clause covers not only the specific chemicals listed under the  RMP regulations, but also any other extremely hazardous chemicals. The  Clean Air Act does not define an extremely hazardous chemical, and EPA  interprets this term broadly. In addition, unlike the RMP provisions, the  general duty clause is not limited to facilities that have more than a  threshold amount of an extremely hazardous chemical.  Thus, facilities  that are not covered under the RMP provisions because their chemical  amounts are below the threshold amount are covered under the general  duty clause. However, if EPA chose to use the general duty clause to  address threats to facilities from terrorism, it would face some limitations.  Facility owners and operators must demonstrate safe practices at their  facilities, but there are no specific standards that facilities have to meet.   Since the general duty clause is not implemented by regulations, there are  no EPA standards specifically defining the duty.  Instead, EPA generally  looks to industry and other standards to indicate what facilities should do  to prevent and mitigate accidental releases.  With respect to chemical  facility security against terrorism, according to EPA, there are few such  standards.", "While EPA believes that the Clean Air Act could be interpreted to  authorize EPA to require chemical plants to address security against  terrorism, there are a number of practical and legal arguments against this  interpretation. First, a release due to a terrorist attack is not entirely  unanticipated, as it is an intentional act. Second, a potential argument  against EPA using its general duty clause to require facilities to address  the threat of terrorism is the relationship between EPA\u2019s general duty  clause and OSHA\u2019s general duty clause.  Clean Air Act section 112(r)  provides that chemical facility owners and operators have a \u201cgeneral duty  in the same manner and to the same extent\u201d as OSHA\u2019s general duty  clause. However, the Department of Labor informed us that it does not  believe OSHA\u2019s general duty clause provides it with authority to address  the threat of terrorism.  In responding to our draft, Justice expressed  concerns that the Clean Air Act does not provide sufficient protection  against dissemination of sensitive information that could be used by  terrorists.", "In light of the litigation risk and the importance of an effective response to  the chemical security issue, EPA has decided not to attempt to require  vulnerability assessments or security enhancements under the Clean Air  Act.

They  stated that chemical companies do not receive enough specific threat  information and frequently receive threat information from multiple  government agencies. Similarly, in developing its vulnerability assessment  methodology, Justice observed that chemical facilities need more specific  information about potential threats in order to design their security  systems and protocols. Industry officials also noted that efforts to share  threat information among industry and federal agencies will be effective  only if government agencies provide specific and accurate threat  information. Threat information also forms the foundation for some of the  tools available to industry to assess facility vulnerabilities. The Justice  vulnerability assessment methodology requires threat information as the  foundation for hypothesizing about threat scenarios, which form the basis  for determining site vulnerabilities.", "Second, according to industry officials, chemical companies face a  challenge in achieving cost-effective security solutions, noting that  companies must weigh the cost of implementing countermeasures against  the perceived reduction in risk. Industry groups with whom we spoke  indicated that their member companies face the challenge of effectively  allocating limited security resources. Facilities must also determine what  constitutes a reasonable level of security against known or suspected  threats. For example, officials noted that preparing facilities against  extreme terrorist scenarios, such as jetliner attacks, would be  prohibitively expensive.", "Third, facilities face pressure from public interest groups to implement  inherently safer practices (referred to in the industry as inherently safer  technologies), such as lowering toxic chemical inventories and  redesigning sites to reduce risks. Justice, in introducing its methodology to  assess chemical facilities\u2019 vulnerabilities, also recognized that reducing the  quantity of hazardous material may make facilities less attractive to  terrorist attack and reduce the severity of an attack. While industry  recognizes the contribution that inherently safer technologies can make to  reducing the risk of a terrorist attack, industry officials noted that  decisions about inherently safer technologies require thorough analysis  and may shift, rather than reduce, risks. For example, reducing the amount  of chemicals stored may shift the risk onto the transportation sector as  reliance on rail or truck shipments increases. Finally, industry officials  underscored that relocating chemical storage tanks and other site redesign  strategies may be extremely costly and may have repercussions on other  facility operations.", "Fourth, industry officials voiced concern about government agencies\u2019  ability to protect sensitive information relating to facility vulnerabilities  and security. They stated that companies may be hesitant to share  information about site-specific vulnerabilities and security unless  government agencies implement specific safeguards to protect this  information. We have also reported that public-private information sharing  practices are central to critical infrastructure protection. Specifically,  practices such as taking steps to ensure that sensitive information is not  inappropriately disseminated and developing standards and agreements on  how shared information will be used and protected are critical to  successful information sharing.", "Finally, industry officials stated that the industry faces a challenge in  engaging all chemical facilities in voluntary security efforts. Industry  officials noted that facilities that are not ACC members present a concern  because they may not be addressing security issues. Officials expressed  concern that smaller chemical companies may not be taking as much  action as larger companies to address vulnerabilities. Officials also  mentioned ACC\u2019s efforts to engage other facilities that manufacture,  distribute, transport, store, or dispose of chemicals through the  Responsible Care program, noting that failure of all facilities to act may  affect public perception of the efficacy of voluntary industry initiatives.", "Although the industry has taken steps to address security concerns, the  extent of security preparedness across the chemical industry is unknown.
