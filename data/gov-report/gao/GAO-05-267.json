By congressional mandate, plans for expenditure of appropriated funds on this system, the Automated Commercial Environment (ACE), must meet certain conditions, including GAO review. This study addresses whether the fiscal year 2005 plan satisfies these conditions, describes the status of DHS's efforts to implement prior GAO recommendations for improving ACE management, and provides observations about the plan and DHS's management of the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 2005 ACE expenditure plan, including related program documentation and program officials' statements, largely satisfies the legislative conditions imposed by the Congress. In addition, some of the recommendations that GAO has previously made to strengthen ACE management have been addressed, and DHS has committed to addressing those that remain. However, much remains to be done before these recommendations are fully implemented. For example, progress has been slow on implementing the recommendation that the department proactively manage the dependencies between ACE and related DHS border security programs. Delays in managing the relationships among such programs will increase the chances that later system rework will be needed to allow the programs to interoperate. Among GAO's observations about the ACE program and its management are several regarding DHS's approach to addressing previously identified cost and schedule overruns. DHS has taken actions intended to address these overruns (such as revising its baselines for cost and schedule, as GAO previously recommended); however, it is unlikely that these actions will prevent future overruns, because DHS has relaxed system quality standards, meaning that milestones are being passed despite material system defects. Correcting such defects will require the program to use resources (e.g., people and test environments) at the expense of later system releases. Until the ACE program is held accountable not only for cost and schedule but also for system capabilities and benefits, the program is likely to continue to fall short of expectations. Finally, the usefulness of the fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan for congressional oversight is limited. For example, it does not adequately describe progress against commitments (e.g., ACE capabilities, schedule, cost, and benefits) made in previous plans, which makes it difficult to make well-informed judgments on the program's overall progress. Also, in light of recent program changes, GAO questions the expenditure plan's usefulness to the Congress as an accountability mechanism. The expenditure plan is based largely on the ACE program plan of July 8, 2004. However, recent program developments have altered some key bases of the ACE program plan and thus the current expenditure plan. In particular, the expenditure plan does not reflect additional program releases that are now planned or recent changes to the roles and responsibilities of the ACE development contractor and the program office. Without complete information and an up-to-date plan, meaningful congressional oversight of program progress and accountability is impaired."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In November 2004, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS), submitted to the Congress its  fiscal year 2005 expenditure plan for the Automated Commercial  Environment (ACE) program.

Nevertheless, progress has been slow in addressing  some of our recommendations, such as the one encouraging proactive  management of the relationships between ACE and other DHS border  security programs, like US-VISIT. Given that these programs have made  and will continue to make decisions that determine how they will operate,  delays in managing their relationships will increase the chances that later  system rework will eventually be required to allow the programs to  interoperate.", "Additionally, while DHS has taken important actions to help address ACE  release-by-release cost and schedule overruns that we previously  identified, it is unlikely that the effect of these actions will prevent the past  pattern of overruns from recurring. This is because DHS has met its  recently revised cost and schedule commitments in part by relaxing system  quality standards, so that milestones are being passed despite material  system defects, and because correcting such defects will ultimately require  the program to expend resources, such as people and test environments, at  the expense of later system releases (some of which are now under way).", "In the near term, cost and schedule overruns on recent releases are being  somewhat masked by the use of less stringent quality standards; ultimately,  efforts to fix these defects will likely affect the delivery of later releases.  Until accountability for ACE is redefined and measured in terms of all types  of program commitments\u2014system capabilities, benefits, costs, and  schedules\u2014the program will likely experience more cost and schedule  overruns.", "During the last year, DHS\u2019s accountability for ACE has been largely focused  on meeting its cost and schedule baselines. This focus is revealed by the  absence of information in the latest expenditure plan on progress against  all commitments made in prior plans, particularly with regard to  measurement and reporting on such things as system capabilities, use, and  benefits. It is also shown by the program\u2019s insufficient focus on system  quality, as demonstrated by its willingness to pass milestones despite  material defects, and by the absence of attention to the current defect  profile for Release 3 (which is already deployed).", "Moreover, the commitments that DHS made in the fiscal year 2005  expenditure plan have been overcome by events, which limits the currency  and relevance of this plan and its utility to the Congress as an  accountability mechanism. As a result, the prospects of greater  accountability in delivering against its capability, benefit, cost, and  schedule commitments are limited. Therefore, it is critically important that  DHS define for itself and the Congress an accountability framework for  ACE, and that it manage and report in accordance with this framework.

For example, the defect data as of November 30, 2004, show that 18 defects that were open at TRR were still open (11 moderate and 7 minor); 33 defects open at PRR were still open (16 moderate and 17 minor); and 92 defects open at ORR were still open (2 severe, 43 moderate, and 47 minor). In addition, the data show that 43 defects opened since ORR (23 severe, 8 moderate, and 12 minor) were still open as of November 30, 2004.
