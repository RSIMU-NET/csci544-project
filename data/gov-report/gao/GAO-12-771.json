FCC set an RF energy exposure limit for mobile phones in 1996, based on recommendations from federal health and safety agencies and international organizations. These international organizations have updated their exposure limit recommendation in recent years, based on new research, and this new limit has been widely adopted by other countries, including countries in the European Union. This new recommended limit could allow for more RF energy exposure, but actual exposure depends on a number of factors including how the phone is held during use. FCC has not adopted the new recommended limit. The Office of Management and Budget\u0092s instructions to federal agencies require the adoption of consensus standards when possible. FCC told GAO that it relies on the guidance of federal health and safety agencies when determining the RF energy exposure limit, and to date, none of these agencies have advised FCC to change the limit. However, FCC has not formally asked these agencies for a reassessment. By not formally reassessing its current limit, FCC cannot ensure it is using a limit that reflects the latest research on RF energy exposure. FCC has also not reassessed its testing requirements to ensure that they identify the maximum RF energy exposure a user could experience.

The rapid adoption of  mobile phones has occurred amidst controversy over whether the  technology poses a risk to human health. Like other devices that transmit  radio signals, mobile phones emit radio-frequency (RF) energy. At high  power levels, RF energy can heat biological tissue and cause damage.  Though mobile phones operate at power levels well below the level at  which this thermal effect occurs, the question of whether long-term  exposure to RF energy emitted from mobile phones can cause other  types of adverse health effects, such as cancer, has been the subject of  research and debate.", "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) share regulatory responsibilities for mobile phones.  FCC, in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969,  regulates RF energy emitted from FCC-regulated transmitters, including  mobile phones. Toward that end, FCC has implemented a certification program to ensure that all mobile phones sold in the United States  comply with the agency\u2019s limit on RF energy exposure. This limit was  designed to protect users from the thermal effects of acute exposure to  RF energy. FDA is responsible for carrying out a program designed to  protect public health and safety from electronic product radiation. FDA  does not review the safety of all radiation-emitting electronic products,  such as mobile phones, before they are marketed. However, FDA has the  authority to take action, such as requiring manufacturers to replace or  recall mobile phones that are shown to emit RF energy at a level that is  hazardous. To date, FDA has not taken such action, but the agency  regularly evaluates scientific studies on mobile phones and health to  determine whether they raise public health questions.", "In 2001, we reported on the status of scientific knowledge about potential  health risks of RF energy exposure from mobile phones and the federal  government\u2019s regulatory actions to ensure mobile phone safety. We found that FDA and others had concluded that the research did not show  RF energy exposure from mobile phones had adverse health effects, but  more studies were needed. We also found that FCC had not issued  standardized procedures for testing mobile phones and that FCC\u2019s and  FDA\u2019s consumer materials could be improved. Since 2001, FCC has  issued revised guidance for mobile phone testing, and both FCC and FDA  have provided updated information to consumers about the health effects  of mobile phone use.", "At your request, we are updating information related to mobile phone  health effects and regulatory issues.

What actions have federal agencies and the mobile phone industry  taken to inform the public about issues related to mobile phone health  effects?", "To determine what is known about the human health effects of RF energy  exposure from mobile phone use, we reviewed selected studies, including  studies and reports that review and assess the scientific research as well  as key individual studies. We identified these studies through literature  searches in online databases, such as Embase and Medline, and  interviews with officials from federal agencies, academic institutions,  consumer groups, and industry associations. We also interviewed subject  matter experts in a range of fields, such as public health and engineering.  To determine the current research activities of federal agencies related to  mobile phone use and health, we interviewed officials from FCC; the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 FDA, Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH);  Department of Defense; Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and  Health Administration (OSHA); and the Environmental Protection Agency  (EPA). To determine the research activities of other organizations, we  interviewed representatives of the International Agency for Research on  Cancer (IARC), academic institutions, consumer groups, mobile phone  industry associations, mobile phone manufacturers, and mobile phone  providers. To determine how FCC set the RF energy exposure limit and  ensures compliance with it, we reviewed FCC regulations and guidance.  We also reviewed reports from international organizations that  recommend RF energy exposure limits. We conducted interviews with  officials from FCC and Telecommunication Certification Bodies (TCBs) to  understand their role in certifying mobile phones. We also interviewed  representatives of the mobile phone industry and consumer  organizations, and experts in RF energy exposure limits to obtain their  perspectives on the testing and certification of mobile phones. To  determine the actions federal agencies and the mobile phone industry  have taken to inform the public about issues related to mobile phone  health effects, we reviewed information on the public websites of CDC,  EPA, FCC, FDA, NIH, and OSHA.

For example, the number of estimated mobile phone subscribers has  grown from about 3.5 million in 1989 to approximately 286 million by the  end of 2009, according to the most recent data reported by FCC.  Further, the number of Americans who rely exclusively on mobile phones  for voice service has increased in recent years. For example, by the end  of 2009 over 50 percent of young adults aged 25 to 29 relied exclusively  on mobile phones, according to the most recent FCC data. The way  individuals use mobile phones has also changed. For instance, while  average minutes of use per mobile phone subscriber per month has  declined in recent years, mobile text messaging traffic has increased.  About 88 percent of teenage mobile phone users now send and receive  text messages, which is a rise from the 51 percent of teenagers who  texted in 2006.", "Mobile phones are low-powered radio transceivers\u2014a combination  transmitter and receiver\u2014that use radio waves to communicate with fixed  installations, called base stations or cell towers. The radio waves used by  mobile phones are a form of electromagnetic radiation\u2014energy moving  through space as a series of electric and magnetic waves. The spectrum  of electromagnetic radiation comprises a range of frequencies from very  low, such as electrical power from power lines, through visible light, to  extremely high, such as gamma rays, as shown in figure 1. The portion of  the electromagnetic spectrum used by mobile phones\u2014as well as other  telecommunications services, such as radio and television broadcasting\u2014 is referred to as the RF spectrum.", "The electromagnetic spectrum includes ionizing and non-ionizing  radiation. Ionizing radiation, such as gamma rays, has energy levels high  enough to strip electrons from atoms and molecules, which can lead to  serious biological damage, including the production of cancers. RF  energy, on the other hand, is in the non-ionizing portion of the  electromagnetic spectrum, which lacks the energy needed to cause  ionization. However, RF energy can produce other types of biological  effects. For example, it has been known for many years that exposure to  high levels of RF energy, particularly at microwave frequencies, can  rapidly heat biological tissue. This thermal effect can cause harm by  increasing body temperature, disrupting behavior, and damaging  biological tissue. The thermal effect has been successfully harnessed for  household and industrial applications, such as cooking food and molding  plastics. Since mobile phones are required to operate at power levels well  below the threshold for known thermal effects, the mobile phone health  issue has generally focused on whether there are any adverse health  effects from long-term or frequent exposure to low-power RF energy  emissions that are not caused by heating."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Research on RF Energy Exposure from Mobile Phones Has Not Demonstrated Adverse Health Effects, but More Studies Are Under Way", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Scientific Research", "paragraphs": ["Scientific research to date has not demonstrated adverse human health  effects from RF energy exposure from mobile phone use, but additional  research may increase understanding of possible effects. In 2001, we  reported that FDA and others had concluded that research had not shown  RF energy emissions from mobile phones to have adverse health effects,  but that insufficient information was available to conclude mobile phones  posed no risk. Following another decade of scientific research and  hundreds of studies examining health effects of RF energy exposure from  mobile phone use, FDA maintains this conclusion. FDA stated that while  the overall body of research has not demonstrated adverse health effects,  some individual studies suggest possible effects. Officials from NIH,  experts we interviewed, and a working group commissioned by IARC\u2014 the World Health Organization\u2019s agency that promotes international  collaboration in cancer research\u2014have reached similar conclusions. For  example, in May 2011 IARC classified RF energy as \u201cpossibly  carcinogenic to humans.\u201d IARC determined that the evidence from the  scientific research for gliomas, a type of cancerous brain tumor, was  limited\u2014meaning that an association has been observed between RF  energy exposure and cancer for which a causal relationship is considered  to be credible, but chance, bias, or confounding factors could not be ruled  out with reasonable confidence. With respect to other types of cancers,  IARC determined that the evidence was inadequate\u2014meaning that the  available studies are of insufficient quality, consistency, or statistical  power to permit a conclusion about the causal association. Additionally, in  April 2012 an advisory group to the Health Protection Agency\u2014an  independent organization established by the United Kingdom government  to protect the public from environmental hazards and infectious  diseases\u2014concluded that although there is substantial research on this  topic, there is no convincing evidence that RF energy below guideline  levels causes health effects in adults or children.", "A broad body of research is important for understanding the health effects  of RF energy exposure from mobile phone use, because no single study  can establish a cause-and-effect relationship and limitations associated  with studies can make it difficult to draw conclusions. Two types of  studies, epidemiological and laboratory, are used in combination to  examine effects from mobile phones. Epidemiological studies investigate  the association, if any, between health effects and the characteristics of  people and their environment. Laboratory studies conducted on test  subjects\u2014including human volunteers, laboratory animals, biological  tissue samples, or isolated cells\u2014are used to determine a causal  relationship between possible risk factors and human health, and the  possible mechanisms through which that relationship occurs.", "Studies we reviewed suggested and experts we interviewed stated that  epidemiological research has not demonstrated adverse health effects  from RF energy exposure from mobile phone use, but the research is not  conclusive because findings from some studies have suggested a  possible association with certain types of tumors, including cancerous  tumors. Findings from one such study, the INTERPHONE study, were  published in 2010. This retrospective case-control study with more than  5,000 cases examined the association between mobile phone use and  certain types of brain tumors, including cancerous tumors, in individuals  aged 30-59 years in 13 countries. Overall study findings did not show an  increased risk of brain tumors from mobile phone use, but at the highest  level of exposure, findings suggested a possible increased risk of  glioma. Other epidemiological studies have not found associations  between mobile phone use and tumors, including cancerous tumors. For  example, findings from a nationwide cohort study conducted in Denmark  that originally followed 420,095 individuals did not show an association  between increased risk for certain types of tumors, including cancerous  tumors, and mobile phone use. Additionally, findings from a subset of  the cohort\u201456,648 individuals with 10 or more years since their first  mobile phone subscription\u2014did not show an increased risk for brain and  nervous system tumors. Further, these findings did not change for  individuals in the cohort with 13 or more years since their first mobile  phone subscription. Also, the CEFALO study\u2014an international case- control study that compared children aged 7 to 19 diagnosed with certain  types of brain tumors, including brain cancers, to similar children who  were not diagnosed with brain tumors\u2014found no relationship between  mobile phone use and risk for brain tumors. Findings from another  study, which was conducted by NIH and examined trends in brain cancer  incidence rates in the United States using national cancer registry data  collected from 1992 to 2006, did not find an increase in new cases of  brain cancer, despite a dramatic increase in mobile phone use during this  time period.", "Limitations associated with epidemiological studies can make it difficult to  draw definitive conclusions about whether adverse health effects are  linked to RF energy exposure from mobile phone use. One such limitation  is that it is difficult to measure and control for all variables that may affect  results. For example, it can be difficult to accurately measure RF energy  exposure from mobile phone use because humans are exposed to RF  energy from many sources within their environments and mobile phone  technology and user patterns frequently change. Also, epidemiological  studies to date have been limited in their ability to provide information  about possible effects of long-term RF energy exposure because the  prevalence of long-term mobile phone use is still relatively limited and  some tumors, including some cancerous tumors, do not develop until  many years after exposure. In addition, epidemiological studies,  specifically cohort studies, are sometimes limited in their ability to provide  information about increased risks for rare outcomes, such as certain  types of brain tumors. To address challenges with assessing rare  outcomes, case-control studies, which collect information about past  mobile phone use among study participants, may be undertaken with  large numbers of cases and controls. While these studies can potentially  provide information on long-term use, and include enough cancer cases  to examine whether this use is associated with rare diseases, collecting  data in this way can introduce bias, such as recall bias, into study data  and further limit findings. To mitigate this potential bias, some  epidemiological studies, specifically cohort studies, follow large  populations over time and collect data about mobile phone use before  participants develop a certain outcome. In spite of these limitations,  experts we spoke with told us that epidemiological studies are a key  component of the body of research used for assessing the health effects  of mobile phones.", "Studies we reviewed suggested and experts we interviewed stated that  laboratory research has not demonstrated adverse human health effects  from RF energy exposure from mobile phone use, but the research is not  conclusive because findings from some studies have observed effects on  test subjects. Some laboratory studies have examined whether RF  energy has harmful effects by exposing samples of human and animal  cells to RF energy over a range of dose rates, durations, and conditions  to detect any changes in cellular structures and functions. For example,  some studies have examined the effects of RF energy on  deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in rodent and human cells. While some of  these studies found that RF energy exposure damaged DNA, others  failed to replicate such an effect using similar experimental conditions.  Other studies have exposed laboratory animals to RF energy, examined  the animals for changes, and compared outcomes with a control group.  For example, some studies have measured the behavior or cognitive  functioning of rats to assess the neurological effects of RF energy.  According to some studies we reviewed, while some of these studies  have observed changes in behavior and cognitive function, overall, these  studies have not consistently found adverse effects from RF energy levels  emitted from mobile phones. Laboratory studies also have exposed  human volunteers to RF energy to investigate possible effects, such as  effects on the neurological system or blood pressure. According to  studies we reviewed, some studies on human volunteers have observed  changes, such as changes in brain activity, but the implications of these  physiological changes in relation to adverse effects on human health are  unknown.", "Limitations associated with laboratory studies can make it difficult to draw  conclusions about adverse human health effects from RF energy  exposure from mobile phone use. For example, studies conducted on  laboratory animals allow researchers to examine the effects of RF energy  exposure on animal systems, but this type of research is limited because  effects on laboratory animals may not be the same on humans.  Additionally, studies on test subjects may observe biological or  physiological changes, but in some circumstances it is unclear how or  even if these changes affect human health. Further, to increase the  strength of the evidence that observed changes in laboratory studies are  the effect of RF energy exposure, studies must be replicated and  confirmed with additional research using different dose rates, durations,  and conditions of RF energy while observing similar effects. To date,  according to FDA officials and some experts we interviewed, only a few  laboratory studies that have shown effects from RF energy have been  replicated, and some replicated studies have not confirmed earlier results.", "Studies we reviewed and experts we interviewed identified key areas for  additional epidemiological and laboratory studies, and according to  experts, additional research may increase understanding of any possible  effects. For example, additional epidemiological studies, particularly large  long-term prospective cohort studies and case-control studies on children,  could increase knowledge on potential risks of cancer from mobile phone  use. Also, studies and experts identified several areas for additional  laboratory studies. For example, additional studies on laboratory animals  as well as human and animal cells examining the possible toxic or  harmful effects of RF energy exposure could increase knowledge on  potential biological and health effects of RF energy. Further, additional  laboratory studies on human and animal cells to examine non-thermal  effects of RF energy could increase knowledge of how, if at all, RF energy  interacts with biological systems. However, some experts we spoke to  noted that, absent clear evidence for adverse health effects, it is difficult  to justify investing significant resources in research examining non- thermal effects of RF energy from mobile phone use. Another area  identified for additional laboratory research is studies on human  volunteers examining the effect of changes in the neurological system,  which could help determine if these possible observed changes in  neurological functioning from RF energy are adverse effects. In addition  to conducting additional research, experts we interviewed reported that  the broader body of evidence on RF energy should be re-evaluated when  findings from key studies become available, to determine whether  additional research in certain areas is still warranted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Research Activities", "paragraphs": ["Current research activities of federal agencies, international  organizations, and the mobile phone industry include funding and  supporting ongoing research on the health effects of RF energy exposure  from mobile phones.

FCC officials told us that they rely heavily on the guidance and  recommendations of federal health and safety agencies when  determining the appropriate RF energy exposure limit and that, to date,  none of these agencies have advised FCC that its current RF energy limit  needs to be revised. Officials from FDA and EPA told us that FCC has not  formally asked either agency for an opinion on the RF energy limit. FDA  officials noted, though, that if they had a concern with the current RF  energy exposure limit, then they would bring it to the attention of FCC.", "Although federal guidance states that agencies should generally use  consensus standards, FCC officials provided reasons why they did not  have current plans to change the RF energy exposure limit. Office of  Management and Budget Circular A-119 concerning federal use of  technical standards states that federal agencies must use \u201cconsensus  standards in lieu of government-unique standards,\u201d except where  inconsistent with law or otherwise impractical. FCC officials noted that no  determination has been made that the new recommended RF energy  exposure limit is inconsistent with law or impractical. FCC has recognized  that research on RF energy exposure is ongoing and pledged to monitor  the science to ensure that its guidelines continue to be appropriate.  FCC officials noted that an assessment of the current limit and the new  recommended limit could be accomplished through a formal rulemaking  process, which would include a solicitation of information and opinions  from federal health and safety agencies. FCC could alternatively release  a Notice of Inquiry to gather information on this issue without formally  initiating rulemaking.", "Stakeholders we spoke with varied on whether the current U.S. RF  energy exposure limit should be changed to reflect the new  recommended limit. For instance, a few experts and consumer groups we  spoke with said FCC should not adopt the new recommended exposure  limit because of the relative uncertainty of scientific research on adverse  health effects from mobile phone use. An official from one consumer  group told us that adopting the 2.0 watts per kilogram exposure limit  would be a step back, since it could allow users to be exposed to higher  radiation levels. Conversely, some experts we spoke with maintained that  both the 1.6- and 2.0-watts-per-kilogram limits protect users from the  thermal effects of RF energy exposure\u2014which the experts maintained are  the only conclusively demonstrated effects of exposure\u2014since a safety  factor of fifty was applied to obtain the limits, meaning that the maximum  permitted exposure is a fiftieth of what was determined to be the  exposure at which potentially deleterious thermal effects are likely to  occur.", "Nevertheless, by not formally reassessing its current RF energy exposure  limit, FCC cannot ensure that it is using a limit that reflects the latest  evidence on thermal effects from RF energy exposure, and may impose  additional costs on manufacturers and limitations on mobile phone  design. FCC\u2019s current limit was established based on recommendations  made more than 20 years ago. According to IEEE, the new  recommended limit it developed is based on significantly improved RF  research and therefore a better understanding of the thermal effects of  RF energy exposure. Additionally, three of the four mobile phone  manufacturers we spoke with favored harmonization of RF energy  exposure limits, telling us that maintaining the separate standards can  result in additional costs and may affect phone design in a way that could  limit performance and functionality. According to some manufacturers we  spoke with, many of their phones are sold in multiple countries. As a  result, the manufacturers have to develop and test phones based on  different exposure limits, which can require additional resources and slow  the time it takes to get new phones into the market. Additionally, one  manufacturer indicated that some features are not enabled on phones  sold in the United States that are available in other countries to comply  with FCC\u2019s current limit.

FCC officials told  us that over the last 10 years, the average time to review an application  submitted directly to the agency has ranged from 45 to 60 days.  Representatives from one TCB we spoke with noted that the TCB review  can be as short as a week, though FCC does not collect data on how long  it takes TCBs to process applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mobile Phone Testing", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that mobile phones comply with FCC\u2019s RF energy exposure  limit, manufacturers conduct tests at their own laboratories or have the  testing conducted for them by private laboratories. Laboratories must  follow standardized FCC testing procedures or work with FCC to develop  acceptable alternatives in some complex cases. These procedures  require that the SAR be measured to ensure the mobile phone\u2019s  compliance with the FCC exposure limit, which was designed to ensure  that mobile phones do not expose the public to levels of RF energy that  could be potentially harmful. FCC periodically updates the testing  procedures as new mobile phone technology is introduced. A typical  testing set-up is shown in figure 3.", "FCC has implemented standardized testing procedures requiring mobile  phones to be tested for compliance with the RF energy exposure limit  when in use against the ear and against the body while in body-worn  accessories, such as holsters, but these requirements may not identify  the maximum exposure under other conditions. The specific minimum  separation distance from the body is determined by the manufacturer  (never to exceed 2.5 centimeters), based on the way in which the mobile  phone is designed to be used. The results of these testing requirements  are two different values: a maximum SAR value for the head and a  maximum SAR value for the body. However, these testing procedures  may not identify the maximum SAR for the body, since some consumers  use mobile phones with only a slight distance, or no distance, between  the device and the body, such as placing the phone in a pocket while  using an ear piece. Using a mobile phone in this manner could result in  RF energy exposure above the maximum body-worn SAR determined  during testing, although that may not necessarily be in excess of the  FCC\u2019s limit. In such a case, exposure in excess of FCC\u2019s limit could occur  if the device were to transmit continuously and at maximum power.", "FCC has not reassessed its testing requirements to ensure that testing  identifies the maximum RF energy exposure for the other usage  conditions a user could experience when mobile phones are in use  without body-worn accessories or as advised by the manufacturer\u2019s  instructions, rather than the head. Although FCC officials said that they  provide case-by-case guidance for many mobile phones operating with  new technologies, they do not require testing of mobile phones when  used without body-worn accessories unless such conditions are  specifically identified by the manufacturer\u2019s operating instructions.  Representatives of some consumer groups we spoke with expressed  concern about the exposure to RF energy that can come with such use.  Officials from IEEE, though, told us that the average power and resultant  radiation level of mobile phones while in use is very low, such that even  when a mobile phone is used against the body it is unlikely that the RF  energy exposure would exceed the FCC limit. Nevertheless, FCC has not  reassessed its testing requirements to ensure that mobile phones do not  exceed the RF energy exposure limit in all possible usage conditions.", "Beyond the testing required for certification, FCC also ensures that  mobile phones meet its RF energy exposure limit by reviewing  information collected as part of routine surveillance of mobile phones on  the market. FCC requires TCBs to carry out this post-market surveillance  program, through which each TCB tests one percent of the mobile  phones they have certified for RF energy exposure, to ensure that the  phones continue to meet FCC\u2019s RF energy exposure limit. According to  FCC, no mobile phone tested under this surveillance program has been  found in violation of the RF energy exposure limit."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies and Mobile Phone Industry Provide Information to the Public through Websites and User Manuals", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Information Provided by Federal Agencies", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies provide information to the public on the health effects of  mobile phone use and related issues primarily through their websites.

For instance, NIH primarily provides information  about the research on health effects of RF energy exposure from mobile  phone use, while FCC provides information on how mobile phones are  tested and certified. Nevertheless, the concluding statements about  whether RF energy exposure from mobile phone use poses a risk to  human health are generally consistent across selected federal agencies\u2019  websites that we reviewed, though the specific wording of these  concluding statements varies.", "Representatives from some consumer groups and experts we spoke with  raised concerns that the information on federal agency websites about  mobile phone health effects is not precautionary enough, among other  things. In particular, these representatives and experts said that federal  agencies should include stronger precautionary information about mobile  phones because of the uncertain state of scientific research on mobile  phone health effects as well as the fact that current testing requirements  may not identify the maximum possible RF energy exposure.  Representatives from one consumer group also said that federal agency  websites should provide more consumer information, such as the impact  of different mobile phone technologies on RF energy exposure. Officials  from FCC and NIH maintained that the information on their websites  reflects the latest scientific evidence and provides sufficient information  for consumers concerned about potential health effects related to mobile  phones.", "Some consumer groups noted that they would like FCC to mention  IARC\u2019s recent classification of RF energy exposure as \u201cpossibly  carcinogenic\u201d on FCC\u2019s website. FCC noted that it generally defers to the  health and safety agencies for reporting on new research, though FCC\u2019s  website did include information on the recent INTERPHONE study when  we reviewed the site in June 2012. FCC does provide links to CDC, EPA,  FDA, and other websites, some of which have information about the  IARC\u2019s classification.

FCC regulates RF energy emitted  from mobile phones and relies on federal health and safety agencies to  help determine the appropriate RF energy exposure limit. However, FCC  has not formally asked FDA or EPA for their assessment of the limit since  1996, during which time there have been significant improvements in RF  energy research and therefore a better understanding of the thermal  effects of RF energy exposure. This evidence has led to a new RF energy  exposure limit recommendation from international organizations.  Additionally, maintaining the current U.S. limit may result in additional  costs for manufacturers and impact phone design in a way that could limit  performance and functionality. Reassessing its current RF energy  exposure limit would ensure that FCC\u2019s limit protects the public from  exposure to RF energy while allowing industry to provide  telecommunications services in the most efficient and practical manner  possible.", "The current testing requirements for mobile phones may not identify the  maximum RF energy exposure when tested against the body. FCC  testing requirements state that mobile phone tests should be conducted  with belt-clips and holsters attached to the phone or at a predetermined  distance from the body. These requirements were developed by FCC to  identify the maximum RF energy exposure a user could experience when  using a mobile phone, to ensure that the mobile phone meets the  agency\u2019s RF energy exposure limit. This limit was designed to ensure that  mobile phones do not expose the public to levels of RF energy that could  be potentially harmful. By testing mobile phones only when at a distance  from the body, FCC may not be identifying the maximum exposure, since  some users may hold a mobile phone directly against the body while in  use. Using a mobile phone in this manner could result in RF energy  exposure above the maximum body-worn SAR determined during testing,  although that may not necessarily be in excess of FCC\u2019s limit.
