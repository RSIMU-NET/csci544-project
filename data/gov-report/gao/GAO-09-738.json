Between late 2005 and early 2006, State created a new two-bureau structure to better address these issues and improve efficiency GAO was asked to assess the extent to which State addressed (1) the objectives of its 2005-2006 reorganization and (2) key transformation practices. For this effort, GAO reviewed State documents pertaining to the reorganization and staffing data for the affected bureaus in the periods before and after the reorganization and interviewed former and current State officials in Washington, D.C."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State cannot demonstrate that the 2005-2006 restructuring of its Nonproliferation, Arms Control, and Verification and Compliance bureaus achieved all of its objectives because it did not clearly define the objectives and lacked metrics to assess them. State's objectives were to enable it to better focus on post -September 11 challenges; reduce bureaucratic inefficiencies and top-heavy management; and eliminate overlap. State sought to achieve its first objective by creating new offices and roles to address terrorism and counterproliferation issues. To meet its second objective, State merged three bureaus having 30 offices and functions into two bureaus having 26 offices and functions and freed up staff slots for these new roles, but problems with workload mismatches persisted after the reorganization as State employees noted it left some offices overworked and some offices underworked. State cannot demonstrate that it met its third objective, reducing top-heavy management, as its goals were undefined. Although it reduced the number of senior executives from 27 to 20 and reduced office directorships, the overall number of higher-ranking employees increased from 91 to 100 and executive office staff increased from 44 to 50. Moreover, concerns about mission overlap persist, in part because bureau roles remain undefined in the FAM. State's reorganization addressed few of the key practices for organizational mergers and transformations that GAO developed in 2002. These practices are found to be at the center of successful mergers and transformations. As illustrated below, State generally addressed one key practice, partially addressed two, and did not address the remaining five. For example, State did not address establishing coherent mission and strategic goals because it did not define an end state with measurable goals, nor did it devise a means to gauge progress toward such goals or assess the results of actions taken. As a result, State lacks reasonable assurance that the reorganization achieved its objectives or that it can identify any lessons learned."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has negotiated numerous arms control and  nonproliferation treaties and agreements over the past 40 years, with the  Department of State (State) playing a major role in the process. In  December 2004, State\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG) reported that the  April 1999 integration of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency  (ACDA) into State had produced a three-bureau structure\u2014the bureaus of  Arms Control (AC), Nonproliferation (NP), and Verification and  Compliance (VC)\u2014to deter the spread of weapons of mass destruction  (WMD) and further U.S. arms control objectives. According to the IG,  however, this arrangement did not meet post-September 11, 2001,  challenges, and unclear lines of authority, uneven workload, and  unproductive competition impeded the three bureaus. Among other  things, the IG recommended merging the bureaus of Arms Control and  Nonproliferation. Between July 2005 and March 2006, State undertook the  reorganization of its arms control bureaucracy to address both IG  concerns and a number of security challenges and priorities that had risen  after the September 11 terrorist attack. The Secretary of State merged the  Arms Control and Nonproliferation Bureaus into the new Bureau of  International Security and Nonproliferation (ISN) and expanded the  functions of the Verification and Compliance Bureau, renaming it the  Bureau of Verification, Compliance and Implementation (VCI).  The  former Undersecretary of State for Arms Control and International  Security characterized the reorganization as an effort to refocus the  bureaus on contemporary nonproliferation threats, rather than on past  threats such as nuclear confrontation with the former Soviet Union. In  January 2009, the Secretary of State announced at her nomination hearing  that the new administration placed high importance on the missions of  these bureaus and intended to review their organizational and staffing  requirements before making a decision to reorganize further.", "In this requested report, we examine the extent to which State addressed  (1) the objectives of its 2005-2006 reorganization and (2) key  transformation practices GAO has developed for organizational  transformations and mergers. To address these objectives, we reviewed  State IG reports that recommended the reorganization and examined  relevant State personnel standards, applicable policies, and other  documents related to the planning, implementation, and review of this  reorganization. We met with directors of the current arms control bureaus  and with past and present State officials involved in the reorganization,  including all of the officials assigned to the senior management panel that  designed and implemented the reorganization. We also met with officials  from State\u2019s Human Resources and Management bureaus and examined  State workforce allocations, staffing patterns, and promotion and attrition  data for the affected bureaus from periods before and after the  reorganization. We applied GAO\u2019s criteria for key organizational  transformation and merger practices to assess how State addressed them  in the reorganization. Furthermore, we reviewed various State  documents\u2014including draft descriptions of bureau missions and  functions, memorandums, and e-mails\u2014with guidance on the  restructuring process and criticisms of it, and a study of the new bureaus\u2019  workforce conducted shortly after the reorganization.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2008 to July 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Once these bureaus were established in April 1999, they  were combined with State\u2019s existing Bureau of Political-Military Affairs to  form a new \u201cT family\u201d of bureaus. Subsequently in 2000, due to  congressional concerns regarding effective verification of and compliance  with arms control agreements, part of the Bureau of Arms Control became  a separate Bureau of Verification and Compliance.", "In 2004, the State IG began reviews of the three new bureaus to examine  the effectiveness of ACDA\u2019s incorporation into State and the performance  and interaction of the T bureaus. The IG found that the organizational  structure did not meet current needs and was marked by unclear lines of  authority, unproductive competition among offices, and uneven  workloads. The IG also found that the management structure of the three  bureaus was top-heavy, resulting in poor promotion prospects for junior  civil service staff and the difficulty of attracting Foreign Service Officers  (FSOs). The IG noted that State had yet to agree upon language  formalizing the responsibilities of the three bureaus in its FAM 5 years  after the merger. The IG recommended that the Secretary of State, in  coordination with the Undersecretaries for the Management and T bureaus  (1) form a task force to oversee the merger of AC and NP into a single  bureau to improve the policymaking process; and (2) restructure the VC  bureau into a smaller specialized entity better able to focus on its core  mission.", "In response, State established a task force in August 2004 to evaluate the T  bureaus\u2019 organizational structure, recommend changes if necessary, and  prepare a strategy for implementing structural changes. However,  according to a senior State official, the task force disbanded without  agreeing on a course of action. Nevertheless, the outgoing Secretary of  State approved the merger in December 2004. He deferred the  implementation of the merger until his successor could review the matter.  The new Secretary reaffirmed the decision in February 2005 but deferred  the matter until the Senate confirmed a new Undersecretary of State for  Arms Control and International Security in May 2005.", "On July 29, 2005, State presented a proposed structure to Congress  showing how the Arms Control and Nonproliferation bureaus would be  merged into a new international security and nonproliferation bureau. The  proposed new structure was put together by the new Undersecretary. It  shifted significant responsibilities for implementing arms control  agreements to the newly expanded and renamed Bureau of Verification,  Compliance and Implementation. On September 12, 2005, the  Undersecretary announced the establishment of the new International  Security and Nonproliferation Bureau and the creation of a Senior  Management Panel (SMP) to implement the merger, consisting of the three  principal deputy assistant secretaries from the Arms Control,  Nonproliferation, and Verification and Compliance bureaus, plus the U.S.  Representative to the Conference on Disarmament, based in Geneva,  Switzerland.", "On September 28, 2005, the SMP sent an e-mail and memo to staff  summarizing the reorganization procedures and designating acting office  directors to lead the new bureau.

For example, State designated a Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary  (PDAS) for Counterproliferation Issues in ISN and created three new  offices:    The Office of Counterproliferation Initiatives was to take the lead in  developing, implementing, and improving Proliferation Security Initiative  (PSI) and other efforts to interdict or deny shipments of WMD and their  delivery systems.", "The Office of Weapons of Mass Destruction Terrorism was to develop  policy guidance and a diplomatic strategy. State officials noted that this  office was created to address as an emerging challenge the need to  counter the efforts of terrorists actively seeking weapons of mass  destruction. In February 2006, the Undersecretary testified that this office  would help bridge a gap between the government\u2019s traditional state- focused WMD counterproliferation efforts and the focus of its antiterrorist  intelligence efforts on individuals and groups. The PDAS of ISN stated in  2008 that this office also helped create the Global Initiative to Combat  Nuclear Terrorism, which works to develop counterproliferation and  interdiction capabilities in other governments.", "The Office of Strategic Planning and Outreach, in part, was to address a  perceived gap in the ability of the T bureaus to innovatively address future  threats, identify emerging proliferation threats, and develop a coordinated  and strategic counterproliferation response. For example, the  Undersecretary described the need to develop new ways to assess and  counter the proliferation challenges posed by black markets, front  companies, and global terrorist networks.", "In addition, State merged existing offices to reflect the greater priority it  placed on these post-September 11 challenges, according to State\u2019s July  2005 notification to Congress. For example, State merged offices from two  bureaus to form the Office of Chemical and Biological Weapons Threat  Reduction, which would lead new ISN efforts to prevent states or other  entities from pursuing, using, or proliferating WMD weapons and their  technology. State similarly merged two existing offices to form the Office  of Missile Threat Reduction to take the lead in implementing policies and  programs to counter the proliferation of ballistic and cruise missiles  capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction and better coordinate  these efforts with overall counterproliferation efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Combining Related Offices May Not Have Reduced Bureaucratic Inefficiencies", "paragraphs": ["State reduced the number of offices and functions assigned to the affected  bureaus, but cannot demonstrate how the merger reduced bureaucratic  inefficiencies or redressed uneven workloads.

The reorganization consolidated 24 issue-related  offices and functions present in the two old bureaus into 17 issue-related  offices and functions in the new bureau. State also succeeded in slightly  reducing its overall personnel positions in these bureaus. In October 2004,  the AC, NP, and VC bureaus had a total of 440 staff positions; by  November 2008, the ISN and VCI bureaus had a total of 434 staff positions.  The reorganization affected four types of personnel positions: (1) civil  service full-time equivalents (FTEs), which are positions funded by the  bureau in which they are located; (2) Foreign Service FTEs; (3) other  government staff (that is, personnel not directly funded by the bureaus  such as detailees from other State bureaus, other government agencies,  the armed services, and interns); and (4) contracted employees.", "In 2004, the AC and NP bureaus had a total of 314 staff positions. By 2008,  after they had merged to form the new ISN bureau, that total had  decreased to 291 staff positions. As depicted in figure 2, the new total  reflects changes in the numbers and composition of the staff positions  available to ISN, with declines in the number of civil service FTEs, Foreign  Service FTEs, and other government staff, but a slight increase in the  number of contracted employees.", "The reductions resulting from the merger of the AC and NP bureaus into  the ISN bureau were largely offset by the augmented roles and increased  staff given to the old VC bureau. According to State officials, Congress had  made its acceptance of the new two-bureau structure conditional upon the  transfer of some offices and duties to the newly expanded and renamed  Bureau of Verification, Compliance and Implementation.", "The VC Bureau\u2019s PDAS for Compliance Policy was re-designated as PDAS  for Compliance and Implementation; moreover, the VC bureau\u2019s Deputy  Assistant Secretary (DAS) of State for Verification Policy was re- designated the DAS for Verification and Implementation. The number of  offices and functions reporting to these officials initially rose from six to  nine. This was in part due to State\u2019s decision to shift responsibility for  implementing strategic arms control agreements with the former Soviet  Union, such as the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and the Strategic  Arms Reduction Talks, to VCI. According to a State announcement, the  expanded VCI bureau enhanced State\u2019s ability to verify and ensure full  compliance with arms control and nonproliferation commitments. As part  of this shift, VCI incorporated four additional offices and functions from  the AC bureau to create the VCI Office of Chemical and Conventional  Weapons Affairs, the Office of Strategic Issues, and the Office of Missile  Defense and Space Policy. The latter office was transferred to ISN in June  2007, and the total number of VCI offices and functions dropped from nine  to eight.", "As a result of these changes, total staff positions increased from 126 under  the old VC bureau to 143 under the new VCI bureau.

In contrast, State officials and documents show that some inefficiencies  identified before the reorganization, such as mismatched or uneven  workloads, persisted afterward and may have grown worse.", "Some State officials contend that the reorganization addressed  bureaucratic inefficiencies. A senior official involved in the reorganization  stated that the merger reduced issue overlap, clarified office missions, and  streamlined staffing. He noted that the reorganization (1) reduced the  number of offices focused on furthering strategic arms limitations talks  with the Russians from 3 offices with 22 personnel to 1 office with 4  personnel, and (2) consolidated responsibilities for multilateral arms  control issues into one office and reduced the number of staff dedicated to  these issues from 28 to 18.", "Nevertheless, workload mismatches persisted after the reorganization.

A post-reorganization review  conducted for State in 2006 by two consultants found three former NP  offices with continuing heavy workloads. Moreover, the review noted  that many staff believed the AC offices transferred to VCI remained  underworked. According to some SMP officials and employees  interviewed after the reorganization, transferring these AC offices to VCI  did not relieve the heavy workloads of some of the NP offices transferred  to ISN. Instead, the reductions in staff available to ISN to address the  undiminished workloads of preexisting missions, combined with the new  workloads imposed by the new counterproliferation missions, and the  reprogramming of resources  increased the workload burden on ISN staff,  according to the review and State officials."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Absent Clearly Defined Goals, State Cannot Demonstrate That It Achieved Its Objective of Making Management Less Top-heavy", "paragraphs": ["In its July 2005 notification to Congress, State noted as its third objective  that the merger would reduce top-heavy management.

Our analysis of State staffing profiles shows that State succeeded in  reducing the number of PDAS and DAS positions from 4 to 3, and the  number of office director positions and special representatives from 24 in  AC and NP in 2004 to 17 in ISN in 2008. However, in the absence of (1) a  definition of what constituted top-heavy management, and (2) measurable  goals that identified the number and ranks of the positions to be reduced  or eliminated, State cannot demonstrate whether these actions achieved  this objective.", "Given the ambiguous nature of this objective, the results of the  reorganization can be interpreted differently. For example, while the  number of Foreign Service and civil service senior executives in the  affected bureaus decreased from 27 in 2004 to 20 in 2008, the number of  Foreign Service positions and civil servant positions with ranks just below  the senior level increased from 64 in 2004 to 80 in 2008.

Overall, the total number of staff  with a rank of FO-1 and above in the Foreign Service and GS-15 and above  in the civil service increased from 91 in 2004 to 100 by 2008. While not all  GS-15s and FO-1s hold management or supervisory positions in the  bureaus affected by the reorganization, State cannot demonstrate whether  the changes in the number and positions of the employees holding these  ranks helped it reduce top-heavy management.

In 2004, before the  reorganization, the State IG reports identified a number of areas of overlap  between the AC, NP, and VC bureaus, including multiple bureau reporting  channels for some U.S. international conference representatives and treaty  negotiators, and unclear and conflicting demarcation of responsibilities  between AC and NP for their South Asia and North Korea issues. State  officials noted that the reorganization had addressed some organizational  redundancies. However, a May 2006  study on workforce allocation  conducted by two State contracted employees in the T bureaus conducted  after the reorganization found that mission redundancies persisted for  chemical weapons, missile defense and space policy, nuclear  nonproliferation, and bioterrorism issues among 14 VCI and ISN offices  and functions. Moreover, the study noted that further staff adjustments  between the two bureaus were under way 2 months after the formation of  the VCI bureau in March 2006.", "The ongoing lack of clear guidance in the FAM contributes to the  persistent overlap problem.

The section of the manual detailing the roles and  responsibilities of these bureaus has never been drafted and approved  since the 1999 incorporation of ACDA into State and the creation of the  AC, NP, and VC bureaus. Furthermore, one member of the SMP noted that  the panel\u2019s deliberations about assigning roles and missions to the new  ISN/VCI structure were hindered by the lack of an up-to-date FAM for  these bureaus.", "Although State assured Congress in June 2008 that these omissions in the  FAM would be rectified, it had not modified the manual as of July 2009.  Some former State officials noted in testimony that the missions of the  PM, ISN, and VCI bureaus are also encapsulated in their Bureau Strategic  Plans and internal planning documents that outline the bureau\u2019s goals and  resource needs for future years.

While our analysis of staffing profiles notes that some  experienced senior staff were retained as employees or contracted  employees after the reorganization, some senior State officials concluded  that expertise in some affected offices was significantly reduced. For  example, one official singled out the offices of Multilateral Nuclear and  Security Affairs, Regional Affairs, and Cooperative Threat Reduction as  experiencing particularly significant loss in staff expertise. Additionally,  we reported in March 2009 that State officials noted that the  reorganization resulted in the loss of 9 of the 14 staff in the office  responsible for overseeing the International Atomic Energy Agency and  the Nonproliferation Treaty, limiting its ability to effectively monitor  Technical Cooperation program developments.", "Similarly, State officials did not establish goals for improved career  advancement opportunities. In contrast, available evidence indicates that  post-reorganization opportunities have declined. For example, the FSO  promotion rate within the NP bureau was about 12 percent in 2004 and 2005  before it merged into the ISN bureau\u2014compared with an average annual  promotion rate of 40 percent for FSOs in the regional bureaus in the same  period. The rates then declined precipitously after the reorganization; only  two FSOs were promoted in ISN between 2006 and 2008.", "Furthermore, State officials involved in the reorganization also noted that  State did not succeed in increasing FSO participation in the affected T  bureaus as the SMP had intended. As figure 4 indicates, the number of FSO  positions declined from 48 FTEs to 43 FTEs between 2004 and 2008. This  represents a decline of 10 percent. The number of higher ranking FSO  positions dropped from 14 (including 2 vacant positions) to 12, and the  number of overall vacancies increased from 17 percent of the total (8  positions) to 28 percent (12 positions). Comparable civil service FTE  vacancy rates in 2004 and 2008 were 10 percent and 17 percent,  respectively.", "State officials indicated that the need to contribute some FSO positions to  help meet State\u2019s priority to fully staff Iraq and Afghanistan positions at  the expense of other assignments contributed to this decline. However, a  more persistent cause is the ongoing FSO perception that assignments to  ISN or VCI are not as attractive as assignments to other bureaus.  According to the head of the task force that conducted a survey of FSOs in  the T bureaus in 2006, service in these bureaus is not attractive for several  reasons, including (1) a regional bureau preference to reward regional  rather than functional expertise, (2) career FSOs\u2019 lack of understanding of  the missions and roles of the T bureaus, and (3) limited opportunities and  incentives to acquire technical experience needed for leadership in these  bureaus. State formed a task force in April 2006 to determine why FSOs  are underrepresented in T bureaus and suggest ways of making T bureaus  more attractive to FSOs.

The  composition of an implementation team is important because it sends a  clear signal regarding the components of a merger and whether the new  organization is a merger of equals. In the latter case, the team should  consist of a balance of employees from the various components. In  addition, according to State officials, the qualifications of implementation  team members are also a visible sign that top leadership is serious and  committed to the merger or transformation. For instance, the  implementation team can include personnel with knowledge or expertise  on personnel issues, change management principles, and perform other  complex tasks associated with such reorganizations. While the SMP  functioned as an implementation team to help manage the process, it  initially lacked balance because it contained neither career officials nor  employees with the knowledge of how to conduct necessary  reorganization steps, such as preparing implementation plans; and  establishing target personnel ceilings, position descriptions, and grade  levels. Staff were not permanently placed, and position descriptions and  office mission statements were not formalized until after the start of the  reorganization. T human resource officials told us this should have been  done before the reorganization started. Moreover, the chair of the SMP  stated that its members did not have any knowledge of the eight key  practices that are critical to the success of any merger or transformation.  In fact, Bureau of Human Resources (HR) and T human resource officials  originally envisioned the SMP would serve as a recommending body, with  HR and T human resource officials in charge of implementing the  reorganization.", "State communicated with staff through meetings, memos, and e-mails, but  its informal implementation guide did not contain an overall  communications strategy. Moreover, the messages communicated were  not consistent and did not always meet the specific needs of employees.  As we noted in our 2003 report, communication is most effective when  done early, clearly, often, and in multiple directions. It also needs to be  consistent in tone and content to alleviate the uncertainties generated  during the transformation effort. We found that the SMP\u2019s communications  were not consistent. While the SMP\u2019s September 28, 2005, announcement  designating acting office directors stated that HR had approved the SMP\u2019s  decisions, HR did not agree with all of them. Moreover, SMP officials told  us that the panel\u2019s deliberations were conducted in near secrecy, without  HR participation or written criteria to justify decision-making. In addition,  the information provided did not always meet the specific needs of  employees. For instance, employees stated that they were being required  to make work choices without key information, such as final mission and  position statements corresponding to the new organization.

Organizations undergoing mergers  and other organizational transformations must involve employees from the  beginning to achieve their ownership for the changes that are occurring in  the organization. This can be done in several ways. For instance, the U.S.  Citizenship and Immigration Service involves its employees through focus  groups, project teams, and meetings with union representatives.  Information gathered from focus groups will be used to create feedback  surveys. We found that State did not effectively involve employees in the  process and directed the reorganization in a top-down fashion. For  example, it excluded career officials in deciding who the acting office  directors would be. Only in response to employee concerns was a career  official appointed to the panel. In addition, according to American Foreign  Service Association (AFSA) officials, State did not effectively engage  AFSA, the union that represents FSOs.", "State did not focus on key principles and priorities from the outset of the  merger, such as adherence to sound personnel management principles.  For example, the new organization must have a clear set of core values  and priorities that serve as a framework to assist in the creation of a new  culture and to define the attributes that are intrinsically important to the  new organization. Aside from stating that the placement process would be  done fairly and in accordance with personnel laws and regulations, State\u2019s  informal implementation guide never explicitly identified a set of  principles to guide internal decision making. In addition, a senior T  bureaus official criticized the SMP for focusing on only the most basic  legal or regulatory aspects of the personnel placement process and not  adhering to sound personnel management principles. According to this  official, this included not finalizing office mission and position  descriptions and not extensively involving career and other officials, such  as ones from HR, from the beginning of the reorganization.", "State did not set implementation goals and a timeline to build momentum  and show progress from day one. At a minimum, successful mergers and  acquisitions have careful and thorough 30-, 60-, and 90-day plans in place  well before the effective implementation date, as well as a timeline for  achieving their goals. This can help an organization track its progress  toward intermediate and long-range goals, show progress, help pinpoint  performance shortfalls and gaps, and suggest midcourse corrections.  However, the SMP\u2019s informal implementation guide did not set goals or a  timeline. SMP officials said that they did not set a timeline for the  reorganization because they wanted to complete the reorganization  quickly and did not know how long it would take. In addition, State did not  craft the reorganization with reference to its larger workforce planning  goals in mind. Moreover, it did not make use of a September 2004 baseline  workforce allocation study performed by the HR bureau in anticipation of  the reorganization, which was based on data from State\u2019s Domestic  Staffing Model. According to State officials, this study was made  available to the task force formed to respond to the State IG\u2019s  recommendations, but was not provided to the SMP. As a result, p workload imbalances or staffing gaps identified in the report were not  addressed. According to SMP officials, the Undersecretary did not use dat from the staffing model because the reorganization would not add staff  positions and would eliminate positions with long-standing vacancies.", "State did not establish a coherent mission and integrated goals to guide  the transformation. This includes setting performance goals, measuring  progress, and determining strategies and resources to effectively  accomplish the goals. It also includes using performance measures to  make the programmatic decisions necessary to improve performance and  formally communicate results in performance reports. The SMP\u2019s informal  implementation guide was never formalized and did not contain a results- oriented reporting framework, including performance measures that  defined an end state with clear and measurable goals.", "State did not use its performance management system to define  responsibility and ensure accountability for change. A new organization\u2019s  performance management system should create a \u201cline of sight\u201d showing  how team, unit, and individual performance can contribute to overall  organizational results. We have identified specific measures that can be  taken to accomplish this, such as (1) aligning individual performance  expectations with organizational goals, (2) providing and routinely using  performance information to track organizational priorities, and (3) linking  pay to individual and organizational performance. While State\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 AC, NP, and VC bureau performance plans and fiscal years 2007  and 2008 VCI and ISN plans use performance ratings to track progress  toward organizational goals and objectives, the plans do not mention the  reorganization."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "State\u2019s Unsystematic Approach Contributed to Staff and Employee Group Concerns", "paragraphs": ["Instead of using the above practices to plan, implement, and assess the  results of the restructuring, State reorganized the bureaus  unsystematically, contributing to staff and employee group criticisms of  the process and suspicions that some staff decisions had been politically  motivated. State officials told us that they spent most of their time in the  months before September 2005 developing the organizational structure for  the new bureau and little time planning to implement the reorganization.  In the wake of the reorganization, some ISN staff stated they perceived  morale within their bureau to be lower.  According to State data, attrition  rates rose to levels higher than the average for State\u2019s civil service as a  whole.", "To implement the reorganization, the T human resource office furnished  an informal implementation guide to the SMP at the panel\u2019s request. This  paper envisioned a reorganization directed by the Bureau of Human  Resources and the T bureaus\u2019 human resource office, while the SMP  would serve as an advisory body that would recommend specific actions,  such as decisions on acting directors, staffing levels, and other details for  the new ISN offices. Instead, according to a senior T official, the SMP  made its own implementing decisions and reduced HR\u2019s and the T  bureaus\u2019 human resource office\u2019s roles to ensuring that State followed all  applicable legal and regulatory requirements.", "State officials and employees expressed concerns about the SMP\u2019s  direction and conduct of the reorganization even before the panel made its  first public announcement about the reorganization on September 28,  2005. While the Office of the Legal Advisor and HR stated that the SMP  could direct the reorganization, some officials in HR and the T bureaus\u2019  human resource office disagreed with this decision. According to T  bureau officials, they were concerned that the panel\u2019s members were not  sufficiently knowledgeable about change and personnel management  principles. On September 29, 2005\u2014the day after the SMP sent out its  summary of the reorganization procedures\u2014a senior T bureaus\u2019 official  with human resource responsibilities sent an e-mail to the SMP stating that  it was not following sound personnel management principles. The email  also stated that the SMP had ignored or misinterpreted her office\u2019s  recommendations, advice, and suggestions to the extent that the office had  been unable to contribute meaningfully to the reorganization process.", "Some ISN employees and AFSA officials also criticized the SMP\u2019s  decisions after it publicly announced its reorganization procedures and  named acting office directors in September 2005. Eleven ISN employees  wrote a memorandum to the Undersecretary for Management and the  Director General of the Foreign Service in October 2005, stating that  morale was poor within the new ISN bureau. Moreover, these employees  stated that the SMP\u2019s selections for acting office directors (which resulted  in passing over several experienced officials for these positions)  reinforced their doubts about the impartiality of the process, as did the  lack of career officials or representatives from the T bureaus\u2019 human  resource office, HR, and the Office of the Legal Advisor. They also  expressed concern about other aspects of the process, such as the  requirement to express workforce preferences without first having  concrete position and office mission descriptions, position grades, or the  names of permanent office directors or deputies. The employees asked the  Undersecretary for Management and the Director General of the Foreign  Service to suspend the reorganization until a comprehensive staffing plan  had been developed and add career civil service or FSOs and HR staff to  the SMP, among other actions. AFSA expressed similar concerns in a  November 2005 letter to the Secretary of State and noted that the  reorganization could result in the potential downgrade or elimination of  Foreign Service-designated positions. It also requested, among other  things, that State form an independent panel to review all proposed  reorganization decisions related to Equal Employment Opportunity  concerns and allegations of prohibited personnel practices. In response to  these concerns, State named a career official to the SMP, and included  representatives of the HR bureau and the Office of the Legal Advisor in the  SMP\u2019s discussions, and agreed to have HR review the position descriptions  of the acting office directors and prepare new position descriptions where  necessary.", "The lack of confidence in the reorganization may have adversely affected  staff morale and may have contributed to increased ISN civil service  attrition rates that immediately followed the reorganization, according to  current and former State officials and documents. Twelve percent of ISN\u2019s  full-time civil service employees retired or otherwise left the bureau in  fiscal 2006, the highest level for the bureau and its predecessors from  fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2008.

However,  concerns about this deficiency persist, in part because State has yet to  clearly delineate the roles and responsibilities of the three bureaus in the  FAM, despite having notified Congress in June 2008 that these omissions  would be rectified. In addition, the reorganization appears to have been  conducted in an unsystematic fashion with little effort to address key  transformation practices, such as involving employees from the beginning  or establishing a coherent mission and strategic goals. By not addressing  these key practices, State undermined its ability to implement an effective  and credible reorganization, achieve its stated goals, and correct  documented deficiencies. As a result, the reorganization appeared to lose  credibility among staff, may have contributed to reduced employee  morale, and created negative perceptions among staff that continue to the  present. Any future efforts to restructure State\u2019s arms control and  nonproliferation bureaucracy need to address these key transformation  practices.
