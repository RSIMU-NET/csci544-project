The economic challenges stem from dependence on a few key industries, scarce natural resources, small domestic markets, limited infrastructure, shortages of skilled labor, and reliance on federal grants to fund basic services. To help diversify and strengthen their economies, OIA sponsors conferences and missions to the areas to attract U.S. businesses; however, there has been little formal evaluation of these efforts. After fiscal year 2001, government spending in the CNMI, Guam, and USVI exceeded revenues through fiscal year 2004 (the most recent year for which there is complete data on all four areas). As a result, their fiscal conditions weakened further during this period. CNMI and USVI ended fiscal year 2004 with negative net government assets. For American Samoa the picture was mixed, with more stability than the other areas in the period 2001 through 2003, but a downturn in the balance of governmental funds by the end of fiscal year 2004. Efforts to meet formidable fiscal challenges and build strong economies are hindered by delayed and incomplete financial reporting that does not provide timely and complete information to management and oversight officials for decision making. The insular area governments have had long-standing financial accountability problems, including the late submission of required single audits, the receipt of disclaimer or qualified audit opinions, and the reporting of many serious internal control weaknesses. These problems have resulted in numerous federal agencies designating these governments as \"high-risk\" grantees. The Department of the Interior and the federal agencies are working to help these governments improve their financial accountability, but greater coordination among the agencies would increase the effectiveness of their efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. insular areas of American Samoa, Commonwealth of the  The U.S. insular areasthe Single Audit Act, as amended (Single Audit Act).", "These four insular areas are the subject of this report.

We reviewed  analyses prepared by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) of the tuna  industry in American Samoa and gathered military personnel data from  DOD. In addition, we obtained economic data from insular area officials,  such as CNMI plant closings, employment statistics, and tourism  indicators.", "We studied the fiscal condition of each of the insular area governments by  identifying and analyzing the revenues, expenditures, government fund  balances, and net assets data, as reported in their single audit reports  issued for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. We used benchmark estimates of  2002 GDP, prepared by the U.S. Census Bureau for each of the insular  areas, to calculate revenues and expenditures as a percentage of GDP.  After our work was completed, American Samoa, CNMI, and Guam issued  their single audit reports for fiscal year 2005. We did not update our  information on the insular areas\u2019 fiscal conditions because the USVI single  audit report for fiscal year 2005 had not been issued.", "We reviewed the financial accountability of the insular area governments  by (1) determining the timeliness of submission of the single audit reports,  (2) analyzing the contents of the single audit reports issued for fiscal years  2001-2004, (3) identifying those insular area governments designated as  high-risk grantees through U.S. federal agency contacts, (4) obtaining  information about OIA\u2019s efforts to help the insular areas improve financial  management, and (5) identifying the relevant auditing organizations at the  federal and local levels.

We did note that the \u201cForm Date\u201d is updated if  revised SF-FACs for that same fiscal year are subsequently filed. Our  review of the contents of the single audit reports identified the auditors\u2019  opinions on the financial statements, matters cited by the auditors in their  qualified opinions, the numbers and nature of material weaknesses and  reportable conditions reported by the auditors, and the status of corrective  actions. We interviewed OIA officials to identify their role in assisting the  insular area governments in efforts to improve financial accountability,  including training and technical assistance funded by OIA and provided by  the USDA\u2019s Graduate School.

These factors include lack of diversification, scarce  natural resources, small domestic markets, limited infrastructure, and  shortages of skilled labor. The labor markets of all four insular areas face  competition with U.S. mainland wage levels because natives from the  insular areas are free to migrate to the United States. Therefore, the  insular areas\u2019 private and public sectors face chronic difficulties retaining  well-trained and highly educated workers. Two of the insular areas,  American Samoa and CNMI, control their own immigration and have  developed industries that depend on foreign labor paid a minimum wage  below that of the United States. Although geographic isolation is  frequently mentioned as a factor restraining economic progress in the  insular areas, it does not appear to apply to CNMI, Guam, or USVI. CNMI  and Guam are well positioned to integrate with the regional economies of  East Asia; and USVI is surrounded by the Caribbean Basin countries and  the United States. On the other hand, American Samoa is more  geographically isolated, with Australia, more than 2,000 miles away, and  New Zealand, 1,600 miles away, as the closest large economies.", "Although the type of industries and extent of dependence varies, the local  economies of the insular areas rely on one or two primary industries. The  result of this dependence is economies that are vulnerable to changes in  international trade agreements, tax laws, and other external events. For  example, American Samoa\u2019s private sector is largely based on two tuna  canneries. Although these tuna canneries have been an integral part of  American Samoa\u2019s private sector for decades, they are likely to face  increased foreign competition from existing and pending trade agreements  established to advance free trade, which could have a serious negative  effect on them. Similarly, CNMI\u2019s economy is highly dependent on the  garment manufacturing industry, which is facing the challenge of  remaining internationally competitive against low-wage nations given  recent changes in trade agreements. Guam\u2019s economy depends on two  main sectors\u2014tourism and the provision of services to the U.S. military.  Guam\u2019s tourism sector is currently stable, but has been affected by several  external events, such as the terrorist attacks on the United States on  September 11, 2001, and the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)  epidemic. The stability of the sector that provides services to the U.S.  military is tied to Guam\u2019s status as a strategic U.S. military base. USVI has  a more diverse economy than American Samoa, CNMI, or Guam, with  several sources of revenue\u2014primarily tourism, petroleum refining, and  international business and financial services. However, USVI\u2019s tourist  sector, like that of CNMI and Guam, has experienced volatility due to the  terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001, and the  impact of hurricanes.

According to DOL, the two tuna canneries in the insular area employ about  one-third of the workforce, with another one-third employed by other  businesses, many of which support the tuna industry. The government  sector in American Samoa accounts for about 20 percent of the insular  area\u2019s GDP and employs around one-third of its labor force. Noncitizens  make up a large portion of the canneries\u2019 employees, about 80 percent in  2000.

However, changes scheduled to take  effect in existing free trade agreements, as well as several pending  agreements, are likely to increase competition for the tuna canneries in  American Samoa. For example, according to a DOL study, the elimination  of tuna tariffs in 2008 for Mexico under the North American Free Trade  Agreement (NAFTA) could, in concert with other factors, result in  Mexico\u2019s becoming a major exporter of canned tuna to the United States.  Likewise, the Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA), as amended in 2002,  allows the U.S. President to exempt Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru  from paying U.S. tariffs on shipments of pouched tuna, which is expected  to gain market share in the United States. According to DOL, Congress  may choose to gradually eliminate tariffs on canned tuna for these  countries in the future. In that case, Ecuador\u2014ATPA\u2019s major tuna  exporter\u2014could become, like Mexico, a significant supplier of canned  tuna to the United States. In addition, the U.S.-Thailand Free Trade  Agreement now being negotiated could further challenge the American  Samoa tuna industry if it grants Thailand\u2014the biggest exporter of tuna to  the United States\u2014the right to ship canned tuna to the United States duty  free."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Tax Law Changes", "paragraphs": ["The canneries in American Samoa have benefited from possession tax  credits under section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which is  designed to encourage U.S. corporations to invest in the U.S. insular areas  and create jobs by reducing the federal taxes on income earned by  qualifying U.S. corporations. However, the credit expired for taxable  years beginning after December 31, 2005. Although the House passed  legislation to extend the credit for American Samoa for 1 year, the  provision was removed in conference and was not included in the final  version of the bill, which was signed by the President on May 17, 2006.  According to the DOL study, the loss of the federal income tax credit will  reduce the canneries\u2019 after-tax profitability and could prompt them to  move to countries with a lower minimum wage. The economic and social  impact associated with a significant downturn in its major industry may be  severe in American Samoa because the large foreign workforce has  relatively strong roots in the insular area and, as a result, may remain in  the insular area even if unemployed.", "The CNMI economy depends on two industries, garment manufacturing  and tourism, for its employment, production, and exports. These two  industries rely heavily on a noncitizen workforce that represents more  than three quarters of the labor pool.

Garment  manufacturing and tourism account for about 85 percent of CNMI\u2019s total  economic activity and 96 percent of its exports. Recent estimates of  CNMI\u2019s GDP suggest that, in 2002, the garment industry contributed to  roughly 40 percent of CNMI\u2019s GDP and 47 percent of payroll. The rapid  growth of tourism between 1988 and 1996, with visitor arrivals rising from  over 245,000 to over 735,000, an average annual increase of 14.7 percent,  fueled economic expansion.

Historically, while other garment exports faced  quotas and duties in shipping to the U.S. market, CNMI\u2019s garment industry  benefited from quota-free and duty-free access to U.S. markets for  shipments of goods in which 50 percent of the value was added in CNMI.  Recently, however, U.S. agreements with other textile-producing countries  have liberalized the textile and apparel trade. For example, in January  2005, in accordance with one of the 1994 World Trade Organization (WTO)  Uruguay Round agreements, the United States eliminated quotas on textile  and apparel imports from other textile-producing countries, leaving  CNMI\u2019s apparel industry to operate under stiffer competition, especially  from low-wage countries such as China. With its trade advantage  lessened, CNMI\u2019s garment industry has shrunk. According to a DOI  official, more than 3,800 garment jobs were lost between April 2004 and  the end of July 2006, with 10 out of 27 garment factories closing. U.S.  Department of Commerce data show that the value of CNMI shipments of  garments to the United States dropped by more than 16 percent between  2004 and 2005, from about $807 million to $677 million, and down from a  peak of $1 billion in 1999-2000. In the first 7 months of 2006, garment  exports to the United States dropped by more than 27 percent compared  to the same period in 2005, with sales declining from $419 million to   $305 million. Given that the taxes and fees from the garment industry  account for about 35 to 40 percent of the insular area\u2019s revenues, these  developments will likely have significant financial and economic impacts,  according to OIA officials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Events", "paragraphs": ["Various external events have affected CNMI\u2019s tourism industry in recent  years. Due to CNMI\u2019s proximity to Asia, Asian economic trends have a  direct impact on CNMI\u2019s economy. For example, tourism in CNMI  experienced a sharp decline in the late 1990s with the Asian financial  crisis. According to the Marianas Visitors Authority, total visitor arrivals  dropped from a peak of 736,117 in 1996 to 501,788 in 1999. After a modest  recovery in 2000, tourism faltered again with the September 11, 2001,  terrorist attacks on the United States, bringing the number of visitors to  444,284 in 2001. In 2003, according to CNMI officials, tourism slowed\u2014 with a double-digit decline in arrivals for several months\u2014in reaction to  the SARS epidemic, which originated in Asia, and the war in Iraq. At the  same time, CNMI has experienced an influx of Chinese tourists in recent  years, with the potential to reenergize the industry. The Chinese share of  visitors increased significantly from 0.4 percent in 1997 to 6.5 percent in  2005.

Some of the new firms may just be displacing local ones  or are interested in selling products and services rather than investing;  however, others are likely to benefit the insular areas\u2019 economies by  building local capacity and increasing competition and productivity if  investments are realized. Many business deals are apparently still in the  planning stages, with companies expressing interest, holding talks, and  doing preliminary work.", "Whether and to what extent OIA\u2019s conferences and missions have  contributed to stronger economies in the insular areas is difficult to  discern because OIA does not carry out formal impact evaluations of its  conferences and missions.

But OIA would benefit from an in- depth analysis of how effective its initiatives are in attracting investment  to the islands. Further, OIA could, by learning the extent to which U.S.  firms are partnering with foreign investors already operating in the insular  areas, discover further opportunities for partnership. For example, many  Asian-owned businesses are currently contributing entrepreneurial skills  and capital: many garment factories in CNMI and one of the two canneries  in American Samoa are Asian-owned.

The auditors also reported that  account reconciliations, journal entries, and other basic transactions were  not adequately performed and summarized, a material weakness that casts  doubt on the integrity and reliability of the financial information presented  in the single audit report. Another internal control weakness reported by  the auditors was that the government records had not been maintained in  an organized manner due to a lack of formal procedures for the  maintenance and storage of records. Due to this material internal control  weakness, documentation may be misplaced, lost, or destroyed without  being detected.", "One of the internal control weaknesses that the auditors reported for  CNMI\u2019s government for fiscal year 2004 involved liabilities recorded in the  General Fund. Due to the lack of detailed subsidiary ledgers, the auditors  could not determine the propriety of these account balances, and whether  the negative balances in the accounts, as in prior years, also included  prepaid items. The recording of prepaid items as expenditures will cause  expenditures to be overstated and the related liabilities to be understated.  One of the control activities mentioned in GAO\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government is accurate and timely recording of  transactions and events. This control activity is applicable to the entire  process or life cycle of a transaction or event from the initiation and  authorization of a transaction through its final classification in summary  records. CNMI\u2019s auditors also reported as an internal control weakness, in  at least two of its single audit reports, a Commonwealth Health Center  (CHC) receivable balance that represented accounts outstanding in excess  of 120 days due to inadequate billing and collection procedures. According  to the auditors, the effect of this weakness was a possible misstatement of  CHC\u2019s receivable balances, partially mitigated by a corresponding  uncollectible account balance of the same amount. The auditors  recommended that the uncollectible accounts be written off, and that the  CHC implement procedures for processing all billings on a timely basis  and for following up on aged accounts.", "In Guam, the lack of required physical inventories of government  equipment and the lack of uniform maintenance procedures to keep  equipment in good condition were cited as material weaknesses by  auditors for fiscal years 2003 and 2004. The auditors also stated that the  government of Guam did not perform a comprehensive inventory of its  capital assets, including infrastructure. According to Guam\u2019s single audit  report for fiscal year 2004, the government was working to tag all of its  equipment with bar code property identification labels so that it would be  able to conduct a physical inventory. Another internal control weakness  was reported in the accounts payable-trade account: accounts payable that  had aged 2 or more years remained in the accounts payable listing while  more current balances were liquidated. Moreover, the auditors reported  that all nine of the general ledger liability accounts tested included invalid  accruals. The auditors attributed these problems\u2014which could result in a  potential misstatement of accounts payable\u2014to poor internal control over  the filing of supporting documentation of recorded transactions.  Unreconciled differences in the combined cash balances for some  governmental funds for fiscal year 2004 were reported by the auditors. The  auditors attributed these differences to the lack of timeliness of the  performance of bank reconciliations, which does not appear to have been  monitored\u2014the effect being a misstatement of cash balances. GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government highlights  reconciliation as a key control activity.", "Auditors for USVI reported that the reconciliations of all USVI government  bank accounts as of September 30, 2003 (fiscal 2003 year-end) were not  completed until June 2004.

USVI\u2019s auditors attributed the failure to prepare  timely bank reconciliations to a lack of established procedures.

Auditors also found weaknesses in the  government\u2019s ability to quantify and record certain key financial activity,  such as a workers\u2019 compensation claims liability, due to the lack of  complete and accurate financial data. During 2004, as in previous years,  the government experienced delays in its year-end closing process and in  the preparation of complete and accurate financial statements in  accordance with GAAP.

Material weaknesses in this context are  reportable conditions in which internal controls do not reduce to a  relatively low level the risk of noncompliance with applicable  requirements of laws, regulations, contracts, and grants that would be  material to the major federal program being audited and undetected in a  timely way by employees in the normal course of performing their duties.", "As shown in table 12, auditors reported nine material weaknesses in  compliance with requirements for major federal programs for the  American Samoa government for fiscal year 2004. One of these  weaknesses involved a receiving report that showed that an item  purchased with 2004 grant funds was not received until August 31, 2005,  the end of the 2005 grant year. The effect of this delay was that the  government received and expended from the 2004 grant, but did not  complete the transaction and receive the goods from the vendor until   1 year later. The auditors attributed this weakness to the vendor\u2019s  requirement of advance payment for this purchase and lack of follow up to  determine whether the goods that had been paid for had been delivered.  For fiscal year 2004, another reported internal control weakness in  compliance with requirements for major federal programs involved delays  in the completion of the single audit, which did not occur within 9 months  of the fiscal year end, as required by the Single Audit Act. The auditors  stated that the cause of the missed single audit due date was (1) a failure  of the accounting system and (2) the lack of trained, qualified, and  competent personnel. These two factors resulted in a delay in closing the  accounting records.", "One of the two internal control weaknesses affecting compliance with  major federal programs reported for CNMI\u2019s government for fiscal year  2004 was the failure to record expenditures for the Medical Assistance  Program when they were incurred. In one instance, the auditor identified  expenditures for billings from service providers for services rendered in  previous years. The auditors attributed this weakness to the lack of  policies and procedures regarding the timely recognition of expenditures  at the time services are rendered. The effect of this weakness is that  expenditures reported to the grantor agency, the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), are based on the paid date and not, as  required, the service date. In addition, actual expenditures incurred during  the year are not properly accrued and therefore, current year expenditures  and unrecorded liabilities are understated. The other internal control  weakness related to the lack of adherence to established policies and  procedures regarding physical inventory counts of property and  equipment and the lack of reconciliation between the Division of  Procurement and Supply\u2019s (P&S) master listing and the listings of several  CNMI divisions and offices. For example, CNMI\u2019s Emergency Management  Office (EMO) provided a list of equipment acquired with Office of  Domestic Preparedness grants, but the listing did not include the serial  number or other identification of the equipment or its condition.  Moreover, a physical inventory was not conducted in the past 2 years by  either the EMO or P&S.

For two additional transactions, Guam\u2019s Chief Procurement Officer  determined that the lease of space from a vendor was an unauthorized  procurement because the lease agreement had expired. The method of  procurement, selection of contract type, contractor selection or rejection,  and the basis for the contract price are to be included in the procurement  records, according to applicable procurement requirements. The auditor  attributed this weakness to a lack of internal control over compliance with  applicable procurement requirements. Noncompliance with applicable  procurement requirements was also noted for transactions related to U.S.  Environmental Protection Agency and HHS grants. The auditors also  reported that the government of Guam may have been noncompliant with  earmarking requirements associated with an HHS block grant for maternal  and child health services. According to federal law, 30 percent of the total  grant payments must be used for preventive and primary care services for  children, 30 percent must be used for services for children with special  health care needs, and not more than 10 percent of the allotted funds can  be used by a grantee for administrative expenses. The government of  Guam did not provide the auditors with documents that demonstrated  compliance with these requirements for its 2004 Maternal and Child Health  Services Block Grant.

In one instance, auditors found that financial reports prepared by  the USVI Department of Health for the Women, Infants, and Children  (WIC) Program did not reconcile with the USVI government\u2019s financial  management system (FMS). The auditors identified the cause of this  weakness to be due to current procedures, which do not require a  reconciliation of WIC Program records with the FMS. This lack of  reconciliation could result in incorrectly posted transactions going  undetected and uncorrected and therefore also incorrect financial  information being reported to USDA. The lack of reconciliation between  the government\u2019s records and its FMS was also noted as a weakness  related to a DOL grant for unemployment insurance. In its fiscal year 2004  single audit report, the auditors noted that the USVI Department of  Education did not fully comply with 12 of the 18 requirements for the  second year of the compliance agreement with the U.S. Department of  Education. For example, the auditors reported that the inventory  management system, which was to be fully implemented by December 31,  2004, was not implemented by that date.

Moreover, HUD officials discovered that VIHA was  improperly funding a Virgin Islands government nursing home for elderly  residents in one of its public housing developments. VIHA was also cited  for providing rent rebates of $3 million annually to public housing  residents in violation of HUD regulations. In its audits of VIHA\u2019s fiscal year  2001 and 2002 single audits, the independent public auditor found that  VIHA had serious deficiencies in financial reporting, financial analysis, and  financial management systems. For example, the auditor noted that VIHA  maintained incompatible accounting systems that precluded effective  recording and reporting processes. Therefore, VIHA\u2019s accounting records  did not reflect an accurate or complete accounting of the financial position  and, in addition, VIHA was unable to track and identify expenditures of  federal funds. According to HUD officials, serious fiscal irregularities and  ineffective VIHA Board leadership, factors such as VIHA staff with  insufficient skills, VIHA\u2019s inability to adequately manage programs, and its  failure to improve and correct other operational problems, all pointed to a  breakdown in the management of VIHA.", "On August 1, 2003, HUD notified VIHA that it was in substantial default of  Section 15 under the Annual Contributions Contract (ACC) for failure to  produce reliable financial statements. Violations of Section 15 (A) of the  ACC were based on the numerous deficiencies noted in the authority\u2019s  books and records identified by VIHA\u2019s independent auditors and late  submission of financial reports.

The  information to be collected in this broader framework would include the  status of required single audit reports, the progress of actions to resolve  reported internal control weaknesses, and current needs for technical  assistance, capacity building, and staff level expertise. This information  should also be integrated into a comprehensive monitoring process.", "DOI officials also agreed with our recommendation that OIA develop and  implement procedures for formal evaluations of progress made by the  insular areas to resolve accountability findings and set a time frame for  achieving clean audit opinions. In its comments, DOI officials noted that it  has a formal process for monitoring and tracking the insular areas\u2019  resolution of audit findings in place. DOI officials also indicated that they  will consider establishing a timetable for achieving unqualified (\u201cclean\u201d)  audit opinions after the insular areas have had sufficient time to fully  implement corrective actions to resolve material findings identified in the  fiscal year 2004 and 2005 single audits. While these actions directed at  improved monitoring and resolution of audit findings are a step in the right  direction, they do not specifically address the broader accountability  issues highlighted in our draft report. In this regard, the inability of the  insular areas to achieve unqualified audit opinions over a number of years  indicates the need for more attention and formal evaluation of progress  toward to resolving accountability problems as called for by our  recommendation in this area.", "In addition to providing copies of this report to your office, we will send  copies of this report to other appropriate committees.
