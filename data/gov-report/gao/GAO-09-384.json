While screening and early detection through mammograms and Pap tests--followed by treatment--can improve survival, low-income, uninsured women are often not screened. In 1990, Congress authorized the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to fund screening and diagnostic services for such women, which led CDC to establish the National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program. The Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act of 2000 was also enacted to allow states to extend Medicaid eligibility to women screened under the Early Detection Program and who need breast or cervical cancer treatment. Screened under the program is defined, at a minimum, as screening paid for with CDC funds. GAO examined the Early Detection Program's screening of eligible women, states' implementation of the Treatment Act, Medicaid enrollment and spending under the Treatment Act, and alternatives available to women ineligible for Medicaid under the Treatment Act. To do this, GAO compared CDC data on women screened by the Early Detection Program from 2002 to 2006 with federal estimates of the eligible population, surveyed program directors on the 51 states' (including the District of Columbia) implementation of the Treatment Act, analyzed Medicaid enrollment and spending data, and conducted case studies in selected states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The CDC's Early Detection Program providers screen more than half a million low-income, uninsured women a year for breast and cervical cancer, but many eligible women are screened by other providers or not screened at all. Comparing CDC screening data with federal estimates of low-income, uninsured women, GAO estimated that from 2005 through 2006, 15 percent of eligible women received a mammogram from the Early Detection Program, while 26 percent were screened by other providers and 60 percent were not screened. For Pap tests, GAO estimated that from 2004 through 2006, 9 percent were screened by the program, 59 percent by other providers, and 33 percent were not screened. Most states extend Medicaid eligibility under the Treatment Act to more women than is minimally required. As of October 2008, 17 states met the minimum requirement to offer Medicaid eligibility to women whose screening or diagnostic services were paid for with CDC funds; 15 extended eligibility to women screened or diagnosed by a CDC-funded provider, whether CDC funds paid specifically for these services or not; and 19 states further extended eligibility to women who were screened or diagnosed by a non-CDC-funded provider. In most of the states that offer Medicaid eligibility only to women served with CDC funds or by a CDC-funded provider, if a woman is screened and diagnosed with cancer outside the Early Detection Program, she cannot access Medicaid coverage under the Treatment Act. Medicaid enrollment and average spending under the Treatment Act vary across states. In 2006, state enrollment ranged from fewer than 100 women to more than 9,300. Median enrollment was 395 among the 39 states reporting data, with most experiencing enrollment growth from 2004 to 2006. Among the 39 states, average monthly spending per enrollee was $1,067, ranging from $584 to $2,304. Spending may vary due to several factors, including differences in state eligibility policies and practices and Medicaid benefit plan design. Few statewide alternatives to Medicaid coverage are available to low-income, uninsured women who need breast or cervical cancer treatment but are ineligible for Medicaid under the Treatment Act. Early Detection Program directors in only four of the states with more limited eligibility standards reported having a statewide program that pays for cancer treatment or provides broader health insurance or free or reduced-fee care. And while several sources identified possible local resources as alternatives--donated care, funding from local charity organizations, and county assistance--the availability and applicability of these resources varies by area. For example, an Early Detection Program official in Indiana told us that densely populated areas of the state had multiple treatment resources, but women living in rural areas had limited access to them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2008, an estimated 182,000 women were diagnosed with breast cancer  and 40,000 women died from the disease.

Screening and early detection through mammography and Pap tests to  detect breast and cervical cancer\u2014followed by treatment\u2014can improve  survival. But among low-income, uninsured women, such screening is  underused and access to treatment is sometimes difficult. To improve  access to screening, in 1990 Congress authorized the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) to make grants to states for breast and  cervical cancer screening services, which led the CDC to establish the  National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (the Early  Detection Program).", "Subsequently, the Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment  Act of 2000 (the Treatment Act) was enacted, which allowed states to offer  Medicaid coverage to uninsured women under the age of 65 who were  screened under the Early Detection Program and who need treatment for  breast or cervical cancer. The CDC and the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicaid program, define  what it means to be screened under the Early Detection Program. States  electing to provide Medicaid coverage under the Treatment Act must, at a  minimum, offer eligibility to women who received screening services paid  for, at least in part, with CDC funds. But states have additional flexibility.  For example, a state may extend eligibility to women screened by  providers such as community health centers or family planning clinics,  regardless of whether the providers receive CDC funds.", "Because of concerns that low-income, uninsured women living in certain  states may still have difficulty accessing and paying for treatment services,  you asked us to report on the impact of the Early Detection Program and  the implementation of the Treatment Act. In this report, we examine   (1) how many eligible women have been screened by the Early Detection  Program; (2) how states have implemented the Treatment Act; (3) how  many women have enrolled in Medicaid under the Treatment Act and the  average spending by state for this coverage; and (4) alternatives available  to low-income, uninsured women who need treatment for breast or  cervical cancer, but are not covered under the Treatment Act.", "To determine how many eligible women have been screened by the Early  Detection Program, we analyzed information from the CDC\u2019s Minimum  Data Elements (MDE) on the number of women screened by the program  from 2002 through 2006. We then compared this information with  estimates from the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) on the  number of low-income, uninsured women who would likely be eligible for  screening by the Early Detection Program, and with the overall number of  women who received a mammogram or a Pap test within the  recommended screening interval (2 years for a mammogram, 3 years for a  Pap test).", "To determine how states have implemented the Treatment Act, we  conducted a Web-based survey of Early Detection Program directors in  the 51 states. We determined that the Early Detection Program directors  were knowledgeable about their states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility policies and  practices regarding the Treatment Act based on preliminary interviews  and discussions with the CDC.", "To determine how many women have enrolled in Medicaid under the  Treatment Act, we analyzed data from CMS\u2019s Medicaid Statistical  Information System (MSIS). Data on Treatment Act enrollment were not  available for all states and all years. Data are presented for 2004 (38 states)  and 2006 (39 states).

For a more in-depth  understanding of these alternatives, we conducted case studies of three  states: Florida, Indiana, and Virginia. These states were selected because  they are among the states that do not extend Medicaid eligibility under the  Treatment Act beyond the minimum, women whose screening services  were paid for with CDC funds. These states also have low rates of low- income, uninsured women screened for breast and cervical cancer by the  Early Detection Program when compared to the national average. In each  state, we interviewed Early Detection Program directors and other  officials, representatives of cancer advocacy groups such the American  Cancer Society and Susan G.

The program   funds breast and cervical cancer screening services for women who are  uninsured or underinsured, have an income equal to or less than   250 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL), and are aged 40 through 64  for breast cancer screenings or aged 18 through 64 for cervical cancer  screenings. Within these eligibility criteria, CDC prioritizes certain groups  for screening and individual program grantees may target certain groups  or broaden eligibility. Breast cancer screening consists of clinical breast  exams and mammograms. Cervical cancer screening consists of pelvic  exams and the Pap test. While screening services represent the core of  the Early Detection Program, program providers must also provide  diagnostic testing and follow-up services for women whose screening tests  are abnormal. The CDC funds cannot be used to pay for treatment;  however, for women diagnosed with breast or cervical cancer, program  providers must provide referrals for appropriate treatment services and  case management services, if determined necessary.", "The Early Detection Program, which was reauthorized by Congress in  2007, is funded through annual appropriations to the CDC. According to  CDC officials, in fiscal year 2008, total funding for the program was  approximately $182 million. To implement the program, the CDC solicits  applications to select Early Detection Program grantees every 5 years. All  grantees must submit an annual request for funding to CDC. According to  CDC officials, annual budgets are awarded based on performance and  other factors. By law, grantees must match every $3 in federal contribution  with at least $1 in non-federal contribution. Grantee matching funds may  support the screening or non-screening components of the program. At  least 60 percent of the awarded funds must be used for direct clinical  services; the remainder may be used for other program functions  including program management, education, outreach, quality assurance,  surveillance, data management, and evaluation. Some grantees have also  acquired additional state or local resources for their programs. Early  Detection Program grantees typically have a network of local providers  such as community health centers and private providers that deliver the  screening and diagnostic services to women.", "Under the Treatment Act states may extend Medicaid eligibility to women  who are under age 65, uninsured, otherwise not eligible for Medicaid, and  who have been (1) screened under the CDC-funded Early Detection  Program and (2) found to be in need of treatment for breast or cervical  cancer including precancerous conditions. All 51 states chose to  implement this optional Medicaid eligibility category. In doing so they  were required to provide full Medicaid coverage to eligible women  screened under the Early Detection Program and found in need of  treatment for breast or cervical cancer. States must provide Medicaid  coverage for the period when the woman needs treatment for breast or  cervical cancer. In guidance provided to states, CMS and CDC define  \u201cscreened under the program\u201d as, at a minimum, offering Medicaid  eligibility to women whose clinical services under the Early Detection  Program were provided all or in part with CDC funds. Accordingly, CDC  officials stated that any state offering Medicaid coverage under the  Treatment Act would be required, at a minimum, to offer coverage to  women screened with CDC funds, provided the women met all other  eligibility requirements. The guidance also allows states to use a broader  definition of \u201cscreened under the program,\u201d which includes extending  Medicaid eligibility to (1) women screened by a CDC-funded provider  within the scope of the state\u2019s Early Detection Program, even if CDC funds  did not pay for the particular service, or (2) women screened by a non\u2013 CDC-funded provider whom the state has elected to include as part of its  Early Detection Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC\u2019s Early Detection Program Screens More Than Half a Million Women Annually, but Many Eligible Women Are Not Screened", "paragraphs": ["The CDC\u2019s Early Detection Program screened about half a million or more  women for breast and cervical cancer annually from 2002 through 2006.

There  were 350,202 women screened with a Pap test and 5,110 cervical cancers  and precursor lesions detected. Almost half of all women screened by the  Early Detection Program in 2006 were screened by grantees in 10 states.  (See app. II for information by grantee.) A number of factors determined  how many women were screened by a grantee, including the CDC funding  awarded, the availability of other resources, and clinical costs (for  example, the use of more costly screening technologies such as digital  mammography).", "Over the 5-year period from 2002 through 2006, the Early Detection  Program screened 1.8 million low-income, uninsured women. About   1.1 million women were screened for breast cancer, and 18,937 breast  cancers were detected. Similarly, about 1.1 million women were screened  for cervical cancer, and 22,377 cervical cancers and precursor lesions  were detected. The age and race of women screened reflect the Early  Detection Program\u2019s policies that prioritize breast cancer screening for  women 50 to 64 years old and cervical cancer screening for women 40 to  64 years old. Thus, women who received a mammogram tended to be  older, with 71 percent age 50 or older. Women who received a Pap test  tended to be younger, with 55 percent under age 50. (See fig. 1.)

However,  Early Detection Program directors in 6 of these states reported that  women diagnosed outside the program can be rescreened under the  program to qualify for Medicaid, and in 11 states women can qualify for  Medicaid by receiving additional diagnostic services from a program  provider. Although rescreening or providing additional diagnostic services  is inefficient and may be medically unnecessary, program rules in some  states require a woman to have received at least one CDC-funded service  to qualify for Medicaid. Whether a woman can access Medicaid through  one of these alternate pathways depends on her obtaining a referral and  on the availability of funds and providers to deliver the additional  screening and diagnostic services.", "In implementing the Treatment Act, most states reported they require a  confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer, cervical cancer, or precancerous  lesions to meet the requirement that women be in need of cancer  treatment services. Two states, Missouri and New Hampshire, indicated  that a woman may be enrolled in Medicaid in order to receive certain  diagnostic procedures, such as a biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging. A  third state, Oklahoma, indicated that an abnormal screening test alone met  the standard of needing treatment and qualified a woman for Medicaid  coverage.

In general, states with the  highest enrollment and highest enrollment as a share of population  adopted the broadest definition of \u201cscreened under the program\u201d by  extending Medicaid eligibility to women served by non-CDC funded  providers. In 2006, median enrollment was 639 in these states, or an  average of 124 enrollees per 100,000 women 40 to 64 years old. In contrast,  median enrollment was 265 in states that limit eligibility to women served  with CDC funds or by a CDC-funded provider. In these states an average of  44 women were enrolled for every 100,000 women 40 to 64 years old.", "Medicaid enrollment of women covered under the Treatment Act has  grown in most states.

Among states that  initially applied the minimum definition of screened under the program,  but later broadened eligibility to include women screened by non-CDC- funded providers, enrollment growth averaged 67 percent from 2004 to  2006. For example, in 2004 South Carolina limited Medicaid eligibility to  women served with CDC funds, but in July 2005 it extended coverage to  women served by any qualified provider in the state. Its enrollment grew  from 162 women in 2004 to 614 women in 2006.", "Enrollment in Medicaid under the Treatment Act can also be affected by  state policies and practices for periodic redetermination of Medicaid  eligibility. Practices for redetermining eligibility can range from a  statement by the beneficiary that she continues to need treatment to a  verbal or signed statement by the health provider of the beneficiary\u2019s  treatment status. For example, in West Virginia, Medicaid enrollment  declined from 709 in 2004 to 247 in 2006 after the state imposed stricter  redetermination requirements in 2004.", "As with enrollment, average per capita Medicaid spending under the  Treatment Act also varies widely across states (see fig. 6). Among the 39  states reporting Medicaid enrollment and spending data for 2006, total  monthly spending per Treatment Act enrollee averaged $1,067, ranging  from $584 in Oklahoma to $2,304 in Colorado.

In 2006, these percentages, for  expenditures for women enrolled in Medicaid under the Treatment Act, ranged from   65 percent to 83 percent.", "Some of the variation in average total spending per Treatment Act enrollee  may be accounted for by differences in state Medicaid reimbursement  rates and variation in states\u2019 Medicaid benefit packages. It may also be  affected by the relative proportion of breast and cervical cancer patients.  For example, a 2007 study using state Medicaid claims data from 2003 in  Georgia found that spending for breast cancer patients averaged more  than twice that for cervical cancer patients. In 2003, annual Medicaid  spending was $20,285 for each woman with breast cancer, but $9,845 for  each woman with cervical cancer.", "State eligibility policies and practices can also affect average spending.  For example, Oklahoma, the state with the lowest monthly per person  spending under the Treatment Act, enrolls women in Medicaid based on  the results of an abnormal screening test alone. Thus, according to an  Oklahoma official, many women in Oklahoma are enrolled in Medicaid  only for diagnostic services and do not subsequently incur costs for cancer  treatment. At $584 per month in 2006, average Medicaid spending per  Treatment Act enrollee in Oklahoma is the lowest of the 39 states for  which we have data. West Virginia has reduced its overall enrollment from  709 in 2004 to 247 in 2006 by taking a proactive approach to disenrolling  women if they have completed their cancer treatment, and cannot  otherwise qualify for Medicaid. The state requires more than just a  woman\u2019s self-certification of her continued need for treatment; case  managers actively follow women receiving treatment, and a registered  nurse evaluation is required to certify their continued need for treatment  and Medicaid eligibility.

We analyzed MDE data for calendar years 2002 through 2006,  including information in total and by grantee on the number of women  screened by the Early Detection Program\u2014those who had mammograms  and Pap tests\u2014and the number of breast cancers and cervical cancers or  precursor lesions detected. We also analyzed the age, race, and ethnicity  distributions of the women screened. The Early Detection Program has  policies and procedures for standardizing and assessing the quality of the  MDE data submitted by grantees. We found the data to be sufficiently  reliable for our purposes by reviewing these policies and procedures and  the results of an MDE data validation study.", "We then compared the number of women screened by the Early Detection  Program to the number of women potentially eligible for screening, which  we determined with data collected from the Medical Expenditure Panel  Survey (MEPS), administered by the Agency for Healthcare Research and  Quality. For our analysis of women receiving mammograms, we pooled  MEPS data for 2005 and 2006 because the U.S. Preventive Services Task  Force recommends that women receive a mammogram every 1 to 2 years.  We identified how many women were 40 to 64 years old\u2014the age group  generally eligible for a mammogram by the Early Detection Program\u2014as  well as low income and uninsured. We defined low income as at or below  250 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) because federal guidelines  allow the Early Detection Program to pay for services to women whose  income is at or below this level. According to MEPS, women are  considered uninsured if they indicated for each of the 12 months of the  year that they were not covered under any type of health insurance for the  entire month. Although underinsured women are eligible for screenings  provided by the Early Detection Program, we were not able to identify this  population in MEPS. Next, we determined how many of these potentially  eligible low-income, uninsured women 40 to 64 years old received a  mammogram in 2005 to 2006. We then compared this number with the  number of women that the Early Detection Program screened with a  mammogram in 2005 to 2006.", "For our analysis of women receiving Pap tests, we pooled MEPS data for  2004, 2005, and 2006 because the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force  recommends that women receive a Pap test at least every 3 years. We  identified how many women were 18 to 64 years old\u2014the age group  generally eligible for a Pap test by the Early Detection Program\u2014as well  as low-income and uninsured, using the above criteria. We determined  how many women meeting these criteria received a Pap test in 2004 to  2006. We compared this number with the number of women that the Early  Detection Program screened with a Pap test in 2004 to 2006. In our  analyses of women receiving mammograms and Pap tests, we did not  examine why women did not receive either of these screening tests,  because it was beyond the scope of this report.", "We determined that the MEPS data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes by speaking with knowledgeable agency officials at the Agency  for Healthcare Research and Quality, reviewing related documentation,  and comparing our results with CDC and U.S. Census data.", "To determine how states have implemented the Treatment Act, we  conducted a Web-based survey of Early Detection Program directors in  the 51 states. We reviewed federal guidelines for implementing the  Treatment Act, and interviewed Early Detection Program directors and  other officials in selected states to gather information to design the survey  questions. We reviewed previous studies of the Treatment Act conducted  by George Washington University in 2004 under contract with the CDC and  by Susan G. Komen for the Cure (Komen for the Cure) in 2007. We  determined that the Early Detection Program directors were  knowledgeable about their states\u2019 Medicaid eligibility policies and  practices for the Treatment Act based on this review and discussions with  CDC and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) officials.", "The survey included both closed-ended and open-ended questions on  characteristics of the Early Detection Program, implementation of the  Treatment Act, Medicaid eligibility criteria, and the Medicaid enrollment  process. We pretested the survey at CDC\u2019s national meeting of Early  Detection Program directors in Atlanta, Georgia, on September 9, 2008.  The survey was fielded during October 2008, and we obtained a   100 percent response rate from all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  Survey responses were edited for logic and appropriate skip patterns. We  reviewed survey responses for outliers and followed up with officials in  selected states to verify the accuracy of responses.", "To determine the number of women enrolled in state Medicaid programs  under the Treatment Act and average state spending for this coverage, we  analyzed enrollment and spending data from CMS\u2019s Medicaid Statistical  Information System (MSIS) as presented in the MSIS State Summary  Datamart. The MSIS contains state-submitted Medicaid enrollment and  claims data, including each person\u2019s basis of eligibility, use of services,  basic demographic characteristics, and payments made to providers. We  used MSIS data on the number of women enrolled in Medicaid with the  Treatment Act as their basis of eligibility by state for fiscal years 2004 and  2006. We then calculated the average per person monthly spending by  state for fiscal year 2006 using MSIS data on total spending for Medicaid  enrollees under the Treatment Act and the total number of months of  eligibility accounted for by all enrollees during the year. Our analysis was  limited to 38 states for 2004 and 39 states for 2006 because MSIS data on  enrollment and spending were not available for all states or for all years.  According to CMS, data from the remaining states either were not reported  separately for Treatment Act eligibility or had not yet passed CMS\u2019s data  quality control process. In addition, we could not separately determine  both the number of women enrolled in Medicaid and Medicaid costs for  women by diagnosis (breast cancer, cervical cancer, or precancerous  conditions) because enrollment data reported in the MSIS State Summary  Datamart are not broken down by diagnostic category.", "We worked with CMS officials to establish the reliability of the data used  in our analysis. States submit their MSIS data quarterly to CMS. The data  are submitted to a system of quality control edit checks. Data files that  exceed prescribed error tolerance limits are rejected and must be  resubmitted by states until they are determined acceptable by CMS.  Following the quality review process, data are then posted to CMS\u2019s public  Web site. We also reviewed MSIS documentation including user manuals,  design specifications, a data dictionary, and known MSIS data anomalies.  We also interviewed knowledgeable CMS officials and followed up with  states whose reported enrollment and per capita spending data appeared  as outliers when we arrayed the data for all states. We determined that the  data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes based on our review.", "To identify alternatives available to low-income, uninsured women who  need treatment for breast or cervical cancer, but who are not covered  under the Treatment Act, we obtained general information from our Web- based survey of Early Detection Program directors (described above). We  targeted the relevant survey questions to states that limited Medicaid  eligibility under the Treatment Act to women screened or diagnosed with  CDC funds or that extend Medicaid eligibility to women screened by a  CDC-funded provider. Our findings were limited by responses to a  narrowly-worded survey question on statewide programs for breast and  cervical cancer diagnosis and treatment and may not necessarily account  for all available statewide or state-funded programs.", "We also conducted case studies of three states that limited Medicaid  eligibility under the Treatment Act to women screened or diagnosed with  CDC funds only: Florida, Indiana, and Virginia. We chose these states  because their rate of screening eligible women was lower than the national  average. In each state, we interviewed: Early Detection Program directors  and other officials; representatives from Komen for the Cure, American  Cancer Society local chapters, and other state or local organizations; and  health care providers. We developed a protocol for each interview with  semistructured interview questions and obtained detailed examples of  available alternatives to Medicaid under the Treatment Act. Our findings  are illustrative examples and thus are not generalizable, because the  officials we surveyed and interviewed may not have had complete  knowledge of all available local resources, and because available  resources may vary by state.", "We conducted our work from May 2008 to May 2009 in accordance with all  sections of GAO\u2019s Quality Assurance Framework that are relevant to our  objectives. The framework requires that we plan and perform the  engagement to obtain sufficient and appropriate evidence to meet our  stated objectives and to discuss any limitations in our work. We believe  that the information and data obtained, and the analysis conducted,  provide a reasonable basis for any findings and conclusions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Number of Women Screened by National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program Grantees, 2002\u20132006", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Women screened", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Medicaid Breast and Cervical Cancer Prevention and Treatment Act Enrollment and Spending, 2006", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Jennifer Grover, Assistant  Director; Anne Dievler; Eric Anderson; Seta Hovagimian; Dan Ries; Hemi  Tewarson; Timothy J.
