To encourage cloud service acquisition, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) began requiring agencies to assess all information technology (IT) investments for cloud services. However, only 10 of the 16 agencies reviewed had established assessment guidance. In addition, while the agencies assessed the majority of their planned fiscal year 2019 IT investments for cloud services, 12 agencies had not completed an assessment of 10 or more investments. Nevertheless, 10 of the agencies reported increasing their use of cloud services between fiscal years 2016 through 2019 (see figure). Six agencies noted that inconsistent reporting of cloud investments and investment consolidation impacted their reported percentage.", "Further, the 16 agencies reported that they had increased their cloud service spending since 2015 and 13 of the 16 agencies had saved $291 million to date from these services. However, these agencies identified issues in tracking and reporting cloud spending and savings data, including not having consistent processes in place to do so. Agencies also noted that OMB guidance did not require them to explicitly report savings from cloud implementations and, therefore, they had to specifically collect this data to meet GAO's request. As a result of these identified issues, it is likely that agency-reported cloud spending and savings figures were underreported.", "Officials from 15 of the 16 agencies reported that they had identified significant benefits from acquiring cloud services, including improved customer service and the acquisition of more cost-effective options for managing IT services. In addition, these agencies identified nine cloud investments that, among other things, enhanced the availability of weather-related information, facilitated collaboration and information sharing among federal, state, and local agencies related to homeland security, and provided benefits information to veterans, as examples of systems that realized these benefits. One agency reported that it had not realized benefits because it did not have any completed migration efforts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making one recommendation to OMB on cloud savings reporting, and 34 recommendations to the 16 agencies on cloud assessments and savings.

Furthermore, while federal agencies\u2019 IT use provides essential services  affecting the health, economy, and defense of the nation, this use has  also led to a reliance on custom IT systems that can be costly to maintain.  Accordingly, as a result of these costs, the federal government invests  approximately $90 billion annually in IT.", "As part of a comprehensive effort to transform IT within the federal  government, in 2010, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  began requiring agencies to shift their IT services to a cloud computing  option when feasible. As defined by the National Institute of Standards  and Technology (NIST), cloud computing is a means for enabling on- demand access to shared pools of configurable computing resources  (e.g., networks, servers, storage applications, and services) that can be  rapidly provisioned and released. This approach offers federal agencies a  means to buy services more quickly and possibly at a lower cost than  building, operating, and maintaining these computing resources  themselves.", "To encourage federal agencies to begin taking advantage of cloud  computing services (cloud services), in February 2011, OMB issued a  Cloud First policy that required each agency\u2019s chief information officer  (CIO) to implement a cloud service whenever there was a secure,  reliable, cost-effective option. Since 2012, we have issued several  reports on agencies\u2019 use of cloud services, as detailed later in this report.", "You asked us to conduct a further review of agencies\u2019 reported use of  cloud services. Specifically, our objectives were to: (1) evaluate selected  agencies\u2019 progress in implementing cloud services, (2) review the extent  to which selected agencies have increased spending on cloud services  and achieved cost savings or avoidances, and (3) describe examples of  cloud investments with significant or notable benefits that have been  identified by selected agencies.", "To address these objectives, we selected a sample of agencies based on  the size of their total IT budget for fiscal year 2017. Specifically, we  categorized each of the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act agencies by the  size of its IT budget: large (more than $3 billion), medium ($1 billion to $3  billion), and small (less than $1 billion), as reported on OMB\u2019s IT  Dashboard for 2017. We then selected up to six agencies with the  largest budgets from each budget category.", "Using these criteria, we selected 16 agencies, including 7 agencies from  our prior work on cloud services conducted in 2012 and 2014. These  agencies were the Department of Agriculture (Agriculture), Department of  Commerce (Commerce), Department of Defense (Defense), Department  of Education (Education), Department of Energy (Energy), Department of  Health and Human Services (HHS), Department of Homeland Security  (DHS), Department of Justice (Justice), Department of Labor (Labor),  Department of State (State), Department of Transportation  (Transportation), Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Department of  Veterans Affairs (VA), General Services Administration (GSA), Small  Business Administration (SBA), and Social Security Administration (SSA).", "For our first objective, we obtained and analyzed IT Dashboard data  related to the 16 selected agencies\u2019 use of cloud services for fiscal years  2016 through 2018 and projected use in 2019. We chose to begin with  fiscal year 2016 because we had previously reported on federal agencies\u2019  use of cloud services through fiscal year 2014 and fiscal year 2015 data  was not available. We reviewed agency responses that were submitted  for fiscal years 2016 through 2019 as part of the annual budget  submission process in order to determine whether a specific investment  was using cloud services.", "To ensure the accuracy and completeness of the selected agencies\u2019 data  on the use of cloud services, we downloaded data from the IT Dashboard  on October 3, 2017, March 7, 2018, and October 9, 2018. We took this  step because agencies may update their data on a quarterly basis  throughout the fiscal year. In addition, we presented the results of our  analysis to officials in charge of cloud services within the Office of the CIO  at each selected agency. We asked these officials to verify the  completeness and accuracy of this data and provide any updates as  appropriate. Officials at all 16 agencies confirmed the total number of  investments using cloud services for fiscal years 2016 through 2018 and  their projected use for fiscal year 2019. Based on these steps, we  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to report on agencies\u2019  progress in using cloud services.", "In addition, we compared each selected agency\u2019s cloud guidance to  OMB\u2019s Cloud First guidance and interviewed officials in charge of cloud  services within the Office of the CIO at each agency regarding their cloud  data and guidance. We also interviewed OMB staff in the Office of E- Government and Information Technology regarding its guidance.", "For our second objective, we obtained and analyzed IT Dashboard data  related to the 16 agencies\u2019 spending on cloud services for fiscal years  2015 through 2018. We chose to begin with fiscal year 2015 because we  had previously reported on federal agencies\u2019 spending on cloud services  through fiscal year 2014. In order to determine actual cloud spending  costs for each fiscal year, we used agency spending data reported each  subsequent fiscal year (from fiscal years 2017 through 2018), as of  October 5, 2018.", "We also administered a data collection instrument to obtain and analyze  spending and savings by the 16 selected agencies for fiscal years 2014  through 2018, as well as future planned costs. We requested that these  agencies provide spending and savings data broken down by investment,  as OMB only requires federal agencies to report total spending by cloud  deployment model on the IT Dashboard, and agencies were not required  to identify whether any reported savings were cloud-related.", "We took steps to help ensure the reliability of the data we collected. First,  to minimize errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our  instrument differently from our intended purpose, we reviewed the data  collection instrument with agency officials who would be completing the  instrument during meetings in October and November 2017. Second, we  reviewed the completed spreadsheets to identify missing data or other  errors, and consulted with a GAO data quality expert about these issues  as appropriate. We also reviewed the associated notes regarding  agencies\u2019 qualifications of the provided data and followed up with agency  officials to clarify the responses as appropriate.", "Lastly, we presented the results of our analysis of IT Dashboard data and  the data obtained from the data collection instrument to each of the  selected agencies between June and August 2018. We asked the  agencies to verify the completeness and accuracy of these data and  provide any updates as appropriate. Each of the selected agencies  provided updated information related to our data collection instrument,  which we incorporated as appropriate. Based on the measures we took to  ensure the reliability of the data reported by the agencies to us and on the  IT Dashboard, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  the purpose of this report.", "For the third objective, we obtained and reviewed available  documentation discussing examples of cloud computing investments  identified by the selected agencies as having produced significant or  notable benefits and key practices that helped ensure the effort was  successful, and interviewed officials from the Office of CIO or other  components in charge of cloud services regarding these benefits. As part  of this work, we asked officials within the Office of the CIO at each  selected agency to identify up to three examples of investments that  benefited from the acquisition of cloud services.", "Fifteen of the sixteen agencies in our review identified at least one  example, while one agency\u2014HHS\u2014reported that it did not have any  examples of cloud investments that had produced significant or notable  benefits because it did not have any completed migration efforts.  Because of the open-ended nature of the 15 agencies\u2019 responses to our  questions, we conducted a content analysis of the information we  received in order to identify and summarize the benefits and key practices  that were identified by the 15 agencies. In addition, to select systems or  investments to profile, we reviewed the 34 examples provided by the 15  agencies and narrowed the list to 11 examples. In doing so, we sought to  have a mix of systems that provided mission critical services to the  agency or the public, illustrated a range of cloud computing benefits, and  included detailed information on the benefits achieved from using cloud  services.", "In technical comments received on a draft of this report, two agencies  provided new information regarding the use of cloud services for their  systems that were profiled in appendix VI of the draft report. Based on the  additional information provided by the two agencies, we determined there  was no longer sufficient detail regarding what benefits were realized for  these systems. Therefore, we removed the two agencies\u2019 profiled  examples from the report in order to be consistent with our methodology  for reporting examples of systems that had realized benefits from the  acquisition of cloud services. We then notified both agencies of this  decision. Further details on our objectives, scope, and methodology are  included in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to April 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

As a result, the federal government has spent  billions of dollars on failed and poorly performing IT investments. These  investments have often suffered from ineffective management of project  planning, requirements definition, and program oversight and governance  tasks.", "Accordingly, in February 2015, we added improving the management of  IT acquisitions and operations to our high-risk list\u2014a list of agencies and  program areas that have a higher potential for fraud, waste, abuse, and  mismanagement, or are in need of transformation. In introducing this  high risk area, we specifically noted that agencies spend a significant  portion of their budgets on the operations and maintenance of IT systems  and need to effectively manage these investments in order to ensure they  continue to meet agencies\u2019 needs and deliver value. We issued an update  to our high-risk report in February 2017 and noted that, while progress  has been made in addressing the IT acquisitions and operations high-risk  area, significant work remains to be completed, including establishing  action plans to modernize or replace obsolete investments.", "In addition, over the last 3 decades, Congress has enacted several laws  to assist agencies and the federal government in managing IT  investments. For example, Congress enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act of  1996 to assist agencies in managing their investments.

A public cloud should not allow a  consumer to know or control other consumers of a cloud service  provider\u2019s environment. However, a private cloud can allow for ultimate  control in selecting who has access to a cloud environment.

In addition, we presented the results of  our analysis to officials in charge of cloud services within the Office of the  Chief Information Officer (CIO) at each selected agency. We asked these  officials to verify the completeness and accuracy of this data and provide  any updates as appropriate. Officials at all 16 agencies confirmed the  total number of investments using cloud services for fiscal years 2016  through 2018 and their projected use for fiscal year 2019. Based on these  steps, we determined that these data were sufficiently reliable to report on  agencies\u2019 progress in using cloud services.", "In addition, we compared each selected agency\u2019s cloud guidance to  OMB\u2019s Cloud First guidance. We interviewed Office of the CIO officials in  charge of cloud services at each agency regarding their guidance. In  addition, we interviewed OMB staff from the Office of E-Government and  Information Technology regarding its guidance. Because of the wide  variety of responses and documents we received from the agencies  related to their guidance for assessing investments for cloud computing  services, we conducted a content analysis of the information in order to  determine compliance with OMB\u2019s guidance. In doing so, team members  individually reviewed agencies\u2019 responses and documents and assigned  them to various categories and subcategories. Team members then  compared their categorization schemes, discussed the differences, and  reached agreement on the final characterization of compliance with OMB  guidance. In cases where agencies provided multiple policies or  documents, we followed up to clarify which portions were considered by  the agency to support the requirement to assess all investments for cloud  services.", "In analyzing whether the agencies\u2019 guidance on assessing investments  for cloud services met OMB criteria, we assessed whether the guidance  clearly identified a requirement for evaluating both new and existing  investments for cloud services. Agencies found to not have guidance  which clearly defined the assessment process were evaluated as such for  one of two reasons: either the agency\u2019s formal guidance did not  completely address our assessment criteria or the agency\u2019s guidance had  not yet been established or finalized.", "In analyzing whether agencies had met OMB\u2019s requirement to evaluate  each investment for cloud services, we assessed the number of  investments that had completed assessments based on the fiscal year  2019 budget submission. Agencies found not to have met the  requirement were evaluated as such if the agency had 10 or more  investments that had not yet been evaluated for cloud services. We set  this threshold based on a reasonable interpretation of the intent of OMB\u2019s  guidance requiring assessments of all investments.", "For our second objective, we obtained and analyzed IT Dashboard data  related to the 16 agencies\u2019 spending on cloud services for fiscal years  2015 through 2018. We chose to begin with fiscal year 2015 because we  had previously reported on federal agencies\u2019 spending on cloud services  through fiscal year 2014. Agencies report actual spending costs by fiscal  year on the IT Dashboard as part of the next fiscal year reporting. To  determine actual cloud spending costs for each fiscal year, we used  agency spending data reported each subsequent fiscal year (from fiscal  years 2017 through 2018) as of October 5, 2018.", "In addition, we administered a data collection instrument to each of the 16  agencies to obtain and analyze spending and savings data by the 16  selected agencies for fiscal years 2014 through 2018 and plans for future  planned costs. We requested that these agencies provide spending and  savings data broken down by investment, as OMB only requires federal  agencies to report total spending by cloud deployment model on the IT  Dashboard, and agencies were not required to identify whether any  reported savings were cloud-related. This instrument was administered  from November 2017 to January 2018.", "In the data collection instrument, we asked the selected agencies to  complete information on each of their cloud investments, including the  title of the application or system leveraging cloud, the cloud deployment  and service models, and the associated cloud spending and net cloud  savings or avoidances from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018 and  beyond, as agencies generally submitted data on planned spending for  one or more fiscal years beyond 2018. Due to the varied scale of cloud  implementation efforts ongoing at these agencies, we asked agencies to  only provide all applications, systems, or investments leveraging cloud  with total life-cycle costs of $1 million or more. We also asked agencies to  provide spending and savings or cost avoidances figures in whole  numbers in order to avoid errors in rounding numbers when we calculated  the reported figures in millions.", "We took the following steps to help ensure the reliability of the data we  collected. First, to minimize errors that might occur from respondents  interpreting our instrument differently from our intended purpose, we  reviewed the data collection instrument with agency officials who would  be completing the instrument during meetings in October and November  2017. Second, we reviewed the completed spreadsheets to identify  missing data or other errors, and consulted with our data quality expert  about these issues as appropriate.", "All agencies completed the data collection instrument by May 2018. For  those agencies that provided rounded (rather than exact) spending or  savings figures, we recalculated the data into whole numbers and  confirmed our calculations with the agencies. In addition, one agency  broke down its savings data into savings and cost avoidances; we  combined these reported figures for each investment and, after  consultation with a GAO data subject matter expert, confirmed with all the  other agencies in our review that their information on savings also  included cost avoidances.", "We also reviewed the associated notes regarding agencies\u2019 qualifications  of the provided data and followed up with agency officials to clarify the  responses as appropriate. These notes included information on whether  certain spending or savings data were unavailable, whether certain costs  were excluded from the spending information provided to us or whether  there were other qualifications of the provided data.", "Lastly, we presented the results of our analysis of IT Dashboard data and  the data obtained from the data collection instrument to each of the  selected agencies between June and August 2018. We asked the  agencies to verify the completeness and accuracy of these data and  provide any updates as appropriate. All 16 agencies provided updated  information regarding the list of investments using cloud services with life- cycle costs of $1 million or more and six agencies (Agriculture,  Commerce, Justice, Transportation, Treasury, and VA) provided updated  information related to spending and savings for these investments, which  we have incorporated as appropriate. Based on the measures we took to  ensure the reliability of the data provided by the agencies and reported on  the IT Dashboard, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purpose of this report.", "For the third objective, we obtained and reviewed available  documentation discussing examples of cloud computing investments  reported by the selected agencies as having produced notable benefits  and key practices that ensure the effort was successful. We also  interviewed officials from the Office of the CIO and other components in  charge of cloud services regarding these benefits.", "In order to develop our list of questions for these meetings, we first  conducted research to identify the range of benefits that could be  achieved from acquiring cloud services. We reviewed OMB, GSA, and  CIO Council cloud guidance; our prior work; and key leading cloud  practices from GSA\u2019s Federal Cloud Computing Center of Excellence.  Based on this work, we developed a list of seven key areas of benefits:  (1) improving efficiency and operations; (2) promoting agility and  responsiveness; (3) achieving business growth; (4) reducing cost; (5)  meeting regulatory requirements; (6) enhancing customer experience;  and (7) ensuring mission outcomes. During meetings with agency officials  in the Office of the CIO and other components in charge of cloud  services, we asked officials whether they had identified any significant or  notable benefits in these seven areas. As these seven areas might not  represent all potential benefits, we also asked officials to describe any  additional benefits not included in these areas.", "In addition, as part of these meetings, we asked officials from the Office  of the CIO at each selected agency to identify up to three examples of  investments that benefited from the acquisition of cloud services. We  asked agencies to exclude examples of email deployments to the cloud to  ensure a wider variety of examples of investments with benefits. Fifteen  of the 16 agencies in our review identified at least one or more examples  of cloud investments that had produced significant or notable benefits,  while one agency\u2014HHS\u2014reported that it did not have any such  examples because it did not have any completed migration efforts.  Because of the open-ended nature of the 15 agencies\u2019 responses to our  questions, we conducted a content analysis of the information we  received in order to identify and summarize the benefits and key practices  that were identified by the 15 agencies. We reviewed the benefits and key  practices reported by the agencies and grouped them using the seven  key benefit areas that our prior research had identified. We discussed the  groupings of the reported benefits, and reached agreement on these  categories. We grouped the benefit categories together based on  commonalities such as purpose, impact, and capabilities, and  summarized the benefits reported. Based on discussion, we confirmed a  list of benefits and key practices and totaled the number of agencies that  reported each of these.", "In addition, to select systems or investments to profile, we reviewed the  34 examples provided by the 15 agencies and narrowed the list to 11  examples. We selected these examples using the following factors: the  type of system, whether the system supported the mission or business  operations of the agency or component, and the availability of information  related to the benefits achieved from acquiring cloud services. In doing  so, we sought to have a mix of systems that provided mission critical  services to the agency or the public, illustrated a range of cloud  computing benefits, and included detailed information on the benefits  achieved from using cloud services.", "In technical comments received on a draft of this report, two agencies  provided new information regarding the use of cloud services for their  systems that were profiled in appendix VI of the draft report. Based on the  additional information provided by the two agencies, we determined there  was no longer sufficient detail regarding what benefits were realized for  these systems. Therefore, we removed the two agencies\u2019 profiled  examples from the report in order to be consistent with our methodology  for reporting examples of systems that had realized benefits from the  acquisition of cloud services. We then notified both agencies of this  decision.", "We conducted this performance audit from September 2017 to April 2019  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
