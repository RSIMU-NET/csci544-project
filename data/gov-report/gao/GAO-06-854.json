It facilitates travel for millions of people and eases consular workload, but poses challenges to border inspectors, who, when screening visa waiver travelers, may face language barriers or lack time to conduct in-depth interviews. Furthermore, stolen passports from visa waiver countries are prized travel documents among terrorists, criminals, and immigration law violators, creating an additional risk. While the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has intercepted many fraudulent documents at U.S. ports of entry, DHS officials acknowledged that an undetermined number of inadmissible aliens may have entered the United States using a stolen or lost passport from a visa waiver country. The U.S. government's process for assessing the risks of the Visa Waiver Program has weaknesses. In 2002, Congress mandated that, every 2 years, DHS review the effect that each country's continued participation in the program has on U.S. law enforcement and security interests, but did not set a reporting deadline. In 2004, DHS established a unit to oversee the program and conduct these reviews. We identified several problems with the 2004 review process, as key stakeholders were not consulted during portions of the process, preparation for the in-country site visits was not consistent, and the final reports were untimely. Furthermore, DHS cannot effectively achieve its mission to monitor and report on ongoing law enforcement and security concerns in visa waiver countries due to insufficient resources. DHS has taken some actions to mitigate the program's risks; however, the U.S. government has faced difficulties in further mitigating these risks. In particular, the department has not established time frames and operating procedures regarding timely stolen passport reporting--a program requirement since 2002. Furthermore, DHS has sought to require the reporting of lost and stolen passport data to the United States and the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), but it has not issued clear reporting guidelines to participating countries. While most visa waiver countries participate with Interpol's database, four do not. DHS is not using Interpol's data to its full potential as a border screening tool because DHS does not automatically access the data at primary inspection."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States also issues visas to those who intend to immigrate to the United States.

In 2000, the program became permanent under the Visa Waiver  Permanent Program Act. In 2002, we reported on the legislative  requirements to which countries must adhere before they are eligible for  inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program. In general, these are the  requirements:    A low nonimmigrant visa refusal rate. To qualify for visa waiver status, a  country must maintain a refusal rate of less than 3 percent for its citizens  who apply for business and tourism visas.", "A machine-readable passport program.

For example,  all passports issued after October 26, 2005, must contain a digital  photograph printed in the document; passports issued to visa waiver  travelers after October 26, 2006, must be electronic (e-passports). E- passports aim to enhance border security by making it more difficult to  misuse the passport to gain entry into the United States. Travelers with  passports issued after the deadline that do not meet these requirements  must obtain a visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate overseas before  departing for the United States. In addition, the May 2002 Enhanced  Border Security and Visa Reform Act required that participating countries  certify that the theft of their blank passports is reported to the U.S.  government in a timely manner. Moreover, the act increased the  frequency\u2014from once every 5 years to once every 2 years\u2014of mandated  assessments of the effect of each country\u2019s continued participation in the  Visa Waiver Program on U.S. security, law enforcement, and immigration  interests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Visa Waiver Program Has Benefits and Risks", "paragraphs": ["The Visa Waiver Program has many benefits, including facilitating  international travel for millions of foreign citizens seeking to visit the  United States each year, creating substantial economic benefits to the  United States, and allowing State to allocate resources to visa-issuing  posts in countries with higher-risk applicant pools.

According to economic and commercial officers at several of the U.S.  embassies we visited, visa-free travel to the United States boosts  international business travel and tourism, as well as airline revenues, and  creates substantial economic benefits to the United States. In its report  accompanying the 2000 bill to make the program permanent, the House  Committee on the Judiciary acknowledged the program\u2019s importance to  the U.S. travel and tourism industry, and the benefit it provides to  American citizens by allowing reciprocal visa-free travel to visa waiver  countries.

For example, millions of visa waiver travelers who have benefited from  visa-free travel would need to obtain a visa to travel to the United States if  the program did not exist.

Those travelers who must apply for visas before traveling to the United  States receive two levels of screening before entering the country (see fig.  3). However, visa waiver travelers are first screened in person by a CBP  inspector once they arrive at the U.S. port of entry, perhaps after having  already boarded an international flight bound for the United States with a  fraudulent travel document. For visa waiver travelers, CBP primary  inspectors observe the applicant, examine his or her passport, collect the  applicant\u2019s fingerprints as part of the U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status  Indicator Technology program (US-VISIT), and check his or her name  against automated databases and watch lists, which contain information  regarding the admissibility of aliens, including known terrorists, criminals,  and immigration law violators.

In contrast, non-visa-waiver travelers, who must  obtain a visa from a U.S. embassy or consulate, undergo an interview by  consular officials overseas, who conduct a rigorous screening process  when deciding to approve or deny a visa. As we have previously reported,  State has taken a number of actions since 2002 to strengthen the visa  issuance process as a border security tool.

At that time, the 12-week  training course for new inspectors at the Federal Law Enforcement  Training Center devoted 1 day to passport fraud, according to the OIG.   Currently, CBP dedicates 16 hours out of the 16-week basic training  program to fraudulent document detection training for new border  inspectors, and provides additional courses for inspectors throughout  their assignments at ports of entry.

Following are several examples:  In July 2005, two aliens successfully entered the United States using lost or  stolen Austrian passports. DHS was not notified that these passports had  been lost or stolen prior to this date; the aliens were admitted, and there is  no record of their departure, according to CBP.

In particular, within DHS\u2019s various  components, we found that OIE is largely an unknown entity and,  therefore, is unable to leverage the expertise of DHS officials overseas.  Specifically, only 3 of the 15 DHS field officials with whom we spoke in the  six visa waiver countries we visited were aware of the Visa Waiver  Program Oversight Unit and its mission. A senior DHS representative at  one post showed us that her organizational directory did not contain  contact information for OIE. In addition, an official from the Immigration  and Customs Enforcement\u2019s Office of International Affairs acknowledged  that DHS needs a better communication plan for the Visa Waiver Program.  He stated that DHS had not prioritized the workload for all its officials  overseas, including their role in overseeing the Visa Waiver Program; he  also told us that OIE had not yet articulated what information it needed,  designated a mechanism to share that information, or gained agency-wide  acceptance of procedures for monitoring the compliance of visa waiver  countries. In fact, a senior DHS official in Washington, D.C., told us that he  may find out about developments\u2014either routine or emergent\u2014in visa  waiver countries by \u201chappenstance.\u201d Without an outreach strategy, DHS is  not able to leverage its existing resources at U.S. embassies in all visa  waiver countries.", "Furthermore, key stakeholders, who are in a position to influence and  monitor visa waiver countries\u2019 compliance with the program\u2019s  requirements, were not informed of the major findings of the country  assessments. In fact, at the time of our visits, ambassadors or deputy  chiefs of mission in each of the six posts told us that they were not fully  aware of the extent to which the country assessments discussed law  enforcement and security concerns posed by the continued participation  of the country in the program. The Deputy Chief of Mission at one post  stated that without the appropriate information, such as was contained in  the assessments, embassy officials could not be effective agents for the  U.S. government with regard to these issues. Bureau of Consular Affairs  officials in Washington, D.C., agreed that any concerns identified in the  assessments should be brought to the attention of the embassy, so that the  posts can address the concerns accordingly. Due to the lack of outreach  and clear communication about its mission, OIE is limited in its ability to  monitor the day-to-day law enforcement and security concerns posed by  the Visa Waiver Program, and the U.S. government is limited in its ability  to influence visa waiver countries\u2019 progress in meeting requirements.", "We also found gaps in interagency communication. According to OIE,  State plays a significant role in conveying information relevant to the Visa  Waiver Program to U.S. embassy officials and their host government  counterparts. Therefore, it is important that State and DHS have clear lines  of communication. For example, in October 2005, one government  expressed willingness to share data on lost and stolen issued passports  with the United States, and asked for technical specifications on how to do  so. However, at the time of our February 2006 visit, the post in that  country had not received direction from headquarters on how this  passport information should be shared. Moreover, OIE officials told us  that they were unaware that this country was willing to share this data  until we brought it to their attention in early March 2006. As a result, the  United States missed opportunities to potentially deter the fraudulent use  of passports from this country, which in fact has the highest rate of misuse  among all visa waiver countries, according to DHS. Additionally, a senior  consular official in another participating country expressed frustration  that DHS had not fully explained to embassy officials why visa waiver  countries needed to report lost and stolen passport information directly to  the United States and Interpol, which maintains a global database of lost  and stolen travel documents.

In March 2005, at the working group\u2019s  request, the U.S. embassy in Berlin conveyed these concerns to the  German government to seek a solution. In March 2006, DHS determined  that sufficient progress had not been made to address the concern over  German temporary passports, and, as of May 1, 2006, German temporary  passport holders are not allowed to travel to the United States under the  Visa Waiver Program without a visa.", "DHS has also made some progress in enforcing new passport security  measures. For example, DHS has enforced an October 26, 2005, deadline  requiring travelers under the Visa Waiver Program to have digital  photographs in their passports. Specifically, Italian and French citizens  with noncompliant passports issued after October 26, 2005, must first  obtain a visa before traveling to the United States because these countries  did not meet the deadline. Furthermore, as previously mentioned, by  October 26, 2006, visa waiver travelers must have e-passports for travel  under the program. E-passports aim to enhance the security of travel  documents, making it more difficult for imposters or inadmissible aliens to  misuse the passport to gain entry into the United States. DHS and State  officials told us that nearly all 27 participating countries report that they  are on schedule to meet this deadline. According to US-VISIT, DHS will  deploy machines to read the e-passports at 33 airports by the October 2006  deadline, covering about 98 percent of all visa waiver travelers. While US- VISIT intends to deploy e-passport readers to all ports of entry in the  future, it has not articulated clear timeframes to do so.

For example, in 2004, a visa waiver  country reported the theft of nearly 300 stolen blank passports to the  United States\u2014more than 9 years after the theft occurred. In addition, in  2004, a visa waiver country reported the theft of 270 blank passports more  than 8 months after the theft occurred.

Moreover, DHS has not established time frames or  operating procedures to enforce this requirement.

We understand that DHS\u2019s organizational structure changed during the  2004 review process. To avoid confusion regarding the DHS units that  had some involvement in this process, we have replaced references to  the Office of International Enforcement (OIE) with DHS, as  appropriate.   2.  Our review focused on the 2004 biennial review process for 25 of the  27 Visa Waiver Program countries. We agree that DHS has taken some  steps to improve the 2005 process for Italy and Portugal, whose  reviews are still in process, and we discuss these improvements in our  report. However, we disagree that DHS has corrected most of the  problems associated with the 2004 review process. As we note in our  report, as of June 2006, DHS had neither updated the interagency  working group team members on the status of the reviews of Italy and  Portugal, nor provided them with a timeline for proceeding with the  review. Furthermore, stakeholders continued to express concern  about DHS\u2019s lack of communication about the process and the  findings. Therefore, we recommended that DHS finalize clear,  consistent, and transparent protocols for biennial country assessments  and provide these protocols to stakeholders at relevant agencies at  headquarters and overseas.    3.  We did not intend to suggest that the evaluation of U.S. security and  law enforcement interests needed to be conducted or finalized during  the in-country site visits. Our point is that important events may take  place while the country assessments are in the clearance process. We  believe that DHS should update the country assessments to reflect  these events, such as large scale thefts of blank passports like the May  2005 theft that we noted in our report, to ensure that Congress has a  comprehensive analysis of the current law enforcement and security  risks posed by each country.  4.  We agree that DHS cannot continue to incorporate data indefinitely  into the country assessments. However, as we reported, the teams  collecting information about the visa waiver countries\u2019 risks in 2004  used, in some cases, information from 2 years prior; by the time the  summary report was issued in November 2005, some of the data was  more than 3 years old. Indeed, as DHS noted elsewhere, the 2004  country assessments provided a \u201crearview mirror\u201d and \u201cbackward- looking\u201d evaluation. Thus, the assessments may not necessarily have  contained the best information available at the time the assessments  were finalized. Given the lengthy time it took for DHS to issue the  November 2005 summary report to Congress, and to ensure future  reports contain timely information when issued, we believe that  Congress should consider establishing a biennial deadline by which  DHS must complete the country assessments and report to Congress.    5.  We agree that continuous and ongoing evaluations of Visa Waiver  Program countries are needed and recommended that DHS create real- time monitoring arrangements and provide additional resources to the  Visa Waiver Program Oversight Unit to achieve this goal. However, as  long as DHS is required to report biennially to Congress, DHS should  ensure that future reviews are conducted in a timely fashion. Based on  our review of the 2004 country assessment process, the assessments  may not necessarily have contained the best information available at  the time the assessments were finalized given the lengthy time it took  for DHS to finalize its reviews.  6.  We agree that it is in the U.S. government\u2019s best interest to engage with  countries on global concerns identified during the course of the  country assessment process. It is not our intention to inhibit this kind  of consultation. Furthermore, we acknowledge that a consultative  process may involve tradeoffs between timely reporting and complete  information gathering and analysis. Our concern is that key  stakeholders in headquarters and at overseas posts, as well as  members of the in-country site visit teams, expressed concerns about  their roles in the 2004 country assessment process, and stated that  they had not received enough detail from DHS about the process and  the findings. Thus, we recommended that DHS provide transparent  protocols to all stakeholders that provide timelines for the entire  assessment process, including the role of a site visit, an explanation of  the clearance process, and deadlines for completion. We believe it is  important that DHS finalize its standard operating procedures, and  share these procedures with relevant stakeholders at headquarters and  overseas. As we noted in our report, due to the lack of outreach and  clear communication about its mission, OIE is limited in its ability to  monitor the day-to-day law enforcement and security concerns posed  by the Visa Waiver Program, and the U.S. government is limited in its  ability to influence visa waiver countries\u2019 progress in meeting  requirements.  7.  We strongly agree that classified and sensitive information should be  protected. However, we also believe that cleared U.S. officials at  overseas posts in Visa Waiver Program countries, including  ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission, have a need to know the  extent to which law enforcement and security concerns were  identified during the mandated biennial reviews, and should receive  copies of the final country assessments. Without the appropriate  information, such as was contained in the assessments, embassy  officials can not be effective agents for the U.S. government with  regard to these issues. We believe that the establishment of a classified  sharing system that allows U.S. government agencies to access the  country assessments is a positive step."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: Comments from the Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VI: Comments from the International Criminal Police Organization", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix VII: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Jess T.
