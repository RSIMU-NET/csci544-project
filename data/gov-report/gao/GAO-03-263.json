Formidable challenges, however, remain in securing transit systems. Obtaining sufficient funding is the most significant challenge in making transit systems as safe and secure as possible, according to GAO survey results and interviews with transit agency officials. Funding security improvements is problematic because of high security costs, competing budget priorities, tight budget environments, and a provision precluding transit agencies that serve areas with populations of 200,000 or more from using federal urbanized area formula funds for operating expenses. In addition to funding challenges, certain characteristics of transit agencies make them both vulnerable to attack and difficult to secure. For example, the high ridership and open access of some transit systems makes them attractive for terrorists but also makes certain security measures, like metal detectors, impractical. Moreover, because all levels of the government and the private sector are involved in transit decisions, coordination among all the stakeholders can pose challenges. While transit agencies are pursuing security improvements, the federal government's role in transit security is expanding. For example, the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) launched a multipart security initiative and increased funding of its safety and security activities after September 11. In addition, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act gave the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) responsibility for the security of all transportation modes, including transit. TSA anticipates issuing national standards for transit security. As the federal government's role expands, goals, performance indicators, and funding criteria need to be established to ensure accountability and results for the government's efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over a year has passed since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001,  realigned our national priorities. While most of the early attention  following these attacks focused on airport security, emphasis on the other  modes of transportation has since grown. Moreover, terrorist events  around the world have shown that mass transit systems, like other modes  of transportation, are often targets of attack. For example, roughly one- third of terrorist attacks worldwide target transportation systems, and  transit systems are the mode most commonly attacked. In May 2002, the  Department of Transportation issued a terrorist threat advisory to the  transit industry indicating that subway systems were a possible target. The  industry remains in a heightened state of alert.", "Addressing transit safety and security concerns is complicated by the  nature and scope of transit in the United States. About 6,000 agencies  provide transit services, such as buses, subways, ferries, and light rail, in  the United States. Each workday, about 14 million Americans ride on some  form of transit. Because the effectiveness of transit systems depends on  their accessibility, security measures common in aviation are difficult to  apply. Furthermore, government agencies at the federal, state, and local  levels and private companies share responsibility for transit safety and  security and are involved in making transit decisions.", "This report examines transit safety and security at the federal and local  levels. In particular, the report describes (1) challenges in securing mass  transit systems, (2) steps transit agencies have taken to enhance safety and  security, and (3) the federal role in transit safety and security. To address  these issues, we visited 10 transit agencies across the country, including the  Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority in Austin; Chicago Transit  Authority; Central Florida Regional Transit Authority in Orlando; Los  Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority; Minneapolis-St.  Paul Metropolitan Council; New York City Transit; Regional Transportation  District in Denver; San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit; San Francisco  Municipal Railway; and Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority in  the District of Columbia. We selected these agencies because they  represent different geographical areas and operate transit systems of  different sizes and modes. In addition, we surveyed a random sample of all  transit agencies throughout the nation that are eligible to receive federal  urbanized area formula funds to obtain additional information on safety  and security issues. We received responses to our survey from 155 of 200  transit agencies, for an overall response rate of 78 percent. Our survey  results are generalizable to our sample population.

As figure 1 shows, buses are the most widely used form of  transit, providing almost two-thirds of all passenger trips.", "A number of organizations are involved in the delivery of transit services in  the United States, including federal, state, and local governments and the  private sector:  FTA provides financial assistance to transit agencies to plan and  develop new transit systems and operate, maintain, and improve  existing systems. FTA is responsible for ensuring that the recipients of  federal transit funds follow federal mandates and administrative  requirements. FTA\u2019s Office of Safety and Security is the agency\u2019s focal  point for transit safety (freedom from unintentional danger) and  security (freedom from intentional danger).", "State and local governments also provide a significant amount of  funding for transit services. As figure 2 shows, state and local  governments provide funding for over 40 percent of transit agencies\u2019  operating expenses and about a quarter of their capital expenses.  According to statute, states are also responsible for establishing State  Safety Oversight Agencies to oversee the safety of transit agencies\u2019 rail  systems.", "Transit agencies, which can be public or private entities, are  responsible for administering and managing transit activities and  services. Transit agencies can directly operate transit service or contract  for all or part of the total transit service provided. About 6,000 agencies  provide transit services in the United States, and the majority of these  agencies provide more than one mode of service. Although all levels of  government are involved in transit security, the primary responsibility  for securing transit systems has rested with the transit agencies.", "FTA administers a number of programs, both discretionary and formula  based, that provide federal funding support to transit agencies. The largest  of these programs is the urbanized area formula grant program, which  provides federal funds to urbanized areas (jurisdictions with populations of  50,000 or more) for transit capital investments, operating expenses, and  transportation-related planning. As figure 3 shows, the urbanized area  formula grant program accounts for almost one-half of the total authorized  funds for all transit programs under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (TEA-21). Recipients of urbanized area formula funds are  required to spend at least 1 percent of these funds to improve the security  of existing or planned mass transportation systems unless the transit  agencies certify that such expenditures are unnecessary.", "Restrictions on the use of urbanized area formula funds for operating  expenses have changed over the years. When the urbanized area formula  program was created in 1982, funds could be used by transit agencies,  regardless of an area\u2019s population, for operating expenses with certain  limitations. However, during fiscal years 1995 to 1997, an overall cap was  placed on the total amount of these formula grants that could be used for  operating expenses. In fiscal year 1995, the cap was $710 million, and in  fiscal years 1996 and 1997 it was $400 million. With the passage of TEA-21  in 1998, the restrictions on urbanized area formula funds were again  changed.   Specifically, TEA-21 prohibits transit agencies that serve  urbanized areas with populations of 200,000 or more from using urbanized  area formula funding for operating expenses. According to FTA officials,  the prohibition was instituted because policymakers believed the federal  government should only pay for the construction of mass transit systems,  not their operations. The legislative history of TEA-21 indicates that the  Congress allowed transit agencies serving urban areas with populations of  less than 200,000 to continue to use urbanized area formula funds for  operating expenses so that they would have sufficient funding flexibilities.", "Throughout the world, public surface transportation systems have been  targets of terrorist attacks. For example, the first large-scale terrorist use of  a chemical weapon occurred in 1995 in the Tokyo subway system. In this  attack, a terrorist group released sarin gas on a subway train, killing 11  people and injuring about 5,500. In addition, according to the Mineta  Transportation Institute, surface transportation systems were the target of  more than 195 terrorist attacks from 1997 through 2000.

Certain characteristics of transit systems, such as their high ridership and  open access, make them both vulnerable to attack and difficult to secure.  The high cost of transit security improvements, coupled with tight budgets,  competing needs, and a restriction on using federal funds for operating  expenses (including security-related operating expenses such as additional  security patrols) in large urban areas creates an even greater challenge for  transit agencies. Moreover, because of the numerous stakeholders involved  in transit security, coordination can become a problem."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Characteristics of Transit Systems Pose Security Challenges", "paragraphs": ["According to transit officials and transit security experts, certain  characteristics of mass transit systems make them inherently vulnerable to  terrorist attacks and difficult to secure. By design, mass transit systems are  open (i.e., have multiple access points and, in some cases, no barriers) so  that they can move large numbers of people quickly. In contrast, the  aviation system is housed in closed and controlled locations with few entry  points. The openness of mass transit systems can leave them vulnerable  because transit officials cannot monitor or control who enters or leaves the  systems. In addition, other characteristics of some transit systems\u2014high  ridership, expensive infrastructure, economic importance, and location  (e.g., large metropolitan areas or tourist destinations)\u2014also make them  attractive targets because of the potential for mass casualties and  economic damage. Moreover, some of these same characteristics make  transit agencies difficult to secure. For example, the number of riders that  pass through a mass transit system\u2014especially during peak hours\u2014make  some security measures, such as metal detectors, impractical. In addition,  the multiple access points along extended routes make the costs of  securing each location prohibitive.", "Further complicating transit security is the need for transit agencies to  balance security concerns with accessibility, convenience, and  affordability. Because transit riders often could choose another means of  transportation, such as a personal automobile, transit agencies must  compete for riders. To remain competitive, transit agencies must offer  convenient, inexpensive, and quality service. Therefore, security measures  that limit accessibility, cause delays, increase fares, or otherwise cause  inconvenience could push people away from transit and back into their  cars. Our discussions with transit agency officials and our survey results  indicate that striking the right balance between security and these other  needs is difficult. For example, as shown in figure 5, 9 percent of survey  respondents reported that the most significant barrier to making their  transit systems as safe and secure as possible is balancing riders\u2019 need for  accessibility with security measures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Security Improvements Is a Key Challenge", "paragraphs": ["Funding security improvements is a key challenge for transit agencies. Our  survey results and our interviews with transit agency officials indicate that  insufficient funding is the most significant challenge in making transit  systems as safe and secure as possible. Moreover, our survey results  indicate that the most common reason for not addressing items identified  as needing attention through safety and security assessments is insufficient  funding. Factors contributing to funding challenges include high security  costs, tight budgets, competing budget priorities, and a provision  prohibiting transit agencies in large urbanized areas from using federal  urbanized area formula funds for operating expenses, such as security  training.", "Transit security investments can be quite expensive. While some security  improvements are inexpensive, such as removing trash cans from subway  platforms, most require substantial funding. For example, one transit  agency estimated that an intrusion alarm and closed circuit television  system for only one of its portals would cost approximately $250,000\u2014an  amount equal to at least a quarter of the capital budgets of more than half  the transit agencies we surveyed. According to our survey results, the top  three safety and security funding priorities of transit agencies regardless of  size are enhanced communication systems, surveillance equipment, and  additional training. The transit agencies we visited have identified or are  identifying needed security improvements, such as upgraded  communication systems, additional fencing, surveillance equipment, and  redundant or mobile command centers. Of the 10 transit agencies we  visited, 8 had developed cost estimates of their identified improvements.  The total estimated cost of the identified security improvements at the 8  agencies is about $711 million. The total cost of all needed transit security  improvements throughout the country is unknown; however, given the  scope of the nation\u2019s transit systems and the cost estimate for 8 agencies, it  could amount to billions of dollars.", "Transit agency officials told us that they are facing tight budgets, which  make it more difficult for their agencies to pay for expensive security  improvements. According to most of the agencies we visited, the weakened  economy has negatively affected their revenue base by lowering ridership,  tax revenues dedicated to transit, or both. In particular, 8 of the 10 agencies  we visited reported that ridership has dropped this year, primarily because  of the slow economy. The decreased ridership levels have lowered fare box  revenue. In addition, state and local sales taxes, which provide revenue for  many transit agencies, have declined with the weakened economy and  reduced the transit agencies\u2019 revenue, according to a number of transit  agency officials.", "Other competing funding needs also present a challenge for transit  agencies. Given the tight budget environment, transit agencies must make  difficult trade-offs between security investments and other needs, such as  service expansion and equipment upgrades. For example, an official at one  transit agency stated that budget shortfalls and expenditures for security  improvements have delayed some needed capital projects and reduced the  budgets for all departments\u2014except the safety and security budget.  Similarly, an official at another agency reported that his agency is funding  security improvements with money that was budgeted for nonsecurity  projects. According to our analysis, 16 percent of the agencies we surveyed  view balancing safety and security priorities against other priorities as the  most significant challenge to making their systems as safe and secure as  possible.", "Officials from some transit agencies we visited also reported that the  funding challenges are exacerbated by the current statutory limitation on  using urbanized area formula funds for operating expenses. The urbanized  area formula program provides federal funds to urbanized areas  (jurisdictions with populations of 50,000 or more) for transit capital  investments, operating expenses, and transportation-related planning. The  program is the largest source of federal transit funding. As mentioned  earlier, TEA-21 prohibits transit agencies in large urbanized areas  (jurisdictions with populations of 200,000 or more) from using urbanized  area formula funding for most operating expenses. This prohibition limits  many agencies\u2019 ability to use FTA funds for security-related operating  expenses. For example, transit agencies in large urbanized areas cannot  use their urbanized area formula funds to pay for security training or  salaries for security personnel, among other uses. Officials from a number  of agencies we visited said this prohibition was a significant barrier to  funding needed security improvements, although several agency officials  also noted that the elimination of this prohibition would be helpful only if  additional funding were provided. Given the declining revenue base of  some transit agencies, however, the prohibition compounds the budgetary  challenges of securing transit systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Coordination Is Key to Transit Security but Presents Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Coordination among all stakeholders is integral to enhancing transit  security, but it can create additional challenges. Numerous stakeholders  are typically involved in decisions that affect transit security, such as  decisions about its operations and funding. As we noted in our testimony  before the Subcommittee on Transit and Housing in September and in  previous reports, coordination among all levels of government and the  private sector is critical to homeland security efforts, and a lack of  coordination can create problems, such as duplication of effort. In  addition, the national strategy for homeland security recognizes the  challenges associated with intergovernmental coordination but emphasizes  the need for such coordination. According to our site visits and our survey  results, coordination of emergency planning is generally taking place  between transit agencies and local governments, despite some challenges;  however, such coordination appears to be minimal between transit  agencies and governments at the regional, state, and federal levels.", "We found that transit agencies and local governments are coordinating  their emergency planning efforts. Our survey results indicate that 77  percent of transit agencies have directly coordinated emergency planning  at the local level; moreover, 65 percent of agencies surveyed believe they  have been sufficiently integrated into their local government\u2019s emergency  plans. Likewise, 9 of the 10 transit agencies we visited said they are  integrated to at least a moderate extent into their local government\u2019s  emergency planning. Officials from these 9 transit agencies noted that their  agencies are included in their local government\u2019s emergency planning  activities, such as emergency drills, tabletop exercises, planning meetings,  and task forces. For example, when Minneapolis held an emergency drill  that simulated a biological attack on the city, Metro Transit transported  \u201cvictims\u201d to hospitals, even taking some victims to out-of-state hospitals  because the local hospitals were at capacity. Transit agency and local  government officials said their past experiences with weather emergencies  and special events, like Super Bowl celebrations, had helped establish good  working relationships. According to the officials, these past experiences  have demonstrated the types of support services transit agencies can  provide during emergencies, including evacuations, triage centers, victim  transport, and shelters. However, officials said these working relationships  are usually informal and undocumented. For example, the majority of the  transit agencies we visited did not have a memorandum of understanding  with their local government.", "Although transit agencies are generally active participants in emergency  planning at the local level, they nevertheless face some coordination  challenges. According to our survey results, some of the most significant  challenges in coordinating emergency planning at the local level are  insufficient funding, limited awareness of terrorist threats to transit, and  lack of time. Similar concerns were often raised during our meetings with  transit agencies. For example, one agency official noted that his agency  operates in over 40 jurisdictions and that coordinating with all of these  local governments is very time consuming.", "In contrast to the local level, coordination of emergency planning among  transit agencies and governments at the regional, state, and federal levels  appears to be minimal. Most of the transit agencies we visited reported  limited coordination with governments other than their local government.  Our survey results reveal a similar pattern. For example, 68 percent of  transit agencies we surveyed have not directly coordinated emergency  planning at the regional level; 84 percent have not directly coordinated  emergency planning at the state level; and 87 percent have not directly  coordinated emergency planning at the federal level. As we have noted in  past reports on homeland security, the lack of coordination among  stakeholders could result in communication problems, duplication, and  fragmentation.

A recurring theme was for the federal government to establish a  clearinghouse or similar mechanism that maintains and disseminates this  type of information. Specifically, officials expressed a need for the federal  government to provide additional information on the following topics:  Intelligence: Transit officials from a number of agencies stated that the  federal government should provide additional information on threats to  their transit agencies or cities. Officials also commented that \u201creal time\u201d  information on attacks against other transit agencies would be useful.", "Best practices: A number of officials said that information on transit  security best practices would be beneficial. According to FTA officials,  the assessments of the 36 transit agencies are helping them identify best  practices.", "Federal grants: Officials from several transit agencies suggested that  information on available grants that can be used for transit safety and  security improvements would be useful, noting that locating these  grants is challenging and time consuming. For example, an assistant  general manager stated that she spends too much of her time searching  the Internet for grants available for transit.", "Level of security: Transit officials from a few agencies told us that it  would be helpful for the federal government to provide information on  the appropriate level of security for their agencies. For example,  officials at one agency questioned whether they needed to continue to  post guards\u201424 hours a day, 7 days a week\u2014at the entrance and exit of  their tunnel, a practice instituted when the Department of  Transportation issued a threat advisory to the transit industry in May  2002. Similarly, our survey results indicate that determining the  appropriate level of security is a challenge for transit agencies.", "Cutting-edge technology: Officials from a number of agencies said  that the federal government should provide information on the latest  security technologies. For example, officials from one agency said that  such information is needed because they have been bombarded by  vendors selling security technology since September 11; however, the  officials said they were unsure about the quality of the products,  whether the products were needed, or whether the products would be  outdated next year.", "Decontamination practices: Several transit agency officials expressed  a need for information on decontamination protocols. For example, one  agency official noted that information is needed on how to determine if  the system is \u201cclean\u201d after a chemical or biological attack.", "According to FTA officials, FTA is developing two mechanisms to better  disseminate information on intelligence, best practices, and security- related issues to transit agencies. First, FTA is launching a new secure Web  site to post best practices and allow for the exchange of security-related  information. In September 2002, FTA invited 100 transit agencies to register  to use this Web site, which utilizes the Federal Bureau of Investigation  (FBI) secure Web site technology called Infragard. Second, FTA is funding  the transit Information Sharing and Analysis Center, which will disseminate  intelligence information to transit agencies. The Center will initially be  available for the largest 50 agencies. The schedules for launching or  expanding the Center to other transit agencies have not been established.", "Officials from several of the agencies we met with also said that the federal  government should be investing more in security-related research and  development. Agency officials noted that individual transit agencies do not  have the resources to devote to research and development. Moreover, the  officials said this is an appropriate role for the federal government, since  the products of research and development endeavors should benefit the  entire transit community, not just individual agencies. FTA\u2019s Office of  Technology is currently the agency\u2019s focal point for research and  development and is responsible for identifying and supporting  technological innovations, including safety and security innovations.  According to FTA documents, the Office of Technology\u2019s obligations for  safety and security technologies have increased from $680,000 in fiscal year  2000 to an estimated $1.1 million in fiscal year 2002. FTA\u2019s fiscal year 2003  budget request includes about $4.2 million for the Office of Technology\u2019s  safety and security technologies, representing a 272-percent increase from  fiscal year 2002. FTA is also conducting 13 research projects on a variety of  security-related issues, such as updating its guide for security planning,  developing material for a security awareness campaign, and working on  decontamination procedures for public transportation.", "A number of transit officials also expressed a need for the federal  government to help them obtain security clearances. As we have reported  in our previous work on homeland security, state and local officials have  characterized their lack of security clearances as a barrier to obtaining  critical intelligence information. The inability to receive any classified  threat information could hamper transit agencies\u2019 emergency preparedness  capability as it apparently did at one of the transit agencies we visited. In  this agency\u2019s city, a bomb threat was made against a major building, but  because the transit agency officials did not have the necessary security  clearances, the FBI did not inform them of this threat until about 40  minutes before the agency was asked to help evacuate the building.  According to transit agency officials, the lack of advance notice negatively  affected their agency\u2019s ability to respond, even though, in this case, the  threat was not carried out. Proposed legislation (H.R. 3483) provides that  the Attorney General expeditiously grant security clearances to governors  who apply for them and to state and local officials who participate in  federal counterterrorism working groups or regional task forces. FTA has  offered to help transit agencies join their local FBI Joint Terrorism Task  Force to better access intelligence information, but it has not made assisting transit agencies with security clearances part of their security  activities.", "Officials from the transit agencies we visited also said that additional  federal funding is needed. As noted earlier, many of the transit agencies we  visited are experiencing tightened budgets, which make it more difficult for  them to fund safety and security needs. Moreover, according to our survey  results, insufficient funding is the most significant obstacle agencies face in  trying to make their systems more safe and secure. The Congress has  already made additional funding available for transit security purposes\u2014 about $23.5 million through the fiscal year 2002 DOD supplemental.   FTA\u2019s  fiscal year 2003 budget request also includes $17.9 million for safety and  security expenditures."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Critical Decisions Remain about the Federal Government\u2019s Role in Funding Transit Security Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Important funding decisions for transit safety and security initiatives  remain. Due to the expense of security enhancements and transit agencies\u2019  tight budget environments, the federal government is likely to be viewed as  a source of funding for at least some of these enhancements. These  improvements join the growing list of security initiatives competing for  federal assistance. Based on our past work on homeland security issues,  site visits to transit agencies, and survey results, we believe that several  issues will need to be addressed when the federal government\u2019s role in  funding transit safety and security initiatives is considered. These issues  include (1) determining the roles of stakeholders in funding transit security,  (2) developing an approach to distribute federal funds, (3) establishing  goals and performance indicators for the federal government\u2019s efforts, and  (4) selecting the appropriate federal policy instrument to deliver  assistance.", "The roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in funding transit safety and  security need to be determined. Since all levels of government and the  private sector are concerned about transit safety and security, determining  who should finance security activities may be difficult. Some of the  benefits of transit systems, such as employment and reduced congestion,  remain within the locality or region. In addition, private companies that  own transit systems could directly benefit from security measures because  steps designed to thwart terrorists could also prevent others from stealing  goods or causing other kinds of economic damage. Given the importance of  transit to our nation\u2019s economic infrastructure, some have argued that the  federal government should help pay for protective measures for transit.  Transit officials we spoke with said that the federal government should  provide additional funding for security needs. Fifty-nine percent of transit  agencies in large- and small-urbanized areas responding to our survey said  they plan to use federal funds to pay for their top three security priorities.  Additionally, TSA and FTA officials said they would seek additional  resources for transit security. The current authorizing legislation for  federal surface transportation programs, TEA-21, expires on September 30,  2003. The reauthorization of TEA-21 provides an opportunity to examine  stakeholders\u2019 roles and responsibilities for transit security, including  federal funding responsibilities.", "Since requests for funding transit security improvements will likely exceed  available resources, an approach for distributing the federal dollars is  needed. Transit agency officials we met with identified a number of  possible federal funding criteria, including ridership levels, the population  of the city the transit agency serves, identified vulnerabilities of the agency,  the potential for mass casualties, and assets of the agency (e.g., tunnels and  bridges). In general, the transit agency officials we spoke with believed the  federal government should direct its dollars to agencies that are most at  risk or most vulnerable to a terrorist attack\u2014a criterion consistent with a  risk management approach. A risk management approach is a systematic  process to analyze threats, vulnerabilities, and the criticality (or relative  importance) of assets to better support key decisions linking resources  with prioritized efforts for results. Figure 9 illustrates that the highest risks  and priorities emerge where the three parts of a risk management approach  overlap. For example, transit infrastructure that is determined to be a  critical asset, vulnerable to attack, and a likely target would be at most risk  and therefore would be a higher priority for funding compared with  infrastructure that was only vulnerable to attack.", "We have advocated using a risk management approach to guide federal  programs and responses to better prepare against terrorism and other  threats and to better direct finite national resources to areas of highest  priority. FTA and TSA have not developed funding criteria or an approach  to distribute funding for transit security. However, the agencies have the  needed information to apply a risk management approach. For example,  FTA obtains threat information from a variety of sources, including the FBI,  and is in the process of identifying the most critical transit infrastructure.  In addition, FTA has vulnerability information from the security  assessments it recently performed. Moreover, according to TSA officials,  TSA used a risk management approach to recently distribute grants to  seaports and is researching best practices for using risk management  assessments.", "In addition to a funding approach, goals and performance indicators need  to be established to guide the federal government\u2019s efforts in transit  security. These critical components can influence all decisions\u2014from  launching new initiatives to allocating resources\u2014as well as measure  progress and ensure accountability. The Congress has long recognized the  need to objectively assess the results of federal programs, passing the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (commonly referred to  as the Results Act). The Results Act required agencies to set strategic and  annual goals, measure performance, and report on the degree to which  goals are met. However, goals or outcomes of where the nation should be in  terms of transit security or other national security programs have yet to be  defined. For example, as we reported this summer, the National Strategy  for Homeland Security does not establish a baseline set of performance  goals and measures for assessing and improving preparedness. Moreover,  the goals and measures for transit safety and security in the Department of  Transportation\u2019s current strategic plan were developed before September  11 and focus more on safety and crime than on terrorism. Consequently,  they do not reflect today\u2019s realities or the changing role of the federal  government in transit security. Given the recent and proposed increases in  security funding, such as the DOD supplemental that provided about $23.5  million for transit security, as well as the need for real and meaningful  improvements in preparedness, establishing clear goals is critical to  ensuring both a successful and a fiscally responsible effort. Moreover,  performance indicators are needed to track progress toward these  established goals.", "Another important consideration is the design of policy instruments to  deliver assistance. Our previous work on federal programs suggests that  the choice and design of policy instruments have important consequences  for performance and accountability. The federal government has a variety  of policy tools, including grants, loan guarantees, regulations, tax  incentives, and partnerships, to motivate or mandate state and local  governments or the private sector to help address security concerns. The  choice and design of policy tools can enhance the government\u2019s capacity to  (1) target the areas of highest risk to better ensure that scarce federal  resources address the most pressing needs, (2) promote the sharing of  responsibilities among all parties, and (3) track and assess progress toward  achieving national goals. Regardless of the tool selected, specific  safeguards and clear accountability requirements, such as documentation  of the terms and conditions of federal participation, are needed to protect  federal interests."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Securing the nation\u2019s transit system is not a short-term or easy task. Many  challenges must be overcome. FTA and the transit agencies we visited have  made a good start in enhancing transit security, but more work is needed.  Transit agencies\u2019 calls for increased federal funding for security needs join  the list of competing claims for federal dollars and, as a result, difficult  trade-offs will have to be made. Since requests for federal assistance will  undoubtedly exceed available resources, criteria will be needed for determining  which transit security improvements merit any additional federal funds. To  ensure that finite resources are directed to the areas of highest priority, the  criteria should be in line with a risk management approach. In addition to  helping distribute funds, establishing a risk-based funding approach would  inform congressional decision making and demonstrate to the Congress  that the funds will be managed efficiently. Moreover, as the federal  government\u2019s role in transit security expands\u2014whether through additional  funding or the setting of national standards by TSA\u2014it is important that  goals and performance indicators are established to guide the government\u2019s  efforts in transit security. These components are needed to ensure  accountability and results.", "The upcoming reauthorization of the surface transportation authorizing  legislation provides an opportunity to examine the role of the federal  government, including its funding responsibilities, in transit security.  However, transit agencies cannot wait for the new authorizing legislation to  implement transit security improvements and are moving forward with  improvements to enhance the security of their system and passengers. The  federal government could assist transit agencies as they press forward with  their security initiatives by allowing all transit agencies, regardless of the  size of the population it serves, to use urbanized area formula funds for  security-related operating expenses. Although eliminating the prohibition  on urbanized area funds would not provide additional funding, it would  give agencies increased flexibility in financing transit security  enhancements so that they could decide, for example, to use their federal  dollars to pay for additional security patrols instead of a new rail car. This  additional flexibility would be especially helpful given the high costs of  transit security improvements and the declining revenues of many  agencies. Additionally, the Department of Transportation could help transit  agency officials obtain timely intelligence information so that they can  make better informed decisions about their agency\u2019s emergency planning  and response. The transit Information Sharing and Analysis Center is a  positive step in providing some transit agencies timely intelligence  information. The Department of Transportation could take other steps as  well, including helping transit agency officials obtain security clearances,  to further enhance the sharing of critical intelligence information to transit  agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide transit agencies greater flexibility in paying for transit security  improvements, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation  consider seeking a legislative change to allow all transit agencies,  regardless of the size of the urbanized area they serve, to use federal  urbanized area formula funds for security-related operating expenses.

We selected these agencies  because they represent different geographical areas and operate transit  systems of different sizes and modes. (See fig. 10 and table 1.) During our  site visits, we interviewed key officials from the transit agencies and the  respective city governments and reviewed the transit agencies\u2019 emergency  plans.", "In addition to our site visits, we surveyed a sample of 200 transit agencies.  The sample from which we drew our population consisted of all transit  agencies throughout the nation that are eligible to receive federal  urbanized area formula funding, according to the most up-to-date list of  eligible agencies provided by the National Transit Database. The results of  our mail survey are generalizable to this population, which we refer to as  our sample population.", "We stratified our sample population into two groups\u2014agencies that serve  urbanized areas with a population of 200,000 or more (large urbanized  areas); and agencies that serve urbanized areas with a population of 50,000  to 199,999 (small urbanized areas). We distinguished between these two  strata because agencies that operate in large urbanized areas are prohibited  from using federal urbanized area formula funds for operating expenses,  whereas agencies in small urbanized areas are not prohibited from using  FTA funds for operating expenses. We randomly selected 100 agencies from  each stratum to survey.", "Our overall survey response rate was 78 percent. However, we excluded 9  surveys from our analysis after determining that these transit agencies  were outside the scope of our review for one of the following reasons: they  had gone out of business (3); they were subsidiaries of other agencies  included in our sample (2); or they did not provide bus, customized  community transport, rail, subway, or ferryboat services (e.g., they only  provide vanpool service) (4). The reported survey results are based on the  responses of the subpopulation of 146 agencies within the scope of our  review.", "To help design our survey instrument, we reviewed surveys on transit  safety and security conducted by FTA, the American Public Transportation  Association (APTA), and the Transportation Cooperative Research  Program. We also obtained input from Department of Transportation, FTA,  and transit agency officials; and representatives from APTA and the Mineta  Transportation Institute. After developing the survey instrument, we  pretested the content and format of the survey with officials from several  transit agencies and made necessary revisions.   All returned  questionnaires were reviewed, and we called respondents to obtain  information when questions were not answered or clarification was  needed. All data were double-keyed and verified during data entry, and  computer analyses were performed to identify any inconsistencies or other  indications of error. A copy of the mail questionnaire is included in  appendix I.", "All sample surveys are subject to sampling error\u2014that is, the extent to  which the survey results differ from what would have been obtained if the  whole population had been observed. Measures of sampling error are  defined by two elements, the width of the confidence intervals around the  estimate (sometimes called the precision of the estimate) and the  confidence level at which the intervals are computed. Because we followed  a probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only  one of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Moreover,  because each sample could have provided different estimates, we express  our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95- percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 5 percentage points). This  is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95 percent  of the samples we could have drawn.

In addition,  other potential sources of error associated with surveys, such as  misinterpretation of a question and nonresponse, may be present, although  nonresponse errors should be minimal.", "Finally, in addition to our site visits and survey, we analyzed agency  documents and interviewed transit agency officials, industry  representatives, and academic experts.
