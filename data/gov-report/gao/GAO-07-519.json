Congress must give its consent to compacts that affect the balance of power between the states and the federal government. An example of a congressionally approved environment and natural resource compact is the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, which created the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency (TRPA) to administer its provisions. For such compacts, GAO determined (1) the organizational structures, powers and authorities, and dispute resolution and public accountability mechanisms; (2) the extent to which concerns have been raised about the structure and governance of compacts that have commissions; and (3) how the structure and governance of TRPA compares to those of other similar compact commissions. GAO reviewed 59 congressionally approved compacts and surveyed those 45 that had commissions."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Forty-six of the 59 congressionally approved environment and natural resource compacts that GAO reviewed had established interstate commissions to administer the compact, while the remainder relied on existing state agencies. The 46 compacts with commissions varied in their organizational structure, powers and authorities, and means of resolving disputes, but were similar in how they ensured public accountability. For example, commission size ranged from 2 to 48 members, and some commissions had regulatory authority, while others had only advisory authority. Twenty-six percent of the compacts had provisions for resolving disputes. However, about 36 percent of the commissions responding to GAO's survey reported that they had used means other than litigation to resolve disputes. Significantly more, about 94 percent, of the commissions reported having procedures for ensuring public accountability, such as holding public meetings and allowing public input. For the 13 compacts that did not have commissions, GAO found variations in their powers and authorities, and few of these compacts provided mechanisms for dispute resolution or public accountability. Interstate compact commissions reported that significant concerns about their structure and governance have rarely been raised. When concerns did arise about organizational structure and public accountability, they varied from commission to commission. However, concerns about regulatory authority largely centered on the scope of the commission's authority. In addition, a number of compact officials believed that concerns about commission structure and governance often reflected disagreements with specific commission actions rather than actual concerns about the organizational structure, public accountability, or regulatory authority of the commission itself. The Tahoe Regional Planning Agency is generally similar in organizational structure and governance to three other interstate compact commissions with comparable functions--the Columbia River Gorge, Delaware River Basin, and Susquehanna River Basin Commissions. All four commissions consist of appointed representatives, although their size and composition vary; they all have an administrative appeals process to resolve disputes, and they use similar accountability mechanisms. A major difference between the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency and the other commissions relates to the breadth of its authority regarding land use issues. This authority extends to water, air, and other natural resources, as well as public health and safety, whereas the Columbia River Gorge Commission has more limited land use authority, and the Delaware and Susquehanna River Basin Commissions have no land use authority."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Interstate compacts are legal agreements between two or more states that  Interstate compacts are legal agreements between two or more states that  are designed to resolve problems or concerns that transcend state lines.  are designed to resolve problems or concerns that transcend state lines.

The framework  varies widely and depends largely on the subject matter, scope, and  complexity of the compact agreement. In some cases, the compact does  little more than prescribe certain conditions with which the member states  must comply or require the states to cooperate in furthering the purposes  of the compact. In such cases, the states often assign the compact\u2019s  administration and implementation to existing agencies or officials within  the member states. By doing so, the states can coordinate their resources  to avoid duplicating efforts or costs, take advantage of economies of scale,  and promote more effective management of issues common to the  member states. For example, some interstate water allocation compacts  that distribute fixed quantities of water to each of the member states\u2014 such as the Snake River Compact\u2014assign administrative responsibility to  the official in each state who is in charge of managing the public water  supply.", "In contrast, some compacts involve more complex interstate matters that  require greater coordination among states, such as the disposal of low- level radioactive waste. In such cases, states are more likely to delegate  authority to an interstate agency\u2014typically called a commission\u2014that is  created to administer and implement the compact\u2019s provisions. The  nature of each commission\u2019s authority varies and can range from advising  states on interstate problems to regulating activities of mutual concern. In  general, compact commissions consist of representatives of the member  states, typically called commissioners. The commissioners are usually  appointed by elected officials or serve by virtue of their elected position,  such as governor, or their role as a federal, state, or local government  official. For example, to administer the provisions of the Tahoe Regional  Planning Compact, the states of California and Nevada created the Tahoe  Regional Planning Agency (TRPA), which includes representatives from  the two states and the federal government. Many compact commissions  are funded, in whole or in part, by the member states. Although the federal  government may provide grants or participate in some compact programs,  compact commissions generally operate independently of the federal  government. Since interstate compact commissions are neither federal in  nature nor state in scope, they occupy what some have referred to as a  \u201cthird tier\u201d of government.", "Because of your interest in congressionally approved interstate compacts  that address environment and natural resource issues and, in particular,  the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, this report describes (1) the  approaches used to administer congressionally approved environment and  natural resource compacts, including their organizational structure,  powers and authorities, and mechanisms for resolving disputes and  providing public accountability; (2) the extent to which concerns have  been raised regarding the structure and governance of those compacts,  like the Tahoe Regional Planning Compact, that have commissions; and  (3) specifically, how the structure and governance of TRPA compares to  those of other similar compact commissions.", "To conduct this review, we identified and reviewed 59 congressionally  approved interstate compacts that address environment and natural  resource management issues, interviewed compact experts and officials,  and surveyed compact commission officials on the approaches used to  structure and govern their compacts and the extent to which concerns  have been raised regarding these approaches. We surveyed officials from  only 45 of the 46 compacts that established commissions, because 1  commission was not yet operational at the time of our review. We received  responses from 36 of the 45 compact commissions we surveyed, for a  response rate of 80 percent. In addition, using the survey results, we  identified 3 compact commissions that have functions similar to those of  TRPA: the Columbia River Gorge Commission, the Delaware River Basin  Commission, and the Susquehanna River Basin Commission. To compare  TRPA to these three commissions, we interviewed commission staff in  Stateline, Nevada; White Salmon, Washington; West Trenton, New Jersey;  and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. In addition, we reviewed commission  documents and activities, and interviewed compact stakeholders,  including commission members; federal, state, and local government  officials; environmentalists; and members of the business community,  among others.

Traditionally, compacts were  negotiated by special joint commissions appointed by the state governors.  Increasingly, however, compacts have been formulated by interested  groups of state officials or other stakeholders and then recommended to  the state legislatures. In either case, each state legislature accepts the  compact by enacting a law that adopts the terms of the agreement. When  the required number of states have enacted such a law, the compact is  formed.", "In cases where the compact affects the balance of power between the  federal government and the states, the states must obtain the consent of  Congress for the compact to be valid. Congress generally gives its consent  in one of three ways: (1) after the fact, by passing legislation that  specifically recognizes and consents to the compact as enacted by the  states; (2) in advance, by passing legislation encouraging states to enter  into a specified compact or compacts for specified purposes; or (3)  implied after the fact, when actions by the states and the federal  government indicate that Congress has granted its consent even in the  absence of a specific legislative act. In addition, Congress may impose  conditions as part of granting its consent, and it typically reserves the right  to alter, amend, or repeal its consent. Any proposed amendment to a  compact must follow the compact approval process, unless the compact  specifies otherwise.", "The use of interstate compacts has changed over time in terms of number,  subject matter, and scope. Of the 32 compacts enacted between 1789 and  1920, most resolved boundary disputes between 2 neighboring states. As  the twentieth century progressed, states increasingly used interstate  compacts to address complex problems that were not confined to their  borders, such as apportioning interstate waters, supervising out-of-state  offenders under community supervision, and constructing and  administering bridges and shared port facilities. According to the Council  of State Governments, more than 200 interstate compacts exist  nationwide, with each state belonging to an average of 25 compacts. Along  with the increasing numbers and subjects covered, interstate compacts  have also expanded their range of coverage from 2 states to as many as 50  and may also include the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, U.S.  territories, and Canadian provinces as signatories.", "Over one-third of the compacts that exist today deal with environment and  natural resource issues. Although a large number of these compacts deal  with water allocation, they address other subjects as well.", "In addition to addressing a variety of subjects, the scope of these  environment and natural resource compacts ranges from 2 to as many as  30 states, and includes, in some cases, the District of Columbia, Canadian  provinces, or the United States as signatories. As table 1 shows, about  three-fourths of these compacts have received congressional approval.", "Prior to the 1920s, existing agencies and officials within compact states  routinely administered interstate compacts. However, as states began to  jointly tackle issues of greater complexity and broader geographic scope,  the use of interstate commissions gained popularity. The majority of the  compacts enacted since 1970 have established interstate commissions.  These commissions consist of appointed representatives of each  compacting state, called commissioners, who are responsible for  administering the compact\u2019s provisions. Additionally, commissions may  employ technical and other staff to assist in the compact\u2019s administration.  In some cases, commissions will hire an executive director who is  responsible for administering the commission\u2019s daily operations in  accordance with the commission\u2019s direction and policies.

The commissions established by the 46  compacts we reviewed varied in size and interests represented. In all  cases, the commissioners were appointed to serve\u2014generally by elected  officials or by virtue of their state office, such as governor or head of a  state natural resources department. However, the number of  commissioners ranged from 2 to 48, with each state generally having an  equal number of commissioners. For example, the Rocky Mountain Low- Level Radioactive Waste Compact required that each of its three member  states appoint one representative to the commission, while the New  England Interstate Water Pollution Control Compact required that each of  its seven member states appoint 5 commissioners. Depending on the  compact, there were as few as 1 and as many as 7 commissioners from  each state. Of the 46 compacts, 15 explicitly required member states to  appoint commissioners to represent additional interests. For example, 11  compacts provided for local representation, 4 required the appointment of  a knowledgeable citizen from each state, and 1 required the appointment  of an industry representative from each state. In addition, 18 of the 46  compacts, such as the Connecticut River Valley Flood Control Compact,  specified the number of commissioners from each state, but left it to each  state to decide how to choose its commissioners.", "Of the 46 compacts with commissions that we reviewed, 21 provided for a  federal representative on the commission. For 16 of these compacts, the  President appointed the federal representative; the other 5 compacts  named an official of a specified federal agency, such as the Director of the  U.S. Geological Survey. While nearly half of the compacts with  commissions had federal representation, only 4 of these compacts\u2014the  Connecticut River Atlantic Salmon, the Delaware River Basin, the  Susquehanna River Basin, and the Upper Colorado River Basin  Compacts\u2014explicitly gave the federal representative the power to vote on  commission decisions or actions.", "Staff. Compacts also varied in their provisions for staff to conduct day-to- day operations and provide technical assistance to the commissions. Only  8 of the 46 compacts explicitly required that their commissions hire staff,  an additional 34 compacts left it to the commissions\u2019 discretion to hire  staff, and 4 compacts made no provisions for staff.

In other cases, the  compacts explicitly granted commissions the authority to issue  regulations. For example, the Ohio River Valley Water Sanitation  Commission has the authority to set water pollution control standards for  the Ohio River. We also found cases where the commissions had both  advisory and regulatory authority. For example, the Delaware River Basin  Commission studies and advises states on approaches to water  management, but also regulates water quality and water supply. In some  cases, we had difficulty determining from a compact\u2019s language whether  the commission was advisory or regulatory in nature.

California and Nevada each have 7 members, including 4  statewide and 3 local representatives, and the federal government has a  representative. All 7 California board members are appointed by elected  officials. Four Nevada board members are appointed by elected officials, 2  serve by virtue of their state office, and 1 is appointed at-large by the other  Nevada members. The federal representative is appointed by the  President. All board members, except the federal representative, can vote  on matters before the commission.

According  to DRBC and SRBC officials, the designee is typically the head of the  state\u2019s natural resources or environmental protection department. The  federal representative is an officer of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers  appointed by the President. Unlike the federal representatives on TRPA  and the CRGC, the federal representatives on the DRBC and the SRBC can  vote on commission matters, because the United States is a party to the  compacts.", "Staff. Like the three other commissions, TRPA employs an executive  director who is responsible for administering the commission\u2019s day-to-day  operations in accordance with the commissioners\u2019 direction and policies.

The advisory planning commission holds hearings, reviews proposed  amendments to TRPA\u2019s plans and ordinances, and makes  recommendations to the governing board. In addition, TRPA\u2019s governing  board has formed four advisory committees, composed of board members,  to review and make recommendations to the board on legal, operational,  public education and outreach, and local government matters. Similar to  TRPA, both the DRBC and the SRBC have established ongoing issue- related advisory committees that sometimes include members of the  public. For example, the DRBC has established a flood advisory  committee and the SRBC an agricultural water use committee.

In addition, TRPA,  like the CRGC and the DRBC, also uses mediation as an alternative  process for resolving disputes.

Specifically, under its compact, TRPA is required to adopt environmental  standards to protect the natural environment and to maintain public health  and safety within the Tahoe region. The nine standards adopted by TRPA  address air quality, water quality, soil conservation, wildlife habitat, fish  habitat, vegetation preservation, noise, recreation, and scenic resources.  After setting the standards, TRPA was required to adopt a regional plan  and ordinances to achieve and maintain the standards. The ordinances  were required to contain, at minimum, standards for water purity and  clarity; subdivision; zoning; tree removal; solid waste disposal; sewage  disposal; landfills; excavations; cuts and grading; piers, harbors,  breakwaters or channels, and other shoreline developments; waste  disposal in shoreline areas; waste disposal from boats; mobile home parks;  house relocation; outdoor advertising; flood plain protection; soil and  sedimentation control; air pollution; and watershed protection. Further,  these ordinances preempt the regulations of local and state agencies in the  region, unless such regulations are stricter, and must be interpreted  consistently with federal laws that may also apply within the Lake Tahoe  region. Any project that may substantially affect the land, water, or any  other natural resources of the Lake Tahoe region must comply with  applicable provisions of the compact, the regional plan, ordinances, and  rules and regulations.", "In comparison to TRPA, the CRGC is more limited in its land use planning  authority. Whereas TRPA is broadly responsible for how and to what  extent land\u2014as well as water, air, and other natural resources\u2014is used  within the region, the CRGC only regulates the use of land when it affects  cultural, natural, recreational, or scenic resources. For example, unlike  TRPA, the CRGC cannot regulate land use for public health and safety,  such as natural hazards, or for noise. Further, the CRGC can set and  enforce standards only when a county fails to enact land use ordinances  consistent with the commission\u2019s management plan, and only one of the  six counties in the Scenic Area has failed to do so. In contrast, neither the  DRBC nor the SRBC has regulatory authority over land use; instead, local  jurisdictions have such authority.

For example, we pretested the survey with three compact  commission officials and used their feedback to refine the survey. Also, to  reduce survey nonresponse, we sent e-mail reminders and conducted  follow-up telephone calls with nonrespondents. Overall, officials from 36  of the 45 compacts in our sampling frame responded to our survey, for a  response rate of 80 percent.
