Related to the intended use of performance  information, DHS explains for each performance measure discussed in  this appendix how it uses the measure for decision making. For example,  DHS explains that its measure of the number of convicted criminal aliens  removed from the country reflects the \u201cfull impact\u201d of its program activities  in this area.

Labor officials referred us to other agency  publications\u2013The Department of Labor FY 2014-2018 Strategic Plan and  The Department of Labor FY 2016 Congressional Budget Justification\u2013for  explanation to the public of the activities they said their agency was taking  to ensure the quality of its performance information. We confirmed that  these publications do describe the agency\u2019s research and evaluation  agenda. For example, Labor states in its strategic plan that it is committed  to improving the quality of performance information by conducting future  evaluations to ensure the outcome data it reports are accurate. While  Labor\u2019s strategic plan does not explain the extent to which these data  quality studies will focus on issues related to its APGs, Labor does  provide valuable information and important context on how it plans to  ensure the quality of its performance information. Nevertheless,  GPRAMA\u2019s performance information quality requirements are important  because our previous work on fragmentation, overlap, and duplication  shows that Labor needs to report more transparently on program  performance for its veterans\u2019 employment and training programs. This  relates to one of Labor\u2019s APGs on improving employment outcomes for  veterans. Specifically, we reported in 2012 that Labor provided Congress  with an annual veterans\u2019 program report that provided certain  performance information, such as the number of disabled and recently  separated veterans who received intensive services. But, we found that  Labor was not reporting these results relative to the performance goals it  had set.  We recommended in our prior work that Labor report both  performance goals and associated performance outcomes for its  veterans\u2019 employment and training programs. Labor agreed with our  recommendation and has made some progress in addressing it. For  example, Labor has reported on how the results achieved for the  performance measure it uses to measure progress on one of its APGs  (percent of veterans receiving intensive services served by Disabled  Veterans Outreach Program specialists) compare to the targets it set.  Labor provided this information for this performance measure in both its  performance report and on Performance.gov.", "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Described Its  Overall Approach for Ensuring Performance Information Quality, but Does  Not Explain How Performance Information Quality for its APGs Is  Ensured  NASA\u2019s performance plans and reports characterize the agency as a  performance-based organization committed to managing toward specific,  measurable goals, and to using performance information to continually  improve operations. As shown in table 6, these performance plans and  reports explain how the agency ensures the quality of its performance  information overall. For example, NASA stated in its performance plans  and reports that it held internal reviews for its projects, determined  technology readiness levels, and required mission directorates and  mission support offices to submit evidence supporting all performance  measure ratings.such as scientific review committees and aeronautics technical evaluation  bodies, to help it validate program performance. These statements  provide valuable insight into how NASA measures its performance and  uses evidence.", "Further, NASA stated that it used external entities,  However, NASA\u2019s performance plans and reports did not explain how the  agency ensured the quality of performance information for individual  APGs. NASA presented concise summaries of each APG, progress  updates, and next steps. However, there was little explanation provided  for external audiences which described how NASA took the approach it  has outlined for ensuring the overall quality of its performance  information, and applied this approach to individual APGs.", "In our discussions with NASA officials, they emphasized that they do  collect information related to all of the GPRAMA requirements. To  illustrate this, NASA officials demonstrated their internal Performance  Measure Manager system to us in April 2015.  NASA officials told us that  the system functions as a warehouse for agency performance information  and they upload information from the system to Performance.gov for  quarterly APG updates and to help develop their performance plans and  reports. They showed us that this system collects information on the  quality of performance information for a range of performance measures,  including for APGs. For example, the internal database has a field for  verification and validation materials for the James Webb Space  Telescope APG, and identifies a data limitation for it.  However, NASA  does not publicly report all of the information the system collects on how it  ensures the quality of performance information for its APGs.", "NASA officials expressed concern about how well the GPRAMA  performance information quality requirements can be applied to their  agency\u2019s performance reporting. NASA officials said that they use what  GPRAMA and Office of Management and Budget Circular A-11 refer to as  an alternative form of performance measurement that, among other  things, allows an agency to use milestones for completing major  deliverables for the APG instead of performance measures.  They  further explained that they use numerous milestones to measure progress  on their APGs. They added that NASA only reports on key quarterly  milestones in its performance plans and reports and on  Performance.gov.  Unlike other agencies, they noted they often do not  have quantitative data sets for their performance information. However,  the GPRAMA performance information quality requirements apply to all  APGs, even if the agency is using milestones.", "As we noted in our 2015 High Risk update, NASA plans to invest billions  of dollars in the coming years to explore space, understand Earth\u2019s  environment, and conduct aeronautics research. We designated NASA\u2019s  acquisition management as high risk in 1990 in view of NASA\u2019s history of  persistent cost growth and schedule slippage in the majority of its major  projects. Going forward, we noted in our February 2015 high risk update  that it will be critical for NASA to ensure adequate and ongoing  assessments of risks related to two of its APGs for developing new  systems for exploring deep space and the James Webb Space  Telescope. However, as our review shows, NASA has not explained to  external audiences how it is ensuring the quality of performance  information for these APGs related to these high-risk areas. Without such  information, it will be more difficult for Congress and the public to  understand whether NASA is effectively measuring progress toward these  APGs, and whether the billions of dollars being spent to accomplish these  important efforts are being used effectively."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cross-Agency Working Group Could Help Agencies and OMB Improve Public Reporting on the Quality of Performance Information Used to Measure Progress on Priority Goals", "paragraphs": ["In 2015, OMB and the Performance Improvement Council (PIC)  established the Data Quality Cross-Agency Working Group.

The PIC\u2019s Executive Director and her staff also noted that this end  product could include providing recommendations to OMB on changes  that could be made to the A-11 guidance on how to address GPRAMA\u2019s  performance information quality requirements. OMB staff also indicated to  us that they would like to get input from the group on additional changes  that could be made to A-11.

More recently, agencies have also been required to  report on Performance.gov on how they will ensure the accuracy and  reliability of the performance information used to measure progress on  each of their highest priority performance goals, the APGs. However,  insufficient progress has been made. While OMB for several years has  directed agencies to discuss the quality of APG performance information  in their annual performance plans and reports, the selected agencies\u2019  plans and reports often did not. OMB recently changed its guidance to  require agencies to provide this information for publication on  Performance.gov. The next key step is to build upon this recent guidance  to implement the change and make this important information readily  accessible to the public and Congress.", "This overall lack of transparency means that members of Congress,  citizens, journalists, and researchers seeking information about agency  performance related to priority goals have to search in multiple places,  and often end up finding no explanation of the quality of performance  information for APGs. For agencies to maintain the confidence of  Congress and the public that they are indeed achieving their priority goals  for the challenging and complex results they seek to achieve, agencies  will need to provide more transparent explanations of how they are  ensuring the accuracy and reliability of performance information for their  APGs.", "More broadly, our review shows that five agencies continue to provide  limited information in their annual performance plans and reports  concerning the quality of performance information for their APGs. The  same is true for all six agencies on Performance.gov. In some cases, the  needed context and information may be available within the agency for  the agency\u2019s use. However, this information is not consistently provided  to external audiences. The Performance Improvement Council\u2019s (PIC)  Data Quality Cross-Agency Working Group provides a potential forum for  agencies to collaborate and share information on this topic, and the group  is defining its intended end product. Given the shortcomings our review  identified at the majority of the six agencies reviewed, the working group  could help agencies identify practices that will help them more clearly  explain to Congress and the public how they are ensuring that the  performance information for their highest priority performance goals is  accurate and reliable.

Interior and NASA\u2019s  written responses are reproduced in appendixes II and III.", "In its response, NASA also shared a concern about how we portrayed its  high-risk reporting in the draft report. It stated that our draft report  suggested that the select milestones identified as part of its performance  reporting are the sole mechanisms NASA uses to assess risks and  measure progress towards launching the James Webb Space Telescope,  and developing new systems for human exploration of deep space. NASA  further stated that to comply with reporting requirements related to APGs,  it has opted to provide information on key quarterly milestones that the  public can easily understand. To address NASA\u2019s concern, we revised  the report to recognize that NASA officials told us they use numerous  milestones to measure progress on their APGs. NASA also said that it  only reports on key quarterly milestones in its performance plans and  reports, and on Performance.gov. NASA also provided technical  clarifications, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) also concurred with the  recommendation directed to it. However, DHS stated that it has already  taken action to implement our recommendation to work with OMB to  describe on Performance.gov how DHS is ensuring the quality of  performance information used to measure progress towards its APGs.  Thus, DHS regards the recommendation as resolved and closed. DHS  stated that on July 1, 2015, agency officials in its Office of Program  Analysis and Evaluation provided OMB with several specific suggestions  to consider as possible enhancements to the internal system that OMB  uses to gather agency data for public posting on Performance.gov. This  will allow agencies to include more comprehensive data quality  information on this public website. DHS\u2019s efforts are an important step  toward addressing our recommendation. However, as our review found,  and DHS recognizes in its response letter, more will need to be done to  make DHS\u2019s explanations of performance information quality for its APGs  accessible to external audiences on Performance.gov. For example, in  our report we noted that OMB\u2019s updated A-11 guidance in June 2015  gives agencies the option of providing a hyperlink from Performance.gov  to an appendix in their performance reports containing their performance  information quality discussion, which DHS could do. We will continue to  monitor DHS\u2019s efforts to work with OMB to fully implement the  recommendation. DHS\u2019s written comments are reproduced in appendix  IV.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) partially concurred with the  recommendations directed to it. DOD stated that it has ongoing actions to  improve the quality of performance information, and to make better use of  that information in management. However, DOD stated that it did not  agree that making discussion of the process of managing the quality of  performance information a part of either the agency strategic plan or  annual reporting has any major management value. We disagree. First,  GPRAMA does not require, nor did we recommend, that DOD provide  information on the quality of performance information for its agency  priority goals in its agency strategic plan. Second, GPRAMA does require  that this information be provided in agency performance plans and reports  and on Performance.gov. We continue to believe it is important for DOD  to fully address these GPRAMA requirements because, as described in  our report, two of DOD\u2019s APGs address areas we have identified as high  risk. Also, DOD is responsible for more than half of the federal  government\u2019s discretionary spending.
