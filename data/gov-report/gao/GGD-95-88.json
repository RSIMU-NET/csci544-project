In particular, the report discusses the number, size, and industry class of corporations that paid AMT over the period 1987 through 1992; why they were liable for it; whether AMT achieved its purpose; and how AMT might affect corporate investment. AMT was substantially revised by Congress in 1986 to ensure that no corporate taxpayer with substantial economic income avoids significant tax liability by using exclusions, deductions, and credits. In addition, Congress made changes to AMT so that corporations that reported significant income on their financial statements for a particular year would pay some tax in that year. AMT raised almost $2.6 billion in net tax revenue in 1992."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The legislative history of AMT refers to three distinct measures of income: economic income, financial statement or \u201cbook\u201d income, and income as defined for tax purposes. A calculation of economic income would include all types of income, recognize all income when it is earned rather than when it is received, subtract all the costs of earning the income, and make adjustments for inflation. Because such a comprehensive measurement would not be based solely on market transactions, it is not done in practice. Financial statements include a comprehensive measure of income based on historical records that can be verified. In contrast to economic income, financial statement or book income does not adjust values for inflation and does not recognize certain items of income until they are received. The definition of income implicit in the tax code combines a measure of taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay taxes with the desire to encourage certain activities through the tax code and to minimize the difficulty of administering and complying with the tax law. Despite many similarities, the three measures are substantially different from each other. The purpose of AMT is to better coordinate the definition of income for tax purposes with that of economic income and financial statement income.", "Corporations are required to calculate their tax liability under two sets of rules\u2014computing their regular tax liability and their tentative AMT liability, and paying whichever is greater. If the tentative AMT is more than the regular tax, the difference between them is AMT. AMT is described in sections 55 through 59 of the Internal Revenue Code.", "Corporations have to keep records to calculate AMT as well as the regular tax. For tax year 1994, a corporation had to file Form 4626\u2014used to figure AMT\u2014if its taxable income or loss before the net operating loss deduction, plus its adjustments and preferences, totaled more than the lesser of $40,000 or the corporation\u2019s allowable exemption amount. The corporate AMT was cited by all 17 corporations we interviewed in preparing for testimony last year as among the provisions in the Internal Revenue Code with the largest recordkeeping and compliance cost burden.", "The AMT rate is 20 percent, lower than the regular corporate tax rate of 35 percent now or 34 percent through 1992. However, AMT is levied on a broader tax base than the regular tax because the AMT tax base includes certain regular tax preferences and adjustments that either delay the time when income is recognized or exclude income items altogether.", "Two important AMT adjustments are related to depreciation and financial statement income. Depreciation is the cost incurred by a business reflecting the reduction in value of certain of its assets over time. For both the regular tax and AMT, the amount of depreciation deductions taken in a year is a certain fraction of the original purchase price of the assets. Compared with the regular tax, deductions for depreciation under AMT are smaller in the early years after an asset is placed in service and are spread out over a longer time.", "The book income and the adjusted current earnings (ACE) adjustments were established to ensure that firms reporting large earnings on their financial statements in a given year paid some tax in that year. Book income reported on financial statements may not equal taxable income on tax returns because some items of revenue and expenses are never included in one or the other or are reported in different years. As a result, book income may not be equal to the taxable income figure on tax returns, as explained in appendix III. The book income adjustment was part of AMT from 1987 through 1989. It was replaced by the ACE adjustment in 1990. The ACE adjustment relies on income tax principles to define income in a way that Congress intended to be as broad as the definition of book income.", "AMT limits the amount of a corporation\u2019s net operating losses from prior years that can be deducted in calculating current year\u2019s income to 90 percent of tentative taxable income computed under AMT rules. In addition, it disallows the use of many credits available in the regular tax and specifically restricts the amount of foreign tax credit that can be taken for tax payments abroad.", "AMT is also linked to the regular tax through the AMT credit. Corporations that have paid AMT can credit these payments against their regular tax liability in future years when they pay the regular tax. However, the credit cannot be used to reduce regular tax liability below tentative AMT liability in future years. With this crediting mechanism, AMT operates partially as a prepayment of tax rather than as a permanent increase in tax liability.

These numbers must be combined with the fact that recovery of AMT liability via the AMT credit has been growing, albeit slowly, as shown in figure 1. Most corporations that paid AMT in 1987 had not fully recovered their payment by 1991, the last year we were able to examine, but the total dollar volume of credits used rose from year to year."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Which Corporations Paid AMT?", "paragraphs": ["The total number of corporations paying AMT was small. About 28,000, or about 1.3 percent of the 2.1 million corporations subject to AMT in 1992, paid AMT in 1992. The corresponding percentage ranged from 0.7 to 1.5 percent in the 1987 through 1992 period.", "Although only about 28,000 firms paid AMT in 1992, many more corporations were affected by it. For example, almost 400,000 corporations filed the AMT form with IRS in 1992 even though they owed no AMT.", "Of the approximately 2.1 million corporations that were subject to AMT in 1992, about 2,000 corporations with assets of $100 million or more paid 85 percent of the total corporate AMT liability. This was a pattern that generally held true for 1987 through 1991 also. As shown in figure 2, corporations with assets of $500 million or more paid 75 percent of all AMT in 1992, irrespective of the credit they may have received.", "However, most corporations that paid AMT from 1987 through 1992 were relatively small. In most years, more than 70 percent of corporations paying AMT had less than $10 million in assets. In 1992, 75 percent of AMT payers had less than $10 million in assets, as is also shown in figure 2. Nevertheless, relatively large corporations were more likely than smaller corporations to pay AMT. For instance, in all years except one, about 20 percent of corporations with assets of $500 million or more paid AMT; in contrast, no more than half of 1 percent of corporations with less than $1 million in assets paid AMT.", "The industries in which corporations paid the most AMT were manufacturing, transportation, and finance. At the industry level, AMT generally increased the amount of tax paid by about 1 or 2 percent of taxable income. Eight specific industry subclasses that we examined\u2014auto, steel, chemicals, utilities, transportation, paper, oil and gas extraction, and mining other than oil\u2014had generally higher percentages of AMT payers than existed in the nation as a whole during the 6 years we examined.", "Firms differed from each other in how often they paid AMT and the extent to which AMT increased their taxes. Of approximately 10,000 corporations with over $50 million in assets that we tracked over a 5-year period, about half paid AMT in at least one year. Of those that paid AMT at least once, most paid it for only one year. Only about 160 of the 10,000 corporations we studied paid AMT in all five years. In the larger universe of all AMT payers, about a third of the AMT payers that also paid regular tax had their taxes at least doubled by AMT."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why Did Corporations Pay AMT?", "paragraphs": ["By far the most important elements that caused corporations to pay AMT were the depreciation adjustment for property placed in service after 1986 and the book income and adjusted current earnings adjustments. For instance, in 1992 the depreciation adjustment was included on about 87 percent of AMT returns and raised taxable income by about $23 billion. The ACE adjustment was included on about 67 percent of AMT returns and raised taxable income by about $19 billion. No other preference item or adjustment was present in more than 10 percent of AMT returns.", "AMT also caused corporations to pay tax by limiting their ability to take net operating loss deductions and the foreign tax credit (FTC). About 32 percent of AMT payers in 1992 included net operating losses in their AMT calculations, and about 19 percent reached the limitation on the use of the deduction. About 3 percent of AMT payers had FTC as part of their AMT computation, and about one-fourth of FTC claimants were constrained by the 90 percent FTC limit. FTC claims reduced overall AMT before credits by 32 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Has AMT Achieved Its Purposes?", "paragraphs": ["AMT has partially achieved the congressional objectives of ensuring that taxpayers with substantial economic income in a given year, and taxpayers with positive book income in a given year, pay some tax in that year. By including tax preferences in its tax base and by more closely approximating economic depreciation when inflation is low, AMT leads to a tax more closely based on economic income. In addition, in every year from 1987 through 1992, at least 6,000 corporations with positive book income that paid no regular tax paid some AMT, and at least 9,000 corporations with positive book income subject to regular tax paid an additional AMT amount, as shown in appendix III."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AMT Leads to a Closer Measurement of Economic Income When Inflation Is Low", "paragraphs": ["A corporate tax based on economic income would deny many of the preferences and exclusions now in the regular tax code, index the value of assets and costs for inflation, and base depreciation deductions on economic depreciation. AMT moves the tax code closer to taxing economic income by including several preferences and exclusions in its tax base. With respect to inflation, neither the regular tax nor AMT rules adjust the measurement of income for inflation. Concerning depreciation, AMT depreciation rules lead to deductions that more closely approximate economic depreciation when inflation is low. However, AMT depreciation deviates further from economic income than does regular tax depreciation in the presence of moderate or high rates of inflation. AMT may also reduce the generous deductions of nominal interest expense (rather than inflation-adjusted interest expense) that corporations can claim at high rates of inflation. (App. III provides additional information on corporations\u2019 book income, economic income, and AMT depreciation rules.)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AMT Has Made More Corporations With Positive Book Income Pay Taxes", "paragraphs": ["In 1992, AMT provisions were successful in making about 9,900 corporations with positive book income and no regular tax liability pay some AMT, as shown in table 1. Also, about 13,800 corporations with positive book income subject to regular tax paid an additional AMT amount. About 4,300 corporations with negative book income also paid AMT\u20141,800 of these corporations paid both regular tax and AMT, and almost 2,500 of these corporations paid AMT but no regular tax. This payment of taxes by corporations with losses may have been due to the fact that some revenues were recognized for financial accounting purposes after they were included on tax returns and/or expenses were recorded in accounting records before they were deducted for tax purposes, as explained in appendix III.", "On the other hand, AMT did not reach all corporations with positive book income. Of 2.1 million corporate returns subject to AMT in 1992, about 306,000 corporate returns reported positive book income but did not pay regular or alternative minimum tax. The vast majority of these corporations were small and had less than $40,000 in net income, so they probably qualified for the AMT exemption. Of the larger corporations with positive book income, most were investment companies, which generally flow out all their income to shareholders. Because of this feature of their business, these companies are exempt from the book income and ACE adjustments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "How Might AMT Affect Corporate Investment?", "paragraphs": ["The effects of AMT on corporate investment are not clear. Studies and comments by economists have examined two ways in which AMT might affect investment: by (1) reducing cash flow and thus discouraging investment, or (2) changing marginal incentives to invest, leading to changes in investment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Cash Flow", "paragraphs": ["Corporations finance investment through internal funds\u2014retained earnings or profits\u2014or external funds such as debt or new stock issues. For corporations that must use external sources and pay significantly higher costs compared to their opportunity costs (earnings from investing their own funds), investment could be sensitive to the current profitability or cash-flow position of the firm.", "A number of recent studies have found significant effects of cash flow on investment, and some authors have concluded that some corporations find external funds significantly more expensive than internal funds. These studies have concluded that this is more likely to be the case for smaller firms, firms that pay relatively small amounts of dividends, firms that do not participate in the corporate bond market, and firms that cannot use working capital to smooth investment spending over time. Thus, for such firms, AMT might reduce investment by reducing cash flow and forcing them to finance investment with costly external funds.", "It is not clear how many AMT payers meet these conditions. No study has directly tested the extent to which such cash-flow constraints affect corporations that paid AMT. The tax return data we used were limited in their ability to directly test many of these factors. However, the data did show that most AMT is paid by relatively large corporations. To the extent that investment by large corporations is less dependent on current cash flow than is the case for small corporations, the effect of the AMT on investment would be limited. In addition, as AMT credits are reclaimed in the future, cash flow would increase at that time, possibly increasing investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Marginal Incentives to Invest", "paragraphs": ["Many studies have been done on the effects of corporate income taxes on marginal incentives to invest, and several have directly investigated the effects of the AMT on marginal incentives to invest. These studies have investigated how the regular corporate income tax and AMT might affect the incentive to invest through their tax rates, depreciation provisions, the deductibility of interest payments and the nondeductibility of dividends, loss provisions, and credits for certain types of investment. Relative to the regular tax, AMT has a lower rate, a generally slower depreciation schedule, and additional limitations on credits and losses. Because the lower tax rate by itself would lower the cost of investment but the other two features would raise the cost of investment, investment incentives may be increased or decreased relative to the regular tax.", "Several studies have investigated how AMT affects incentives to invest for corporations that are consistently paying AMT or recovering AMT credits over long periods. Studies we reviewed contained the following conclusions: Incentives to invest were greater under AMT than under the regular tax for firms permanently paying AMT that financed investments with equity. In this case, the value of the lower tax rate more than offset slower depreciation deductions, so the effective tax rate was lower. Investment incentives were reduced under AMT relative to the regular tax for debt-financed investments. Because interest is deductible under both AMT and the regular tax, a dollar of interest payments will reduce taxes by a greater amount under the higher regular tax rate.", "For investments financed with a mixture of debt and equity, investment incentives under AMT can be higher or lower than the regular tax, depending on the amount of debt used. For the mix of debt and equity described as typical by two authors, investment incentives are greater under AMT than under the regular tax.", "Another study addressed the more general situation where firms could switch from the regular tax to AMT or pay AMT and then return to the regular tax and recover all their AMT credits. In this circumstance, the effect of AMT on investment incentives is more complicated. In this case, the effect of taxes on the cost of capital investment will depend on the timing of investment relative to when and how long the corporation pays AMT, as well as on the source of financing for the investment. If depreciation deductions are taken when the firm is paying the regular tax, and income from the investment is received when the firm is paying AMT, the cost of investment is relatively low. If depreciation deductions are taken when the firm is paying AMT and income is taxed at the higher regular tax rate, the cost of investment is higher.", "Our analysis showed that the circumstance envisioned in this later study was the more common for AMT corporations\u2014such firms were more likely to switch between the regular tax and AMT. We tracked the 1987 through 1991 tax situations of 10,000 corporations with assets of $50 million or more. Fifty-one percent did not pay AMT in any year. About 13 percent either paid AMT or had unrecovered AMT credits in all 5 years. The remaining 36 percent switched back and forth from the regular tax to AMT.", "Our review of the available studies indicated that determining the effect of AMT on investment is further complicated by the lack of consensus on how significantly actual investments are affected by changes in investment incentives. Analysts have widely differing views on how responsive investment is to changes in tax rules. Some studies have concluded that investment is very responsive to changes in tax incentives, while others have found small effects. The difficulty stems from a lack of consensus on the nontax determinants of investment; without a clear model of how other factors affect investment, it is difficult to isolate the effects of taxes, holding other factors fixed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our objectives for this report were to (1) determine which corporations paid AMT and why they were liable for it, (2) examine whether AMT has achieved its purpose, and (3) discuss how AMT might affect corporate investment.", "To meet our first objective, we analyzed the IRS Statistics of Income corporate databases for 1987 through 1992, the most recent data available at the time of our review. These data files of over 70,000 tax returns per year include all corporations with assets of over $100 million and a stratified probability sample of all other corporations organized for profit. Results from firms with assets of less than $100 million are thus subject to sampling errors. With the large sample sizes, the calculations of sampling errors for 1989 and 1990 showed that the 95-percent confidence intervals for statistics based on all AMT-paying firms were within 5 percentage points of percentage estimates and within 5 percent of the value of other estimates. Where larger confidence intervals were found, they are noted in the report. We also constructed a database consisting of tax returns for corporations that filed returns in each year from 1987 through 1991. This database included about 10,000 corporations that had assets of over $50 million in each of these years. Corporations in this database paid 73 percent of the total regular tax liability and 77 percent of all AMT paid in 1991. We tracked these corporations over time to assess their experience with AMT. The major limitations of this database are that it does not include (1) all corporations and (2) larger corporations that either went out of business between 1987 and 1991 or merged with another corporation and therefore did not file their own tax returns.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed AMT\u2019s legislative history. Using the previously described tax return data, we also analyzed the relationship between the income or losses corporations showed on their books and the regular tax and/or AMT they paid. To assess whether AMT effectively taxes corporate economic income, we compared the AMT tax base with the tax base proposed by the Treasury Department in 1984. Treasury\u2019s proposal was to change the tax system so that real economic income would be taxed. We also compared the AMT tax base with the list of tax expenditures published by the Joint Committee on Taxation to determine the extent to which AMT includes items that are preferences or exclusions in the regular tax. To determine whether the AMT depreciation provisions are consistent with economic depreciation, we obtained estimates of the present value of economic depreciation deductions under the regular tax and AMT from the Congressional Research Service. These estimates, while comprehensive and widely used by researchers, were based on work on economic depreciation published in 1981. Therefore, the estimates are subject to error and would not reflect any changes in economic depreciation rates that might have occurred since 1981.", "To meet the third objective, we reviewed various academic studies and articles. In addition, we reviewed the literature on the determinants of business investment.", "We did not obtain IRS comments on this report because we did not address tax administration issues.", "We did our work in Washington, D.C., between May 1993 and February 1995 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The tax system has historically tried to achieve two potentially conflicting goals. One goal has been to raise revenue in relation to taxpayers\u2019 ability to pay, which is generally measured by annual income. Another has been to encourage certain types of economic activity thought to be beneficial to society. This goal has been pursued through provisions (tax preferences) that exclude various types of income from tax, delay the payment of tax on certain types of income, or grant tax credits for certain activities.", "These two goals can conflict with each other. At various times, reports that individuals and corporations were able to pay no tax through the direct use of tax preferences and through interactions of preferences and other features of the tax code led to concerns that the ability-to-pay goal was not being met.

Treasury studies found that some high income individuals paid little or no tax, and that many high income individuals paid tax at a lower rate than individuals with lower income. In response to these findings, Treasury proposed establishing a minimum tax for individuals.", "The Tax Reform Act of 1969 included an add-on minimum tax for both noncorporate and corporate taxpayers on certain tax preferences. A 10-percent tax was levied on the corporate minimum tax base, which was the sum of corporate tax preferences minus a $30,000 exemption amount and a corporation\u2019s regular tax liability. Levied in addition to the taxpayer\u2019s regular tax liability, this was an add-on rather than an alternative tax. The Tax Reform Act of 1976 added preferences and changed the exemption amount.", "In 1978, concerns about the effectiveness of the individual AMT led to changes. In contrast to an add-on minimum tax, the tax introduced in 1978 developed the AMT concept of levying a tax on an alternative income base when the liability under the alternative base is greater than the regular tax liability. From 1978 to 1982, individuals were subject to both AMT and the add-on minimum tax. In 1982, the add-on tax for individuals was repealed and the AMT base broadened. Throughout this period, the corporate add-on tax was essentially unchanged.", "In its 1984 tax reform proposal, the Treasury Department proposed changing business taxes, including the corporate income tax, so that the tax base more closely approximated the real economic income of businesses. In addition to several important structural changes, Treasury recommended eliminating over 45 existing tax preferences and limiting many others. In particular, Treasury proposed eliminating most of the preferences in the regular tax that were included in the add-on tax. Treasury concluded that a minimum tax or an add-on tax would not be necessary if the preferences in the tax code were eliminated directly.", "In contrast to the Treasury Department proposal, the administration\u2019s 1985 tax reform proposal recommended that the corporate add-on minimum tax be replaced with an AMT. Also in contrast to the Treasury proposal, the President\u2019s proposal included additional preferences in the regular tax, did not repeal others, and did not index the corporate tax base for inflation. The proposal called for an AMT under which taxpayers would calculate their income under two systems and pay AMT when it reflected greater tax liability. The President\u2019s proposal also called for an expanded list of preferences to be covered by AMT. \u201cCongress concluded that the minimum tax should serve one overriding objective: to ensure that no taxpayer with substantial economic income can avoid significant tax liability by using exclusions, deductions, and credits. Although these provisions may provide incentives for worthy goals, they become counterproductive when taxpayers are allowed to use them to avoid virtually all tax liability.... \u201cIn particular, Congress concluded that both the perception and the reality of fairness have been harmed by instances in which corporations paid little or no tax in years when they reported substantial earnings, and may even have paid substantial dividends, to shareholders. Even to the extent that these instances may reflect deferral, rather than permanent avoidance, of corporate tax liability, Congress concluded that they demonstrated a need for change.\u201d", "Since the passage of TRA, several other important changes have been made to the corporate AMT.

If TAMT is more than the regular tax, the taxpayer is subject to AMT. The taxpayer will pay the government the amount of TAMT liability. The difference between TAMT and the regular tax is the amount of AMT actually owed. If regular tax is more than TAMT, the taxpayer is subject to the regular tax. The calculation of regular tax owed can include a credit for AMT paid in earlier years. Because of the AMT credit, any AMT paid may be recouped in future years when the taxpayer returns to the regular tax. In this regard, AMT more closely resembles a prepayment of tax than a permanent increase in tax liability. However, taxpayers cannot reduce their regular tax liability below TAMT through the use of the AMT credit.

If a corporation computed its regular tax as $1 million and its tentative AMT as $1.5 million, it would pay $1.5 million. One million dollars of this payment would be classified as regular tax, and $0.5 million would be classified as AMT.", "If the same corporation found that in the next year it owed $2 million as its regular tax liability and $1 million of TAMT, the corporation would then be subject to just the regular tax. The corporation could claim a credit against its regular tax for the $0.5 million in AMT it paid the year before and then send $1.5 million to the government. In this case, it would recoup its AMT payment quickly. However, the AMT credit cannot reduce current year regular tax liability below current year AMT liability. If the corporation\u2019s TAMT in the second year had been $1.75 million instead of $1 million, it could only have claimed a credit of $0.25 million and would have had to carry the remaining $0.25 million in uncredited AMT payments ahead to future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "AMT Preferences and Adjustments", "paragraphs": ["In general, AMT preferences and adjustments reflect aspects of the regular tax that either (1) defer tax by rapidly recognizing expenses or by delaying revenue recognition, or (2) always exclude certain income from the definition of taxable income."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "AMT Preferences", "paragraphs": ["AMT preferences under the post-TRA AMT generally maintain the preferences that were in place under the add-on minimum tax.

Later in the asset\u2019s useful life, depreciation deductions will be greater under the AMT schedule than under the regular tax.

In this case, the taxpayer\u2019s larger regular tax depreciation deductions are effectively disallowed by AMT in favor of smaller deductions. The AMT credit allows the taxpayer to eventually deduct the cost of the asset, either through depreciation deductions directly or through AMT credits that restore the previously disallowed depreciation deductions.", "Before 1989, the AMT credit carryforward was limited to those items involving deferral of tax only. In OBRA 1989, this rule was changed so that all items that generate AMT, whether timing or permanent differences, lead to a creditable carryforward for tax years after 1989. Unlike the net operating loss deduction carryforward or foreign tax credit carryforward for the regular tax, the AMT credit has no time limit.

Many items in the Treasury proposal related to the mismeasurement of income due to inflation. Inflation reduces the value of depreciation deductions because the amount of depreciation deducted reflects the historical cost of the asset when purchased, not its current replacement value.

Corporations will include income from tax-exempt securities on their financial statements, but this income will never be included in taxable income. Another permanent difference is the treatment of dividends received by a corporation. For financial statements, dividends received are included in income. For tax purposes, only a fraction of dividends received are taxed. The purpose of the deduction for dividends received is to compensate in part for the lack of a deduction for dividends paid. Without a deduction for dividends received, income flowing through several corporations and ultimately to shareholders would be taxed at all levels.", "Some items of revenue and expense are eventually recognized by both tax and financial accounting but are recognized at different times. Book income before tax can exceed taxable income if (1) revenue is recognized for accounting purposes prior to its recognition on the tax return, or (2) expenses are recognized for accounting purposes after their deduction on the tax return. On the other hand, book income before tax can be less than taxable income if (1) revenue is recognized for accounting purposes after its inclusion on the tax return, or (2) expenses are recognized for accounting purposes prior to their deduction for tax purposes.

First, by increasing the average tax rate, AMT could reduce cash flow, discouraging investment. Second, AMT could change the marginal tax rate, which is the additional tax owed from an additional dollar of income. If AMT changed the incentives to invest, this in turn could lead to changes in investment. The material that follows summarizes the results and ideas of the various studies and comments."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Effects of AMT on Cash Flow and Investment", "paragraphs": ["Corporations can finance investment through internal funds (retained earnings or profits) or external funds, such as debt or new stock issues. If a corporation must pay significantly higher costs for borrowed funds or newly issued stock than the opportunity cost of retained earnings, investment could be sensitive to the current profitability or cash-flow position of the firm. In circumstances where securities markets do not have the same information as managers in evaluating the potential investments of the firm, firms that must borrow from the markets may have to pay a premium for funds. If such premiums had to be paid, potential investments that could be profitable if the firm had sufficient cash flow might not be profitable, and investment could be curtailed or delayed until sufficient cash flow was available.", "A number of recent studies have found significant effects of cash flow on investment, and some authors have concluded that some corporations find external funds significantly more expensive than internal funds. These studies have concluded that this is more likely to be the case for smaller firms, firms that pay relatively small amounts of dividends, firms without access to the corporate bond market, and firms that cannot use working capital to smooth investment spending over time.", "It is not clear how many AMT payers meet these conditions. No study has directly tested the extent to which such cash-flow constraints affect corporations that paid AMT. The tax return data we used were limited in their ability to directly test many of these factors. However, the data did show that most AMT is paid by relatively large corporations. To the extent that investment by large corporations is less dependent on current cash flow than is the case for small corporations, the effect of the AMT on investment would be limited. In addition, as AMT credits are reclaimed in the future, cash flow would increase at that time, possibly increasing investment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Taxes Affect Investment Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Several studies have analyzed the effects of AMT on incentives to invest. These studies have attempted to measure the extent to which AMT changes incentives to invest. While AMT increases the average tax rate paid by corporations, it may increase or decrease the marginal tax rate on new investment.", "A common approach to analyzing the effects of taxes on investment has been to calculate the extent that taxes increase the before-tax profit rate or pretax rate of return needed to generate a given after-tax profit or return on investment. Under these analyses, business income taxes have been found to effectively raise the price of investments. If investments cost more than they otherwise would, only those that earn relatively high profits over time will be worthwhile. One advantage to this type of analysis is that it can include all the features of the tax code that may affect the after-tax return to an investment.", "Researchers have studied how several business income tax provisions may affect incentives to invest. In particular, the incentives to invest can be affected through the tax rate, depreciation provisions, the deductibility or nondeductibility of interest payments and dividends, whether inflation is accounted for, loss provisions, and credits for certain types of investment. First, the lower the statutory business tax rate is, the lower is the cost of capital investments, and the greater is the incentive to invest. Second, the more accelerated the depreciation method and shorter the useful lives of business assets are, the lower is the cost of investment. For example, an immediate deduction of all investment spending (expensing) reduces the tax cost on investment to zero. Third, inflation can reduce the value of deductions that are based on historical cost. Indexing provisions would lower the cost of capital in times of inflation. Fourth, the deductibility or nondeductibility of sources of finance and the tax rates that apply to those sources in the individual income tax can affect the cost of investment. Fifth, the deductibility of prior-year losses from taxable income and whether such loss carryforwards earn interest to preserve their present value can affect the cost of capital. Finally, if tax credits are allowed for certain types of investment, the cost of those investments falls.", "As shown in table IV.1, relative to the regular tax, AMT has a lower rate, a generally slower depreciation schedule, and additional limitations on credits and losses. Since the lower tax rate by itself would lower the cost of investment but the other two features would raise the cost of investment, it is not immediately clear whether the cost of investment would rise or fall. An evaluation of the effects of AMT must include all these features.", "Accelerated relative to economic depreciation (with low to moderate inflation)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Studies of AMT and Incentives to Invest", "paragraphs": ["The studies we reviewed found that relative to the regular tax, investment incentives can be increased or reduced by AMT, depending on several factors. In general, these studies focused on investment incentives for small projects that would not by themselves affect whether the corporation would be subject to the regular tax or AMT.", "For firms permanently paying AMT, the incentives to invest were found to be greater under AMT than the regular tax for investments financed by equity. In this case, the value of the lower tax rate more than offset slower depreciation deductions, so the effective tax rate was lower.", "On the other hand, investment incentives can be lower under AMT relative to the regular tax for debt-financed investments. Since interest is deductible under both AMT and the regular tax, the higher rate under the regular tax is a relative advantage because a dollar of interest payments will reduce taxes by a greater amount if the tax rate is higher. Since the regular tax code favors debt-financed over equity-financed investment at the corporate level because interest payments are deductible and dividends are not, AMT may reduce this distortion.", "For investments financed with a mixture of debt and equity, the effective rate under AMT can be higher or lower depending on the amount of debt used. For an investment with the average mix of approximately one-third debt, effective rates are higher under the regular tax than under AMT.", "The results cited above hold for firms that are either permanently paying only the regular tax or paying AMT. However, the effect of AMT on investment incentives is further complicated if firms switch back and forth from AMT status to regular tax status. In this case, the cost of capital will depend on the timing of investment relative to the time during which AMT is paid and the length of time the firm pays AMT and recovers its credits, as well as the source of financing for the investment. Investment incentives will depend on the timing of investment because of the differences in the depreciation rules and the tax rates between the two systems. If depreciation deductions are taken when the firm is paying the regular tax, and income from the investment is received when the firm is paying AMT, the cost of investment is relatively low. If depreciation deductions are taken when the firm is paying AMT and income is taxed at the higher regular tax rate, the cost of investment is higher.", "A recent study also showed that AMT may change the incentives to invest in the United States or abroad. Since the AMT tax rate is lower than the regular tax rate, firms operating abroad may find that AMT status presents an opportunity to bring profits back to the United States and pay tax at a temporarily lower tax rate. If these additional profits are reinvested here, domestic investment may rise. On the other hand, the depreciation schedule under AMT is closer to that for foreign investment under the regular tax, narrowing the differential that exists under the regular tax. AMT may thus reduce the relative disincentive to invest abroad, encouraging more investment abroad than otherwise.", "The literature does not cover the effect of AMT on investment when an investment is large enough to potentially change the tax status of the firm from the regular tax to AMT or from a current net operating loss position to AMT. Some studies have examined investment incentives when corporations can be either in a net operating loss carryforward position or paying the regular tax. In this case, the size of net operating loss outstanding has an effect on incentives; a firm with a relatively small NOL carryforward is penalized for investment because of the loss of the time value of money on the loss. However, a large NOL carryforward could indicate that the firm will effectively be tax-exempt for the foreseeable future and investment may be encouraged. It is not clear at this time how AMT might change these incentives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Sensitive Is Investment to the Price or Cost of Capital?", "paragraphs": ["The effect of AMT on investment is further complicated by the lack of consensus on the size of the effect on investment of changes in the incentive to invest.

Some studies have concluded that investment is very responsive to changes in tax incentives, while others have found small effects. The difficulty stems from a lack of consensus on the nontax determinants of investment; without a clear model of the other determinants of investment, it is difficult to isolate the effects of taxes, holding other factors fixed.", "In particular, it has been difficult for investment models to isolate the effects of output and price. If output is the major determinant of investment as firms add capacity when output is growing, then investment may be relatively insensitive to the price of capital goods.
