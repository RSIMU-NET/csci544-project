The Coast Guard set program baselines before conducting a preliminary design review, which puts the program at risk of having an unstable design, thereby increasing the program's cost and schedule risks. While setting baselines without a preliminary design review is consistent with DHS's current acquisition policy, it is inconsistent with acquisition best practices. Based on GAO's prior recommendation, DHS is currently evaluating its policy to better align technical reviews and acquisition decisions.", "Technology. The Coast Guard intends to use proven technologies for the program, but did not conduct a technology readiness assessment to determine the maturity of key technologies prior to setting baselines. Coast Guard officials indicated such an assessment was not necessary because the technologies the program plans to employ have been proven on other icebreaker ships. However, according to best practices, such technologies can still pose risks when applied to a different program or operational environment, as in this case. Without such an assessment, the program's technical risk is underrepresented.", "Cost. The lifecycle cost estimate that informed the program's $9.8 billion cost baseline substantially met GAO's best practices for being comprehensive, well-documented, and accurate, but only partially met best practices for being credible. The cost estimate did not quantify the range of possible costs over the entire life of the program. As a result, the cost estimate was not fully reliable and may underestimate the total funding needed for the program.", "Schedule. The Coast Guard's planned delivery dates were not informed by a realistic assessment of shipbuilding activities, but rather driven by the potential gap in icebreaking capabilities once the Coast Guard's only operating heavy polar icebreaker\u2014the Polar Star \u2014reaches the end of its service life (see figure).", "GAO's analysis of selected lead ships for other shipbuilding programs found the icebreaker program's estimated construction time of 3 years is optimistic.

These ships will enable the Coast Guard to maintain heavy polar  icebreaking capability and recapitalize its icebreaking fleet. Congressional  committees have expressed concern regarding the Coast Guard\u2019s ability  to ensure year-round access to the Arctic and Antarctic with the current  fleet, which affects U.S. economic, maritime, and national security  interests in these regions. As the only operating HPIB nears the end of its  service life, the Coast Guard is planning for delivery of the lead ship by as  early as 2023 to avoid a gap in capability, with subsequent ship deliveries  anticipated in 2025 and 2026. In 2016, in response to a Congressional  report, the Navy and the Coast Guard established an integrated program  office (IPO) to leverage the Navy\u2019s shipbuilding expertise for acquiring the  icebreakers for Coast Guard operations. In March 2018, the Navy  released the solicitation for a contract to design and construct up to three  HPIBs.

Because of the finite number of parts available  from the Polar Sea, the Coast Guard may have to acquire new parts for  the Polar Star that could increase the $75 million estimate.

Coast Guard  officials stated the results of these studies helped inform and refine  the ship\u2019s specifications and provided them with a better  understanding of the technology risks and schedule challenges. As of  February 2018, each contract was valued at about $5.6 million. Under  these contracts, each shipbuilder completed five detailed industry  study iterations.

Given a previous  independent study analyzing the cost-effectiveness of nuclear- powered icebreakers, the Coast Guard deemed a nuclear-powered  icebreaker design as infeasible. The alternatives analysis also noted  that the Canadian design met icebreaking requirements. However,  Coast Guard officials told us the Canadian design did not meet  requirements such as habitability and military-oriented multi-mission  tasks, but the design could potentially be modified to meet those  needs. In addition, IPO officials stated the Canadian design was  designed for science missions rather than military missions. The  Canadian design was considered among some of the shipbuilders as  a starting point in examining HPIB design risks.", "From May to August 2017, the Coast Guard tested two scale models  of icebreakers at the Canadian National Research Council\u2019s ice tank  facility in Newfoundland. Coast Guard officials told us the testing  helped to mitigate potential design risks with the hull form and  propulsors\u2014a mechanical device that generates thrust to provide  propulsion for the ship. The Coast Guard tested the resistance,  powering, and maneuvering of the model icebreakers\u2019 hull form and  propulsion to inform their indicative design and discovered that the  ship\u2019s maneuverability was a challenge during model testing.  However, through model testing, the Coast Guard was able to validate  general characteristics of its indicative design, including power needs  and the hull form. In addition to model testing, Canadian Coast Guard  officials told us that the U.S. Coast Guard has engaged with them in  formal and informal exchanges regarding icebreaker acquisitions  more generally.", "As a result of its indicative design, industry studies, and model testing  efforts, the Coast Guard identified the integrated power plant, propulsors,  and hull form as key design considerations for the HPIB.

These baselines  inform DHS\u2019s and Coast Guard\u2019s decisions to commit resources. Our best  practices for knowledge-based acquisitions state that before program  baselines are set, programs should hold key systems engineering events,  such as a preliminary design review, to help ensure that requirements are  defined and feasible and that the proposed design can be met within cost,  schedule, and other system constraints. Similarly, in November 2016,  we found that establishing a preliminary design through early detailed  systems engineering results in better program outcomes than doing so  after program start. During the HPIB\u2019s preliminary design review, the  Coast Guard plans to verify that the contractor\u2019s design meets the  requirement of the ship specifications and is producible, and the schedule  is achievable, among other activities.", "The Coast Guard has yet to conduct a preliminary design review for the  HPIB program because DHS\u2019s current acquisition policy does not require  programs to do so until after ADE 2A/2B. The Coast Guard plans to hold  the preliminary design review by December 2019, after the award of the  detail design and construction contract. Holding a preliminary design  review after ADE 2A/2B is consistent with DHS policy. However, in April  2017, we found that DHS\u2019s sequencing of the preliminary design review is  not consistent with our acquisition best practices, which state that  programs should pursue a knowledge-based acquisition approach that  ensures program needs are matched with available resources\u2014such as  technical and engineering knowledge, time, and funding\u2014prior to setting  baselines. In that report, we found that by initiating programs without a  well-developed understanding of system needs through key engineering  reviews such as the preliminary design review, DHS increases the  likelihood that programs will change their user-defined key performance  parameters, costs, or schedules after establishing their baselines. As a  result, we recommended that DHS update its acquisition policy to require  key technical reviews, including the preliminary design review, to be  conducted prior to approving programs\u2019 baselines. DHS concurred with  this recommendation and stated that it planned to initiate a study to  assess how to better align its processes for technical reviews and  acquisition decisions. Upon completion of the study, DHS plans to update  its acquisition policies, as appropriate.", "Instead of establishing the HPIB program\u2019s acquisition program baselines  after assessing the shipbuilder\u2019s preliminary design, the Coast Guard  established cost baselines based on a cost estimate that used the ship  design team\u2019s indicative design. Coast Guard officials told us that the  selected shipbuilder will develop its own HPIB design as part of the detail  design and construction contract, independent of the indicative design.

Although completing the preliminary design review after setting  program baselines is consistent with DHS policy, this puts the Coast  Guard at risk of breaching its established baselines and having to revise  them later in the acquisition process, after a contract has been signed  and significant resources have already been committed to the program.  At that point, the program will be well underway and it will be too late for  decision makers to make appropriate tradeoff decisions between  requirements and resources without causing disruptions to the program.", "Consistent with DHS acquisition policy, DHS and the Coast Guard must  monitor the HPIB program against the acquisition program baselines set  at ADE 2A/2B; however, DHS acquisition policy does not require an  official update to the baseline unless the program breaches its baselines  or until the next major milestone, whichever occurs first. For the HPIB, the  next milestone is ADE 2C, which is currently planned for no later than  June 2021. ADE 2C corresponds to the approval of low-rate initial  production and in the case of the HPIB, the start of construction for the  lead ship. Evaluating the HPIB\u2019s baselines at ADE 2C\u2014immediately  before the shipbuilder is authorized to start construction\u2014is too late  because the funding required for the construction phase likely would have  already been requested and provided. On the other hand, evaluating the  acquisition program baselines after the preliminary design review but  before ADE 2C would help to ensure that the knowledge gained during  the preliminary design review is used to inform the program baselines and  business case for investing in the HPIBs before significant resource  commitments are made.", "Although the Coast Guard set the acquisition program baselines prior to  gaining knowledge on the feasibility of the selected shipbuilder\u2019s design, it  has expressed a commitment to having a stable design prior to the start  of lead ship construction.

Coast Guard officials further stated that the  integrated power plant is the standard power plant used on domestic and  foreign icebreakers. Coast Guard officials told us that similarly, market  survey data on azimuthing propulsors shows that ice-qualified azimuthing  propulsors in the power range have been used on foreign icebreakers.  The Coast Guard has also communicated to industry through the request  for proposals that the HPIB should have only proven technology and  plans to have the shipbuilders provide information on the maturity of the  technologies when they submit their proposals.

The guidance further states  that technologies can become critical if they need to be modified from  prior successful use or expected to operate in an environment beyond  their original demonstrated capability. Similarly, according to our best  practices for assessing technology readiness, critical technologies are not  just technologies that are new or novel. Technologies used on prior  systems can also become critical if they are being used in a different  form, fit, or function.", "Our technology readiness assessment guide notes that program officials  sometimes disregard critical technologies when they have longstanding  history, knowledge, or familiarity with them. The best practices guide cites  examples of organizations not considering a technology critical if it has  been determined to be mature, has already been fielded, or does not  currently pose a risk to the program. Additionally, our guide notes that  contractors may be overly optimistic about the maturity of critical  technologies, especially prior to contract awards. According to our best  practices guide, presuming a previously used technology as mature is  problematic when the technologies are being reapplied to a different  program or operational environment.", "As a result, based on our analysis of available Coast Guard information,  we believe the HPIB\u2019s planned integrated power plant and azimuthing  propulsors should be considered critical technologies given their criticality  in meeting key performance parameters, their use in a different  environment from prior ships, and the extent to which they pose major  cost risks (see table 4).", "Without conducting a technology readiness assessment, the Coast Guard  does not have insight into how mature these critical technologies are.  According to our best practices, evaluating critical technologies requires  disciplined and repeatable steps and criteria to perform the assessment  and make credible judgments about their maturity. The evaluation of each  critical technology must be based on evidence such as data and test  results. In addition, the team that assesses the technologies must be  objective and ideally independent. Instead, the Coast Guard has relied  on industry to provide information on the maturity of the HPIB\u2019s  technologies and uses terms such as \u201cstate-of-the-market\u201d or \u201cproven,\u201d  which do not translate into meaningful measures for systematically  communicating the technology readiness, especially when discussing  new applications of existing technologies.", "Additionally, even if the Coast Guard determines the maturity levels of the  HPIB\u2019s technologies through an objective and independent technology  readiness assessment, the program\u2019s planned level of maturity for the  ship\u2019s technologies falls short of our best practices. According to the  HPIB\u2019s systems engineering tailoring plan and request for proposals, the  program intends on implementing only proven technologies that have  been demonstrated in a relevant environment, commensurate with a  technology readiness level (TRL) of 6. However, our best practices do  not consider a technology to be mature until it has been demonstrated in  an operational environment, commensurate with a TRL 7. Specifically,  our best practices for shipbuilding recommend that programs should  require critical technologies to be matured into actual prototypes and  successfully demonstrated in an operational or a realistic environment  (TRL 7) before a contract is awarded for the detail design of a new ship.

We assessed the program\u2019s lifecycle cost estimate, which was performed  by NAVSEA 05C, against our best practices for cost estimating. For our  reporting purposes, we collapsed 18 of our applicable best practices into  the four general characteristics of a reliable cost estimate:  comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. Figure 8  provides a summary of our assessment of the HPIB\u2019s lifecycle cost  estimate.", "Comprehensive.

The  estimate also documents detailed ground rules and assumptions, such as  the learning curve used to capture expected labor efficiencies for follow- on ships.

Specifically, the cost estimate\u2019s  documentation mostly captured the source data used as well as the  primary methods, calculations, results, rationales, and assumptions used  to generate each cost element. However, the documentation alone did  not provide enough information for someone unfamiliar with the cost  estimate to replicate what was done and arrive at the same results. For  example, NAVSEA officials discussed and showed us how historical data  from the analogous ships were used to create the estimate, but these  specific sources were not found in the cost estimate documentation.", "Accurate. We found the estimate substantially met best practices for  being accurate. In particular, the estimate was properly adjusted for  inflation, and we did not find any mathematical errors in the estimate  calculations we inspected.

While  the documentation does not discuss the reliability, age, or relevance of  the cost data, NAVSEA officials provided us with additional information  regarding those data characteristics.

We found the HPIB cost estimate partially met the best  practices associated with being credible. A credible cost estimate should  analyze the sensitivity of the program\u2019s expected cost to changes among  key cost-driving assumptions and risks. It should also quantify the cost  impact of risks related to assumptions changing and variability in the  underlying data used to create the cost estimate. Credible cost estimates  should also be cross-checked internally and reconciled with an  independent cost estimate that is performed by an outside group. These  two best practices ensure that the estimate has been checked for any  potential bias. Our review of the HPIB cost estimate determined it  partially met the best practices for being credible due to the following:", "Exclusions of major costs from sensitivity analysis and risk and  uncertainty analysis. The cost estimators conducted sensitivity  analysis as well as risk and uncertainty analysis on only a small  portion of the total lifecycle costs. For both the sensitivity analysis  and risk and uncertainty analysis, we found that NAVSEA only  modeled cost variation in the detail design and construction portion of  the program and excluded from its analyses any risk impacts related  to the remainder of the acquisition, operating and support, and  disposal phases, which altogether comprise about 75 percent of the  lifecycle cost. The cost estimate documents that the limited number of  active icebreakers and available data prevented NAVSEA from  identifying accurate risk bounds for the operating and support and  disposal phases. Further, NAVSEA officials told us because they used  historical data, including average maintenance costs from the Healy,  they felt that their estimate was reasonable. However, similar to how  NAVSEA consulted with the ship design team to establish high and  low-end costs using analogous ships, NAVSEA could have used cost  ranges in the historical data to develop risk bounds for the remaining  costs in the acquisition, operations and support, and disposal phases.  Without performing a sensitivity analysis on the entire life cycle cost of  the three ships, it is not possible for NAVSEA to identify key elements  affecting the overall cost estimate. Further, without performing a risk  and uncertainty analysis on the entire life cycle cost of the three ships,  it is not possible for NAVSEA to determine a level of confidence  associated with the overall cost estimate. By not quantifying important  risks, NAVSEA may have underestimated the range of possible costs  for about three-quarters of the entire program.", "Lack of applied correlation in the risk and uncertainty analysis. In  its independent assessment of the HPIB cost estimate, the DHS Cost  Analysis Division similarly found that the results of the risk and  uncertainty analysis may understate the range of possible cost  outcomes for the HPIB. The DHS assessment noted that NAVSEA did  not use applied correlation\u2014which links costs for related items so that  they rise and fall together during the analysis\u2014in its cost model.  According to a joint agency handbook on cost risk and uncertainty,  applied correlation helps to ensure that cost estimates do not  understate the possible variation in total program costs. Omitting  applied correlation when assessing a cost estimate for risk can cause  an understated range of possible program costs and create a false  sense of confidence in the cost estimate. For example, absent applied  correlation, the DHS assessment noted that the Navy calculated with  a 99-percent level of confidence that the program will not exceed its  threshold (maximum acceptable) acquisition cost. Navy officials  explained that they will incorporate applied correlation in future  updates to the cost estimate when better data are available. However,  by applying correlation factors from the joint agency handbook to the  same data that NAVSEA used, DHS\u2019s Cost Analysis Division  determined that NAVSEA overstated the likelihood of the program not  exceeding its threshold acquisition cost.", "Cost estimate not fully reconciled with a comparable  independent cost estimate. While the Naval Center for Cost  Analysis performed an independent cost estimate of the HPIB  program, the office used a different methodology from NAVSEA\u2019s, and  its estimate was based on an earlier version of the indicative ship  design and associated technical baseline. NAVSEA officials told us  that before the Coast Guard\u2019s ship design team updated the indicative  ship design and technical baseline, NAVSEA met twice with Naval  Center for Cost Analysis to reconcile their results. However, NAVSEA  officials told us that due to the speed at which the program was  progressing, no reconciliation occurred after the ship design team  finalized the indicative ship design. While we did not find any specific  ground rules and assumptions that differed between the two  estimates, some ship characteristics had changed, such as the weight  estimates for propulsion and auxiliary systems, among others. The  use of two different technical baselines creates differences in the two  estimates and makes them less comparable to one another.", "For additional details on our assessment of the HPIB\u2019s cost estimate  against our 18 cost estimating best practices, see appendix III.", "By excluding the majority of the HPIB program\u2019s lifecycle costs from the  sensitivity analysis as well as the risk and uncertainty analysis, and  reconciling the estimate with an independent cost estimate based on a  different iteration of the ship design, the cost estimate does not provide a  fully credible range of costs the program may incur. Moreover, the  exclusion of applied correlation further provides a false sense of  confidence that the program will not exceed its threshold cost. As a result,  the estimate provides an overly optimistic assessment of the program\u2019s  vulnerability to cost growth should risks be realized or current  assumptions change.

The Navy gave offerors an opportunity to provide the  estimated savings that the government could achieve if it were to take  a \u201cblock buy\u201d approach in purchasing the ships or purchasing supplies  in economic order quantities. The Navy did not include a definition of  \u201cblock buy\u201d in the HPIB request for proposals synopsis. Based on our  prior work, block buy contracting generally refers to special legislative  authority that agencies seek on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis to  purchase more than one year\u2019s worth of requirements. The request  for proposals synopsis stated a preference for submission of the  estimated savings within 60 days of the release of the request for  proposals, or by May 2018. As of June 2018, the Navy had not  received any formal responses from industry on potential savings from  block buys or economic order quantities. For the HPIB request for  proposals, the Navy stated that any information on block buys or  economic order of quantities would be optional and would not be used  as part of the evaluation of proposals submitted by offerors.", "Our prior work on block buy contracting approaches for the Littoral  Combat Ship and F-35 Joint Strike Fighter programs found that the  terms and conditions of the contracts affect the extent to which the  government achieves savings under a block buy approach. For  example, the Littoral Combat Ship\u2019s block buy contracts indicated that  a failure to fully fund the purchase of a ship in a given year would  make the contract subject to renegotiation. DOD has pointed to this as  a risk that the contractors would demand higher prices if DOD  deviated from the agreed to block buy plan.", "In its HPIB acquisition strategy, the IPO has also considered the use of  foreign suppliers as allowable under the law. According to the February  2018 HPIB acquisition plan, the HPIB must be constructed in a U.S.  shipyard given statutory restrictions, including restrictions on construction  of Coast Guard vessels and major components in foreign shipyards  unless authorized by the President. However, foreign suppliers will be  permitted to provide components and design services to the extent  applicable statutes and regulations allow. According to Coast Guard  officials, foreign design firms have extensive expertise and knowledge to  produce the design for HPIBs. As a result, the U.S. shipbuilders planning  to submit proposals on the HPIB solicitation may partner with these  foreign design firms when submitting proposals. Similarly, Coast Guard  officials stated that the azimuthing propulsors that have the necessary  power and ice classification for the HPIB are manufactured by foreign  companies. Therefore, the selected shipbuilder may subcontract with  these companies to acquire the propulsors.", "In addition, Navy contracting officials stated that the program did not need  to obtain a waiver from the Buy American Act\u2014which generally requires  federal agencies to purchase domestic end products when supplies are  acquired for use in the United States, and use domestic construction  materials on contracts performed in the United States\u2014for certain  components.

The  Navy did not request any funding in fiscal year 2019 for the HPIB, while  Coast Guard requested $30 million. Subsequently, after discretionary  budget caps were relaxed by Congress, the Administration\u2019s fiscal year  2019 budget addendum requested an additional $720 million in fiscal year  2019 Coast Guard appropriations for the program. Although the Navy  did not request fiscal year 2019 funding for the lead ship, and Navy  officials told us they have no plans to budget for the HPIB program  moving forward, Congress may still choose to appropriate funds for the  HPIB to the Navy.

For example, if the Coast Guard or the Navy  revises the program\u2019s requirements, this could increase the scope and  value of the contract and result in additional contract costs. It is unclear in  this instance, which organization is responsible for paying for the  additional costs. Further, our 2005 work on Navy shipbuilding programs  found that the most common causes of cost growth in these programs  were related to design modifications, the need for additional and more  costly materials, and changes in employee pay and benefits, some of  which required changes in contract scope.", "IPO officials told us that unplanned changes to the program\u2019s scope and  any corresponding funding requests for unanticipated cost growth would  require discussions and agreements with both Coast Guard and Navy  leadership.

We also compared the HPIB lead ship\u2019s 3- year construction schedule to historical construction cycle times of lead  ships among a nongeneralizable sample of major Navy and Coast Guard shipbuilding programs. We selected programs that were active within the  last 10 years and have completed construction of the lead ship. We also  included the Coast Guard\u2019s Healy medium polar icebreaker, even though  it is not a recent shipbuilding program, because it is the most recent polar  icebreaker to be built in the United States. We excluded the Coast Guard  Fast Response Cutter, Navy submarines, and Navy aircraft carriers  because we determined that their size and complexity did not make them  reasonable comparisons to the HPIB for construction times.

We  obtained data on these programs\u2019 construction schedules from program  documentation, such as acquisition program baselines, Navy selected  acquisition reports, and Navy and Coast Guard budget documentation.  We selected only lead ships for comparison because we have found in  our prior work that schedule delays are amplified for lead ships in a class.  Lead ships are thus more comparable to the HPIB lead ship than follow- on ships.
