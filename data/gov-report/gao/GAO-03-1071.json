The United Nations is attempting to apply the elements of this strategy to help Sierra Leone, East Timor, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo transition from conflict to sustainable peace, but it faces enormous challenges. Establishing security often takes longer and can be more expensive than originally planned in countries where rival factions may continue to fight. Developing participatory governance is also difficult in countries with little experience of accountable government. Coordinating with independent international organizations and donor nations with different priorities is also a challenge. The United Nations has not yet developed results-oriented measures of progress for the three peacekeeping operations. Although the United Nations uses some indicators to manage the withdrawal of peacekeeping troops, they did not have results-oriented measures to assess the security situations in Sierra Leone and East Timor and subsequent events in each country showed that the situation was not as secure as available measures indicated.

Department  of Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO) is responsible for the planning,  management, and logistical support of U.N. peacekeeping operations  worldwide. From 1948 through August 2003, the Security Council  authorized 56 peacekeeping operations. Fourteen of these operations were  ongoing as of August 2003.", "Most current U.N. peacekeeping operations have relatively narrow  mandates that authorize peacekeepers to monitor or supervise cease-fires  and peace agreements between formerly warring parties. Three ongoing  operations\u2014those in East Timor, Sierra Leone, and the Democratic  Republic of the Congo\u2014have broader, multidimensional mandates that  address complex emergencies.", "Earlier multidimensional peacekeeping operations in Somalia, Cambodia,  and Bosnia tried to address governance, human rights, and humanitarian  affairs, but they initially lacked long-term transition strategies. For  example, the peace operation in Somalia did not clearly link security with  efforts to rebuild the country. In Bosnia, a coalition of nations led by the  North Atlantic Treaty Organization formed an international force to  provide security, which was initially planned to last 1 year. But 2 years  later, troop withdrawal was linked to the achievement of broad objectives  for the overall peace operation. In Cambodia, there was no clear plan for  effectively developing the rule of law after the peacekeeping operation  left. The Security Council recognized the shortcomings in these operations  and began to consider better strategies to plan and manage operations for  sustainable peace.", "In 1999, the need to address such shortcomings gained greater urgency as  the Security Council mandated new U.N. operations to address complex  emergencies in Sierra Leone, East Timor, and the Democratic Republic of  the Congo. (App. III describes in more detail the crisis each of these  countries faced and the United Nations\u2019 response.) The council debated  the need for a new approach to planning, conducting, and concluding  multidimensional peacekeeping operations in countries with complex  emergencies. The council examined the lessons learned from these past  failures and the process for closing a peacekeeping operation. In 2000, the  council requested that the Secretary General make recommendations  about how to effectively launch, close, or significantly alter a U.N.  peacekeeping operation.

Secretary General stated that the ultimate purpose of  peacekeeping is to help countries achieve sustainable peace. To do this,  the U.N. transition strategy for complex emergency countries guides the  United Nations, other international organizations, and donor countries to  (1) establish and maintain security, (2) develop institutions that provide  rule of law and participatory governance, and (3) create conditions for  economic and social recovery and reform.", "Establishing and maintaining security are priorities for U.N. peacekeeping  operations. However, when armed interventions have been necessary, the  United Nations generally has authorized alliances\u2014such as the North  Atlantic Treaty Organization\u2014or coalitions of nations to undertake  military operations to restore security. U.N. peacekeepers then have  responsibility for maintaining secure conditions so that other aspects of  the peace operation, including humanitarian efforts, can move forward. In  the longer term, maintaining security may include demobilizing and  reintegrating ex-combatants into society, training a fair and impartial  police force, and building a professional army that is accountable to the  national government.", "The transition strategy emphasizes that sustainable peace is most likely if  the country establishes rule of law and participatory governance. To  support this, the peacekeeping operation and many other partners  undertake programs to reform a country\u2019s justice system so that it is fair,  transparent, and equitable. Other activities include strengthening or  building government institutions to ensure transparency, equal access, and  accountability to all citizens. Other efforts, when authorized by the  Security Council, may include supporting broad-based political parties,  overseeing or administering free and fair elections, and supporting efforts  to combat corruption.", "Creating the conditions for economic and social recovery and reform is  also important in the transition strategy. Efforts to create these conditions  include reconstruction of infrastructure and utilities and activities to  promote national reconciliation and human rights, such as supporting war  crimes tribunals or truth and reconciliation panels. Other efforts in this  area include support for resettlement of refugees and displaced persons.", "Several studies have similarly found that the earlier operations did not  focus on obtaining comprehensive results needed for sustainable peace.  For example, a Department of Defense-sponsored study determined that  past failures in restoring peace were highly correlated with the failure to  restore public security, political rights, and honest government and with  the facilitation of economic reconstruction. A 2002 guide developed as a  tool for U.S. policy makers reached similar conclusions. The guide noted  that a peacekeeping operation must undertake a range of military and  political tasks to achieve a sustainable outcome in a complex emergency  situation. These tasks include demobilizing armed groups, reforming the  police, establishing rule of law, and rehabilitating the economy. The guide  concludes that assessment of progress toward restoring stability in the  country should identify measures to be relied upon (such as disarming ex- combatants or holding elections) and/or transforming conditions on the  ground (such as reducing the level of violence in the country and  increasing confidence in elected officials). Our observations on lessons  learned from our survey of 32 previous reports on peacekeeping  operations in 16 countries came to similar conclusions about the need for  comprehensive transition planning in complex emergency situations. The  Security Council recognized the shortcomings in the earlier missions and  began to consider better strategies to plan and manage operations for  sustainable peace.", "In February 2001, the Security Council endorsed this broad approach for  effective transitions. The council stated that achieving a sustainable peace  requires a comprehensive approach that includes political, humanitarian,  and human rights programs to foster sustainable development, eradication  of poverty, and transparent and accountable government and rule of law.

The Secretary General has observed that  peacekeepers should establish close working relationships with these  other stakeholders and begin transition planning during the operation\u2019s  earliest stages.

According to a British government analysis,  however, Sierra Leone\u2019s reliance on hereditary chieftains has always  compromised transparency and accountability and provided a means for  the central government to control local affairs. Moreover, this reliance  limits democratic participation because only candidates meeting  hereditary lineage requirements were eligible to run in recent elections to  fill 61 tribal chieftaincies left vacant during the war. Additionally, local  civic leaders in one district stated that the Speaker of the National  Parliament arbitrarily replaced the locally selected candidate for chief.

However, the operation established this target using a standard European  police-to-population ratio and relied on outdated population estimates.  Moreover, the number of police does not measure the quality of their  training and whether they are improving security in the country.

The government was restored in 1998 after West African forces  drove the junta from power. In January 1999, an unsuccessful attempt to  overthrow the government by the RUF resulted in massive loss of life and  destruction in Freetown and the surrounding area.", "In July 1999, the parties to the conflict signed a peace agreement (known  as the Lom\u00e9 Agreement because it was signed in Lom\u00e9, Togo) negotiated  with the assistance of the United Nations. Under the agreement, the RUF  agreed to maintain a cease-fire, transform itself into a political party, and  join a government of national unity. In return, the agreement granted  pardon and amnesty to all combatants, including those from the RUF, for  actions before the agreement was signed. In October 1999, the Security  Council established the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone to, among  other things, assist in the implementation of the Lom\u00e9 Agreement, assist in  the disarmament demobilization and reintegration of former combatants,  and monitor the cease-fire. The council\u2019s resolution authorized the  deployment of up to 6,000 military peacekeepers. Despite having signed  the Lom\u00e9 Agreement, RUF forces attacked population centers and  engaged in a series of armed confrontations with African peacekeeping  forces and, subsequently, with U.N. troops. In May 2000, the RUF took  about 500 U.N. peacekeepers hostage. U.N. and other assessments  concluded that insufficient military strength and other shortcomings  contributed to the peacekeeping force\u2019s inability to deter and repel RUF  attacks and stabilize the country.", "The hostage-taking and other incidents prompted a significant change in  the United Nations\u2019 and the international community\u2019s approach to the  crisis in Sierra Leone. The international community applied greater  military and diplomatic pressure, which succeeded in overcoming RUF  resistance and restoring the peace. Beginning in May 2000, the United  Kingdom deployed troops to protect and evacuate U.K. and other nationals  and secure the area around Freetown and the airport. This deployment  boosted confidence in the government and allowed the United Nations to  redeploy peacekeepers to other areas. At the same time, the United  Nations began increasing the strength of its peacekeeping force in a series  of steps from 6,000 to 17,500 troops. The Security Council augmented the  mission\u2019s mandate to clarify its right to self-defense and tasked it to help  extend government authority throughout the country, including areas  controlled by the RUF and other armed groups. In addition, Guinean  armed forces defeated RUF incursions into that country, and the United  Nations imposed sanctions on Liberia to reduce that country\u2019s support for  the RUF. The arrest and imprisonment of RUF leader Foday Sankoh in  mid-2000 enhanced RUF cooperation.", "The United Nations reported that, through May 2002, the U.N.  peacekeeping operation supported the extension of government authority  throughout the country, the disarmament and reintegration of ex- combatants, and the conduct of free and fair national elections. According  to U.N. reports, by December 2001, U.N. troops had been deployed to all  districts of Sierra Leone, and, by June 2002, government administrators  and police had also been deployed to all districts with the support of the  U.N. forces, the U.N. Development Program, and international groups. In  January 2002, the Government of Sierra Leone, the RUF, and the United  Nations declared the disarmament process complete. Having disarmed, the  RUF participated as a political party in national presidential and  parliamentary elections in May 2002. The U.N. operation played an  important role in supporting these elections, which international and local  observers characterized as free, transparent, and generally free of  violence.", "In the spring and summer of 2002, having achieved these basic milestones,  U.N. officials began to develop plans to gradually reduce the size of the  mission. In accordance with Security Council guidance, U.N. officials  identified and articulated strategic goals for key areas where progress  would affect the security threat facing Sierra Leone and its ability to  maintain security and stability without substantial assistance from U.N.  peacekeepers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "East Timor", "paragraphs": ["A former Portuguese colony, East Timor experienced years of intermittent  conflict following its 1975 occupation by Indonesia. Low-level  international efforts to resolve this conflict were unsuccessful until 1998,  when Indonesian-Portuguese negotiations finally produced agreement on a  referendum to decide the territory\u2019s political future. The ensuing vote for  independence in August 1999 provoked a violent response from militias  favoring integration with Indonesia. The international community  intervened to end the fighting and established a U.N. transitional  administration in 2000 to run the country and oversee international  assistance efforts until a new national authority was elected and  independence declared in May 2002. A U.N. peacekeeping operation  remains in East Timor in support of the government and ongoing  international efforts to create sustainable peace in the new country.", "East Timor is a small country with a population ranging between 800,000  and about 1 million occupying the eastern portion of the island of Timor  (see fig. 8). First colonized by Portugal in the 1500s, Timor was divided  between the Netherlands and Portugal in 1859. While the Dutch side  became part of Indonesia after World War II, East Timor remained under  Portuguese rule. In 1975, Portugal finally withdrew and East Timor  declared independence. However, armed conflict among domestic factions  provided Indonesia with a pretext for occupation. For the ensuing quarter  century, Indonesia conducted an unsuccessful campaign to incorporate  East Timor, with intermittent warfare claiming 100,000 to 250,000 lives. By  1999, years of violence and disruption had reduced East Timor to last  place among Asian countries on the United Nations\u2019 Human Development  Index.", "Although the United Nations refused to recognize Indonesia\u2019s annexation  and called for self-determination for East Timor, these calls did not  achieve results until the government of Indonesia changed hands in 1998  and the new administration decided to enter U.N.-mediated discussions  with Portugal about the territory\u2019s political future.", "In 1999, these talks resulted in agreement to hold a popular vote on  whether East Timor would accept or reject a proposal to remain affiliated  with Indonesia as an autonomous entity. To ensure a free and fair  referendum, the Security Council created a small observer mission, the  U.N. Mission in East Timor, to monitor campaigning and voting and to  oversee the result of the vote. However, Indonesia retained responsibility  for maintaining peace and security. On August 30, 1999, the population  voted overwhelmingly against the proposal, voting in effect for U.N.  administration and eventual transition to full independence. In response,  militias favoring integration with Indonesia went on a rampage with the  support of elements of the Indonesian security forces, killing hundreds of  people, displacing 500,000 more\u2014many of whom fled or were forcibly  removed to West Timor\u2014and destroying much of the country\u2019s already  damaged infrastructure and housing. Those leaving included most of the  country\u2019s professional class, who were predominantly Indonesian in  origin.", "Despite diplomatic pressure from the Secretary General and others,  Indonesian authorities did little to end the violence; Indonesian security  forces in fact provided considerable support to pro-union militias. In 1999,  the Secretary General noted that the potential for post-vote discord was  widely acknowledged and Indonesian authorities had not done an effective  job of quelling prereferendum violence. The U.N. mission then in the  country, however, had not been provided with the means for taking  effective action to restore stability.", "In the aftermath of the violence, the United Nations authorized a series of  interventions in East Timor that were intended to end the violence, create  a national government, and consolidate a stable environment that would  permit devolution of all responsibilities to the new national government  and withdrawal of U.N. forces. In September 1999, the Security Council  authorized an Australian-led international force of approximately 8,000  military personnel to intervene in East Timor, end the violence, and  facilitate humanitarian operations. With Indonesian consent, this force  quickly entered East Timor and restored order. About 500,000 East  Timorese were displaced from their homes. About half of the displaced  went to West Timor, in some cases forced to go by fleeing pro-Indonesia  militiamen. The following month, the council authorized creation of the  U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor that would assume  responsibility for maintaining security from the Australian-led force,  administer an interim government, and work to develop East Timor\u2019s  capacity for self-government. In the ensuing months, the mission oversaw  development of a national consultative council, began training a police  force, assisted with the return of most of the refugees, helped other  international organizations create the conditions for economic  development, and patrolled the boundary with Indonesia. Between August  2001 and April 2002, the people of East Timor elected a constituent  assembly, adopted a constitution, and elected a president.", "On May 20, 2002, East Timor became an independent country, and the U.N.  transitional administration turned over responsibility for governance to  Timorese authorities. Recognizing this change in circumstances, the  Security Council created a U.N. Mission in Support of East Timor to  pursue a mandate that supports the new government as it works to  establish stability and security in the country. The mission has developed  implementation plans for its activities, identified security and governance  \u201cmilestones\u201d to be achieved, and developed a proposed timetable for  reducing its presence in East Timor over a 2-year period, with the final  withdrawal of the peacekeepers to be completed by mid-2004."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Democratic Republic of the Congo", "paragraphs": ["Since suffering foreign invasion and overthrow of the government in 1996- 97 and again in 1998-99, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has  been divided by conflict among shifting alliances of foreign and domestic  armed groups, including troops from seven other countries sent to support  or oppose the government. International initiatives aimed at restoring  peace, including a U.N. peacekeeping operation, have made some progress  since 1999, but violence continues to occur. The Security Council  established a peacekeeping operation, the U.N. Organization Mission in  the Democratic Republic of Congo, in support of a 1999 peace agreement  signed in Lusaka, Zambia. The parties to the agreement largely failed to  meet their commitments until late 2002, making it difficult for the U.N.  mission to plan a comprehensive approach to restoring stability. Foreign  troops were withdrawn by May 2003, and the Congolese factions formed a  transitional government in June 2003. In July 2003, the council expanded  the peacekeeping operation\u2019s mandate to assist the new government\u2019s  efforts to provide security and rule of law. In addition, the council  authorized a substantial increase in the size of the peacekeeping force.", "The DRC occupies the core of central Africa. Approximately equivalent in  size to the United States east of the Mississippi River, the country shares  borders with nine other nations and has a population of about 55 million.  The country is rich in natural resources, with substantial deposits of gold,  diamonds, coltan, and other minerals; ample timber; and enormous  potential for hydroelectric power generation. A colony of Belgium until  1960, the new country dissolved into a multisided war shortly after  declaring independence. The government of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, in  power from 1965 to 1997, eventually restored order but failed to channel  the country\u2019s considerable wealth into economic and social development.  Corrupt government officials became wealthy while the population  remained poor, politically disenfranchised, and willing to support  opposition groups and coup attempts. The economy suffered a near-total  collapse during the early 1990s. By 1997, the central government could do  little to resist rebels and outside forces.", "The political and economic tensions in the DRC were exacerbated by the  1994 conflict and associated genocide in neighboring Rwanda. More than 1  million ethnic Hutus fleeing Tutsi reprisals inside Rwanda became  refugees in eastern DRC. Ethnic tension and fighting involving Congolese  Tutsis, the army, and exiled Rwandan Hutu militias ensued, leading  eventually to a 1997 uprising by domestic rebel groups that succeeded in  deposing Mobutu with support from Rwanda, Uganda, and Angola. The  successor government under rebel leader Laurent Kabila was challenged  in 1998 by a new coalition of internal rebels and Rwandan and Ugandan  troops. With support from Angola, Zimbabwe, Namibia, Sudan, and Chad,  the Kabila government pushed its challengers back to eastern DRC before  losing the initiative. Rwandan and Ugandan troops and their respective  rebel client groups remained in control of large portions of the country  (see fig. 9). According to International Rescue Committee estimates, the  continuing conflict has cost more than 3 million lives since 1998.", "In July 1999, the main parties to the DRC conflict agreed to honor a cease- fire and begin a national dialogue to lead to the creation of a transitional  government and national elections. The Security Council authorized a U.N.  peacekeeping operation to support the cessation of hostilities, oversee the  withdrawal of foreign forces, and encourage talks sponsored by the United  Nations and the African Union to create a new national government that  included the current government and foreign-supported rebel groups in  eastern DRC. The peacekeeping operation would then support the new  government\u2019s efforts to restore peace, including a timetable calling for  agreement on the formation of a unified transitional government within 3  months, withdrawal of all foreign forces within 6 months, and  reestablishment of state administration throughout the DRC within 9  months, that is, by April 2000.", "The parties were slow to meet their commitments and were unable to  implement a comprehensive plan to restore peace. The formation of a  national government was also substantially delayed. The parties  committed numerous violations of the cease-fire, and it was not until  December 2002 that the Kinshasa government and major rebel groups  from eastern Congo signed a power-sharing agreement that would permit  the creation of the transitional government. Foreign troops have been slow  to withdraw in part because they want to retain control of mineral  resources. Rwanda withdrew its troops in late 2002, while Uganda  removed the last of its units in May 2003. As of August 2003, fighting has  continued among rebel militias seeking to control Ituri and other  northeastern regions. In Ituri, local, ethnic militias began fighting after  foreign troops vacated the area.", "Since 1999, the Security Council has gradually increased the strength and  mandate of the U.N. peacekeeping operation that supported the peace  process. In 2001, the council authorized the mission to train police for the  eastern rebel-occupied city of Kisangani and help reopen the Congo River  to commercial traffic. In 2002, it inaugurated a program to disarm and  repatriate ethnic Hutu militiamen and their families from the DRC to  Rwanda. The council approved a number of increases in the size of the  peacekeeping force, raising its authorized strength from 90 military  liaisons in August 1999 to 8,700 troops by December 2002. The actual  forces provided by member states to the operation have been significantly  below the ceiling because the country\u2019s unstable political environment,  great size, and poor transportation network make it costly to deploy  troops. Consequently, the number of U.N. troops actually deployed to the  DRC totaled about 6,200 soldiers and 76 police as of June 2003. In May  2003, the council also authorized the deployment of a separate French-led  force of about 1,500 international troops to the Ituri region to end fighting  and restore order in the city of Bunia.", "The Congolese parties to the peace agreement formed the National Unity  and Transition government in June 2003.

The council also authorized the mission to use force  to stabilize Ituri and other northeastern regions and expanded its force  level to 10,800 troops. The U.N. operation will also assume control over  international forces in the Ituri region in September 2003.
