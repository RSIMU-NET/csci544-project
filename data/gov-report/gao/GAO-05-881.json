Agencies still lack the capacity to create the full range of information needed for effective day-to-day management. In fiscal year 2004, auditors for 16 of the 23 CFO Act agencies reported that agencies' financial management systems failed to comply with FFMIA. Primarily six types of problems related to agencies systems were identified in the audit reports. These same types of problems have been consistently reported for agencies with noncompliant systems for a number of years. GAO views these problems with agency financial systems to be a significant challenge to improving the management of the federal government. Auditors for six agencies provided negative assurance on systems' FFMIA compliance for fiscal year 2004. This means that nothing came to their attention to indicate that financial management systems did not meet FFMIA requirements. OMB's current reporting guidance calls for negative assurance; however, GAO continues to believe that this type of reporting is not sufficient for reporting under the act. In addition, negative assurance may provide the false impression that the auditors are reporting that the agencies' systems are compliant. In contrast, auditors for the Department of Labor (DOL) provided positive assurance by reporting that DOL's financial management systems substantially complied with FFMIA requirements. In fiscal year 2005, DOL auditors plan to enhance their audit procedures to focus on the reliability and use of managerial cost information. GAO looks forward to other auditors adopting a similar reporting practice that adds more value. In addition, auditors have expressed concern about providing positive assurance because of the need to clarify the meaning of substantial compliance. OMB continues to move ahead on other initiatives to enhance financial management in the federal government.

This series of legislation started with  the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act of 1982 (FMFIA), which  Congress passed to strengthen internal controls and accounting systems  throughout the federal government, among other purposes. Issued  pursuant to FMFIA, the Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government provides the standards that are  directed at helping agency managers implement effective internal control,  an integral part of improving financial management systems. Internal  control is a major part of managing an organization and comprises the  plans, methods, and procedures used to meet missions, goals, and  objectives. In summary, internal control, which under OMB\u2019s guidance for  FMFIA is synonymous with management control, helps government  program managers achieve desired results through effective stewardship of  public resources.", "Effective internal control also helps in managing change to cope with  shifting environments and evolving demands and priorities. As programs  change and agencies strive to improve operational processes and  implement new technological developments, management must  continually assess and evaluate its internal control to ensure that the  control activities being used are effective and updated when necessary.  While agencies had achieved some success in identifying and correcting  material internal control and accounting system weaknesses, their efforts  to implement FMFIA had not produced the results intended by Congress.", "Therefore, in the 1990s, Congress passed additional management reform  legislation to improve the general and financial management of the federal  government. The combination of reforms ushered in by the (1) CFO Act of  1990, (2) Government Performance and Results Act of 1993,  (3) Government Management Reform Act of 1994, (4) FFMIA, (5) Clinger- Cohen Act of 1996, (6) Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, and (7) Department of Homeland Security Financial Accountability Act of  2004, if successfully implemented, provides a solid foundation for  improving the accountability of government programs and operations as  well as for routinely producing valuable cost and operating performance  information. These financial management reform acts emphasize the  importance of improving financial management across the federal  government.", "In particular, building on the foundation laid by the CFO Act, FFMIA  emphasizes the need for agencies to have systems that are able to generate  reliable, useful, and timely information for decision-making purposes and  to ensure accountability on an ongoing basis. FFMIA requires the  departments and agencies covered by the CFO Act to implement and  maintain financial management systems that comply substantially with (1) federal financial management systems requirements, (2) applicable  federal accounting standards, and (3) the SGL at the transaction level.  FFMIA also requires auditors to state in their CFO Act financial statement  audit reports whether the agencies\u2019 financial management systems  substantially comply with FFMIA\u2019s systems requirements.

Specifically, this guidance calls for  auditors to provide negative assurance when reporting on an agency  system\u2019s FFMIA compliance. Second, in OMB Memorandum, Revised  Implementation Guidance for the Federal Financial Management  Improvement Act (Jan. 4, 2001), OMB provides guidance for agencies and  auditors to use in assessing substantial compliance. The guidance  describes the factors that should be considered in determining whether an  agency\u2019s systems substantially comply with FFMIA\u2019s requirements. Further,  the guidance provides examples of the types of indicators that should be  used as a basis for assessing whether an agency\u2019s systems are in substantial  compliance with each of the three FFMIA requirements.

As detailed in appendix V, we have also issued a series of  checklists to help assess whether agencies systems meet systems  requirements. The FAM guidance on FFMIA assessments recognizes that  while financial statement audits offer some assurance regarding FFMIA  compliance, auditors should design and implement additional testing to  satisfy FFMIA criteria. For example, in performing financial statement  audits, auditors generally focus on the ability of the financial management  systems to process and summarize financial information that flows into  annual agency financial statements. In contrast, FFMIA requires auditors to  assess whether an agency\u2019s financial management systems comply with  system requirements, accounting standards, and the SGL. To do this,  auditors need to consider whether agency systems provide reliable, useful,  and timely information for managing day-to-day operations so that agency  managers would have the necessary information to measure performance  on an ongoing basis rather than just at year-end. Further, OMB\u2019s current  audit guidance calls for financial statement auditors to review  performance information for consistency with the financial statements, but  does not require auditors to determine whether such information is  available to managers for day-to-day decision making as called for by the  FAM guidance for testing compliance with FFMIA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed the fiscal year 2004 financial statement audit reports for the  23 CFO Act agencies to identify the auditors\u2019 assessments of agency  financial systems\u2019 compliance and the problems that affect FFMIA  compliance.

The change was due to audit tests  performed on NRC\u2019s fee billing system in fiscal year 2004. As a result of  their tests, the auditors concluded that the billing system lacked sound  internal controls and does not comply with existing requirements for  revenue systems. At GSA, the auditors provided negative assurance that the  financial management systems were FFMIA-compliant in fiscal year 2004,  although they had previously determined that the systems were not in  compliance for fiscal year 2003 due to significant reconciliation problems.  For fiscal year 2004, the GSA auditors closed the material weakness  regarding the significant reconciliation problems that had affected GSA the  prior year.", "DHS will be subject to FFMIA for the first time in fiscal year 2005.

However, we have noted that the DHS  auditors identified and reported deficiencies that relate to all three FFMIA  requirements. We plan to include DHS in our analysis of the fiscal year 2005  FFMIA results.", "While substantially more CFO Act agencies have obtained clean or  unqualified audit opinions on their financial statements, as shown in figure  2, the underlying agency financial systems remain a serious problem. The  number of unqualified opinions has increased over the past 8 years (from  11 in fiscal year 1997 to 18 for fiscal year 2004), and most agencies were  able to issue their audited financial statements within the accelerated  reporting time frame\u201422 of the 23 CFO Act agencies issued their audited  financial statements by the November 15, 2004, deadline set by OMB, just  46 days after the close of the fiscal year. While the increase in unqualified  and timely opinions is noteworthy, we are concerned over the growing  number of CFO Act agencies that have restated certain of their financial  statements for fiscal year 2003 to correct errors and have included a matter  of emphasis paragraph in our report on the audit of the fiscal year 2004  consolidated financial statements given the seriousness of this problem. As we have previously testified, at least 11 of the 23 CFO Act agencies  restated their fiscal year 2003 financial statements, whereas 5 CFO Act  agencies restated their fiscal year 2002 financial statements. The  restatements to CFO Act agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 financial statements  ranged from correcting two line items on one agency\u2019s balance sheet to  numerous line items on several of another agency\u2019s financial statements.  The amounts of the agencies\u2019 restatements ranged from several million  dollars to over $91 billion. Nine of those 11 agencies received unqualified  opinions on their financial statements originally issued in fiscal year 2003.  Seven of the 9 auditors issued unqualified opinions on the restated financial  statements, which in substance replace the auditors\u2019 opinions on their  respective agencies\u2019 original fiscal year 2003 financial statements. For 2 of  these 9 agencies, the auditors not only withdrew their unqualified opinions  on the fiscal year 2003 financial statements but also issued other than  unqualified opinions on their respective agencies\u2019 restated fiscal year 2003  financial statements because they could not determine whether there were  any additional misstatements and the effect that these could have on the  restated fiscal year 2003 financial statements.", "For two of the agencies with restated financial statements, auditors  provided negative assurance that the agencies\u2019 systems were in compliance  with FFMIA for fiscal year 2003. The restatements at these agencies  reflected inaccurate recording of transactions, and in one case, the cause  for the restatement could be traced back to the implementation of new  software, among other factors. The necessity for these agencies to restate  certain financial accounts in the subsequent fiscal year raises questions  about whether the agencies systems substantially met FFMIA requirements  and whether financial managers had access to reliable, useful, and timely  information with which to make fully informed operational decisions in  fiscal year 2003.", "The need for restatements and end-of-the-year adjustments to correct for  errors undermines public trust and confidence in both the entity and all  responsible parties and indicates a continuing lack of improvement in the  underlying agency financial systems. Undue emphasis on receiving  unqualified or clean audit opinions has led to an expectation gap since, as  more agencies receive clean opinions, public expectations are raised that  the government has sound financial management and can produce reliable,  useful, and timely information on demand throughout the year, whereas the  annual FFMIA assessments offer a different perspective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FFMIA Compliance Findings Mostly Based on Negative Assurance", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2004 auditors for seven agencies reported their systems to be  in substantial compliance with the requirements of FFMIA. Auditors for six  of these agencies (Commerce, Energy, EPA, NRC, NSF, and SSA) provided  negative assurance that the agencies\u2019 systems were in compliance with  FFMIA. Auditors provide negative assurance when they state that nothing  came to their attention during the course of their planned procedures to  indicate that these agencies\u2019 financial management systems did not meet  FFMIA requirements. If readers are not familiar with the concept of  negative assurance, which we believe is generally the case, they may  incorrectly assume that these systems have been fully tested by the  auditors and that the agencies have achieved compliance. OMB\u2019s current  audit guidance only calls for auditors to provide negative assurance when  reporting whether an agency\u2019s systems are in substantial compliance with  FFMIA.", "To provide positive assurance of FFMIA compliance, auditors need to  perform more comprehensive audit procedures than those necessary to  render an opinion for a financial statement audit. In performing financial  statement audits, auditors generally focus on the capability of the financial  management systems to process and summarize financial information that  flows into financial statements. In contrast, FFMIA is much broader and  requires auditors to assess whether an agency\u2019s financial management  systems substantially comply with systems requirements. To do this,  auditors need to consider whether agency systems provide complete,  accurate, and timely information for day-to-day decision making and  management.", "In fiscal year 2004, auditors for DOL provided an opinion, or positive  assurance, of DOL\u2019s financial management systems\u2019 compliance with  FFMIA. At DOL, the Inspector General (IG) contracted with an  independent public accounting firm to perform the FFMIA examination in  accordance with American Institute of Certified Public Accountants  attestation standards, which by reference are incorporated in Government  Auditing Standards. To do so, the auditors used a combination of financial  statement and FFMIA-specific audit procedures. Specifically, they  performed extensive transaction testing and reconciliations combined with  FFMIA-related audit procedures based on the GAO/PCIE FAM  requirements. For example, they developed a good understanding of the  financial systems capabilities, documented their assessments of DOL\u2019s  financial systems\u2019 compliance with systems requirements, and considered  the nature and extent of managerial cost information available for effective  day-to-day management.", "According to the auditors, two developments at DOL in fiscal year 2004  were key to the ability of the auditors to conclude that DOL systems  substantially complied with the three requirements of FFMIA for fiscal year  2004. First, during fiscal year 2004, DOL management assigned staff the  responsibility of reconciling the Fund Balance with Treasury (FBWT)  accounts on a daily basis. Due to this increased focus on FBWT, at the end  of fiscal year 2004, the auditors found no material differences between DOL  and Treasury\u2019s records. Second, DOL implemented a cost management  system during fiscal year 2004 in order to provide current year cost data to  managers that has not been available in prior years. The auditors also  determined that none of the internal control deficiencies reported as part  of the financial statement audit indicated substantial noncompliance with  FFMIA requirements. For the fiscal year 2005 financial statement audit, the  auditors plan to increase their focus on the types of reports being produced  currently by the cost system and how managers are using that information  for day-to-day operations. In addition, the fiscal year 2005 DOL audit plan  requires the auditors to perform the FFMIA-related FAM audit procedures  and complete the associated checklists.", "The efforts by the DOL auditors to perform the level of review necessary to  provide positive assurance of FFMIA compliance in fiscal year 2004 is most  noteworthy. We have discussed the importance of providing positive  assurance on FFMIA as required by the act for a number of years. We look  forward to other agencies adopting similar auditing and reporting practice.", "Providing positive assurance of an agency\u2019s financial management system  can identify weaknesses and lead to improvements that enhance the  performance, productivity, and efficiency of federal financial management  systems. It also provides a clear \u201cbottom line,\u201d whereas negative assurance  does not do so. Therefore, as we have discussed in prior reports, we  reaffirm our prior recommendation that OMB require agency auditors to  provide a statement of positive assurance when reporting an agency\u2019s  systems to be in substantial compliance with FFMIA. OMB continues to  support the requirement for negative assurance of FFMIA compliance.  While OMB agrees that testing should occur, and its guidance on FFMIA  calls for it, OMB officials stated that different, more coordinated  approaches toward assessing an agency\u2019s internal controls and FFMIA  compliance might provide sufficient assurance on an agency\u2019s systems. For  example, in preparing the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA)  scorecard assessments, OMB officials meet with agencies to discuss a  number of financial management issues and have systems demonstrations.  Agencies are asked to identify key business questions and related cost  drivers. Then, the agencies must develop systems that can produce the  information needed on those cost drivers to help management at all levels  focus on results. OMB officials stated that they believed the PMA scorecard  framework offers an alternate route toward substantial compliance that is  similar to that offered by positive assurance. In its written comments on a  draft of this report (see app. VI), OMB stated that the processes used in  evaluating agencies against the PMA standards can provide a corroborative  mechanism in evaluating compliance with FFMIA. Our concern is that the  information provided by this approach does not come under audit scrutiny,  which is what the law requires, and may not be reliable.", "In December 2004, OMB revised Circular No. A-123, Management\u2019s  Responsibility for Internal Control, to strengthen the requirements for  conducting management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial  reporting. The revision incorporates the internal control requirements for  publicly traded companies that are contained in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002. The circular emphasized management\u2019s responsibility for  establishing, maintaining, and reporting on internal control to achieve the  objectives of effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting,  and compliance with laws and regulations. In commenting on a draft of this  report, OMB emphasized that through its revision to Circular No. A-123,  agencies are required to implement more rigorous processes for  conducting management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal  controls over financial reporting. Given that PMA and Circular No. A-123  reviews help to ensure agencies\u2019 access to and use of timely and accurate  financial data, OMB believes that requiring a statement of positive  assurance would prove only marginally useful.", "From our perspective, auditor reporting on internal control is a critical  component of monitoring the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s  accountability, especially for large, complex, or challenged entities.  Auditors can better serve their clients and other financial statement users  and better protect the public interest by having a greater role in providing  assurances of the effectiveness of internal control in deterring fraudulent  financial reporting and protecting assets. Financial management systems  are a critical element of an entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.  Although enhanced internal control reporting would not necessarily  address the full capability of the financial management systems in place,  such reporting would include reportable internal control weaknesses  caused by financial systems problems. However, the full value of  independent auditors\u2019 assessments of FFMIA compliance will not be fully  realized until auditors perform a sufficient level of audit work to be able to  provide positive assurance that agencies are in compliance with FFMIA as  called for in the act. When reporting an agency\u2019s financial management  systems to be in substantial compliance, positive assurance from  independent auditors will provide users with confidence that the agency  systems provide the reliable, useful, and timely information envisioned by  the act.", "In addition, we also reaffirm our previous recommendation that OMB  explore clarifying the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to help ensure  consistent application of the term. As we noted in our prior reports,  auditors we interviewed had concerns about providing positive assurance  in reporting on agency systems\u2019 FFMIA compliance because of a need for  clarification regarding the meaning of substantial compliance. In its  comments, OMB stated that its growing experience helping agencies  implement the PMA enables it to refine the existing FFMIA indicators  associated with substantial compliance.

The weaknesses reported  by the auditors ranged from serious, pervasive systems problems to less  serious problems that may affect only one aspect of an agency\u2019s accounting  operation:  nonintegrated financial management systems,  lack of accurate and timely recording of financial information,  noncompliance with the SGL,  lack of adherence to federal accounting standards, and  weak security controls over information systems.", "Figure 3 shows the relative frequency of these problems at the 16 agencies  reported to have noncompliant systems. The same six types of problems  have been cited by auditors in their fiscal years 2000 through 2003 audit  reports, although the auditors may not have reported these problems as  specific reasons for their systems\u2019 lack of substantial compliance with  FFMIA.

OMB Circular No. A-127, Financial Management Systems, requires  agencies to establish and maintain a single integrated financial  management system that conforms to functional requirements published  by JFMIP\u2019s Program Management Office (PMO). More details on the  financial management systems requirements can be found in appendixes I  and II.", "The lack of integrated financial management systems typically results in  agencies expending major effort and resources, including in some cases  hiring external consultants, to develop information that their systems  should be able to provide on a daily or recurring basis. Agencies with  nonintegrated financial systems are also more likely to devote more time  and resources to collecting information than those with integrated systems.  In addition, opportunities for errors are increased when agencies\u2019 systems  are not integrated.", "Auditors frequently mentioned the lack of integrated financial management  systems in their fiscal year 2004 audit reports. As shown in figure 3,  auditors for 12 of the 16 agencies with noncompliant systems reported this  to be a problem, compared with 11 of the 17 agencies reported with  noncompliant systems in fiscal year 2003. For example, auditors for the  Department of Justice reported that the financial management systems of  the department\u2019s component agencies are not integrated or configured to  support financial management and reporting. For instance, the U.S.  Marshals Service\u2019s core financial system lacks integrated subsidiary ledgers  for certain key account balances. Consequently, staff at this organization  must perform time-consuming manual procedures to document  adjustments and crosswalks between the general ledger and the financial  statements. However, the limited amount of time available at the end of  each financial reporting period increases the risk that errors existing in the  financial statements were not detected and corrected prior to final  issuance. The auditors also noted that the nonintegrated systems do not  support management\u2019s need for timely and accurate information for day-to- day decision making.", "At the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), auditors  reported numerous weaknesses in the core financial system, the integrated  financial management system first implemented by NASA in fiscal year  2003. We have previously reported on problems NASA faced when implementing this system. Specifically, the auditors found that the core  financial system lacked integration with certain key subsidiary systems,  such as the property system, and does not facilitate the preparation of  financial statements. Although the auditors recognized that management  identified and resolved significant system problems in fiscal year 2004, the  auditors identified serious continuing weaknesses in their review of  property, plant, and equipment (PP&E)\u2014specifically contractor-held  PP&E. For example, due to a lack of integration with the property system,  entries for contractor-held property, totaling $8.5 billion, had to be  manually entered into the core financial system. The auditors concluded  that the problems will not be fully addressed until NASA implements a  single integrated system for reporting property and develops a  methodology to identify costs that should be capitalized at the time that  transactions are processed. The auditors further noted that certain  transactions continue to be posted incorrectly due to improper  configurations within the system.

Furthermore, DOT lacked an effective process for  reconciling transactions among its own subsidiary agencies. In fiscal year  2004, DOT\u2019s subsidiary agencies reported a total of $17 million in accounts  receivable, or amounts due from other departmental agencies.

This condition also renders IRS  unable to produce reliable cost-based performance information. IRS  officials stated that they have the information necessary to determine the  cost of various activities, such as conducting investigations; however, this  information is widely distributed among a variety of information systems  that are not integrated and therefore cannot share data.
