However, for smaller public companies (defined in this report as $700 million or less in market capitalization), the cost of compliance has been disproportionately higher (as a percentage of revenues) than for large public companies, particularly with respect to the internal control reporting provisions in section 404 and related audit fees. Smaller public companies noted that resource limitations and questions regarding the application of existing internal control over financial reporting guidance to smaller public companies contributed to challenges they face in implementing section 404. The costs associated with complying with the act, along with other market factors, may be encouraging some companies to become private. The companies going private were small by any measure and represented 2 percent of public companies in 2004. The full impact of the act on smaller public companies remains unclear because the majority of smaller public companies have not fully implemented section 404. To address concerns from smaller public companies, SEC extended the section 404 deadline for smaller companies with less than $75 million in market capitalization, with the latest extension to 2007. Additionally, SEC and PCAOB issued guidance intended to make the section 404 compliance process more economical, efficient, and effective. SEC also encouraged the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO), to develop guidance for smaller public companies in implementing internal control over financial reporting in a cost-effective manner. COSO's guidance had not been finalized as of March 2006. SEC also formed an advisory committee to examine, among other things, the impact of the act on smaller public companies. The committee plans to issue a report in April 2006 that will recommend, in effect, a tiered approach with certain smaller public companies partially or fully exempt from section 404, \"unless and until\" a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting is developed that recognizes the characteristics and needs of smaller public companies. As SEC considers these recommendations, it is essential that the overriding purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act--investor protection--is preserved and that SEC assess available guidance to determine if additional supplemental or clarifying guidance for smaller public companies is needed. Smaller public companies have been able to obtain access to needed audit services and many moved from the largest accounting firms to mid-sized and small firms. The reasons for these changes range from audit cost and service concerns cited by companies to client profitability and risk concerns cited by accounting firms, including capacity constraints and assessments of client risk. Overall, mid-sized and small accounting firms conducted 30 percent of total public company audits in 2004--up from 22 percent in 2002. However, large accounting firms continue to dominate the overall market, auditing 98 percent of U.S. publicly traded company sales or revenues."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In response to numerous corporate failures arising from corporate  mismanagement and fraud, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002.

Public and investor confidence in the fairness  of financial reporting and corporate ethics is critical to the effective  functioning of our capital markets. The act\u2019s requirements apply to all  public companies regardless of size and the public accounting firms that  audit them.", "The act established the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board  (PCAOB) as a private-sector non-profit organization to oversee the audits  of public companies that are subject to securities laws. PCAOB, which is  subject to oversight by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), is  responsible for establishing related auditing, quality control, ethics, and  auditor independence standards. The act also addresses auditor  independence and the relationship between auditors and the public  companies they audit. The act requires public companies to assess the  effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and for their  external auditors to report on management\u2019s assessment and the  effectiveness of internal controls. The act also contains provisions  intended to make chief executive officers (CEO) and chief financial  officers (CFO) more accountable, improve the oversight role of boards of  directors and audit committees, and provide whistleblower protection.

Similarly, we constructed a  database of public companies that went private using SEC filings and  press releases retrieved from Lexis-Nexis, an online periodical database.  To obtain information on smaller public companies\u2019 experiences with  Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance, we also conducted a survey of companies  with market capitalization of $700 million or less and annual revenues of  $100 million or less that, as of August 11, 2005, reported to SEC that they  had complied with the act\u2019s internal control-related requirements. One  hundred fifty-eight of 591 companies completed the survey, for an overall  response rate of 27 percent. Additionally, we held discussions with  representatives of SEC, the Small Business Administration (SBA), PCAOB,  smaller public companies, the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of  the Treadway Commission (COSO), financial service providers, rating  agencies, institutional investors, trade groups, accounting firms, and other  market participants.", "Because SEC has extended the date by which registered public companies  with less than $75 million in public float (known as non-accelerated filers)  had to comply with the act\u2019s internal control-related provisions (section  404) to their first fiscal year ending on or after July 15, 2007, we could not  analyze the impact of the internal control provisions of the act for a  significant number of smaller public companies (SEC estimates that non- accelerated filers represent about 60 percent of all registered public  companies). Thus, to gain some insight into the potential impact these  provisions may have on smaller public companies, we analyzed public data  and other information related to the experiences of public companies that  have fully implemented the act\u2019s provisions. To determine the act\u2019s impact  on smaller privately held companies, we interviewed officials about state  requirements comparable to key Sarbanes-Oxley provisions and  representatives of smaller private companies and financial institutions  about capital access requirements. We also analyzed data on companies\u2019  initial public offering (IPO) and secondary public offering (SPO) from SEC  filings.

The definition of  small varies among agencies, but SEC generally calls companies that had  less than $75 million in public float non-accelerated filers. Accelerated  filers are required by SEC regulations to file their annual and quarterly  reports to SEC on an accelerated basis compared to non-accelerated filers.  As of 2005, SEC estimated that about 60 percent \u20145,971 companies\u2014of all  registered public companies were non-accelerated filers.

PCAOB is subject to SEC oversight. The act gives  PCAOB four primary areas of responsibility:  registration of accounting firms that audit public companies in the U.S.  securities markets;  inspections of registered accounting firms;    establishment of auditing, quality control, and ethics standards for  registered accounting firms; and investigation and discipline of registered accounting firms for violations of  law or professional standards.", "Title II of the act addresses auditor independence. It prohibits the  registered external auditor of a public company from providing certain  nonaudit services to that public company audit client. Title II also specifies  communication that is required between auditors and the public  company\u2019s audit committee (or board of directors) and requires periodic  rotation of the audit partners managing a public company\u2019s audits.", "Titles III and IV of the act focus on corporate responsibility and enhanced  financial disclosures. Title III addresses listed company audit committees,  including responsibilities and independence, and corporate  responsibilities for financial reports, including certifications by corporate  officers in annual and quarterly reports, among other provisions. Title IV  addresses disclosures in financial reporting and transactions involving  management and principal stockholders and other provisions such as  internal control over financial reporting. More specifically, section 404 of  the act establishes requirements for companies to publicly report on  management\u2019s responsibility for establishing and maintaining an adequate  internal control structure, including controls over financial reporting and  the results of management\u2019s assessment of the effectiveness of internal  control over financial reporting. Section 404 also requires the firms that  serve as external auditors for public companies to attest to the assessment  made by the companies\u2019 management, and report on the results of their  attestation and whether they agree with management\u2019s assessment of the  company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.", "SEC and PCAOB have issued regulations, standards, and guidance to  implement the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For instance, both SEC regulations  and PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard Number 2, \u201cAn Audit of Internal Control  Over Financial Reporting Performed in Conjunction with an Audit of  Financial Statements\u201d state that management is required to base its  assessment of the effectiveness of the company\u2019s internal control over  financial reporting on a suitable, recognized control framework  established by a body of experts that followed due process procedures,  including the broad distribution of the framework for public comment.  Both the SEC guidance and PCAOB\u2019s auditing standard cite the COSO  principles as providing a suitable framework for purposes of section 404  compliance. In 1992, COSO issued its \u201cInternal Control\u2014Integrated  Framework\u201d (the COSO Framework) to help businesses and other entities  assess and enhance their internal control. Since that time, the COSO  framework has been recognized by regulatory standards setters and others  as a comprehensive framework for evaluating internal control, including  internal control over financial reporting. The COSO framework includes a  common definition of internal control and criteria against which  companies could evaluate the effectiveness of their internal control  systems.  The framework consists of five interrelated components:  control environment, risk assessment, control activities, information and  communication, and monitoring. While SEC and PCAOB do not mandate  the use of any particular framework, PCAOB states that the framework  used by a company should have elements that encompass the five COSO  components on internal control.", "Internal control generally serves as a first line of defense in safeguarding  assets and preventing and detecting errors and fraud. Internal control is  defined as a process, effected by an entity\u2019s board of directors,  management, and other personnel, designed to provide reasonable  assurance regarding the achievement of the following objectives: (1)  effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (2) reliability of financial  reporting; and (3) compliance with laws and regulations. Internal control  over financial reporting is further defined in the SEC regulations  implementing section 404. These regulations define internal control over  financial reporting as providing reasonable assurance regarding the  reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial  statements, including those policies and procedures that    pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the  company;   provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary  to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally  accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the  company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of  management and directors of the company; and   provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of  unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company\u2019s assets that  could have a material effect on the financial statements.", "PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2 reiterates this definition of internal  control over financial reporting. Internal control is not a new requirement  for public companies. In December 1977, as a result of corporate  falsification of records and improper accounting, Congress enacted the  Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). The FCPA\u2019s internal accounting  control requirements were intended to prevent fraudulent financial  reporting, among other things. The FCPA required companies to: (1) make  and keep books, records, and accounts that in reasonable detail accurately  and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of assets and (2)  develop and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to  provide reasonable assurance over the recording and executing of  transactions, the preparation of financial statements in accordance with  standards, and maintaining accountability for assets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smaller Public Companies Have Incurred Disproportionately Higher Audit Costs in Implementing the Act, but Impact on Access to Capital Remains Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis, costs associated with implementing the Sarbanes- Oxley Act\u2014particularly those costs associated with the internal control  provisions in section 404\u2014were disproportionately higher (as a  percentage of revenues) for smaller public companies. In complying with  the act, smaller companies noted that they incurred higher audit fees and  other costs, such as hiring more staff or paying for outside consultants, to  comply with the act\u2019s provisions. Further, resource and expertise  limitations that characterize many smaller companies as well as their  general lack of familiarity or experience with formal internal control  frameworks contributed to the challenges and increased costs they faced  during section 404 implementation. Along with other market factors, the  act may have encouraged a relatively small number of smaller public  companies to go private, foregoing sources of funding that were  potentially more diversified and may be less expensive for many of these  companies. However, the ultimate impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on  smaller public companies\u2019 access to capital remains unclear because of the  limited time that the act has been in effect and the large number of smaller  public companies that have not yet fully implemented the act\u2019s internal  control provisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Smaller Public Companies Incurred Disproportionately Higher Audit Costs", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis indicates that audit fees have increased considerably since  the passage of the act, particularly for those smaller public companies that  have fully implemented the act. Both smaller and larger public companies  have identified the internal control provisions in section 404 as the most  costly to implement. However, audit fees may have also increased because  of the current environment surrounding public company audits including,  among other things, the new regulatory oversight of audit firms, new  requirements related to audit documentation, and legal risk. Figure 1  contains data reported by public companies on audit fees paid to external  auditors before and after the section 404 provisions became effective for  accelerated filers in 2004. Based on this data, we found that (1) audit fees  already were disproportionately greater as a percentage of revenues for  smaller public companies in 2003 and (2) the disparity in smaller and  larger public companies\u2019 audit fees as a percentage of revenues increased  for those companies that implemented section 404 in 2004. For example,  of the companies that reported implementing section 404, public  companies with market capitalization of $75 million or less paid a median  $1.14 in audit fees for every $100 of revenues compared to $0.13 in audit  fees for public companies with market capitalization greater than $1  billion. Among public companies with market capitalization of $75  million or less (2,263 in total), the 66 companies that implemented section  404 paid a median $0.35 more per $100 in revenues compared to those that  had not implemented section 404. However, using publicly reported audit  fees as an indicator of the act\u2019s compliance costs has some limitations.  First, the audit fees reported by companies that complied with section 404  should include fees for both the internal control audit and the financial  statement audit. As a result, we could not isolate the audit fees associated  with section 404. Second, the fees paid to the external auditor do not  include other costs companies incurred to comply with section 404  requirements, such as testing and documenting internal controls and fees  paid to external consultants. While the spread between what smallest and  largest public companies that implemented section 404 paid as a  percentage of revenue increased between 2003 and 2004, we also noted  that, as a percentage of revenue, the relative disproportionality between  the audit fees paid by smaller public companies and the largest public  companies remained roughly the same between 2003 and 2004.

For example, 128 of the 158 smaller public  companies that responded to our survey (81 percent of respondents) had  hired a separate accounting firm or consultant to assist them in meeting  section 404 requirements. Services provided included assistance with  developing methodologies to comply with section 404, documenting and  testing internal controls, and helping management assess the effectiveness  of internal controls and remediate identified internal control weaknesses.  These smaller companies reported paying fees to external consultants for  the period leading up to their first section 404 report that ranged from  $3,000 to more than $1.4 million. Many also reported costs related to  training and hiring of new or temporary staff to implement the act\u2019s  requirements. Additionally, some of the smaller companies that responded  to our survey reported that their CFOs and accounting staff spent as much  as 90 percent of their time for the period leading up to their first section  404 report on Sarbanes-Oxley Act compliance-related issues. Finally, many  of the smaller public companies incurred missed \u201copportunity costs\u201d to  comply with the act that were significant. For example, nearly half (47  percent) of the companies that responded to our survey reported deferring  or canceling operational improvements and more than one-third (39  percent) indicated that they deferred or cancelled information technology  investments.", "While most companies, including the majority of the smaller public  companies that responded to our survey and that we interviewed, cited  section 404 as the most difficult provision to implement, smaller public  companies reported challenges in complying with other Sarbanes-Oxley  Act provisions as well. Nearly 69 percent of the smaller public companies  that responded to our survey said that the act\u2019s auditor independence  requirements had decreased the amount of advice that they received from  their external auditor on accounting- and tax-related matters. About half  the companies that responded to our survey indicated that they incurred  additional expenses by hiring outside counsel for assistance in complying  with various requirements of the act. Examples mentioned included legal  assistance with drafting charters for board committees, drafting a code of  ethics, establishing whistleblower protection, and reviewing CEO and CFO  certification requirements. About 13 percent of the smaller public  companies reported incurring costs to appoint a financial expert to serve  on the audit committee, and about 6 percent reported incurring costs to  appoint other independent members to serve on the audit committee.  While these types of costs were consistent with those reported for larger  companies, the impact on smaller public companies was likely greater  given their more limited revenues and resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Smaller Companies Have Different Characteristics Than Larger Companies, Some of Which Contributed to Higher Implementation Costs", "paragraphs": ["While public companies\u2014both large and small\u2014have been required to  establish and maintain internal accounting controls since the Foreign  Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, most public companies and their external  auditors generally had limited practical experience in implementing and  using a structured framework for internal control over financial reporting  as envisioned by the implementing regulations for section 404. Our  survey of smaller public companies and our discussions with external  auditors indicated that the internal control framework\u2014that is the COSO  framework\u2014referred to in SEC\u2019s regulations and PCAOB\u2019s standards  implementing section 404 was not widely used by public companies,  especially smaller companies, prior to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.", "Many companies documented their internal controls for the first time as  part of their first year implementation efforts to comply with section 404.  As a result, many companies probably underestimated the time and  resources necessary to comply with section 404, partly because of their  lack of experience or familiarity with the framework. These challenges  were undoubtedly compounded in companies that needed to make  significant improvements in their internal control systems to make up for  deferred maintenance of those systems. While this was largely true for  both larger and smaller companies, regulators (SEC and PCAOB), public  accounting firms, and others have indicated that smaller public companies  often face particular challenges in implementing effective internal control  over financial reporting.", "Resource limitations make it more difficult for smaller public companies  to achieve economies of scale, segregate duties and responsibilities, and  hire qualified accounting personnel to prepare and report financial  information. Smaller companies are inherently less able to take advantage  of economies of scale because they face higher fixed per unit costs than  larger companies with more resources and employees. Implementing the  functions required to segregate transaction duties in a smaller company  absorbs a larger percentage of the company\u2019s revenues or assets than in a  larger company. About 60 percent of the smaller public companies that  responded to our survey said that it was difficult to implement effective  segregation of duties. Several executives told us that it was difficult to  segregate duties due to limited resources. According to COSO\u2019s draft  guidance for smaller public companies, smaller companies can develop  and implement compensating controls when resource constraints  compromise the ability to segregate duties. The American Institute of  Certified Public Accountants noted that smaller public companies often do  not have the internal audit functions referred to in COSO\u2019s internal  framework guidance. Other executives commented that it was difficult to  achieve effective internal control over financial reporting because they  lacked expertise within their internal accounting staff. For example,  according to an executive from a company that reported a material  weakness in its section 404 report, the financial accounting standards for  stock options were too complex for his staff and it was easier to have its  auditor fix the mistakes and cite the company for a material weakness in  internal control over financial reporting. Two other executives told us that  their auditors cited their companies with material weaknesses in internal  controls over financial reporting for not having appropriate internal  accounting staff; to remediate this weakness, the companies had to hire  additional staff.", "According to COSO, however, some of the unique characteristics of  smaller companies create opportunities to more efficiently achieve  effective internal control over financial reporting and more efficiently  evaluate internal control which can facilitate compliance with section 404.  These opportunities can result from more centralized management  oversight of the business, and greater exposure and transparency with the  senior levels of the company that often exist in a smaller company. For  instance, management\u2019s hands-on approach in smaller companies can  create opportunities for less formal and less expensive communications  and control procedures without decreasing their quality. To the extent that  smaller companies have less complex product lines and processes, and/or  centralized geographic concentrations in operations, the process of  achieving and evaluating effective internal control over financial reporting  could be simplified.", "According to SEC, another characteristic of smaller public companies is  that they tend to be much more closely held than larger public companies;  insiders such as founders, directors, and executive officers hold a high  percentage of shares in the companies. Further, CFOs of smaller public  companies frequently play a more integrated operational role than their  larger company counterparts. According to a recommendation by  participants at the September 2005 Government-Business Forum on Small  Business Capital Formation hosted by SEC, these types of shareholders  are classic insiders who do not need significant SEC protection.  According to SEC\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis, among public companies  with a market capitalization of $125 million or less, insiders own on  average approximately 30 percent of the company\u2019s shares. Although the  \u201cinsider\u201d shareholders owners may not have the same need for significant  investor SEC protection as investors in broadly held companies, minority  shareholders who are not insiders may have a need for such protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complexity, Scope, and Timing of PCAOB Guidance also Appeared to Influence Cost of Section 404 Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Accounting firms and public companies also have noted that the scope,  complexity, and timing of PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2 contributed to  the challenges and higher costs in the first year of implementation of  section 404. PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2 establishes new audit  requirements and governs both the auditor\u2019s assessment of controls and its  attestation to management\u2019s report. PCAOB first issued an exposure draft  of the standard for comment by interested parties on October 7, 2003. The  Board received 194 comment letters from a variety of interested parties,  including auditors, investors, internal auditors, public companies,  regulators, and others. Due to the time needed to draft the standard,  evaluate the comment letters, and finalize the standard, PCAOB did not  issue the final standard until March 2004\u2014more than 8 months after SEC  issued its final regulations on section 404 and part way into the initial year  of implementation for accelerated filers.

In  PCAOB\u2019s report on the initial implementation of Auditing Standard No. 2,  the Board found that both auditors and public companies faced enormous  challenges in the first year of implementation arising from the limited time  frames for implementing the new requirements; a shortage of staff with  prior training and experience in designing, evaluating, and testing controls;  and related strains on available resources. The Board found that some  audits performed under these circumstances were not as effective or  efficient as they should have been.

Based on the trends observed in 2003 and 2004 and  the 80 companies that went private in the first quarter of 2005, we project  that the number of companies going private will have risen more than 87  percent, from the 143 in 2001 to a projected 267 through the end of 2005.  Our analysis also indicated that companies going private during this entire  period were disproportionately small by any measure (market  capitalization, revenue, or assets).", "The costs associated with public company status were most often cited as  a reason for going private (see table 2). While there are many reasons for a  company deregistering\u2014including the inability to benefit from its public  company status\u2014the percentage of deregistered companies citing the  direct cost associated with maintaining public company status grew from  12 percent in 1998 to 62 percent during the first quarter of 2005. These  costs include the accounting, legal, and administrative costs associated  with compliance with SEC\u2019s reporting requirements as well as other  expenses such as those related to managing shareholder accounts. The  number of companies citing indirect costs, such as the time and resources  needed to comply with securities regulations, also has increased since the  passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In 2002, 64 companies that went  private cited cost as one of the reasons for the decision; however, that  number increased to 143 and 130 companies in 2003 and 2004,  respectively. Many of the companies mentioned both the direct and  indirect costs associated with maintaining their public company status.  Over half of the companies that cited costs mentioned the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act specifically (roughly 58 percent in 2004 and 2005 and 41 percent in  2003). For smaller public companies, the costs of complying with  securities laws likely required a greater portion of their revenues, and cost  considerations (indirect and direct) were the leading reasons for  companies exiting the public market, even prior to the enactment of the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act.", "Further, the benefits of public company status historically appeared to  have been disproportionately smaller for smaller companies, companies  with limited need for external funding, and companies whose public  shares were traded infrequently or in low volume at low prices. As a  result, issues unrelated to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, such as market and  liquidity issues and the benefits of being private, are also major reasons for  companies going private. From 1999 to 2004, more companies cited market  and liquidity issues than the indirect costs associated with maintaining  their public company status. Companies in this category cited a wide  variety of issues related to the company\u2019s publicly traded stock such as a  lack of analyst coverage and investor interest, poor stock market  performance, limited liquidity (trading volume), and inability to use the  secondary market to raise additional capital. Smaller companies also  have cited advantages of private status such as greater flexibility, freedom  from the short-term pressures of Wall Street, belief that the markets had  consistently undervalued the company, and the ability to avoid disclosures  of information that might benefit their competitors (see app. II).", "Companies that elect to go private reduce the number of financing options  available to them and must rely on other sources of funding. In aggregate,  equity is cheaper when it is supplied by public sources, net of any costs of  regulatory compliance. However, in some circumstances, private equity or  bank lending may be preferable alternatives to the public market.  Statistics suggest bank loans are the primary source of funding for U.S.  companies that rely on external financing. Some companies with  insufficient market liquidity had little opportunity for follow-on stock  offerings and going private would not have fundamentally altered the way  they raised capital. We found that almost 25 percent of the companies that  deregistered from 2003 through the end of the first quarter of 2005 were  not trading on any market at all (see fig. 3). Approximately 37 percent of  the companies that went private during this period were traded on the  Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB); the general liquidity of this  market is significantly less than major markets traded on the NASDAQ  Stock Market, Inc. (NASDAQ) or the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).  Additionally, 14 percent were traded in the Pink Sheets and, therefore,  were most likely closely held and traded sporadically, if at all. Pink Sheets  LLC is not registered with SEC, has no minimum listing standards, does  not require quoted companies to provide detailed information to its  investors, and is regarded as high-risk by many investors. As a result,  trading on the Pink Sheets may produce negative reputational effects that  can further reduce liquidity and the market value of the company\u2019s stock,  thereby increasing the cost of equity capital."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "It Is Too Soon to Determine How Sarbanes- Oxley Affected Access to Capital for Smaller Public Companies", "paragraphs": ["As previously discussed, a large number of smaller public companies have  not fully implemented all the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  notably non-accelerated filers (public companies with less than $75 million  in public float).

Moreover, the limited time that  the act\u2019s provisions have been in force would limit any impact on access to  capital, even for the companies that have implemented section 404.

In particular, SEC has extended deadlines for complying with  section 404 requirements several times since issuing its final rule in 2003  (see table 3). In its final rulemaking on section 404 requirements, SEC  stated that it was sensitive to concerns that many smaller public  companies would experience difficulty in evaluating their internal control  over financial reporting because these companies might not have as formal  or well-structured a system of internal control over financial reporting as  larger companies. In November 2004, SEC granted \u201csmaller\u201d accelerated  filers an additional 45 days to file their reports on internal control over  financial reporting out of concern that these companies were not in a  position to meet the original deadline. SEC granted non-accelerated filers  two additional extensions in March 2005 and September 2005, with the  latter extension giving non-accelerated filers until their first fiscal year  after July 2007 before having to report under section 404.

It is a comprehensive document that addresses  the work required by the external auditor to audit internal control over  financial reporting, the relationship of that work to the audit of the  financial statements, and the auditor\u2019s attestation on management\u2019s  assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.  The standard requires technical knowledge and professional expertise to  effectively implement.", "While both SEC regulations and the PCAOB standard refer to COSO\u2019s  internal control framework, many companies were unfamiliar with or did  not use this framework, despite the fact that public companies have been  required by law to have implemented a system of internal accounting  controls since 1977. According to SEC, smaller public companies and their  auditors had expressed concern that the COSO internal control framework  was designed primarily for larger public companies and smaller companies  lacked sufficient guidance on how they could use COSO\u2019s internal control  framework, resulting in disproportionate section 404 implementation  costs. As a result, SEC staff asked COSO to develop additional guidance to  assist smaller public companies in implementing COSO\u2019s internal control  framework in a small business environment. In October 2005, COSO issued  a draft of the guidance for public comment, and anticipated issuing final  guidance for smaller public companies in early 2006. The draft guidance  outlined 26 principles for achieving effective internal control over financial  reporting and provides examples on how companies can implement them.  The draft guidance states that the fundamental concepts of good internal  control over financial reporting are the same whether the company is large  or small. At the same time, the draft guidance points out differences in  approaches used by smaller companies versus their larger counterparts to  achieve effective internal control over financial reporting and discusses  the unique challenges faced by smaller companies. While intended to  provide additional clarity to smaller companies for implementing an  internal control framework, the guidance has received mixed reviews with  some questioning whether it will significantly change the disproportionate  cost and other burdens for smaller public companies associated with  section 404 compliance.", "In December 2004, SEC announced its intention to establish its Advisory  Committee on Smaller Public Companies to assess the current regulatory  system for smaller companies under the securities laws, including the  impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. In addition to granting companies more  time to meet the act\u2019s requirements, SEC has been considering how its  section 404 guidance and overall approach to implementation might be  revised. SEC chartered the advisory committee on March 23, 2005. The  committee plans to issue its final report to SEC by April 2006.", "On March 3, 2006, the committee published an exposure draft of its final  report for public comment that contained 32 recommendations related to  securities regulation for smaller public companies. Due to the number of  recommendations, the advisory committee refers to its 14 highest priority  recommendations as \u201cprimary recommendations.\u201d One of its primary  recommendations is an overarching recommendation calling for a \u201cscaled\u201d  approach to securities regulation, whereby smaller public companies are  stratified into two groups, \u201cmicrocap\u201d and \u201csmallcap\u201d companies. Under  this recommendation, microcap companies would consist of companies  whose common stock in the aggregate make up the lowest 1 percent of  U.S. equity market capitalization. The advisory committee estimates, based  on data from SEC\u2019s Office of Economic Analysis, that the microcap  category would include public companies whose individual market  capitalization is less than $128 million, approximately 53 percent of all U.S.  public companies. For the smallcap category, the advisory committee  estimates that the category would include public companies whose  individual market capitalization is less than $787 million and greater than  $128 million, and would encompass an additional 26 percent of U.S. public  companies and an additional 5 percent of U.S. market capitalization.  Taken together, the categories of microcap and smallcap companies, as  defined by the advisory committee draft recommendations, would include  approximately 79 percent of all U.S. public companies and 6 percent of  market capitalization, according to the advisory committee\u2019s analysis of  SEC data. The recommendation calling for a scaled approach for securities  regulation based on company size was also incorporated into the  committee\u2019s preliminary recommendations related to internal control over  financial reporting.", "While acknowledging that some have questioned whether smaller public  companies\u2019 problems with section 404 have been overstated, the advisory  committee concluded that section 404, as currently structured, \u201crepresents  a clear problem for smaller public companies and their investors, one for  which relief is urgently needed.\u201d In part, the advisory committee based  its conclusion on a belief that smaller public company compliance with  section 404 has resulted in disproportionate costs and less certain  benefits.", "The advisory committee\u2019s primary recommendations related to internal  control over financial reporting address regulatory relief from section 404  for a subset of the microcap and smallcap categories described above by  the inclusion of revenue criteria. Specifically, the committee\u2019s  preliminary recommendations are that:    Unless and until a framework for assessing internal control over financial  reporting for such companies is developed that recognizes their  characteristics and needs, provide exemptive relief from all of the  requirements of section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act to microcap  companies with less than $125 million in annual revenue and to smallcap  companies with less than $10 million in annual product revenue.", "Unless and until a framework for assessing internal control over financial  reporting for smallcap companies is developed that recognizes the  characteristics and needs of those companies, provide exemptive relief  from section 404(b) of the act\u2014the external auditor involvement in the  section 404 process\u2014to smallcap companies with less than $250 million  but greater than $10 million in annual product revenues and microcap  companies with between $125 million and $250 million in annual revenues.", "By including the revenue criteria, the committee\u2019s recommendations  regarding section 404 cover a subset of the public companies included  within its microcap and smallcap definitions. The committee estimated  that, after applying the revenue criteria, 4,641 \u201cmicrocap\u201d public  companies (approximately 49 percent of 9,428 public companies identified  in data developed for the advisory committee by SEC\u2019s Office on  Economic Analysis) may potentially qualify for full exemption from  section 404 and another 1,957 \u201csmallcap\u201d public companies  (approximately 21 percent of the SEC-identified public companies)\u2014a  total of 70 percent of SEC-identified public companies\u2014may potentially  qualify for exemption from the external audit requirement of section  404(b). It is likely that a number of public companies that would qualify  for exemptive relief under the committee\u2019s recommendations have  probably already complied with both sections of 404(a) and (b), based on  their status as accelerated filers.", "If adopted, these recommendations would effectively establish a \u201ctiered  approach\u201d for compliance with section 404, \u201cunless and until\u201d a framework  for assessing internal control over financial reporting is developed for  microcap and smallcap companies. Under the tiered approach, larger  public companies that do not meet the committee\u2019s size criteria for  exemption would continue to be required to comply with both section  404(a)\u2014management\u2019s assessment of and reporting on internal control  over financial reporting\u2014and section 404(b)\u2014the external auditors\u2019  attestation on management\u2019s assessment and the effectiveness of the  company\u2019s internal control. \u201cSmallcap\u201d public companies that meet the  revenue criteria would be exempt from complying with section 404(b), but  the companies would still be required to comply with section 404(a).  \u201cMicrocap\u201d and some \u201csmallcap\u201dcompanies that meet the revenue criteria  would be entirely exempt from both section 404(a) and (b). The  committee\u2019s two primary recommendations related to regulatory relief  from section 404 for smaller public companies also include additional  requirements that affected public companies apply additional corporate  governance provisions and report publicly on known material internal  control weaknesses.", "In its next primary recommendation on internal control over financial  reporting, which is premised on the adoption of the recommendation for  microcap companies described above, the committee acknowledged that  SEC might conclude, as a matter of public policy, that an audit  requirement is necessary for smallcap companies. In that case, the  committee recommended SEC provide for the external auditor to perform  an audit of only the design and implementation of internal control over  financial reporting, which by its nature would be more limited than the  audit of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting  required by section 404(b) and PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2, and that  PCAOB develop a new auditing standard for such an engagement. While  this recommendation is based on the view that having the external auditor  perform a review of the design and implementation of internal control  over financial reporting would be more cost-effective than the work  otherwise required under Auditing Standard No. 2, the committee\u2019s report  does not address the extent to which costs for such a review would be  lower than that required under Auditing Standard No. 2 and whether the  lower costs would be worth the reduced assurances provided by reduced  scope of the external auditors\u2019 work on internal control over financial  reporting.", "While not specifically focused on small business issues, SEC also  conducted a public \u201croundtable\u201d in April 2005 that gave public companies,  accounting firms, and others an opportunity to provide feedback to SEC  and PCAOB on what went well and what did not during the first year of  section 404 implementation. GAO also participated in this roundtable.  Following the roundtable, the SEC and PCAOB Chairmen noted the  importance of section 404 requirements but acknowledged that initial  implementation costs had been higher than expected and noted the need  to improve the cost-benefit equation for small and mid-sized companies.  Both agencies issued additional guidance in May 2005 based on findings  from the roundtable. PCAOB\u2019s guidance clarified that auditors (1) should  integrate their audits of internal control over financial reporting with their  audits of the client\u2019s financial statements, (2) exercise judgment and tailor  their audit plans to best meet the risks faced by their clients rather than  relying on standardized \u201cchecklists,\u201d (3) use a top-down approach  beginning with company-level controls and use the risk assessment  required by the standard, (4) take advantage of the work of others, and (5)  engage in direct and timely communication with their audit clients, among  other matters. Guidance by SEC and its staff emphasized the need for  reasonable assurance, risk-based assessments, better communication  between the auditor and client, and clarified what should be in material  weakness disclosures. Representatives of the smaller public companies  that we interviewed indicated that the additional guidance that SEC and  PCAOB issued was helpful. SEC and PCAOB plan to hold a second  roundtable in May 2006 to discuss companies\u2019 second year experiences  with implementing section 404. Both chairs of SEC and PCAOB have said  that they would consider additional guidance if necessary.", "On November 30, 2005, PCAOB also issued a report on the initial  implementation of its auditing standard on internal control over financial  reporting. The report included observations by PCAOB\u2014based in  significant part, but not exclusively, on its inspections of public  accounting firms, which in the 2005 cycle included a review of a limited  selection of audits of internal control over financial reporting\u2014on why the  internal control audits were not as efficient or effective as the standard  intended. PCAOB also amplified the previously issued guidance of May  2005, discussing how auditors could achieve more effective and efficient  implementation of the standard.", "Further, PCAOB has held a series of forums nationwide to educate the  small business community on the PCAOB inspections process and the new  auditing standards. The goal of the forums was to provide small  accounting firms and smaller public companies an opportunity to discuss  PCAOB-related issues with Board members and staff. PCAOB also  established a Standing Advisory Group to advise PCAOB on standard- setting priorities and policy implications of existing and proposed  standards. The Standing Advisory Group has considered ways to improve  the application of its internal control over financial reporting  requirements\u2014Auditing Standard No. 2\u2014with respect to audits of smaller  public companies.", "Finally, both SEC and PCAOB have acknowledged the challenges that  smaller public companies faced and continue to face in implementing  section 404 and have begun to address those challenges. SEC also has  emphasized that smaller companies need to focus on the quality of their  internal control over financial reporting. Data provided by SEC\u2019s Office of  Economic Analysis and other studies have pointed to the increased level  of restatements as an indicator that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2014section 404  in particular\u2014has gotten companies to identify and correct weaknesses  that led to financial reporting misstatements in prior fiscal years. For  example, according to recent research conducted by Glass, Lewis and Co.,  the restatement rate for smaller public companies was more than twice  the rate for the largest public companies (9 percent for companies with  revenues of less than $500 million and 4 percent for companies with more  than $10 billion). SEC staff also noted that smaller public companies had  a disproportionately higher rate of material weaknesses in internal control  over financial reporting during the first year of implementing section 404.  Our discussions with accounting firms confirmed that smaller public  companies have had a higher rate of reported material weaknesses in  internal control over financial reporting than larger public companies.", "A major challenge in considering any regulatory relief from section 404 is  that the overriding purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act is investor  protection. Investor confidence in the integrity and reliability of financial  reporting is a critical element for the efficient functioning of our capital  markets. The purpose of internal control over financial reporting is to  provide reasonable assurance over the integrity and reliability of the  financial statements and related disclosures. Market reactions to financial  misstatements illustrate the importance of accurate financial reporting,  regardless of a company\u2019s size.", "Given the anticipated regulatory changes, particularly those relating to  section 404\u2019s internal control reporting requirements, smaller public  companies may be limiting or not taking definitive actions to improve  internal control over financial reporting based on a perception that they  could become exempt from section 404.

In addition, some small companies issue equities that trade on smaller  markets such as the Pink Sheets. For those private companies desiring to  enter the public market, the IPO process has always been recognized as a  time-consuming and expensive endeavor.", "However, venture capitalists and private company officials told us that, as  a result of the act and other market factors, many private companies have  been spending additional time, effort, and money to convince investors  that they can meet the requirements of the act. For example, investors  have become more cautious and demanding of the private companies in  which they invest. Consequently, private companies have hired auditors  and additional staff to make substantial changes to their financial system  and data-reporting capabilities, document internal controls and processes,  and review or change accounting procedures.", "According to venture capitalists and private company officials with whom  we spoke, a private company\u2019s ability to meet the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s  requirements can significantly decrease some of the investment risk  associated with becoming a public company. For example, both groups  told us that companies with well-documented internal control and  governance policies were more attractive and able to secure investor  funding at a much lower cost. Moreover, they noted that underwriters  expected private companies to consider and comply with the act well in  advance of going public. If a private company were unable to meet the  act\u2019s requirements, venture capitalists would want the company to show  evidence of a plan for becoming compliant as soon as the company  became public. If not, venture capitalists noted that they would be less  likely to invest in such a company and look elsewhere for investment  opportunities.", "These new expectations may have served to increase the expenses  associated with the IPO process through changes in the professional fees  charged by auditors and potentially other costs as well. Specifically, we  found that there has been a disproportionate increase for the smallest  companies when IPO expenses were viewed as a percentage of revenue.  As shown in table 4, the direct expenses (excluding underwriting fees)  associated with the IPO represented a significant portion of a small  company\u2019s revenues, relative to larger companies, from 1998 through the  second quarter of 2005. These expenses have increased disproportionably  since 2002 for small companies going public\u2014especially for the smallest of  these companies ($25 million or less in revenues).

Moreover, other market factors also could explain the  increase in IPO expenses paid to auditors.", "In addition to the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the general  increase in direct expenses, other important factors likely have influenced  IPO activity. To illustrate, the downward trend in IPOs occurred before the  passage of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in mid-2002. It is widely acknowledged  that IPO filings and pricings tend to be closely associated with stock  market performance.

Venture capitalists told us that, on average, a private company had to  demonstrate at least 6 quarters of profitability before it could go public  and hire an auditor to carry it through the IPO process.

For larger private companies, the  representatives stated that they require audited financial statements and  cash flow information, but that their lending requirements existed well  before the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and have not changed as a result of its  passage. Overall, they noted that they do not believe that the act has  affected the way financial institutions and lenders conduct business with  private companies. They also noted that financial institutions and lenders  have always enjoyed the freedom to obtain virtually any information about  a potential borrower and to inquire about the company\u2019s financial  reporting process and corporate governance practices.

Specifically, several  state legislatures proposed instituting requirements similar to those in the  Sarbanes-Oxley Act for privately held state-registered companies.  Subsequently, three states\u2014Illinois, Texas, and California\u2014passed  legislation that mandates corporate governance and accountability  requirements that resemble certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.  For example, Illinois passed legislation in 2004 that requires enhanced  disclosures for certain nonpublic companies and additional licensing  requirements for certified public accountants and, in 2003, Texas passed  legislation that imposes strict ethics and disclosure requirements for  outside financial advisors and service providers, public or private, that  provide financial services to the state government. On September 29, 2004,  California adopted the Nonprofit Integrity Act of 2004, becoming the first  state in the nation to require nonprofit organizations to meet requirements  that resemble some provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. For instance,  nonprofits with gross revenues of $2 million or more operating within the  state of California currently are required to have independent auditors  and, in the case of charitable corporations, audit committees.

Additionally, the officials told us  that some private companies may have chosen to voluntarily adopt certain  practices that resemble Sarbanes-Oxley Act provisions to satisfy external  auditors and legal counsel looking for comparable assurances to reduce  risk, increase confidence, and improve credibility with many stakeholders.

Reasons for  these changes range from audit cost and service concerns cited by  companies to client profitability and risk concerns cited by accounting  firms, including capacity constraints and assessments of client risk.

The resulting increases in workload and audit  fees appear to have constrained smaller companies\u2019 access to large  accounting firms\u2014either because smaller companies were unable to  afford a large accounting firm or because large accounting firms resigned  from smaller clients.

Regulators, public companies, audit firms, and  investors generally have acknowledged that many of the act\u2019s provisions  have had a positive and significant impact on investor protection and  confidence. Yet, for smaller public companies and companies of all sizes  that have complied with the various provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,  compliance costs have been higher than anticipated\u2014with the higher cost  being associated with the internal control over financial reporting  requirements of section 404.", "There is widespread agreement that several factors contributed to the  costs of implementing section 404 for both larger and smaller public  companies. Few public companies or their audit firms had prior direct  experience with evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of internal  control over financial reporting or with implementing the COSO internal  control framework, particularly in a small business environment. This was  despite previous requirements, dating back to 1977, that public companies  implement a system of internal accounting controls. The first year costs  were exacerbated because many companies were documenting their  internal control over financial reporting for the first time and remediating  poor or nonexistent internal controls as part of their first-year  implementation efforts to comply with section 404, both of which could be  viewed as a positive impact of the act. In addition, the nature, timing, and  extent of available guidance on establishing and assessing internal control  over financial reporting made it more difficult for most public companies  and audit firms to efficiently and effectively implement the requirements  of section 404. As a result, management\u2019s implementation and assessment  efforts were largely driven by PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2, as  guidance at a similar level of detail was not available for management\u2019s  implementation and assessment process. These factors, in conjunction  with the changed environment and expectations resulting from the act,  contributed to a considerable amount of \u201clearning curve\u201d activities and  inefficiencies during the initial year of implementation. Auditing firms and  a number of public companies have stated that they expect subsequent  years\u2019 compliance costs for section 404 to decrease. This is not  unexpected given the significance and nature of the changes and a  preexisting environment that did not place enough emphasis on effective  internal control over financial reporting.", "Consistent with the findings of the Small Business Administration on the  impact of regulations generally on smaller public companies, it is  reasonable to conclude that smaller public companies face  disproportionately greater costs, as a percentage of revenues, than larger  companies in meeting the requirements of the act. While facing the same  basic requirements, smaller public companies generally have more limited  resources, fewer shareholders, and generally less complex structures and  operations. Again, this is to be expected given the economies of scale and  differing levels of corporate infrastructure and resources. However, some  of the unique characteristics of smaller companies can create  opportunities to efficiently achieve effective internal control over financial  reporting. Those characteristics include more centralized management  oversight of the business, more involvement of top management in the  business operations, simpler operations, and limited geographic locations.", "The ultimate impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act on the majority of smaller  public companies remains unclear because the time frame to comply with  section 404 of the act was extended until fiscal years ending after July  2007 for the approximately 5,971 public companies with less than   $75 million in public float. Recognizing the challenges that smaller public  companies have faced in meeting the requirements of the act, particularly  section 404, SEC formed an advisory committee on smaller public  companies to analyze the impact of the act and other securities laws on  smaller public companies. The advisory committee has issued an exposure  draft of its final reporting stating that certain smaller public companies  need relief from section 404, \u201cunless and until\u201d a framework for assessing  internal control over financial reporting is developed that recognizes the  characteristics and needs of smaller public companies. The exposure draft  contains specific recommendations that would essentially result in a  \u201ctiered approach\u201d for compliance with section 404 requirements, where  larger public companies would continue to be required to fully comply  with all requirements of section 404, while smaller public companies  consisting of \u201cmicrocap\u201d and \u201csmallcap\u201d companies would be granted  differing levels of exemptions until an adequate framework was in place.", "We have two specific concerns regarding the advisory committee\u2019s  recommendations. First, the recommendations propose relief \u201cunless and  until a framework for assessing internal control over financial reporting\u201d  for smaller companies is developed that \u201crecognizes the characteristics  and needs of those companies.\u201d While the recommendations hinge on the  need for a framework that recognizes smaller public company  characteristics and needs of smaller public companies, they do not  address what needs to be done to establish such a framework or how such  a framework should take into consideration the characteristics and needs  of smaller public companies. Many, if not most, of the significant problems  and challenges encountered by large and small companies in implementing  section 404 related to problems with implementation, rather than the  internal control framework itself. In addition to having a useful internal  control framework, appropriate implementation of a framework by public  companies must be based on risk, facts and circumstances, and  professional judgment. We believe that sufficient guidance covering both  the internal control framework and the means by which it can be  effectively implemented is essential to enable large and small public  companies to implement a framework which would enable effective and  efficient assessment and reporting on the effectiveness of internal control  over financial reporting.", "Our second concern relates to the ambiguity surrounding the conditional  nature of the \u201cunless and until\u201d provisions of the recommendations and its  potential impact on a large number of companies that would likely qualify  for the proposed exemptions. If resolution of small public company  concerns about a framework and its implementation results in an  extended period of exemption, then large numbers of public companies  would potentially be exempted for additional periods from complying with  this important investor protection component of the act. The categories of  microcap and smallcap companies, as defined by the advisory committee  recommendations, cover 79 percent of U.S. public companies and   6 percent of the U.S. equity market capitalization when combined.  Although the categories of microcap and smallcap have been further  refined by the advisory committee through the addition of a revenue size  filter for purposes of its primary recommendations on section 404, it  appears that a large number of companies, up to 70 percent of all U.S.  public companies, would be potentially exempted. Specifically, the  committee estimates that, after applying the revenue criteria, 4,641 \u201cmicro  cap\u201d public companies (approximately 49 percent of 9,428 public  companies identified in data developed for the advisory committee by  SEC\u2019s Office on Economic Analysis) may potentially qualify for the  proposed full exemption from section 404 and another 1,957 \u201csmallcap\u201d  public companies (approximately 21 percent of the identified public  companies) may potentially qualify for the proposed exemption from the  external audit requirement of section 404(b). These estimates do not  include those public companies trading on the Pink Sheets that would be  covered by the Advisory Committee\u2019s preliminary recommendations. In  addition, it is likely that a number of public companies qualifying for  exemptive relief under the committee\u2019s recommendations are likely to  have already complied with both sections of 404(a) and (b) of the act  under the current category of accelerated filers.", "Also, regarding the committee\u2019s third primary internal control  recommendation calling for a review of the design and implementation of  internal control if SEC concludes, as a matter of public policy, that the  external auditor\u2019s involvement is required, it is not clear from the  committee\u2019s report the extent to which, particularly in the present  environment, such a review would result in lower costs than those being  associated with the implementation of PCAOB\u2019s Auditing Standard No. 2.  Any lower costs that might result must be considered in light of the  reduced independent assurances on the effectiveness of internal control  over financial reporting that would result and the potential for confusion  on the part of users of the public company\u2019s financial statements and audit  reports.", "Until sufficient guidance is available for smaller public companies, some  interim regulatory relief on a limited scale may be appropriate. However,  given the number of public companies that would potentially qualify for  relief under the recommendations being considered, we believe that a  significant reduction in scope of the proposed relief needs to occur to  preserve the overriding investor protection purpose of the Sarbanes-Oxley  Act. The purpose of internal control over financial reporting is to provide  reasonable assurance over the integrity and reliability of the financial  statements and related disclosures. Public and investor confidence in the  fairness of financial reporting is critical to the effective functioning of our  capital markets. Market reactions to financial statement misstatements  illustrate the importance of accurate financial reporting, regardless of a  company\u2019s size. SEC staff and others have pointed to the increased level of  restatements as an indicator that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2014section 404 in  particular\u2014has prompted companies to identify and correct weaknesses  that led to financial reporting misstatements in prior fiscal years.", "Indicators also show that in some respects, smaller companies have a  higher risk profile for investors. For instance, smaller public companies  have higher rates of restatements generally and showed a  disproportionately higher rate of reported material weakness in internal  control over financial reporting during the initial year of section 404  implementation. Over time, having the effective internal control over  financial reporting envisioned by the act can reduce some aspects of the  higher risk profile of smaller public companies.", "When SEC receives and considers the final recommendations of SEC\u2019s  small business advisory committee, it is essential that SEC consider key  principles, under the umbrella principle of investor protection, when  deciding whether or to what extent to provide smaller public companies  with alternatives to full implementation of the section 404 requirements.  These principles include (1) assuring that smaller public companies have  sufficient useful guidance to implement, assess, and report on internal  controls over financial reporting to meet the requirements of section 404,  (2) if additional relief is considered appropriate, conducting further  analysis of small public company characteristics to significantly reduce  the scope of companies that would qualify for any type of additional relief  while working to ensure that the Sarbanes-Oxley Act\u2019s goal of investor  protection is being met, and (3) acting expeditiously such that smaller  public companies are encouraged to continue improving their internal  control over financial reporting.", "First, it is critical that SEC carefully assess the available guidance,  including that being developed by COSO, to determine whether it is  sufficient or whether additional action needs to be taken, such as issuing  supplemental or clarifying guidance to smaller public companies to help  them meet the requirements of section 404. Our analysis of available  research and discussions with smaller public companies and audit firms  indicate that public companies and external auditors have had limited  practical experience with implementing internal control frameworks in a  smaller company environment and that additional guidance is needed.  Moreover, it is critical that SEC coordinate its actions with PCAOB, which  is responsible for establishing standards for the external auditor\u2019s internal  control attestations, to ensure that external auditors are using standards  and guidance on section 404 compliance that are consistent with guidance  for public companies and that they are doing so in an effective and  efficient manner. As SEC considers the need for additional  implementation guidance, it will be important that the guidance and  related PCAOB audit standards be consistent and compatible. Also, it will  be important for the PCAOB to continue to identify ways in which auditors  can achieve more economical, effective, and efficient implementation of  audit-related standards and guidance.", "Second, as SEC considers whether and to what extent it might be  appropriate to provide additional interim relief to some categories of  smaller public companies, it will be important to balance the needs of the  investing public with the concerns expressed by small businesses. In doing  so, it is important to determine whether there are unique characteristics,  in addition to size, that could influence the extent that some regulatory  accommodation might be appropriate in order to arrive at a targeted and  limited category of companies being provided with potential exemptions.  For example, if these companies were closely held or have a higher rate of  insider investors, regulatory relief may raise less of an investor protection  concern. These investors may be more knowledgeable about company  operations and receive fewer benefits from section 404\u2019s enhanced  disclosures. For companies that are widely traded, regulatory relief would  raise more concerns about investor protection and relief would appear  less appropriate. Furthermore, although the \u201cinsider\u201d shareholder owners  may not have the same need for investor protection as investors in broadly  held companies, minority shareholders who are not insiders may need  such protection. For other purposes, certain provisions of SEC\u2019s securities  regulations and the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974  regulations condition different types of relief, in part, on the nature and/or  the financial sophistication of the investor, and SEC may wish to consider  whether such approaches would help serve to balance the concerns of  small businesses against the needs of investors. The criteria and  characteristics used should be linked to the investor protection goals of  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and be geared toward limiting the numbers of  companies that would be eligible based on those investor protection goals.  In addition, the advisory committee\u2019s preliminary recommendations to  exempt \u201csmaller public companies\u201d from the external audit requirements  of section 404 would include a number of companies that have already  complied with section 404, and SEC needs to carefully consider whether it  is appropriate to provide regulatory relief on this basis.", "Finally, we believe that SEC has an obligation to resolve section 404  implementation requirements for smaller public companies in a way that  creates incentives for smaller public companies to take actions to improve  their internal control over financial reporting. Rather than delaying  implementation, which would likely result in smaller public companies  anticipating future extensions or relief, SEC\u2019s resolution of these issues  would provide needed clarity and certainty over the scope and timing of  smaller companies\u2019 compliance with section 404 and provide incentives to  smaller public companies to begin the process of implementing section  404."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In light of concerns raised by the SEC Advisory Committee on Smaller  Public Companies and others regarding the ability of smaller public  companies to effectively implement section 404, we recommend that the  Chairman of SEC    assess the guidance available, with an emphasis on implementation  guidance for management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial  reporting, to determine whether the current guidance is sufficient and  whether additional action is needed, such as issuing supplemental or  clarifying guidance to help smaller public companies meet the  requirements of section 404, and   coordinate with PCAOB to (1) help ensure that section 404-related audit  standards and guidance are consistent with any additional guidance  applicable to management\u2019s assessment of internal control and (2) identify  additional ways in which auditors\u2019 can achieve more economical, effective,  and efficient implementation of the standards and guidance related to  internal control over financial reporting.", "If, in evaluating the recommendations of its advisory committee, SEC  determines that additional relief is appropriate beyond the current July  2007 compliance date for non-accelerated filers, we recommend that the  Chairman of SEC analyze and consider, in addition to size, the unique  characteristics of smaller public companies and the knowledge base,  educational background, and sophistication of their investors in  determining categories of companies for which additional relief may be  appropriate to ensure that the objectives of investor protection are  adequately met and any relief is targeted and limited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Chairman, SEC, and the Acting  Chairman, PCAOB, for their review and comment.

We handled  missing data by dropping companies with incomplete financial data from  any analysis involving the use of such data. Therefore, it should be noted  that we are not dealing with the entire population included in the Audit  Analytics database but rather a large subset. Because of these issues, the  results should be viewed as estimates of audit fees based on a large  sample rather than precise estimates of all fees charged over the entire  population.

First, we analyzed all the companies to  determine whether the company was deregistering its common stock to  continue to operate as a privately held company. During this step, we  eliminated companies that filed the Form 15 as a result of acquisitions,  mergers that were not \u201cgoing private\u201d transactions liquidations,  reorganizations, or bankruptcy filings or re-emergences. We also  eliminated duplicate filings and filings by foreign registrants.

We  grouped the reasons into seven categories for our final analysis.", "We took a number of steps to ensure the reliability of the database,  including testing of random samples of the coded data, 100 percent  verification of certain areas of the database, and various other quality  control measures. For the initial coding, we found the error rates to be 0.6  percent or lower for all years except 2001 and 1998. Because the initial  error rate exceeded 1.5 percent for these 2 years, we performed 100  percent verification and corrected any errors. However, because the error  rate for the remaining years was positive, it is unlikely that we captured  every company going private in 1998\u20132005. We also excluded all  companies with one or zero holders of record unless that company also  filed a Schedule 13E-3 (Going private transaction by certain issuers) with  SEC. In doing so, we may have missed some companies going private.  However, an outside study found only 12 companies that filed a Form 15  but did not file a Schedule 13E-3 from 1998 through 2003. Additionally,  our analysis of the companies that listed more than one holder of record  on the Form 15 should have picked up some of these types of firms.

To develop and test our questionnaire, we interviewed  officials at 14 smaller public companies. We then pretested drafts of our  questionnaire with 10 companies and then discussed their answers and  experiences with our social science survey specialists. The pretests were  conducted in person and by telephone with company executives in  Virginia, Maryland, New York, Connecticut, California, Georgia, and  Illinois.", "To identify the smaller public companies eligible to participate in the  survey, we analyzed company SEC filings from the Audit Analytics  database. Our survey universe consisted of 591 companies that met the  following five criteria: (1) $700 million or less in market capitalization as  of the end of the company\u2019s 2004 fiscal year; (2) $100 million or less in  revenues as of the end of the company\u2019s 2004 fiscal year end; (3)  completed section 404 requirements by filing related reports of  management and the company\u2019s external auditor as of August 11, 2005; (4)  were not foreign companies; and (5) were not investment vehicles such as  mutual funds and shell companies. Of the 591, we could not reach 168  within the survey period because we were not able to obtain e-mail  addresses for the CFO or other executive. We began our Web-based survey  on September 21, 2005, and included all useable responses as of November  1, 2005. We sent follow-up e-mails on three occasions to remind  respondents to complete the survey. One hundred fifty-eight companies  completed the survey for an overall response rate of 27 percent. Only one  respondent indicated that his company was a non-accelerated filer.", "The low response rate raised concerns that the views of 158 respondents  might not be representative of all smaller public company experiences  with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. While we could not test this possibility for  our primary questions (whether the act places a disproportionate burden  on smaller companies or compromises their ability to raise capital), we did  conduct an analysis to determine whether our sample differed from the  population of 591 in company assets, revenue, and market capitalization  and type (based on the North American Industrial Classification System  code). We found no evidence of substantial non-response bias based on  these characteristics. However, because of the low response rate we still  could not assume that the views of the 158 respondents were  representative of the views of other smaller public companies on  implementing Sarbanes-Oxley Act requirements. Therefore, we do not  consider these data to be a probability sample of all smaller public  companies.", "In addition to potential non-response bias, the practical difficulties of  conducting any survey may introduce other non-sampling errors. For  example, difference in how a particular question is interpreted or the  sources of information available to respondents may introduce errors. We  took steps to minimize such non-sampling errors in both the data  collection and data analysis stages. We examined the survey results and  performed computer analyses to identify inconsistencies and other  indications of error. A second independent analyst checked all the  computer analyses. Further, we used GAO\u2019s Questionnaire Programming  Language (QPL) system to create and process the Web-based survey. This  system facilitates the creation of the instrument, controls access, and  ensures data quality. It also automatically generates code for reading the  data into SAS (statistical analysis software). This tool is commonly used  for GAO studies.", "We used QPL to automate some processes, but also used analysts to code  the open-ended questions and then had a second, independent analyst  review them. (The survey contained both open- and close-ended  questions.) We entered a set of possible phrases, called tags, which we  identified for each question into QPL. When the analysts reviewed the text  responses, they assign the tags that best reflect the meaning of what the  respondent has written. The system then compares the tags assigned by  the independent reviewers. Multiple tags may be assigned to a single  response; thus, it is possible for reviewers to agree on some tags and not  on others. Although it is possible to have reviewers resolve their  differences until agreement is found, for this survey we only considered  tags that were selected by all reviewers on the first pass. Tags assigned by  only one reviewer were dropped. This process allowed a quantitative  analysis of open comments made by respondents.

We analyzed IPO expenses as a percentage of revenue and offering  amount for companies in various size categories to determine whether the  differences between the groups changed over time and whether the  differences were statistically significant when controlling for other  determining factors.", "SEC\u2019s EDGAR database is considered the definitive source for information  on IPOs since all companies issuing securities that list on the major  exchanges and the OTCBB, as well as those that meet certain criteria  listing on the Pink Sheets, must register the securities with SEC.  Nevertheless, we crosschecked the descriptive statistics retrieved from  EDGAR with NASDAQ\u2019s IPO data. However, there was no financial data  available on several companies, while others failed to provide information  to complete all of the fields. In cases where revenue was left blank,  individual filings were reviewed and actual revenue, 9-month revenue or  pro-forma data was used to determine the size of the company. In cases  were this data was not available we dropped these companies from any  analysis involving the use of such data. Additionally, there can be  significant lag between the dates a company initially files for an IPO with  SEC and when the stock of the company is finally priced (begins trading).  Because we had data on IPO filings during the last 2 months of 1997, we  were able to include those companies that priced IPOs over the 1998-2005  period that initially filed for an IPO during that time. However, any IPOs  that were priced during this time but had an initial filing that occurred  prior to November 1, 1997, are not included. For this reason the number of  priced IPOs for 1998 (and to an even lesser extent 1999) may understate  somewhat the actual numbers of companies coming to the public market  during that year.

To reduce the number of holders of record, a  company can undertake a number of transactions including tender offers,  reverse stock splits, and cash-out mergers.
