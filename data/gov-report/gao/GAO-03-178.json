States receive money based in part on factors such as annual population estimates derived from the previous decennial census, which is conducted by the Department of Commerce, Bureau of the Census. GAO was asked to measure the effect that using the 2000 census data has on redistributing funding for federal formula grant programs. To do this, GAO analyzed the change in the U.S. and state populations between 1999 and 2000 that was the result of correcting prior population estimates and estimated for the four programs the extent of any redistribution of federal funding among states."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 2000 census count of 281.4 million people exceeded the 1999 population estimate by 8.7 million people, or 3.2 percent. Three-quarters of this 1-year population increase, 6.8 million people, was the result of correcting errors in population estimates over the preceding decade; the remaining portion of the increase, 1.9 million people, was the result of population growth from 1999 to 2000. Every state's population had been underestimated during the 1990s, but the extent varied, from the smallest correction in West Virginia--0.3 percent--to the largest in the District of Columbia--10.2 percent. Twenty-eight states had a correction below the national average of 2.5 percent, and 23 states had a correction above the national average. Correcting population estimates for the 2000 census redistributes among states about $380 million in federal grant funding for Medicaid, Foster Care, Adoption Assistance, and SSBG. Funding for the 28 states that had below-average corrections to their populations decreases by an estimated $380.3 million; funding for the 23 states that had above-average corrections increases by an estimated $388.8 million. Most of the change in funding is concentrated in states with larger populations. However, changes in funding are smaller in several large states because the matching rates for Medicaid, Foster Care, and Adoption Assistance are limited by statute--matching rates cannot fall below 50 percent. Some higher-income states would receive matching rates below 50 percent if not for this limitation. Most of the shift in funding occurs in fiscal year 2003 when federal matching rates for the Medicaid, Foster Care, and Adoption Assistance programs are based on population estimates derived from the 2000 census. A small portion of the shift occurred in fiscal year 2002 because that is when the SSBG began using the 2000 census counts. The Department of Commerce provided technical comments on a draft of this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2000, the federal government obligated about $332 billion in  grants to state and local governments to help fund an array of programs  ranging from Medicaid to Highway Planning and Construction. Over 85  percent, or about $283 billion, of this grant money was distributed to state  and local governments using formulas that are based on data such as state  population and personal income. For example, the $196 billion federal- state Medicaid program finances health care to low-income families with  children and aged, blind, and disabled individuals through a statutory  formula based on state per capita income\u2014the ratio of total personal  income to state population.", "To calculate grant amounts, formula grant programs generally rely on  annual population estimates for each state developed by the Bureau of the  Census. State populations are estimated by adding to the prior year\u2019s  population estimate the number of births and immigrants and subtracting  the number of deaths and emigrants. These estimates are subject to error,  mainly because migration between states and between the United States  and other countries is difficult to measure. By the end of each decade,  when the decennial census is taken, a significant gap may have arisen  between the population estimate and the census population count for the  same day of the year, such as April 1, 2000.", "When population data based on a new census enter into federal formula  grant calculations, states gain or lose funding depending on how the gaps  between their population estimates and their census counts compare with  the U.S. average gap. The larger the gap between a state\u2019s population  estimate and its census count, the larger the shift in funding is. For  formula grant programs that distribute a set amount of federal funding, the  gains in states with increased funding are offset by the losses in states  with decreased funding. For open-ended formula grant programs, such as  Medicaid, states with increased funding do not necessarily offset states  with decreased funding.", "To measure the effect of using the 2000 census on the distribution of  formula grant funding among the states, you asked us to examine (1) the  change in the U.S. and each state\u2019s population between 1999 and 2000 due  to correcting prior population estimates and (2) the extent of any  redistribution of federal funding among the states for four selected  formula grant programs as a result of the 2000 census.", "To address these objectives, we used information on annual state  population estimates that were derived from the 1990 census and state  estimates that were derived from both the 1990 and 2000 censuses, as  reported by the Census Bureau. To estimate the error in population  estimates, we compared the April 1, 2000, population estimates based on  the 1990 census with the April 1, 2000, census counts. To determine the  effect of correcting the errors in population estimates on the distribution  of formula grant funding to the states, we analyzed 4 federal formula grant  programs of the 172 such programs identified in the Catalog of Federal  Domestic Assistance\u2014Social Services Block Grant (SSBG), Medicaid,  Foster Care Title IV-E, and Adoption Assistance. We chose these 4  programs because their formulas use population estimates to distribute  federal assistance, and they represented almost half of all formula grant  funding (46 percent) in fiscal year 2000. The SSBG distributes a set  appropriation exclusively on the basis of population data. The 3  entitlement programs, Medicaid, Foster Care, and Adoption Assistance,  use per capita income\u2014the ratio of personal income to state population\u2014 in identical formulas to determine federal matching rates. We obtained  information on the formulas for these programs from the Department of  Health and Human Services, and we used funding data for each program  for the fiscal year in which the program first used population data derived  from the 2000 census to calculate grant awards. To calculate the change in  formula funding resulting from correcting population estimates, we  compared what funding would be if formula grant amounts were  calculated using two different population estimates for the same year, one  based on the 1990 census and the other on the 2000 census. We conducted  our work from July 2001 through January 2003 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Census Bureau counts the U.S. population once every decade through  its decennial census. For the years in between, the Bureau estimates  states\u2019 populations from annual data on changes in births, deaths, and net  migration (including net movements of military personnel). These annual  population estimates are called postcensal population estimates because  they are based on the prior census (see table 1 for definitions of different  population counts used in this report). This process of making annual  postcensal population estimates continues until the next census. Once the  new census is taken, the Bureau compares the population estimates to the  census population counts for the same date. The difference between the  population estimate and the census count is called the error of closure.  Subsequently, annual population estimates are revised for the prior decade  using the counts from the new census. For example, after the 2000 census,  the annual population estimates from the 1990s were revised to be  consistent with both the 1990 and 2000 censuses. These revised population  estimates are called the intercensal population estimates because they rely  on the preceding and the succeeding censuses.", "Of the four programs we analyzed, Medicaid is the largest, comprising 43  percent of all federal formula-based programs and 94 percent of the total  funding for the four programs analyzed for this report (see table 2).", "The SSBG formula allocates an amount of funding, set by annual  appropriation, directly to the states. A state\u2019s allocation is proportional to  its share of the total U.S. population. State allocations for fiscal year 2002  used the April 2000 census, and allocations for prior years used postcensal  population estimates that were based on the 1990 census.", "In contrast with the SSBG\u2019s fixed appropriation, the Medicaid, Foster  Care, and Adoption Assistance programs are open-ended entitlement  programs\u2014the states determine the level of program expenditures, and  the federal government reimburses a share of their expenditures according  to matching rates, called the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages  (FMAP), set by statutory formula. All three programs use the same  formula, which is based on a 3-year average of state per capita income\u2014 the ratio of aggregate personal income to state population. As a state\u2019s per  capita income increases, its matching rate decreases, and vice versa. In  addition, unless a state experiences changes in aggregate personal income,  its federal payment generally declines if the state\u2019s population growth is  less than the national average. Matching rates range from a minimum of 50  percent to a maximum of 83 percent of a state\u2019s Medicaid expenditures.  The minimum 50 percent rate affects only the high per capita income  states. For fiscal year 2002, for example, a high-income state such as  Connecticut would receive a 15 percent federal matching rate if the 50  percent minimum was not in place.", "For fiscal year 2002, the federal matching rates for Medicaid, Foster Care,  and Adoption Assistance were based on a 3-year average of per capita  income from 1997 through 1999. Rates for fiscal year 2003 are based on a  3-year average from 1998 through 2000. Although the formulas use  overlapping years, the state population numbers used to compute per  capita income differ depending on which fiscal year the grant is for. For  these three programs, the fiscal year 2002 formula calculations used  postcensal population estimates derived from the 1990 census for 1997  through 1999 to calculate per capita income. Fiscal year 2003 formula  calculations used population estimates for 1998 through 2000 derived from  the 2000 census. Thus, the 2000 census affects matching rates for these  programs beginning in fiscal year 2003 (see table 3)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most of Population Difference Between 1999 and 2000 Resulted from Correction of Errors That Occurred During 1990s", "paragraphs": ["The difference between the 2000 census count and the 1999 postcensal  population estimate was 3.2 percent, which is large compared with the 1  percent average annual growth rate estimated over the preceding decade.  Most of the difference was due to the correction of the error that had  occurred during the 1990s. According to the Census Bureau, the size of the  error was the result of an underestimate in the measurement of net  international migration during the 1990s and the improved coverage of the  2000 census compared with the 1990 census. Consequently, the postcensal  population estimate for 2000 was smaller than the 2000 census count.  Every state\u2019s population growth was underestimated and needed  correction, but the correction amounts varied widely. Among the four  Census regions, only the Midwest showed a consistent pattern: all 12  states were close to or below the national average correction.

The error of closure was 6.8 million  people, substantially larger than the 1.5 million error of closure associated  with the 1990 census. The error of closure for the 2000 census was four  times the corresponding percentage error for the 1990 census (2.5 percent  compared with 0.6 percent).", "The large error of closure in 2000 was due to underestimating the annual  growth in population during the 1990s and to the improved coverage of the  2000 census over the 1990 census. The postcensal population estimates for  the decade grew an average 1.0 percent annually. However, the 2000  census showed that the average annual growth rate in population was 0.2  percent higher than the estimated rate, or 1.2 percent. The Census Bureau  revised its annual population estimates upward when it released its  intercensal population estimates in the spring of 2002.", "The Census Bureau cited two reasons for the size of the error in its  postcensal estimated population growth through the 1990s. First, the net  international migration was underestimated during the decade, especially  for the Hispanic population. The Hispanic population was underestimated  by approximately 10 percent, four times higher than the national average  population underestimate, 2.5 percent. Second, the 2000 census was more  accurate than the 1990 census. The population undercount from the 2000  census was much smaller compared with the 1990 census (1.18 percent,  compared with 1.62 percent, making the 2000 census more accurate); the  2000 census counted people who were probably missed in the 1990  census."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Size of Population Correction Differed Widely Across States", "paragraphs": ["The error of closure shows a wide variation across states.

Michigan and Ohio, for example, account  for 57 percent of the total decrease in funding for states with below- average population corrections. A number of high-income states, including  California and New York, are largely unaffected by the correction in their  populations because their matching rates for the Medicaid, Foster Care,  and Adoption Assistance programs cannot decrease below the minimum  50 percent matching rate.
