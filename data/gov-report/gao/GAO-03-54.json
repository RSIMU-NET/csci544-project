First, they review prime contractors' compliance with the requirements of their subcontracting plans--either through on-site visits to contractors or by simply reviewing their subcontractor activity reports. Second, they conduct various marketing activities, such as marketing small businesses to prime contractors. In recent years, however, additional duties placed on CMRs have often taken priority over these responsibilities. In fact, in fiscal year 2000, 87 percent of the CMRs had other substantial responsibilities. Moreover, workloads and prime contractor coverage now vary greatly between CMRs. Additionally, CMRs are relying more on \"desk\" reviews of subcontractors' activity to monitor compliance with subcontracting plans as opposed to on-site reviews. This is a concern to some SBA officials who believe that on-site reviews are more thorough, though others believe the desk review offers the potential for greater coverage. Declines in staffing and travel funds have contributed to the changing role of the CMR. With downsizing and retirements taking place and no staff assigned to replace lost personnel, the number of CMR full-time equivalents (FTEs) has decreased significantly and has resulted in workload imbalances. While there are concerns about the changing nature of the CMR role, SBA has not strategically planned for these changes or assessed their collective impact. Instead, it has implemented ad hoc measures to deal piecemeal with resource declines. Unless steps are taken to better evaluate and plan for the future of CMRs, SBA will continue to lack an understanding of their contributions to small business subcontracting."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Subcontracting on large federal contracts is becoming increasingly important to small businesses, principally because subcontracts may offer the most opportunities for these businesses to participate in federal procurement in the near future.

As part of our evaluation, we used data from a recent survey we conducted of all staff working as CMRs in fiscal year 2000. Our overall response rate was 97 percent."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government encourages federal prime contractors\u2019 use of small businesses as subcontractors by requiring prime contractors to develop plans with stated goals for subcontracting to various types of small businesses. Federal regulations require a subcontracting plan for each contract or contract modification that exceeds $500,000 ($1 million for construction contracts) and has subcontracting possibilities.", "The Subcontracting Assistance Program is SBA\u2019s vehicle for increasing the percentage of subcontract awards to small businesses and ensuring that small businesses have the maximum practicable opportunity to participate in the performance of federal government contracts. SBA\u2019s Office of Government Contracting (OGC) oversees this program. SBA/OGC has six Area Offices responsible for all prime contractors\u2019 subcontracting performance.", "The program is implemented by CMRs, who promote small business subcontracting in two primary ways, as described in SBA regulations.First, CMRs review prime contractors\u2019 compliance with the requirements of their subcontracting plans. They conduct on-site compliance reviews at prime contractors\u2019 facilities and validate how well the prime contractors are implementing their subcontracting plans. They also conduct \u201cdesk reviews,\u201d which are reviews of relevant subcontracting reports that are submitted by prime contractors and completed without on-site visits.", "Second, CMRs conduct various marketing activities, such as marketing small businesses to prime contractors or matching certain types of small business subcontractors with prime contractors. CMRs perform this \u201cmatchmaking\u201d through both personal introductions and the use of Web- based tools that help to connect prime contractors and subcontractors. CMRs also provide various educational activities (e.g., seminars and workshops) for prime contractors, subcontractors, and agency officials as part of their marketing activities. In describing the duties required of CMRs, SBA regulations do not place a relative order of importance on any of these responsibilities.", "In addition, CMRs work on various SBA special initiatives as part of their marketing activities. For example, CMRs promote SBA\u2019s special 8(a) subcontracting initiative, which focuses on increasing the number of subcontracts to small disadvantaged businesses. CMRs also promote several special initiatives involving SBA\u2019s Procurement Marketing and Access Network (PRO-Net). PRO-Net is a Web-based system that allows prime contractors to advertise potential subcontracting opportunities and small businesses to advertise their capabilities as subcontractors. CMRs install PRO-Net access stations at large prime contractor sites and public libraries, and train interested businesses and agencies in the use of PRO- Net to match prime contractors and subcontractors. Finally, CMRs conduct special training for agencies and contractors on SBA\u2019s historically underutilized business zones (HUB-Zone) Empowerment Contracting Program, which encourages economic development in HUB Zones.", "SBA/OGC also employs other contract specialists, who focus on small businesses as prime contractors rather than subcontractors. These include Procurement Center Representatives (PCRs), size determination specialists, and Certificate of Competency (COC) specialists. PCRs work with agencies to determine whether it is appropriate for acquisitions not set aside for small businesses to be set aside. Size determination specialists determine whether a small business meets existing size standards for all procurement programs for which status as a small business is required. COC specialists review a contracting officer\u2019s determination that the small business in question is not competent to perform on a particular contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CMR Role Is Conflicted and in Decline", "paragraphs": ["The CMR role is conflicted and in decline. Over the past few years, the CMR role has become part-time, and CMRs now usually have additional roles that often take priority. CMRs appear to spend slightly more time on marketing activities than on compliance monitoring, and they now rely much more frequently on desk reviews than on-site visits for the latter. In addition, workloads and prime contractor coverage vary greatly between CMRs. SBA officials and CMRs have several concerns about the CMR role."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The CMR Role Is Usually Part-Time and Often Lower Priority", "paragraphs": ["The CMR position is usually part-time. At the end of fiscal year 2001, about 90 percent of the CMRs had other substantial responsibilities in addition to their CMR duties. At that time, only 4 of the 39 CMRs were full-time CMRs. As figure 1 shows, the number of part-time CMRs has grown over time, increasing twelve-fold since 1992. (SBA officials anticipate the continued assignment of additional roles to CMRs and other contracting specialists.) In addition, despite the fact that a larger number of staff had CMR duties at the end of fiscal year 2001 than in fiscal 1992, the number of CMR full- time equivalents (FTEs) declined 28 percent\u2014from 25 to about 18\u2014during this period.", "The SBA officials and CMRs we interviewed told us that part-time CMRs have a variety of additional responsibilities, including serving as PCRs, COC specialists, and/or size determination specialists. For example, in our survey, 87 percent of the CMRs responding reported that in fiscal year 2000, they served in one or even two additional roles, as figure 2 shows.PCR was the most frequent additional role; 59 percent of the part-time CMRs also served as PCRs.", "The CMRs and SBA officials we interviewed also told us that part-time CMRs often give lower priority to their CMR work than to their PCR, COC, and/or size determination work. This is consistent with our survey\u201457 percent of the part-time CMR respondents reported spending 60 to 89 percent of their time in fiscal year 2000 performing non-CMR duties. Only 31 percent reported spending less than 30 percent of their time on non- CMR duties. Apparently, there are several reasons for this, including not only the workload demands of these other roles, but also the time frames within which they must be performed. Generally, these roles are tied to specific procurements, and staff performing them must meet the procurement schedule. Regulations and guidance also mandate tight time frames for certain tasks. In contrast, CMR work is generally not as time sensitive, and several CMRs who perform these other roles told us they \u201cfit in CMR work\u201d when they have time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Time Spent on Compliance Monitoring Versus Marketing Varies", "paragraphs": ["CMRs generally seem to spend slightly more time on marketing than on compliance monitoring.

Figure 5 and table 3 illustrate the wide range in CMR workload.", "The SBA officials and CMRs we interviewed also acknowledged wide variations in workload between individual CMRs, whether full-time or part-time, in different Area Offices or within the same Area Office.

Similarly, in another Area Office, one CMR had 120 prime contractors to monitor, while a CMR in another had only 2. Both spend about 20 percent of their time as CMRs.", "Not surprisingly, the uneven distribution of CMRs and CMR FTEs has contributed to wide variations in the number of on-site reviews performed annually by Area Offices. For example, one Area Office conducted 15 on- site reviews in fiscal year 2001, while others conducted 40 or more. In addition, uneven workload distribution has contributed to the existence of large blocks of un-reviewed, that is, \u201cuncovered,\u201d prime contractors. For example, in one Area, there are no SBA reviews of any kind\u2014on-site or desk\u2014being done for 212 prime contractors, including all the prime contractors in one state and half of those in another.

For example, one Area Director stated that compliance monitoring should be the first priority for CMRs and matchmaking (i.e., marketing) should be secondary. Another Area Director said that the CMR role should be a combination of compliance monitoring and matchmaking but that matchmaking should get more emphasis.", "In contrast, the May 2001 report of the SBA Subcontracting Task Team clearly identifies compliance monitoring as the CMRs\u2019 main function. The report concludes that over the past several years, CMRs have spent a disproportionate amount of their time on special initiatives. The report recommends that compliance reviews become the CMRs\u2019 primary focus and that less emphasis be placed on ancillary duties, such as matchmaking or special initiatives. The report even proposes a new job title for the CMR, adding that \u201cmarketing\u201d gives the wrong impression that matchmaking is the CMR\u2019s main role.", "In contrast again, SBA\u2019s Web site does not mention compliance monitoring as part of the CMR role. Rather, the Web site, which is an important means of communicating with both prime contractors and small businesses, describes the CMR role as \u201cassisting small businesses in obtaining subcontracts by marketing small businesses and matching them with large prime contractors.\u201d", "Concerns about the focus of the CMR role are not new.

Because desk reviews take place in the CMRs\u2019 offices rather than at the prime contractors\u2019 locations, CMRs do not have to travel. In addition, the desk review takes substantially less time to accomplish than does the on- site review. Consequently, relying on desk reviews saves both travel money and CMR time.", "SBA staff opinions differ about the relative merits of on-site versus desk reviews. Some SBA officials and many CMRs believe that on-site reviews are more effective and question the relative value of desk reviews as a means of monitoring compliance. During on-site reviews, CMRs determine if prime contractors are complying with their subcontracting plans by going to the prime contractor\u2019s location, reviewing files and documentation that support reported summaries of subcontracting activities, and interviewing officials. The CMRs we spoke with said that this type of in-depth review is one of their best tools to encourage the maximum use of small businesses as subcontractors. In contrast, other SBA officials believe that using desk reviews not only saves resources but also increases the total amount of monitoring that CMRs can do. SBA officials said they have never evaluated the effectiveness of the two types of reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Concerns about CMR Workload and Prime Contractor Coverage", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s OIG observed the uneven workload distribution problem in October 1995. Noting the limited subcontracting resources and variable staffing levels and workloads, the OIG concluded that the unequal distribution of workload among CMRs was correlated with the uneven coverage of prime contractors. Accordingly, the OIG recommended that SBA more evenly distribute prime contractors among CMRs to improve coverage. However, SBA officials told us that where CMRs are located is driven by factors other than the location of prime contractors with subcontracting plans. For example, they said that although they can request CMRs to relocate to provide better coverage, they cannot require staff to relocate.", "It is likely that the full extent of the uneven workload and coverage problems has not yet been identified. SBA officials have estimated that as many as 1,500 additional prime contractors with subcontracting plans are not presently captured by SBA\u2019s data systems. While SBA officials told us they are working to improve the methods and databases for identifying and tracking prime contractors, progress appears to be very slow. Again in October 1995, the SBA OIG noted that the number of federal prime contractors with subcontracting plans was unknown, complicating SBA\u2019s efforts to focus subcontracting program activities and likely resulting in lost small business opportunities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Factors Affecting the CMR Role", "paragraphs": ["Two primary factors have affected the CMR role: declines in resources and an ad hoc, piecemeal response to resource challenges. Both staffing and travel funds declined substantially over the past several years. With downsizing and retirements taking place and no staff assigned to replace lost personnel, the number of CMR FTEs declined significantly and resulted in workload imbalances across and even within SBA\u2019s Area Offices. Travel fund reductions have meant fewer on-site visits and greater reliance on desk reviews. Staff at all levels agreed that insufficient resources\u2014particularly staffing and travel funds\u2014are the biggest obstacles to greater CMR coverage of prime contractors.", "SBA did not formulate a strategic plan for dealing with the impact of resource reductions on the CMR role.

SBA officials agreed that these resource declines have significantly affected the CMR role. For example, SBA Area Directors told us that the need to assign multiple roles to field staff has increased since SBA experienced significant budget and staff cuts in the mid-1990s. Prior to these cuts, most field staff for both the prime and subcontracting programs were hired as specialists for one program. Now most, including CMRs, work on multiple programs. Similarly, the Subcontracting Task Team report pointed out that the merging of the CMR/PCR positions was workload driven and reflected the fact that positions were not being filled when incumbents retired. Finally, several SBA officials told us that to cope with the loss of staff and lack of travel funds, as well as the increased number of special initiatives, the assignment of multiple roles to staff became necessary and the desk review was created to replace the on-site review, when necessary.", "The decline in travel funds has especially affected on-site compliance monitoring. The lack of travel funds has become a critical factor in decisions about which prime contractors receive on-site reviews, particularly in those Area Offices that cover large geographic areas. For example, in one Area, one CMR said that one major factor determining which contractors receive on-site visits was whether they could be reached on a tank of gas, since travel funds are so limited. In another Area, the Director said that travel funds have been a problem for a long time, and that for many months of the fiscal year, CMRs do not have access to any travel money. This prevents them from being able to effectively select prime contractors for on-site review.", "Our survey indicated that the lack of travel funds also affected on-site reviews in fiscal year 2000. For example, 76 percent of the responding CMRs rated their Area Office\u2019s travel budget as very important in determining which prime contractors to review on-site. In comparison, fewer\u201466 percent\u2014rated problems with contractor reports as very important. Still fewer\u201458 percent and 50 percent, respectively\u2014rated poor/marginal ratings of the contractor during the last on-site review and the fact that the contractor had never had an on-site review as very important. Similarly, 78 percent rated the lack of travel funds as a significant barrier to conducting on-site prime contractor reviews.", "Finally, the Task Team\u2019s report expressed concern that without the requisite travel money and other resources, SBA will continue to monitor (on-site) about 12 percent of the total prime contractor portfolio, thus limiting the effectiveness of the Subcontracting Assistance Program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ad Hoc, Piecemeal Response to Resource Challenges", "paragraphs": ["SBA\u2019s response to these resource challenges has been largely ad hoc and reactive.

In addition, they told us that neither OGC nor the Subcontracting Assistance Program has conducted strategic assessments or planning for the CMR role.", "In sum, while regulations and operating procedures describe a variety of duties and responsibilities that CMRs may perform, SBA has not developed goals and objectives for the CMR role. For example, the agency analyzed what might be desirable levels of prime contractor coverage or subcontracting plan compliance in today\u2019s environment and how CMRs might contribute to achieving these goals. In addition, although SBA has productivity measures (e.g., the number of on-site and desk reviews conducted) to track CMRs\u2019 performance, it does not have impact or outcome measures\u2014or even such expectations\u2014for CMRs.

For example, the task force study that SBA cites as evidence of planning identified some specific problems with the CMR role and recommended some specific solutions. However, it did not strategically assess or plan the CMR role, nor was it tied to any SBA strategic-planning effort. In addition, the study did not use or establish measurable goals and objectives or outcome and impact measures for the CMR role. Similarly, the regulations and operating procedures that SBA references as evidence of vision are not tied to measurable goals and objectives and associated outcome and impact measures. Rather, they simply describe a variety of duties and responsibilities that CMRs are required to perform. In addition, the conditions that SBA cites as evidence of CMRs\u2019 effectiveness may be the result of many factors other than CMRs\u2019 efforts alone.

We do not agree that 80-percent time is essentially equivalent to 100- percent time. Four staff that work 80 percent of their time as Commercial Marketing Representatives (CMRs) constitute about three full-time equivalents (FTEs), not four FTEs. This is a difference of about 20 percent. As we point out in our report, SBA\u2019s use of part-time CMRs for whom the CMR role is, as SBA comments, \u201ca collateral duty,\u201d has not meant an increase in CMR staff resources. Rather, total CMR FTEs declined 28 percent from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal 2001. 2. SBA\u2019s task force study identified some specific problems with the CMR role and recommended some specific solutions, and SBA\u2019s efforts to implement some of these solutions can possibly lead to some incremental improvements. However, the task force study did not strategically assess or plan the CMR role, nor was it tied to any SBA strategic-planning effort. In addition, the study did not use or establish measurable goals and objectives or outcome and impact measures for the CMR role. In other words, the study did not address the larger issues of CMR strategic role assessment and planning. In the absence of such planning, SBA\u2019s approach to addressing challenges that CMRs face will continue to be ad hoc and piecemeal. 3. Delegating decisions about the focus of the CMR role to Area Directors may be appropriate. However, SBA has not conducted any assessments or evaluations that address what Area Office factors and characteristics make such delegation essential or effective. Furthermore, SBA has not evaluated the effectiveness of local decisions regarding the balance between compliance monitoring and marketing. The resource pressures on the CMR role heighten our concern. It may be that local decisions about the focus of the CMR role are more influenced by the realities of local resource constraints than by local compliance monitoring and marketing needs. Without sound assessment and evaluation, however, this and many other issues of role focus will remain clouded. 4. The regulations and operating procedures that SBA references do not constitute a strategic vision tied to measurable goals and objectives.", "Rather, as we discuss in our report, they simply describe a variety of duties and responsibilities that CMRs are required to perform. Since the regulations and guidance do not place a relative order of importance on these duties, and the Small Business Act and the Federal Acquisition Regulations do not mention CMRs, there is no law, regulation, or guidance requiring or suggesting that CMRs prioritize their work according to a strategic vision.", "In contrast, a strategic vision is broader and more comprehensive. It is expressed in an overall strategic plan that articulates a mission and specific plans to fulfill that mission, including measurable goals and objectives and associated outcome and impact measures. SBA also appears to recognize at least to some degree the limitations of the regulations and operating procedures as a strategic vision because it agrees that it needs to rethink the CMR role and develop outcome or impact measures. 5. SBA recognizes that on-site reviews are both more effective than and preferable to desk reviews but asserts that they are \u201cless cost- effective\u201d and \u201cnot always necessary.\u201d However, SBA does not offer persuasive evidence to support these assertions. During our review, SBA officials told us that they had not conducted assessments or evaluations of either of these compliance review methods or of their comparative effectiveness. Furthermore, SBA has not identified the criteria\u2014that is, the strategic goals and objectives and associated impact or outcome measures\u2014necessary to guide such assessments and evaluations.", "SBA also says that it uses the results of desk reviews to determine which prime contractors should receive on-site reviews. However, as we discuss in our report, the lack of travel funds is the primary driver of decisions about which prime contractors receive on-site reviews. 6. SBA observes that in fiscal year 2000, small businesses, in general; small disadvantaged businesses; and women-owned small businesses received \u201cmuch higher\u201d percentages of all subcontract awards than of prime contract awards. SBA also observes that the percentage of subcontract dollars awarded to small disadvantaged businesses has improved steadily over the past two decades. SBA then attributes both of these conditions solely to CMR efforts.", "SBA has not conducted the assessments and evaluations necessary to support this conclusion. Moreover, while CMRs\u2019 efforts may well have contributed to these conditions, a number of other factors likely have had a significant impact. As we note in our report, federal regulations require a subcontracting plan for each contract or contract modification that exceeds $500,000 ($1 million for construction contracts) and has subcontracting possibilities. Federal agencies are independently responsible for complying with these regulations. Agencies may even conduct their own subcontract-monitoring efforts. For example, DOD reviews subcontracting plans for defense prime contractors. In fact, SBA commented that it has delegated the primary responsibility for monitoring the subcontracting plans of most DOD contractors to the responsible DOD agency so that SBA can focus its limited resources on monitoring civilian agencies\u2019 plans. Since DOD accounted for 65 percent of all subcontracted dollars awarded in 2001, it is not likely that CMRs alone are responsible for all small business subcontracting achievements.", "There are also inherent business incentives for prime contractors to subcontract voluntarily with small businesses. For example, small business subcontractors can provide important specialized capabilities that the prime contractor does not have or wish to invest in developing. Small business subcontractors may also be able to provide some general services faster and more economically, thus saving prime contractor resources. Subcontracting also allows prime contractors to avoid permanent staffing increases that may not be sustainable in the face of market shifts. Finally, as we note in our report, the nature of federal contracting has changed. The number of prime contracts is shrinking, and many prime contracts have become so large that small businesses find it difficult to compete for them. This change alone may heavily influence the conditions that SBA cites as markers of CMRs\u2019 effectiveness. 7. We do not agree that our report leaves a mistaken impression with regard to the goals and objectives assigned to CMRs. Rather, we state clearly that SBA has productivity measures (such as the number of on- site and desk reviews conducted) to track CMRs\u2019 performance but that it does not have impact or outcome measures\u2014or even such expectations\u2014for CMRs. SBA agrees that it needs to develop outcome or impact measures to better measure CMR effectiveness. 8. We continue to believe that SBA\u2019s development of its new database appears to be slow. SBA began developing this new database in early 2001, after experiencing repeated problems with its original database. In October 2001, the SBA officials we interviewed told us that the new database would be operational in January 2002. In February 2002, SBA told us that it would be operational by June. Now, in October 2002, SBA says that it is only in test mode and acknowledges that it will not have a complete list of prime contractors with subcontracting plans until the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2003. 9. While SBA\u2019s original database does provide some useful information, the SBA officials we interviewed told us that the data were not complete. The database did not contain a complete list of prime contractors with subcontracting plans. 10. We continue to have concerns about CMRs\u2019 workload and prime contractor coverage. As we discuss in our report, about 18 CMR FTEs nationally monitor the subcontracting activities of the 2,029 prime contractors currently identified. In addition, CMRs have various marketing duties. (In fiscal year 2000, CMRs generally seemed to spend slightly more time on marketing than on compliance monitoring.) CMR compliance monitoring Area Office workloads currently range from 56 to 198 prime contractors per CMR FTE. There are wide variations in CMR workloads both between Area Offices and within more than one Area Office. This situation may be exacerbated when additional contractors with subcontracts are identified and added to CMR workloads."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
