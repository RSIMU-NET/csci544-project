To help address these issues, Congress directed the Administration in 2015 and 2017 to develop a plan for verification and monitoring relating to the potential proliferation of nuclear weapons, components of such weapons, and fissile material. GAO reviewed the first plan submitted to Congress in 2015, and an update submitted in 2017.

In the NDAA, Congress directed the President to produce a plan that would address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on verification, detection and monitoring efforts, including details on costs and funding needs over 10 years, (2) an international engagement plan, (3) a research and development plan, and (4) a description of interagency engagement. The National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the Department of Energy, developed the plan and submitted it to Congress in April 2018.", "According to NNSA officials, NNSA did not include long-term costs and funding needs in the plan because identifying these needs is unrealistic for several reasons, including because agencies have little influence over the spending priorities of other departments outside of the President's budget process. However, NNSA and other agencies already develop plans with long-term funding priorities and cost estimates for other programs. Because the plan does not include any estimates on future costs and funding needs, it limits congressional understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation's verification and monitoring efforts and its ability to make necessary funding and policy decisions. GAO has previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects and identify long-term funding needs. By including in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan, NNSA could help provide assurance that agencies are allocating appropriate resources to the verification and monitoring effort and that these resources are aligned with future activities and processes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Administrator of NNSA should include in its plan estimates of future costs and funding needed to support the activities in the plan.

This provision came out of issues that were  highlighted in a 2014 report from the Department of Defense\u2019s Defense  Science Board (DSB) on nonproliferation verification and monitoring  technologies. As a result of the DSB report, in the fiscal year 2015 and  fiscal year 2017 NDAAs, Congress directed the Administration to submit  interagency plans for verification and monitoring. The Administrations  submitted a classified plan in October 2015 and a classified update to the  plan in May 2017 in response to these mandates. We assessed the 2015  plan and 2017 update in March 2018 and found that they generally did  not address the reporting requirements.", "In the fiscal year 2018 NDAA, Congress indicated that the 2015 plan and  2017 update failed to answer congressional requirements and did not  reflect the high priority of this issue. Further, the NDAA reiterated the  DSB report\u2019s finding that \u201cThe nuclear future will not be a linear  extrapolation of the past\u2026and the technologies and processes designed  for current treaty verification and inspections are inadequate to future  monitoring realities.\u201d To address these issues, in the fiscal year 2018  NDAA Congress directed the President to produce a new plan that would  address four reporting requirements: (1) a plan and roadmap on  verification, detection, and monitoring efforts, including details on future  costs and funding needs over 10 years; (2) an international engagement  plan; (3) a research and development (R&D) plan to describe current and  planned efforts; and (4) a description of interagency engagement. On  behalf of the Administration, the National Nuclear Security Administration  (NNSA) prepared, and the Department of Energy submitted, a classified  plan to congressional committees in April 2018.", "The conference report accompanying the fiscal year 2018 NDAA includes  a provision for GAO to review the plan and provide its assessment to  congressional committees 90 days after submission of the plan. The  objective of this report is to assess whether the Administration\u2019s plan  provided detail on the reporting requirements in the fiscal year 2018  NDAA.", "To address this objective, we reviewed the 2018 plan. We assessed the  content of the plan against the reporting requirements and rated the  extent to which it provided detail on those requirements in one of three  ways: (1) addressed the reporting requirement with detail, (2) addressed  the reporting requirement without detail, or (3) did not address the  reporting requirement. In assessing the level of detail, we considered key  factors identified in our previous work on national strategies, federal  planning, and interagency collaboration. For example, we considered  the extent to which the plan provided information regarding specific goals  or objectives; strategies to achieve those goals or objectives and how  they would be implemented; which agency or agencies would implement  the strategies; and other measurable information, such as timelines and  the resources required. We also interviewed officials at NNSA who led the  development of the plan and coordinated with other contributing  interagency partners.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2018 to August 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

According to the 2017 National Security Strategy, terrorist groups  continue to pursue WMD-related materials, which pose a grave danger to  the United States. As also stated in the 2017 National Security Strategy,  Russia\u2019s nuclear arsenal remains the most existential threat to the United  States, China\u2019s nuclear arsenal is growing and diversifying, Iran has the  potential of renewing its nuclear program and North Korea has pursued  nuclear weapons despite international commitments. As the DSB report  noted, U.S. monitoring abilities are increasingly challenged by evolving  risks in 1) the capability of existing nuclear states and 2) the number of  state and nonstate actors possessing or attempting to possess nuclear  weapons. U.S. nonproliferation activities are conducted and coordinated  across multiple government agencies and organizations, as well as the  intelligence community. In addition, these efforts are coordinated with  international entities, national laboratories, industry, and academia.", "U.S. nuclear nonproliferation verification and monitoring efforts are guided  by, among other things, U.S. obligations under the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and U.S. support for the  Preparatory Commission for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty  Organization (CTBTO). The NPT lays out the respective responsibilities  of nuclear-weapon and nonnuclear-weapon states with regard to the  transfer, acquisition, possession, control, and manufacture of nuclear  weapons. All nonnuclear-weapon states are required to have a  comprehensive safeguards agreement with the International Atomic  Energy Agency (IAEA) to facilitate IAEA\u2019s safeguards activities. IAEA  safeguards are a set of technical measures and activities by which IAEA  seeks to verify that nuclear material subject to safeguards is not diverted  to nuclear weapons or other proscribed purposes. Under the  Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban Treaty (CTBT), which has yet to enter  into force, parties agree not to carry out any nuclear explosions. The  United States supports the work of the CTBTO to build up a verification  regime in preparation for the treaty\u2019s entry into force.", "The Administration\u2019s fiscal year 2018 plan for verification and monitoring  described ongoing interagency efforts to support nuclear proliferation  verification and monitoring and includes information about relevant  national priorities, capability gaps, R&D initiatives, and roles and  responsibilities. The 2018 plan (40 pages) is longer and more detailed  than the 2015 plan (2 pages) or the 2017 update (4 pages).

To identify these requirements, the plan  notes that interagency partners first identified a set of verification and  monitoring priorities. From these priorities they identified a number of  technical gaps. The plan then described dozens of examples of R&D  efforts and non-technical activities to address those technical gaps. For  example, for one gap the plan identifies eight current efforts to address  this gap, including continued Department of Energy and NNSA  investment in sensor capabilities that are small, light, and can operate in  low power.", "We found that the plan provided details on the requirement to identify and  integrate roles and responsibilities and planning. The plan includes details  of the roles and responsibilities of interagency partners and international  bodies that cooperate in the nonproliferation realm. For example, the plan  describes how the Department of Defense is to support U.S. verification  activities under the CTBT, including the installation, operation, and  maintenance of U.S. International Monitoring Systems.", "We found that the plan did not identify costs and funding needs over a 10- year period. NNSA officials stated that they believed providing funding  information over a 10-year period is unrealistic for several reasons. First,  according to NNSA officials, it is not feasible to achieve agreement on  actual or implied budgets outside of the existing President\u2019s budget  process. Second, according to NNSA officials, agencies have little  influence over the funding priorities of other departments outside of  existing budget efforts. Third, according to NNSA officials, long-term  funding estimates are infeasible because the President\u2019s budget only  identifies funding levels five years into the future. However, the 2018  NDAA did not ask for budget information. Instead, the NDAA reporting  requirement called for long-term costs and funding information necessary  to support the verification and monitoring activities in the plan. Finally,  NNSA officials told us that they and officials from other agencies briefed  the appropriate congressional committees prior to the release of the 2018  plan, and discussed the challenges with providing cost and funding data.", "According to NNSA officials, they verified with the congressional  committees that providing such information in the plan would be  impractical.", "We have previously reported that providing estimates of future costs and  funding needs can help congressional decisionmakers prioritize projects  and identify long-term funding needs. NNSA as well as other agencies  within the federal government already develop plans with long-term  funding priorities and cost estimates. For example, in June 2014, we  reported on 10-year estimates for sustaining and modernizing U.S.  nuclear weapons capabilities. As we found in this and other reports,  even when budgets are preliminary or not yet known, plans that include a  range of potential estimates help Congress prioritize projects and  funding. Because the plan does not include any information on  interagency costs and funding needs, it limits 1) congressional  understanding of the long-term affordability of the nation\u2019s verification and  monitoring efforts and 2) Congress\u2019s ability to make necessary funding  and policy decisions.

We have  previously reported on the importance of identifying resources among  collaborating agencies; we noted that without information on resource  contributions from partners in a collaborative effort, there is less  assurance that agency contributions are appropriate to successfully  sustain the effort. Similarly, providing information on future costs and  funding needs is important to help interagency partners coordinate and  develop long-term strategic plans that align with future interagency  efforts. We have found that for strategic planning to be done well, plans  should demonstrate alignment between activities, core processes, and  resources that support mission outcome.

We found that the 2018 plan provided detail on this requirement. The plan  includes detail on a wide range of R&D efforts and non-technical efforts  that agencies are pursuing. For example, the plan reports that the  Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is starting a program that  models millions of nodes and billions of connections to support the  detection of WMD proliferation activities.

However, NNSA stated that it planned no  further action with regard to costs and funding data. NNSA also provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "NNSA stated that it appreciated our recognition of improvements in the  2018 plan for verification and monitoring over the 2015 plan and the 2017  update. In its written comments, NNSA acknowledged that it did not  include interagency cost and funding requirements in the 2018 plan over  10 years as required in the NDAA. The agency stated that it briefed the  appropriate congressional committees before the release of the plan  about the challenges and feasibility of providing the cost and funding data  and received no objections on the omission of the data from the plan.  NNSA also stated that it informed us of the briefings. We have added  clarification in our report that NNSA officials believed they received  agreement from congressional staff to exclude funding and cost estimates  from its plan.", "NNSA stated that the NDAA did not prioritize the relative importance of  the reporting requirements, and that we disproportionately weighted the  one omission in our assessment, effectively overstating the importance of  providing cost and funding information. In addition, NNSA identified  challenges to the feasibility of providing interagency out-year cost and  funding estimates, including the difficulty to quantify the level of R&D and  associated funding required to achieve specific outcomes and that  departments and agencies are unable to commit to aligning 10 year  funding estimates with individual agencies\u2019 timelines and internal  processes for planning, programming, budgeting, and execution.", "NNSA\u2019s statement suggests that it views nuclear proliferation verification  and monitoring programs as being unique and different from other federal  programs and that they should therefore be exempt from estimating their  potential long-term resource burden on the federal budget. We disagree.  Developing future cost and funding estimates for programs is central to  effective interagency planning efforts. The efforts described in NNSA\u2019s  2018 nuclear verification and monitoring plan span a diverse range of  activities that are implemented across multiple agencies. The absence of  cost and funding estimates for these efforts in NNSA\u2019s plan raises  questions as to whether there is an effective interagency process to  coordinate these efforts and if the process is taking adequate account of  resource constraints and making realistic assessments of program  resource needs. In addition, information on future cost and funding  estimates of federal programs provides Congress with a better  understanding of the potential long-term funding needs and costs of the  diverse efforts supporting the proliferation verification and monitoring  mission. We believe this big picture view is important given the multiple  congressional committees of jurisdiction\u2014including appropriations,  authorization, and oversight committees\u2014for the efforts identified in  NNSA\u2019s plan.", "Regarding the feasibility of providing 10-year cost and funding estimates,  we recognize the difficulty and uncertainty agencies face in estimating  future funding needs. However, we do not believe developing such  estimates is impossible. As we reported, the Department of Defense  (DOD) and the Department of Energy (DOE) prepare an annual plan with  10 year cost and funding estimates for their ongoing nuclear sustainment  and modernization efforts, including R&D efforts.", "NNSA also provided general technical comments addressing our findings  on the cost and funding estimates that were not included in the plan,  including comments on NNSA\u2019s authority to obtain 10-year estimates  from other agencies, and on the examples we cited of other interagency  plans that include similar estimates.", "NNSA stated that it did not have authority to require other agencies to  submit 10-year budget estimates for their efforts that are included in the  plan. We noted in our report that Congress directed the President to  include this element in the nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring  plan. However, responsibility to prepare and submit the plan was  delegated by the President to DOE.", "NNSA commented that the joint DOD-DOE annual nuclear sustainment  and modernization plan is not comparable to the NNSA plan because the  former primarily addresses capital projects and other material products,  while the latter primarily addresses R&D activities. The reporting  requirements for NNSA\u2019s nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring  plan were not limited to R&D efforts, but included cost and funding  estimates for related activities and capabilities, including policy,  operations, testing, and evaluation. NNSA\u2019s comment focuses only on the  difficulty of addressing cost and funding estimates for only one aspect  (R&D) of nuclear proliferation verification and monitoring and ignores the  possibility that estimates for non-R&D efforts may be more feasible and  less difficult to report. Moreover, we have reported that the joint DOD- DOE plan on nuclear modernization includes 10-year DOD and DOE  estimates for R&D, as well as estimates for related modernization efforts,  including infrastructure, nuclear weapon life extension programs, delivery  systems, nuclear command, control, and communications systems, and  other related activities.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Administrator of NNSA, and other interested parties.
