Federal law allows up to 10 percent of families to have incomes above 130 percent of the poverty line--GAO refers to them as over-income families. Families with incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, or that meet certain other criteria, are referred to as under-income families. Nearly 1 million children a year participate in Head Start, and the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act provided an additional $2.1 billion. GAO received hotline tips alleging fraud by grantees. In response, GAO investigated the allegations, conducted undercover tests to determine if other centers were committing fraud, and documented instances where potentially eligible children were put on Head Start wait lists. On May 18, 2010 GAO testified on the preliminary results of the ongoing investigation. This report reiterates the findings disclosed in GAO's May testimony, and discusses new findings related to specific fraud allegations at two Head Start grantees. Since GAO's May testimony, HHS has taken a number of actions to address identified weaknesses, such as implementing a fraud hotline. HHS also indicated that it has moved expeditiously to begin a rule making process to strengthen the regulations on the eligibility verification process."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO received allegations of fraud and abuse involving two Head Start nonprofit grantees in the Midwest and Texas. Two of the many allegations were substantiated. For example, one grantee inappropriately counted time parents spent helping children with homework as contributions to meet program funding requirements. While not fraudulent, we found that at both grantees, the average number of students who attended class was significantly lower than the number of students the grantees reported as enrolled in class. Realizing that the alleged fraud schemes could be perpetrated at other Head Start programs, GAO attempted to register fictitious children as part of 15 undercover test scenarios at centers in six states and the District of Columbia. In 8 instances staff at these centers fraudulently misrepresented information, including disregarding part of a family's income to register over-income children into under-income slots. The undercover tests revealed that seven Head Start employees lied about applicants' employment status or misrepresented their earnings. This leaves Head Start at risk that over-income children may be enrolled while legitimate under-income children are put on wait lists. At no point during our registrations was information submitted by GAO's fictitious parents verified, leaving the program at risk that dishonest persons could falsify earnings statements and other documents in order to qualify. In seven instances centers did not manipulate information. To hear selected video clips of GAO enrollments, see http://www.gao.gov/media/video/gao-10-1049/ . In addition, GAO found that most of the 550 Head Start centers contacted had wait lists. GAO also found that two centers where GAO enrolled fictitious children later became full and developed wait lists after the fictitious children had been withdrawn. Only 44 centers reported that they had openings. GAO interviewed families on wait lists from other centers and found that many stated that their incomes were at or below the federal poverty level. In some cases, families stated they had experienced some type of domestic violence, or were receiving some type of public assistance, which made them automatically eligible for Head Start. GAO did not attempt to verify family statements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Head Start program, overseen by the Department of Health and  The Head Start program, overseen by the Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Administration for Children and Families and  Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Administration for Children and Families and  administered by the Office of Head Start (OHS), is one of the largest  administered by the Office of Head Start (OHS), is one of the largest  federal early childhood programs.

We reviewed grant  documentation and enrollment information reported to OHS by grantees.  We reviewed attendance records that we obtained from the grantees. To  conduct undercover testing, we created fictitious identities and bogus  documents, including pay stubs and birth certificates, in order to attempt  to register ineligible children at Head Start centers located in California,  Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas, Wisconsin and the  Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. We also attempted to register two  eligible families and their children to determine if centers would count  these children toward reported enrollment numbers even if our children  never attended the program. We chose the centers where we attempted to  enroll our fictitious children for two reasons. First, unlike the  approximately 500 centers we contacted that could not verify that they  had any openings, these centers indicated that they had openings for new  enrollees. Second, they were located either in states with a significant  proportion of Head Start funding, in the same geographic area as a GAO  office, or in the same geographic area as the two programs we received  FraudNet allegations on. In situations in which our fictitious parents were  told to bring their fictitious child to class, we monitored centers by making  follow-up phone calls, to determine if centers still had openings in order to  ensure that we were not occupying a space that could be used by an  actual, eligible child. Subsequent to our applications, we requested, as  GAO, that the centers provide us all information regarding the submitted  applications and information as to whether these fictitious children ever  were counted on center attendance records. In order to document  situations of families waiting to enroll in Head Start, we identified centers  with wait lists through calls we made to approximately 550 centers and  contacted families on these wait lists. We asked applicants for information  on the length of time they spent on a wait list, the family\u2019s economic  situation, and whether they had been affected by being wait-listed for  Head Start services. We did not attempt to verify the accuracy of the  information that families provided to us. We cannot project the results of  our investigation of allegations, undercover tests, and family interviews to  the entire Head Start program.", "We conducted our investigation from October 2008 through September  2010 in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Council of the  Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Head Start program was established in 1965 to deliver comprehensive  educational, social, health, nutritional, and psychological services to low- income families and their children who are below the age of compulsory  school attendance. These services include preschool education, family  support, health screenings, and dental care. Head Start was originally  aimed at 3- to 5-year-olds. A companion program, called Early Head Start,  began in 1994 and focuses on making these services available to pregnant  women and children from birth to 3 years of age. Head Start operates both  full- and part-day programs\u2014most only during the school year. The  Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program is designed to meet the specific  needs of migrant and seasonal farm worker families. OHS makes Head  Start grants directly to approximately 1,600 local organizations, including  community action agencies, school systems, tribal governments and  associations, and for-profit and nonprofit organizations. To accomplish  Head Start\u2019s goals, the Congress provided $7.2 billion in federal funds for  fiscal year 2010, as well as $2.1 billion in Recovery Act funds.", "Head Start statutes and regulations establish several primary eligibility  criteria, one of which a child must generally meet in order to enroll in the  program. These primary criteria include the child\u2019s family earns income  below the federal poverty level; the child\u2019s family is eligible or, in the  absence of child care, would potentially be eligible for, public assistance;  the child is in foster care; or the child is homeless. However, Head Start  programs may also fill up to 10 percent of their slots with children from  families who do not meet any of the above criteria, but who \u201cwould  benefit\u201d from participation in the program. If a single grantee operates  multiple Head Start locations, the 10 percent limit applies to the aggregate  total enrollment for all combined locations run by that grantee. We refer to  these children and their families as over-income. There is no cap on the  income level for the over-income families. If the Head Start program has  implemented policies and procedures that ensure that the program is  meeting the needs of children eligible under the primary criteria and  prioritizes their enrollment in the program, then the program may also fill  up to 35 percent of its slots with children from families with income below  130 percent of the poverty line. Programs filling slots under this provision  are subject to additional reporting requirements. Children from families  with incomes below 130 percent of the poverty line, and children who  qualify under one of the primary eligibility criteria, are referred to as  \u201cunder-income\u201d for the purposes of this report. In addition, unless a  program applies for and receives a waiver, at least 10 percent of each  program\u2019s total slots must be filled with children with disabilities who are  determined to be eligible for special education and related services or  early intervention services. To qualify for the Migrant and Seasonal Head  Start program, families must have changed their residence within the  preceding 24 months for the purpose of engaging in certain agricultural  work, and the families\u2019 incomes must come primarily from this type of  work. In enrolling families in Head Start, program staff are to review  documentation of income and employment to certify that each family is  eligible. Head Start services are to be provided free of charge to eligible  families.", "OHS assigns each grantee a specific number of children and families that it  is required to serve, known as the funded enrollment. Head Start statutes  and regulations require grantees to maintain enrollment at 100 percent of  the funded enrollment level. If a child stops attending the program, after  the grantee has attempted, unsuccessfully, to get the child back in regular  attendance, the grantee must reopen that spot as a vacancy and no more  than 30 calendar days may elapse before the grantee fills the vacancy;  otherwise, OHS considers the grantee underenrolled. To facilitate the  prompt filling of vacancies, Head Start statutes and regulations require  each grantee to maintain a wait list that ranks children according to its  selection criteria and to select those with the greatest need for services.  Grantees report enrollment numbers monthly, and those that are  underenrolled for 4 consecutive months must receive technical assistance  from OHS and work to develop and implement a plan to eliminate  underenrollment. A grantee that continues to operate with less than 97  percent of its funded enrollment level may have its grant amount  recaptured, withheld, or reduced by OHS. According to HHS, funds for 30  grantees were reduced in 2006. A Head Start grantee may also be  terminated from participation in the program for continuously failing to  meet other performance, education, administrative, and financial  management standards that have been established by HHS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Allegations of Fraud and Abuse Involving Two Head Start Grantees", "paragraphs": ["We investigated the allegations of fraud and abuse that we received  involving Head Start nonprofit grantees in the Midwest and Texas.

This allegation was not substantiated, but we found that  some of the grantees\u2019 centers enrolled more than 10 percent of over- income families. Across all grantee sites, five percent of families were  registered as over-income. Based on records obtained from the grantee, it  appears that 9 of the grantees\u2019 28 centers had more than 10 percent over- income families enrolled. According to the documentation we reviewed,  the percentage of over-income families in the 28 centers ranged from  centers with no over-income enrollments to one center where 44 percent  of the 18 families it enrolled were over-income.

On a classroom basis, one classroom had none of  the students classified as homeless, while in another classroom 38 percent  of the students were considered homeless. Our concern, based on the  allegation, was that some portion of these families classified as homeless  in grantee records were actually over-income families that were not, in  fact, homeless, but were encouraged to report that they were in order to  qualify. We also analyzed enrollment records for 22 students classified as  homeless at one of the Texas grantee\u2019s centers. We determined from  records that 11 of 22 children at this site were correctly classified as  homeless. According to grantee documents, of the 11 students correctly  classified as homeless, 8 students lived with relatives due to financial  hardship and 3 students lived with relatives due to a temporary change in  guardianship. However, based on documentation we obtained from the  grantee, we could not determine whether the other 11 children were  correctly classified as homeless. Of these 11, it appears that 8 of the  students would have qualified for Head Start services because they met  another primary eligibility criterion. For three of the families, we were not  able to determine from the files whether they would have been eligible for  Head Start services under another primary eligibility criterion. By  extension of certain Head Start regulations, OHS officials told us that if a  child qualified for Head Start because it was determined that he or she was  homeless, the child would be eligible not only in the determination year,  but also in the following year, without the requirement that the child\u2019s  homeless status be re-verified.

According to regulations and an Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  circular, if the grantee allows employees to use vehicles owned by the  organization, only those vehicle costs associated with performance of the  Head Start grant may be submitted as allowable costs and reimbursed by  Head Start. We reviewed grantee policy as it related to vehicle record  keeping. We determined that grantee policy followed OMB policy and  stated that travel logs must be maintained as prescribed by the appropriate  supervisor. Grantee officials stated that a set amount was deducted from  employee paychecks to account for this benefit to the employees.

For the Midwest Migrant and Seasonal Head Start program, we were able  to confirm through documents obtained from the grantee that in 2008  more than 60 children were moved from one center to other centers with  vacancies at the end of the grant period. It is not clear whether the  students were physically moved to the other centers or whether they were  moved only on paper.

We also  found that attendance on a single day ranged from 3 percent to 94 percent  of reported enrollment. (See table 3.)", "As we have previously reported, the number of children and families  served by Head Start is an essential measure of the program\u2019s impact. Yet  OHS lacks assurance that grantees actually serve the numbers of children  they report having enrolled and for which they are receiving funds. Under  the current definition of enrollment in Head Start regulations, grantees  could reasonably report full enrollment without providing services to the  number of children they were funded to serve. Reporting figures to the  Congress and the American public that do not represent children and  families to whom services have been provided fails to provide a  transparent measure of the important work undertaken by these  programs. In addition, without monitoring information on services  actually provided, OHS could miss opportunities to assist grantees that are  experiencing significant difficulties in their ability to serve the children  they have enrolled. Calculating attendance, which fluctuates, may be  challenging, but OHS already offers guidance on calculating average daily  attendance on its Web site. Moreover, in 2008 an advisory committee to  the Secretary of Health and Human Services specifically recommended  that attendance be considered along with other factors in determining  whether OHS should renew an individual grant or make the grant available  for competition among organizations. This recommendation has not been  implemented; HHS officials indicated that regulations governing the  redesignation system are under preparation. We recently recommended,  with respect to Head Start services being provided under the Recovery  Act, that OHS should collect data on the extent to which children and  pregnant women actually receive services from Head Start and Early Head  Start grantees. In response to this recommendation, OHS expressed  confidence that enrollment is a valid indicator of service delivery.  However, agency officials acknowledge that enrollment figures are only  accurate if programs are monitored closely on how they report these  figures. OHS officials told GAO that in Fiscal Year 2010 they began  monitoring enrollment figures in relation to attendance during on-site  reviews.

Posing  as fictitious families, we attempted to register children at Head Start  centers in California, Maryland, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Texas,  Wisconsin, and the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area. Our 15 tests  mainly involved families that were not eligible for Head Start services. For  13 of these tests our fictitious families were over-income or had  disqualifying characteristics. For 2 additional tests, our fictitious families  did not have any disqualifying characteristics and were under-income.  These 2 tests were designed to determine whether a Head Start center  would count our fictitious children toward enrollment numbers even if our  children never attended the program. For all 15 tests, we contacted each  center in advance and were instructed in all cases to bring certain  documents necessary for enrollment, which included income  documentation.", "In 8 out of 13 eligibility tests, our families were told they were eligible for  the program and instructed to attend class. In all 8 of these cases, Head  Start employees actively encouraged our fictitious families to misrepresent  their eligibility for the program. In at least 4 cases, documents we later  retrieved from these centers show that our applications were doctored to  exclude income information for which we provided documentation, which  would have shown the family to be over-income. Employees at seven  centers knowingly disregarded part of our families\u2019 income to help make  over-income families and their children appear to actually be under- income. This would have had the effect of filling slots reserved for under- income children with over-income children. At two centers, staff indicated  on application forms that one parent was unemployed, even though we  provided documentation of the parents\u2019 income. A Head Start employee at  one center even assured us that no one would verify that the income  information submitted was accurate. For the 2 tests in which our family  did not have disqualifying characteristics, we were accepted into the  program once and not accepted once because of a lack of openings. In the  test in which our eligible child was accepted into the program, the  scenario was designed to test how long the center would keep a child who  never attended the program on enrollment records before counting the  spot as a vacancy and attempting to fill it with another child. Because of  our concerns about occupying a slot for an actual child, we were forced to  contact the center and voluntarily withdraw our fictitious child before  sufficient time elapsed that would have allowed us to make a  determination regarding how long the center would have kept our child on  enrollment records. We monitored the centers where each of our fictitious  children had been accepted and when a center told us that there were  fewer than three vacancies, we subsequently called and withdrew our  fictitious child. Head Start centers may keep a child on enrollment records  for as long as 30 days even if the child has not attended class. All of our  fictitious children were withdrawn from the program before the 30-day  period had elapsed. However, the enrollment of our family that appeared  eligible for the program as well as our other successful tests highlight the  ease with which unscrupulous parents could fabricate documentation  designed to make it appear as though their children were under-income or  otherwise eligible for the program. Our fictitious pay stubs and W-2s were  made using information found on the Internet, commercially available  word processing software, and a printer and took only a few minutes to  create. At no point during our registrations was any of the information  contained in fictitious documentation submitted by our parents verified,  which indicates that the program is vulnerable to beneficiary fraud in  addition to grantee fraud.", "Table 4 provides details on our approved applications, followed by our  unsuccessful applications. We withdrew our fictitious families from the  programs as soon as we documented that there were fewer than three  openings at a center. To view selected video clips of these undercover  enrollments, go to http://www.gao.gov/products/gao-10-1049/.", "We also identified a key vulnerability during our investigation that could  allow over-income children to be enrolled in other Head Start centers:  income documentation for enrollees is not required to be maintained by  grantees. Under Head Start regulations, Head Start center employees must  sign a statement attesting that the applicant child is eligible and identifying  which income documents they examined, such as W-2s or pay stubs;  however, they do not have to maintain copies of them. We discovered that  the lack of documentation made it virtually impossible to determine  whether families enrolled in Head Start programs had provided accurate  information to Head Start centers. As a result of our testimony at the May  18, 2010 hearing, OHS issued guidance that suggested that grantees use a  standardized form to collect eligibility information, and that grantees  maintain copies of the eligibility documents that were reviewed. However,  given that Head Start employees in several of our undercover tests  reviewed family income documentation, and then chose only to record  part of the income on Head Start forms, we remain concerned that  ineligible children could receive services for which they are not eligible."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Centers Maintain Wait Lists", "paragraphs": ["We are concerned that eligible children at other centers do not receive  services for which they are in need, given the vulnerabilities to fraud and  abuse we found through our undercover tests. At 2 of the 8 centers where  we enrolled fictitious children that were not eligible for the program, we  were later told, after withdrawing our children from the program, that the  center was at full enrollment and was not accepting more children at that  time. During the course of our work, we contacted approximately 550  Head Start centers to determine whether they had space for our fictitious  children. We found that the majority of the centers stated that they had no  open slots for enrollment but maintained wait lists per program  requirements. We found that only 44 centers stated that they had any  openings. We interviewed 21 families on wait lists and found that the  majority stated that their income was at or below the federal poverty level.  In some cases, families had experienced some type of domestic violence  or were receiving some other type of public assistance, a group targeted  specifically for assistance by Head Start program guidelines. We did not  attempt to verify this information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Head Start Center Wait Lists Were Substantial", "paragraphs": ["The length of these wait lists varied considerably; however, several of the  centers we contacted had lengthy wait lists. For example, one grantee we  contacted in Texas, which serves approximately 4,260 children in 36  centers, had over 1,150 children on its wait list. Another Head Start  grantee told us that it averages around 500 children on its wait list. A  representative from one Pennsylvania Head Start center we contacted  stated that there were around 120 applicants on the center\u2019s wait list.  Furthermore, a review of media sources reveals that Head Start centers  around the country face similar challenges meeting their communities\u2019  demand for services. We queried a news media search engine and found  numerous reports of lengthy waiting lists to enroll in Head Start programs  in many parts of the country. For example, according to one Florida  newspaper, the state of Florida has 8,000 students on wait lists for Head  Start programs. A newspaper in Indiana, reported that a program in  Indiana that serves 380 students has 170 students on the wait list. It is  important to note that we found a range of openings in the centers we  called. While several grantees reported that they had lengthy wait lists,  other grantees were eager to accept our fictitious, over-income children to  fill their rolls. The center in New Jersey that accepted our fictitious over- income family told us that it had more than 30 openings. Another center in  California, which did not accept our application, told us that it had 40 part- day openings. We did not validate the actual number of students on  waitlists in these centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Eligible Applicants Cannot Be Admitted Because of Lack of Space", "paragraphs": ["We contacted 21 families who at the time of interview were on wait lists  for Head Start programs. We received a list of 1,600 wait list applicants  from a Head Start grantee in Texas\u2014of these, we attempted to call the 30  families who were at the top of the waitlist and we were able to speak to  11 families. We also received a wait list of 30 applicants for services in  Pennsylvania\u2014we attempted to speak to all 30 families and of these we  were able to speak to 10 families. We asked applicants for information on  the length of time they spent on the wait list, on the family\u2019s economic  situation, and whether they had been affected by being waitlisted for Head  Start services. Several of the applicants we spoke with described  circumstances that made them especially strong candidates for Head Start,  including receiving other types of public assistance, such as Medicaid or  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance, or having histories of domestic abuse.  Additionally, several applicants reported that family members were unable  to accept work opportunities as a result of not being able to enroll  children in Head Start, or experienced additional financial strain because  they had to pay child care costs. Many applicants also cited concerns that  their children would not be adequately prepared for school. Given the  relative ease with which GAO employees posing as fictitious parents were  able to qualify for Head Start services, it is possible that some over-income  or otherwise ineligible children are currently enrolled in Head Start  programs while low-income children are put on wait lists and do not  receive necessary services. For example, when a center manipulates  information to make it appear that an over-income family is a low-income  family this possibly takes up a Head Start slot set aside for a low-income  family. Although OHS does not currently collect information that would  allow it to determine what percent of Head Start centers have a wait list,  the majority of centers we called reported that they had a wait list.

We reviewed grant documentation and  enrollment information reported to the Office of Head Start (OHS) by  grantees. We requested documentation from the grantees, including  attendance records, student files, and policy memorandums. We compared  attendance records to reported enrollment at the Head Start nonprofit  grantees in the Midwest and Texas.

One of these centers was visited 3 times; we conducted  a total of 15 tests at the centers we tested. We also attempted to register  two eligible families and their children to determine if centers would count  these children toward reported enrollment numbers. We chose these  centers for two reasons. First, unlike about 500 centers we contacted that  could not confirm they had any openings, these centers indicated that they  had openings for new enrollees. We chose to focus on only centers with  openings to be sure we did not displace any actual, eligible children.  Second, they were located either in states with a significant proportion of  Head Start funding, in the same geographic area as a GAO office, or in the  same geographic area as the two programs accused of committing fraud.  We created 15 fictitious scenarios and used fabricated documentation  during our in-person applications. Our over-income scenarios involved  family incomes ranging from approximately $20,000 to approximately  $75,000. The scenarios were designed to determine if other Head Start  centers were engaging in actions similar to those that were the basis of the  allegations we received about centers in the Midwest and Texas. We used  publicly available hardware, software, and materials to fabricate our  supporting documentation. In situations in which our fictitious parents  were told to bring their fictitious child to class, we monitored centers by  making follow-up phone calls, to determine if centers still had openings in  order to ensure that we were not occupying a space that could be used by  an actual, eligible child. Subsequent to our applications, we requested, as  GAO, that the centers provide us all information regarding the submitted  applications and information as to whether these fictitious children ever  were counted on center attendance records.", "In order to document situations of families waiting to enroll in Head Start,  we identified centers with wait lists through calls we made to  approximately 550 centers and contacted families on these wait lists.
