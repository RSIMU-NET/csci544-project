To address these and other issues, Congress enacted the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA), which required each polling place to have an accessible voting system by 2006.

In 2008, based upon GAO's survey of polling places, GAO estimated that 27 percent of polling places had no potential impediments in the path from the parking to the voting area--up from16 percent in 2000; 45 percent had potential impediments but offered curbside voting; and the remaining 27 percent had potential impediments and did not offer curbside voting. All but one polling place GAO visited had an accessible voting system--typically, an electronic machine in a voting station--to facilitate private and independent voting for people with disabilities. However, 46 percent of polling places had an accessible voting system that could pose a challenge to certain voters with disabilities, such as voting stations that were not arranged to accommodate voters using wheelchairs. In GAO's 2008 state survey, 43 states reported that they set accessibility standards for polling places, up from 23 states in 2000. Further, 31 states reported that ensuring polling place accessibility was challenging. Localities GAO surveyed in 2008 reported providing voting services directly to long-term care facility residents who may face challenges voting in a polling place. For example, close to one-third of localities GAO surveyed reported designating long-term care facilities as Election Day polling places.", "From shortly after the passage of HAVA until 2006, Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility and conducted an initial assessment of states' compliance with HAVA's January 2006 deadline for accessible voting systems. After implementation of HAVA, Justice's oversight of HAVA's access requirements was part of two other enforcement efforts, but gaps remained. While Justice provided guidance on polling place accessibility, this guidance did not address accessibility of the voting area itself. In 2009, Justice conducted polling place observations for federal elections that identified whether accessible voting systems were in place, but it did not systematically assess the physical accessibility of polling places or the level of privacy and independence provided to voters with disabilities. Justice also conducted a small number of annual community assessments of Americans with Disabilities Act compliance of public buildings, which included buildings designated as polling places. However, these assessments did not provide a national perspective on polling place accessibility or assess any special features of the voting area and the accessible voting system that are set up only on Election Day."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO previously recommended that Justice expand its monitoring and oversight of polling place accessibility.

As you know, voting is fundamental to our democratic system,  and federal law generally requires federal election polling places to be  accessible to all eligible voters, including voters with disabilities and the  elderly. Under the law, state political subdivisions responsible for  conducting elections must assure that polling places used in federal  elections are accessible, as determined by the state. These  requirements present a challenge to state and local election officials  because achieving accessibility\u2014which is affected by the type of  impairment and various barriers posed by polling place facilities and  voting methods\u2014is part of a larger set of challenges they face in  administering elections on a periodic basis. In the 2008 federal election,  an estimated 15 million voters with disabilities cast ballots. However,  during the 2000 federal election, we found that only 16 percent of polling  places had no potential impediments to voting access for people with  disabilities. Congress passed the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA)  to address these and other challenges encountered during the 2000  federal election. Subsequently, Congress asked GAO to assess voting  access for people with disabilities again and examine actions taken to  facilitate voting for residents of long-term care facilities during the 2008  federal election.", "Much has happened since the 2008 federal election, and states have  made various changes to their election laws that may affect voters with  disabilities. Specifically, leading into the 2012 presidential election,  numerous states made substantive changes to: their election codes or  procedures in areas of voter identification; alternative methods of voting,  such as in-person voting prior to Election Day; and requirements for voter  registration drives conducted by nongovernment organizations.", "My statement today is based primarily on our findings from two 2009  GAO reports on polling place accessibility and voting in long-term care  facilities, respectively.

Specifically, in 2012, we  issued a report examining state laws addressing voter registration and  voting on or before Election Day. In the report, we found that states had  been active in the past 10 years in amending their election codes,  regulations, and procedures, not only to incorporate requirements  mandated by HAVA, but also in making substantive changes to their laws  in the areas of voter identification, early voting, and requirements for third- party voter registration organizations. We found that states had a variety  of identification requirements for voters when they register to vote, vote at  the polls on Election Day, and seek to cast an absentee ballot by mail that  were in effect for the November 2012 election. Specifically, while voter  identification requirements varied in flexibility, the number and type of  documents allowed, and alternatives available for verifying identity, 31  states had requirements for all eligible voters to show identification at the  polls on Election Day. We also found that most states had also  established alternatives for voters to cast a ballot other than at the polls  on Election Day. Thirty-five states and the District of Columbia provided  an opportunity for voters to cast a ballot prior to the election without an  excuse, either by no-excuse absentee voting by mail or in-person early  voting, or both. States also regulated the process by which voters  registered to vote and had a variety of requirements that address third- party voter registration organizations that conduct voter registration  drives.", "In addition, in 2012, we issued a report looking at the potential  implementation of weekend voting and similar alternative voting  methods. In the report, we found that in the 2010 general election, 35  states and the District provided voters at least one alternative to casting  their ballot on Election Day through in-person early voting, no-excuse  absentee voting, or voting by mail. However, state and local election  officials we interviewed identified challenges they would anticipate facing  in planning and conducting Election Day activities on weekends\u2014 specifically, finding poll workers and polling places, and securing ballots  and voting equipment\u2014and expected cost increases. Specifically, officials  in 14 of the 17 jurisdictions and the District expected that at least some of  the polling places they used in past elections\u2014such as churches\u2014would  not be available for a weekend election, and anticipated difficulty finding  replacements. Additionally, officials in 5 of the 7 states and the District  that conducted early voting and provided security over multiple days  explained that the level of planning needed for overnight security for a  weekend election would far surpass that of early voting due to the greater  number and variety of Election Day polling places. For example, officials  in one state said that for the 2010 general election, the state had fewer  than 300 early voting sites\u2014which were selected to ensure security\u2014 compared to more than 2,750 polling places on Election Day, which are  generally selected based on availability and proximity to voters."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Proportion of Polling Places Without Potential Impediments Increased Between the 2000 and 2008 Elections", "paragraphs": ["In comparison to our findings in 2000, the proportion of polling places with  no potential impediments increased in 2008.

During this time, Justice officials said they made a  considerable effort to educate state and local election officials and  national organizations representing election officials and people with  disabilities on HAVA voting system requirements. As part of these early  efforts, Justice provided guidance to poll workers on how to assess and  create a physically accessible polling place. Specifically, in 2004, Justice  published the Americans with Disabilities Act: ADA Checklist for Polling  Places, which provided information to voting officials on key accessibility  features needed by most voters with disabilities to go from the parking  area to the voting area. According to our survey, 34 states found the  checklist to be moderately to very helpful. While the checklist provides  limited guidance on accessibility features within the voting area, it does  not provide information about the configuration of the voting system. In  addition to early guidance, Justice also conducted an initial assessment  of states\u2019 progress toward meeting the January 2006 deadline for  compliance with HAVA voting system requirements. For example, in  2003, Justice sent letters to state election officials summarizing HAVA  voting system requirements. Justice later followed up with letters in 2005  and 2006, which outlined HAVA voting system requirements, and asked  states to respond to a series of questions to help gauge whether every  polling place in the state had at least one accessible voting machine and  whether poll workers were trained in the machine\u2019s operation.

For example, Justice supervised  polling place observations for federal elections on Election Day 2008,  primarily to assess compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965.  However, Justice did not systematically assess the physical accessibility  of the polling places or the level of privacy and independence provided to  people with disabilities by the accessible voting system, which limited the  department\u2019s ability to identify potential accessibility issues facing voters  with disabilities. In addition, Justice initiated a small number of annual  community assessments\u2014called Civic Access assessments\u2014of ADA  compliance in public buildings, including buildings designated as polling  places, but these assessments included a small portion of polling places  nationwide and were generally not conducted on Election Day. According  to Justice, these assessments could be resource-intensive, which, in part,  may have limited the number that the department could complete in a  given year. Justice initiated Civic Access assessments for three  communities in calendar year 2008. When onsite reviews identified  physical barriers and impediments for people with disabilities, Justice  generally negotiated and entered into a settlement agreement with the  election jurisdiction. Between 2000 and 2008, Justice entered into 69  Civic Access settlement agreements containing one or more  recommendations aimed at polling place provisions, but given the small  number of Civic Access assessments conducted annually, they did not  provide a national perspective on polling place accessibility.

In addition, Justice stated that it has expanded the scope of Election Day  observations to include an assessment of the physical accessibility of  polling places, citing its monitoring of 240 polling places in about 28  jurisdictions for the 2012 general election. However, Justice did not  indicate whether its expanded Election Day observations include  assessing privacy and independence provided by accessible voting  systems.
