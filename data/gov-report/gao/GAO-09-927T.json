The system is to develop and link planning documents at the federal, state, and local levels. While the system's framework is established, the CBRNE concept and strategic plans that provide further guidance are incomplete. DOD has had operational plans in place and revises these plans regularly. However, until the Integrated Planning System and its associated plans are complete, DOD's plans and those of other federal and state entities will not be integrated, and it will remain unclear whether DOD's CCMRF will address potential gaps in capabilities. With a goal to respond to multiple, near-simultaneous, catastrophic CBRNE incidents, DOD has plans to provide the needed capabilities, but its planned response times may not meet incident requirements, it may lack sufficient capacity in some capabilities, and it faces challenges to its strategy for sourcing all three CCMRFs with available units. Without assigned units and plans that integrate the active and reserve portions of the CCMRF, and agreements between DOD and the states on the availability of National Guard units and the duty status in which they would respond to an incident requiring federal forces, DOD's ability to train and deploy forces in a timely manner to assist civil authorities to respond to multiple CBRNE incidents is at risk. DOD has taken a number of actions in the past year to improve the readiness of units assigned to the CCMRF, increasing both individual and collective training focused on the mission and identifying the mission as high priority. However, the CCMRF has not conducted realistic full force field training to confirm units' readiness to assume the mission or to deploy rapidly. Competing demands of overseas missions may distract from a unit's focus on the domestic mission, and some CCMRF units rotate more frequently than stated goals. These training and force rotation problems have prevented DOD from providing the kind of stability to the force that would allow units to build cohesiveness. DOD is making progress in identifying and providing funding and equipment to meet CCMRF mission requirements; however, its efforts to identify total program requirements have not been completed, and funding responsibilities have been assigned across the department and are not subject to central oversight. When the CCMRF mission priority increased in the spring of 2008, more funding was provided. However, units did not have dedicated funding and thus purchased equipment with existing funding which is also used for other missions. DOD lacks visibility over the mission's total funding requirements. Without an overarching approach to developing requirements and providing funding and a centralized focal point to ensure that all requirements have been identified and funded, DOD's ability to ensure that its forces are prepared to carry out this high priority mission remains challenged."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss preliminary results of our work  on the Department of Defense\u2019s efforts to provide consequence  management support to civilian authorities in the event of a catastrophic  chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and high-yield explosives  (CBRNE) incident. The 2007 National Strategy for Homeland Security  highlighted the continuing threat posed to the United States by the  potential use of weapons of mass destruction by terrorist organizations. In  addition to efforts focused on preventing such attacks, the strategy  highlights the need for a comprehensive capability to mitigate the  consequences of an attack involving weapons of mass destruction. Such a  capability is also a key pillar of the National Strategy to Combat Weapons  of Mass Destruction. The Department of Defense (DOD) characterizes  weapons of mass destruction in terms of CBRNE materials. Incidents  involving CBRNE could range in magnitude, from such things as accidents  like chemical spills that likely could be addressed by local responders to  catastrophic incidents such as terrorist attacks involving nuclear material  that could result in extraordinary levels of casualties and property  damage.", "A catastrophic CBRNE-related incident occurring within the United States  would require a unified, national response, including action by DOD. The  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is responsible for coordinating  federal disaster response planning, with the Federal Emergency  Management Agency (FEMA) serving as the primary federal agency under  DHS for coordinating federal assistance in response to an incident. DOD  would act in support of the primary federal agency. In addition to  establishing CBRNE response units in the National Guard, including the  Civil Support Teams and CBRNE Enhanced Response Force Packages,  DOD is establishing CBRNE Consequence Management Response Forces  (CCMRF). The CCMRF is intended to be roughly a brigade-sized force  (approximately 4,500 troops) that provides the federal military assistance  when a CBRNE incident exceeds local and state capabilities.", "In May 2006, we reported that the National Guard Civil Support Teams  were generally organized and prepared for their mission, and we  highlighted management challenges that needed to be addressed. In  response to the request of this subcommittee and other Senate requesters  that we assess DOD\u2019s federal role in CBRNE consequence management  efforts, we initiated a review focusing on federal military planning and  preparedness efforts and the CCMRF. This testimony is based on  preliminary findings from this work and addresses the extent to which (1)  DOD\u2019s plans and capabilities are integrated with other federal government  plans to address capability requirements, (2) DOD has planned for and  structured its force to provide CBRNE consequence management  assistance, (3) DOD\u2019s CCMRF are prepared to perform their mission; and  (4) DOD has funding plans for the CCMRF that are linked to requirements  for specialized CBRNE capabilities.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has planned for CBRNE  consequence management operations and integrated plans with other  federal government plans, we reviewed and compared current DOD  operational and tactical level plans for civil support and CBRNE  consequence management with existing FEMA and DHS planning efforts.  We also met with officials of the Department of Homeland Security, the  Office of the Undersecretary of Defense for Homeland Defense, and U.S  Northern Command. We reviewed prior GAO reports and worked with  other GAO staff currently examining the overall domestic homeland  security planning integration process. To determine how prepared the  CCMRF is to perform the mission we compared existing DOD policy and  practices on readiness with the current process used to prepare CCMRF  units and report mission readiness. We also met with U.S. Joint Forces  Command and U.S. Army Forces command\u2014which are responsible for  providing ready forces to the combatant commands\u2014to discuss the  manpower sourcing process followed for the CCMRF. We obtained  readiness reports for CCMRF units from U.S. Northern Command and  from judgmentally selected units that were part of task force operations\u2014 which contains most of the specialized capabilities. To determine CCMRF  funding planning and the linkage of funding to mission requirements, we  met with Army and U.S. Northern Command officials to obtain guidance  on the topic and to discuss mission requirements, funding needs, and  sources. We compared funding sources to known CBRNE consequence  management requirements and highlighted areas where funding was not  identified for key activities or areas relevant to unit preparedness. We also  met with the National Guard Bureau and some key units that were  assigned to or soon to be assigned to the CCMRF to discuss their current  capabilities, identified shortfalls, and their approach to mitigating any  identified shortfalls. These units were selected because they belonged to  the task force that would provide most of the specialized CBRNE  capabilities that reside in the CCMRF.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2008 through July  2009 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Under the Framework, disaster response is tiered;  local government and agencies typically respond immediately after an  incident. When additional resources are required, states may provide  assistance with their own resources or may request assistance from other  states through interstate mutual agreements or the Emergency  Management Assistance Compact. Localities and states usually respond  within the first several hours of a major incident. The federal government  provides assistance to states if they require additional capabilities and  request assistance. In the event of a catastrophic incident, such as one  involving CBRNE, the framework also calls for federal response partners  to anticipate the need for their capabilities before their assistance is  requested. The framework lists 15 emergency support functions and  designates federal lead agencies in areas such as search and rescue, public  health and medical services, and transportation. DOD is a supporting  agency for all 15 emergency support functions but is the primary agency  only for search and rescue and public works and engineering. Additional  tools to guide response efforts are provided by The National Preparedness  Guidelines, including National Planning Scenarios, Target Capability and  Universal Target Lists, and national priorities.", "DOD has created significant capabilities that could be used to augment a  federal CBRNE response. It also contributes to the organization, training,  and equipping of several other state military units focused on consequence  management.

The CCMRFs are not whole units by  themselves. They are a collection of geographically separated DOD  capabilities and units across the military services and consist of such  existing specialized capabilities as the U.S. Marine Corps\u2019 Chemical  Biological Incident Response Force as well as general capabilities, such as  transportation units. Although the CCMRF is intended to be about 4,500  personnel in size, the size of the force that would deploy in support of an  actual incident could be modified based on the size of the incident.

The directive also called for  the development of strategic plans, concepts of operations plans, and  operations plans that would be integrated at the federal, regional, state,  and local levels. DHS has grouped the 15 national planning scenarios on  which preparedness plans are to be based into 8 scenario sets, of which 5  are CBRNE-related.

The approval of the CBRNE plans required under  the directive (see table 2 below) would be a step toward unifying and  integrating the nation\u2019s planning efforts. For example, for each National  Planning Scenario, a strategic guidance statement is intended to establish  the nation\u2019s strategic priorities and national objectives and to describe an  envisioned end-state. Strategic guidance statements will have  corresponding strategic plans, which are intended to define roles,  authorities, responsibilities, and mission-essential tasks.

For the first 3 years, DOD did not regularly  assign units to the CCMRF mission, and this decreased DOD\u2019s ability to  actually field any of the CCMRFs within the timelines it had established. In  October 2008 DOD sourced the first CCMRF, primarily with active force  units. A second CCMRF, comprised primarily of reserve units, will assume  the mission in October 2009 and a third in October 2010. In the absence of  national guidance suggesting what level of response capability DOD  should have available within a specified time frame, DOD\u2019s plans use a  phased deployment to allow the CCMRF to be able to provide  consequence management support to civilian authorities within 48-96  hours of being notified of an CBRNE incident. The earlier phases of the  deployment will provide the lifesaving capabilities. However, multiple  DOD estimates for some of the more catastrophic scenarios, such as a  nuclear detonation, have identified significant gaps between the time  certain life saving and other capabilities would be needed and DOD\u2019s  planned response times. For example, victims of a nuclear attack would  require decontamination, which medical experts have established must be  provided within as soon as possible after exposure. If DOD adheres to its  planned response times in such a scenario, the capabilities of early  responders such as local police and fire departments would likely be  overwhelmed before DOD arrived at the incident site. NORTHCOM\u2019s  assessment  and other DOD estimates demonstrated that, for a number of  capabilities, DOD\u2019s response would not be timely. Table 3 shows one  estimate of the potential shortfall in decontamination capabilities that  could result.", "The NORTHCOM capability-based assessment similarly suggests that  without a national, risk-based determination of DOD\u2019s share of the federal  capability requirements, DOD will be unable to determine whether its  planned response times should be adjusted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Planned Force May Lack Sufficient Capacity in Some Key Capabilities Needed for Catastrophic Incidents", "paragraphs": ["In addition to timeliness issues, DOD\u2019s planned force has limited quantities  of some of the needed life saving capabilities, such as medical and  decontamination services.

The CCMRF would be  able to provide only a small portion of the necessary capability. Although a  CCMRF is estimated, under optimal circumstances, to be capable of  decontaminating several thousand people per day, some estimates project  that the gap between needed decontamination capabilities and what local,  state, and other entities could provide would be tens of thousands. DOD  recognizes that it may need additional units to augment the CCMRF, and it  has made some tentative estimates. However, DOD has not developed  contingency plans designating specific units to augment the CCMRF.  Unless these units are identified in advance and trained for the mission,  they may be unable to deploy rapidly. Without clear plans aligning CCMRF  objectives with the projected need for response capabilities and clearly  delineating national expectations for timely response, neither DOD nor  other entities involved in incident response can be certain that the  CCMRFs will be able to respond adequately to mitigate the consequences  of a catastrophic CBRNE incident."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Faces Challenges in Adhering to Its Strategy for Sourcing the CCMRFS with Available Units", "paragraphs": ["In sourcing its 3 CCMRFs, DOD has encountered challenges in  implementing an approach that could enhance unit availability and  training and readiness oversight for forces that are not assigned to  NORTHCOM. DOD originally intended the CCMRF to be comprised  entirely of federal active military forces, but the two follow-on CCMRFs  will be sourced with large numbers of National Guard and Army Reserve  units. The demands of ongoing overseas operations have led DOD to draw  more and more heavily on Guard and Reserve forces to fulfill civil support  functions. Because National Guard units have responsibilities in their  respective states, a competition for resources issue may arise between  DOD and the states. For example, while governors may need the same  capabilities within the state or to support mutual assistance agreements  with other states as would be needed to support a CCMRF, there is no  clear understanding between the governors and DOD to ensure that these  units will be available if they are needed for a federal mission. Moreover,  elements from a single unit can be spread over many states, further  complicating the task of coordinating between DOD and each of the states.  For example, one Army National Guard aviation company belonging to the  CCMRF has elements in Arkansas, Florida, and Alabama. Three different  states would be required to make these elements available to form the  company. The potential rapid deployment mission of the CCMRF makes it  imperative that specific agreements be reached. However, the agreements  that have been reached to date are general in nature and do not specify  how states are to ensure that Guard units will be available for a CCMRF  deployment.", "Similar issues arise with the Army Reserve. The training demands of the  CCMRF mission have caused DOD to authorize additional training days,  but according to Army Reserve officials, reservists cannot be compelled to  attend training events beyond their annual training requirement. They  stated that, as a result, units must rely on the voluntary participation of  their personnel for training beyond the requirement, which reduces their  assurance that these personnel will be available for other necessary  CCMRF training. For example, one reserve company was unable to fulfill  all aspects of its mission requirements because of low participation at a  training event. Unit officials stated that some of the unit\u2019s members had  school or work obligations that conflicted with this training. Moreover,  reserve unit officials stated that, unlike active unit officials, they cannot  restrict the personal travel of unit members to ensure that they will be  available if they are needed to support an unexpected federal CBRNE  incident response. These challenges to sourcing the CCMRF increase the  risk that DOD\u2019s ability to effectively respond to one or more major  domestic CBRNE incidents will be compromised. That risk can be  mitigated by plans that integrate the active and reserve component  portions of the CCMRF and agreements between DOD and the states on  the availability of National Guard units and the duty status under which  they would respond to a major incident requiring federal forces.", "DOD\u2019s decision to change its approach to how NORTHCOM will routinely  interact with units designated for the CCMRF will present additional  challenges. In 2008, DOD\u2019s sourcing approach was to assign the first  CCMRF (primarily active forces) to NORTHCOM and allocate the  remaining two CCMRFs (mix of Guard and Army Reserve) to  NORTHCOM. Beginning in October 2009, DOD will allocate the units  from all three CCMRFs to NORTHCOM, rather than assigning them to the  NORTHCOM commander outright. As a result, despite the fact that  NORTHCOM\u2019s commander is responsible for commanding the federal  military domestic CBRNE response in the continental United States,  NORTHCOM will have no CBRNE forces under its direct control. There  are advantages to assigning forces directly to NORTHCOM. For example,  the command would have direct authority over the units\u2019 day-to-day  activities, including training and exercise schedules, and would be better  able to monitor readiness. Additionally, there would be fewer  administrative steps required for the NORTHCOM commander to activate  and deploy the CCMRF in the event of an incident. This would be crucial  for deploying the critical initial response elements of the overall force.  Under allocation, while DOD\u2019s current approach would provide  NORTHCOM with authority over units while they are participating in  scheduled NORTHCOM training events, NORTHCOM would have to  coordinate with multiple commands to obtain participation from these  units. Current guidance states that other commands should make their  units available for scheduled NORTHCOM exercises \u201cto the greatest  extent possible.\u201d However, NORTHCOM cannot always be assured that  units will be available for these exercises. In addition, NORTHCOM  remains uncertain about the extent to which it will have oversight of  CCMRF units\u2019 day-to-day training activities and be able to confirm that  these units are ready to perform their mission even when they are under  the authority of another command."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Actions on CCMRF Readiness and Training and the Impact of Current Deployments", "paragraphs": ["DOD has taken a number of actions in the past year to improve the  readiness of its CCMRF units.

Before designated units assume the CBRNE mission,  they must be certified by the military services to be trained to perform that  mission. However, there is no requirement to provide these units with a  full force tactical field training exercise. While units conduct this type of  training prior to an overseas deployment, and NORTHCOM and Joint  Force Land Component Command (JFLCC) training officials have  discussed the desirability of such an exercise, the first CCMRF units have  not received this kind of training.

Deployment readiness  exercises are important, because they test units\u2019 abilities to ascertain how  quickly staff can be notified and assembled, equipment prepared and  loaded, and both staff and equipment moved to the designated point of  departure.

While DOD has identified  CCMRF as a high priority mission, competing demands associated with  follow-on missions may distract from a unit\u2019s focus on the domestic  mission. For example, Army units are frequently given the CCMRF mission  when they return from an overseas deployment. Because these units are at  the beginning of the \u201creset\u201d phase of the Army Force Generation  (ARFORGEN) cycle, they often lack personnel and equipment. Although  the Army attempts to accelerate the fill of personnel and equipment to  these units, some units may not have received their personnel and  equipment in sufficient time to allow them to meet all of the requirements  of the CBRNE mission before they assume it. These training and force  rotation issues have prevented DOD from providing the kind of stability to  the force that would allow units to build cohesiveness. While DOD\u2019s goal  has been to assign units for at least 12 months and to set standard start  and end dates for each rotation, several critical units have been unable to  complete their 1-year CCMRF rotations for fiscal year 2009. As a result, the  replacement units who have finished out these rotations have missed  important training. For example, the headquarters units for the aviation  and medical task forces rotated out of the mission after only 4 and 6  months, respectively, because of competing priorities. Because key  leaders from units of the entire force attend a mission rehearsal exercise  prior to mission assumption, the replacement of these units after only a  few months negated much of the value that was gained from these three  task forces working together and precluded the replacement task force  leaders from having the same opportunity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CCMRF Requirements Development, Funding, and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["DOD is making progress in identifying and providing funding and  equipment to meet CCMRF mission requirements; however, its efforts to  identify total program requirements have not been completed, and its  approach to providing program funding has been fragmented, because  funding responsibilities for CCMRF-related costs are dispersed throughout  DOD and are not subject to central oversight."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CCMRF Mission Requirements Have Not Been Fully Developed", "paragraphs": ["The units initially designated for the CCMRF mission did not have fully  developed funding and equipment requirements. In addition, the recent  NORTHCOM Homeland Defense and Civil Support Capabilities-Based  Assessment highlighted a number of systemic capability gaps that need to  be addressed and may generate additional funding requirements.  Moreover, other important requirements for this mission have not been  identified and funded. The Joint Forces Land Component Commander  (U.S. Army North\u2014ARNORTH) and the Joint Task Force Civil Support  are responsible for developing and approving service-specific equipment  unique to the CCMRF\u2019s Joint Mission Essential Tasks. However, to date,  mission essential equipment requirements have not been fully developed.  While some equipment requirement lists have been developed and are  being reviewed by NORTHCOM, equipping officials said that lists have not  been developed for non-standard equipment that units may need in order  to support civil authorities in a CBRNE environment. As a result, some  fiscal year 2008 units have determined requirements based on their own  independent mission analyses. Unit officials stated that filling some of the  needs they identified\u2014such as the need for non-standard communications  equipment that is compatible with civilian equipment\u2014was difficult  because the units lacked a documented requirement for their planned  acquisition. In addition, the review process did not always include the  command organizations that are responsible for the mission. Thus,  decisions on what to buy and in what quantity were not consistently vetted  to ensure standardization in equipping various units. ARNORTH officials  stated that they were in the process of developing mission essential  equipment lists and hope to have them completed in time for the next  rotation, which begins in October 2009."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Extent of Dedicated Funds for Some CCMRF Training Impacts Mission", "paragraphs": ["In the spring of 2008, sourcing priority for the CCMRF mission increased  substantially within the department, and funding was provided for specific  aspects of the mission. For example, funding was provided for  NORTHCOM\u2019s training program\u2014which totals more than $21 million  annually\u2014for three major exercises associated with the CCMRFs for fiscal  year 2010 and beyond, and the Army Reserve has planned funds of more  than $37 million for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to support additional full- time personnel and training days that have been authorized to support the  CCMRF mission. In addition, while the military services have not planned  funds for equipment specifically for the CCMRF mission, equipment has  been purchased with funds left over from past Global War on Terrorism  deployments. In other cases, purchase requests for certain equipment  were denied by administrative parent commands because, unit officials  believed, the equipment was considered non-critical by reviewing officials.  Moreover, units must fund their CCMRF training activities from their  operations and maintenance accounts, which were developed and  approved months before units knew they would be assigned to the  CCMRF. According to unit officials, because they do not have dedicated  funds for CCMRF in their budgets, they sometimes must take money from  other sources to meet what they believe are their highest priorities for the  CCMRF mission. Also according to these officials, while the lack of  planned funds for the CCMRF has been mitigated to some extent by the  mission\u2019s high priority level, they have found it necessary to curtail or  cancel some desirable training because funding was unavailable. Army  officials told us that if funding shortfalls develop because units lack  sufficient funds to conduct both CCMRF and follow-on mission training,  units can request additional funds from the Army. However, unless units  assess their total funding requirement for the CCMRF and their other  designated mission and receive funding based on both missions, CCMRF  units may be at risk of not having enough funding to conduct all of their  CCMRF training. This, in turn, puts units at risk of not being fully prepared  if they are needed to respond to an incident.", "CCMRF units may face more acute funding issues as the United States  begins drawing down in Iraq and as military supplemental funding, such as  funding for Global War on Terrorism, is reduced. Because DOD has  assigned funding responsibilities across the department and because much  of the funding for the CCMRF is coming from existing operations and  maintenance accounts, DOD lacks visibility across the department over  the total funding requirements for this mission. Without an overarching  approach to developing requirements and providing funding, and a  centralized focal point to ensure that all requirements have been identified  and fully funded, DOD\u2019s ability to carry out this high-priority homeland  security mission in an efficient and effective manner is at risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Departments of Defense and of Homeland Security an  extensive briefing on our preliminary findings.
