The block grant was reauthorized under the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, and is currently authorized through September 30, 2013. To inform a potential reauthorization of TANF, GAO was asked to discuss its key findings on TANF performance and oversight from its previous work and identify potential options that would address these findings. This report discusses issues and options in three selected areas: (1) TANF's role in providing cash assistance to low-income families, (2) measurement of TANF work participation, and (3) information on states' use of TANF funds. In addition to summarizing its previous work on these issues, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and agency documents as well as transcripts from relevant congressional hearings from 2009 through 2012 to identify potential options.

GAO noted in 2010 that 87 percent of the dramatic decline from 1995 through 2005 in the number of families receiving cash assistance was due a decline in eligible families participating in TANF, rather than increased incomes. Changes to state TANF programs, such as mandatory work requirements and lower benefits, account in part for this decline. Relatively modest caseload increases in recent years nationwide, as well as decreases in some states, have raised questions about TANF's responsiveness to changing economic conditions. GAO also reported in 2011 that the composition of the TANF caseload has changed, with about 40 percent of cases now comprised of children only, with the adult not receiving benefits, and little known nationwide about state policies for aiding these children. Potential options to better understand TANF's role as a cash assistance program may include: improving information on the extent to which states provide cash assistance to eligible low-income families, and requiring states to include more information--for example in TANF state plans submitted to the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)--on features such as benefit amounts and services provided.", "The current approach used to measure the extent to which states engage TANF recipients in work activities as defined by federal law has limitations. GAO reported in 2010 and 2011 that most states relied on several factors allowed in law, including credits for caseload reductions, to reduce the percentage of families they needed to engage in work to meet their work participation rate requirements. GAO also reported that current policies may be discouraging states from serving some families who are not \"work-ready\" through TANF, such as those with significant barriers to employment or complex needs. Potential options to address these issues may include: eliminating, limiting, or modifying some of the credits states may use to reduce their work participation rate requirements; adjusting requirements to better ensure states engage those not work-ready; and developing an additional or alternate set of measures that focus on employment outcomes. However, more information may be needed to assess the potential impacts of any changes to work participation requirements.", "Limitations exist in the information available to assess states' use of federal TANF funds and state expenditures related to minimum state spending requirements under TANF, known as maintenance of effort (MOE) requirements. GAO reported in 2012 that the TANF block grant has evolved into a flexible funding stream that states use to support a broad range of non-cash services, but information requirements for assessing TANF performance have not kept pace with this evolution. For example, there are no reporting requirements mandating performance information specifically on families receiving non-cash services or their outcomes. GAO also reported in 2012 that states have reported increased levels of MOE spending for a variety of reasons, including helping them reduce their work participation rate requirements as allowed by law. Potential options to better understand federal and state TANF spending may include: improving reporting and performance information to encompass the full breadth of states' use of TANF funds, and requiring a review of MOE expenditures used to meet TANF requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations, but rather identifying some potential options that might improve TANF performance, depending on Congress' goals for the program.

The Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of  1996 (PRWORA), which created TANF, ended the Aid to Families with  Dependent Children (AFDC) program that had entitled eligible low-income  families to monthly cash assistance. Instead, Congress has provided  $16.5 billion per year in fixed federal TANF funding to states to operate  their own welfare programs within federal guidelines. This can help cover  the costs of cash benefits, administrative expenses, and services  primarily targeted to needy families; the amount does not vary according  to the number of cash assistance recipients, referred to as the TANF  caseload. States are also required to maintain a specified level of their  own past welfare spending to receive all of their TANF funds. At the  federal level, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  is responsible for overseeing TANF programs. From fiscal years 1997 to  2011, the most recent year with data available, the federal government  and states have spent nearly $434 billion for TANF, about 60 percent of  which were federal funds. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA)reauthorized TANF, and the block grant is currently authorized through  September 30, 2013.", "This federal-state partnership has undergone multiple changes, including  a dramatic drop in the number of families receiving monthly cash  assistance benefits, legislative actions that were generally expected to  strengthen TANF work requirements, and new trends in states\u2019 TANF  spending. In recent years, several GAO reports and testimonies have  presented findings on TANF performance and oversight in these areas  (see Related Products appendix). To inform deliberations on a potential  extension or reauthorization of TANF, you asked us to discuss key  findings related to TANF performance and oversight from our previous  work and identify potential options that would address these findings. This  report discusses issues and potential options in our selected areas: (1)  TANF\u2019s role in providing cash assistance to low-income families, (2)  measuring TANF work participation, and (3) information on states\u2019 use of  TANF funds.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed GAO reports published since TANF  became effective in 1997 and summarized findings related to TANF cash  assistance, work participation requirements, and TANF spending trends.  These reports generally reflected a variety of methodologies, including  national surveys of state TANF administrators, analyses of state data and  national statistical surveys, and interviews and visits to selected state and  local TANF program staff. These reports are cited throughout this report.  In addition, we reviewed recommendations we had made previously that  have not been implemented, but have continued relevance to current  circumstances. We also reviewed transcripts from relevant congressional  hearings from 2009 through 2012, which provided information on issues  and options identified by members of Congress and other witnesses in  addition to GAO. This information helped us identify potential options in  these areas that would address findings in our previous reports and would  not require changes to TANF purposes or the current financing structure  established by law. In our discussion of potential options, we included  considerations, such as advantages and disadvantages of  implementation and possible unintended consequences, as appropriate.  We used GAO guidance on performance measurement, GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, the  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), and the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 as criteria to help identify potential  options and considerations for implementation. In addition, we selected  three individuals with TANF expertise, including researchers and  representatives from advocacy organizations, that represent a range of  viewpoints to provide their perspectives on our work. We also consulted  with cognizant GAO staff, reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and  agency documents, and spoke with HHS officials. The listed options are  not intended to be exhaustive. In this report, we are not recommending or  endorsing the adoption of any particular policy option or package of  options.

States generally determine cash  assistance benefit levels and eligibility requirements for low-income  families seeking support under state welfare programs. When states set  their TANF cash assistance benefit levels, the amount a family receives  depends, in part, on who is in the assistance unit. An assistance unit is a  group of people living together, often related by blood or some other legal  relationship. States can exclude adults from the assistance unit but still  allow the children to receive some assistance. In these child-only cases,  the adults in the family are excluded from the assistance unit and are  generally not considered when calculating the benefit amount. States are  also generally allowed to spend TANF funds on other services as long as  these services support TANF purposes, which are: (1) to provide  assistance to needy families so that children may be cared for in their  own homes or homes of relatives; (2) to end dependence of needy  parents on government benefits by promoting job preparation, work, and  marriage; (3) to prevent and reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancies; and (4)  to encourage two-parent families.", "Federal law governing TANF generally refers to the term \u201cassistance\u201d and does not  make distinctions between different forms of aid funded by TANF. However, HHS draws  distinctions between \u201cassistance\u201d and \u201cnonassistance.\u201d HHS regulations define assistance  to include cash, payments, vouchers, or other forms of benefits designed to meet families\u2019  ongoing, basic needs. 45 C.F.R. \u00a7 260.31.

HHS uses the term nonassistance to refer to TANF expenditures that fulfill  one of the four TANF purposes, but do not meet this regulatory definition. In our report, we  refer to HHS\u2019s definition of assistance as \u201ccash assistance\u201d and its reference to  nonassistance as \u201cnon-cash services.\u201d focused on participants gaining employment and work-related skills.  States that do not meet minimum work participation rates may be  penalized by a reduction in their block grant. Several factors may help  states meet their work participation rates, such as reductions in their cash  assistance caseloads and spending state funds for TANF purposes above  the required MOE amount. In addition, states are limited in the amount of  time they can provide federal cash assistance to families. In general,  states may not use federal TANF funds to provide cash assistance to a  family that includes an adult who has received cash assistance for 5  years or more.other TANF-funded services.", "Such time limits do not apply to child-only cases or to  Federal law sets forth the basic TANF reporting requirements for states.  For example, states are required to provide information and report to HHS  on their use of TANF funds in TANF state plans outlining how each state  intends to run its TANF program (generally filed every 2 years), quarterly  reports on demographic and economic circumstances and work activities  of families receiving cash assistance, quarterly financial reports providing  data on federal TANF and state MOE expenditures, and annual reports  on state programs funded with MOE funds, among other things. HHS  reviews state information and reports to ensure that states meet the  conditions outlined in federal law. For example, HHS uses the reported  information to determine whether states are meeting work participation  rates.", "In creating the TANF block grant, Congress emphasized the importance  of state flexibility, and restricted HHS's regulatory authority over the states  except to the extent expressly provided in the law. For example, HHS  generally has limited authority to impose new TANF reporting  requirements on states unless directed by Congress, so many changes to  the types of information that states are required to report would require  congressional action.", "As a fixed federal funding stream, the federal TANF block grant amount  does not automatically adjust as caseloads or needs change, and the  level of the federal grant has not been adjusted for inflation since the  program\u2019s creation in 1996. States may reserve federal TANF funds  under a \u201crainy day fund\u201d for use in future years, providing states additional  flexibility in their budget decisions. In fact, we reported in 2010 that many  states had some TANF reserves that they drew down to meet increasing  needs in the recent economic downturn. The federal law that  established TANF also created a TANF Contingency Fund that states  could access in times of economic distress. Similarly, during the recent  economic recession, the federal government created a $5 billion  Emergency Contingency Fund for state TANF programs through the  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, available in fiscal  years 2009 and 2010.

The law does not explicitly state that poverty  reduction is a TANF purpose, and there are generally no federal  requirements or benchmarks as to eligibility criteria or benefit amounts, or  on the percentage of low-income families who are to be covered by a  state\u2019s TANF program.", "When states implemented TANF during fiscal year 1997, a monthly  average of 3.9 million families were receiving cash assistance. This  number declined by over half within the first 5 years of TANF. Since that  time, the average number of families receiving cash assistance each  month has remained well below the initial number of 3.9 million families,  and averaged about 1.9 million families in 2011. Our previous work shows  that although TANF caseloads have declined, many families with incomes  still low enough to receive aid did not do so for a variety of reasons. In a  2010 report, we assessed changes in the number of families eligible for  and receiving cash assistance under AFDC and TANF from 1995 to 2005,  the most recent data available at that time. The strong economy of the  1990s, TANF's focus on work, and other factors such as additional  funding for child care and expansions in the Earned Income Tax Credit  contributed to increases in the share of single mothers working and fewer  families receiving TANF cash assistance.", "While some families worked more, had higher incomes, and were not  eligible for cash assistance, others had income that left them still eligible;  however, many of these eligible families were not participating in the  program. According to our estimates, the majority\u201487 percent\u2014of that  caseload decline can be explained by the decline in eligible families  participating in the program, in part because of changes to state welfare  programs. These changes include mandatory work requirements;  changes to application procedures; lower benefits; policies such as  lifetime limits on assistance; diversion strategies such as providing one- time, non-recurring benefits instead of monthly cash assistance to  families facing temporary hardships; and sanctions for non-compliance,  according to a review of the research. Among eligible families who did not  receive cash assistance, 11 percent did not work, did not receive means- tested disability benefits, and had very low incomes (see fig. 1). We have  not updated this analysis; however, some recent research shows that this  potentially vulnerable group may be growing.", "We have also reported in 2012 that during and after the recent significant  recession, caseloads increased in most states, and the overall national  increase totaled about 15 percent from fiscal years 2008 to 2011. This  has been the first test of TANF\u2014with its capped block grant structure\u2014 during severe economic times. We noted that almost 40 percent of  households with children and income below 200 percent of the federal  poverty threshold that had exhausted Unemployment Insurance benefits  received aid through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (SNAP)(formerly known as food stamps); however, less than 10 percent  received TANF cash assistance in 2009. The relatively modest increase  in TANF caseloads\u2014and decreases in some states\u2014has raised  questions about the responsiveness of TANF to changing economic  conditions. After initial declines in the poverty rate among children\u2014 from 21 percent in 1995 (prior to TANF\u2019s implementation) to 16 percent in  2000\u2014the rate had risen to 22 percent in 2011, according to the Bureau  of the Census.", "In our recent work, we identified several actions that states have taken to  address increased needs while also experiencing budgetary distress.  These include drawing down TANF reserves and accessing TANF  Contingency Funds. In addition, nearly all states received a combined  total of $4.3 billion of the $5 billion TANF Emergency Contingency Fund,  created by Congress under the American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act of 2009, in fiscal years 2009 through 2011. States used these funds  in part to create or expand subsidized employment programs.", "Setting eligibility criteria and benefit levels are ways that states may  manage the costs of their TANF cash assistance programs, directly  affecting the number of families served and the amount of assistance they  receive. 2012 report cited tension between the need to provide cash assistance  and the need to provide other state services during the recent economic  downturn.", "Eligibility criteria and benefit amounts for cash assistance can vary greatly by state. For  example, in Arkansas, as of July 2011, for a family of three, earnings had to be equal to or  below $279 per month in order to be eligible for cash assistance, and their maximum  benefit amount was $204. In contrast, in California, as of July 2011, a family of three\u2019s  income had to be equal to or below $1,224 per month to be eligible for cash assistance,  and their maximum benefit amount was $714.

Regarding  information on TANF coverage of low-income families, in our 2005 report  on several means-tested programs including TANF, we noted that having  participation or coverage rate information is an important tool for program  managers and policymakers, even among programs that were not  intended to serve everyone eligible for program benefits.

As the number of TANF cases with  an adult in the assistance unit has declined significantly, child-only cases  have become more prominent.

Because of the dramatic declines in the number of families receiving cash  assistance after TANF implementation, caseload reduction credits  effectively eliminated work participation rate requirements in some states.  For example, we reported that in fiscal year 2006, 18 states had caseload  reductions that were at least 50 percent, which reduced their required  work participation rates to 0. We noted that state caseload declines have  generally been smaller after DRA changed the base year for measuring  caseload reductions from fiscal year 1995 to fiscal year 2005, among  other things.However, many states are still able to use caseload  declines to help them lower their required work participation rates. For  example, for the most recent data available in fiscal year 2009, 38 of the  45 states that met their required work participation rates for all TANF  families did so in part because of their caseload declines (see fig. 2).", "Additionally, we reported that while states\u2019 caseload reduction credits  before DRA were based primarily on their caseload declines, after DRA,  states\u2019 spending of their own funds on TANF-related services also  became a factor in some states\u2019 credits.

In  addition to the caseload reduction credits and excess MOE discussed  above, we reported that some states have made changes to their TANF  programs that may affect which families are counted in their work  participation rates, such as providing some families assistance in non- TANF programs, discussed in the next section. Given these various  factors, we have noted that the work participation rate does not allow for  clear comparisons across state TANF programs or comparisons of  individual state programs over time. This is the same conclusion we  reached in our 2005 report that recommended changes to improve this  measure of states\u2019 performance. In that report, we found differences  across states that contributed to an inconsistent measurement of work  participation.

States may  generally only count a family\u2019s participation in job readiness assistance,  which can include mental health and substance abuse treatment, towards  the work participation rate for six weeks in a year. A 2012 MDRC study  conducted for HHS suggested that combining work-focused strategies  with treatment or services may be more promising than using either  strategy alone, especially for people with disabilities and behavioral  health problems. Additionally, we have reported that some states find  the restrictions on the amount of time they are allowed to count vocational  educational training towards the work participation rate to be a challenge.  State TANF administrators have expressed concerns that the 12-month  lifetime limit on vocational educational training may be insufficient for  TANF participants to progress to higher-wage employment that will  prevent them from needing assistance in the future. Officials we  interviewed more recently also noted that the restrictions may not match  the needs of workers who lost jobs during the recession, who may require  more education or retraining to find a new job. Finally, we have reported  that many states choose to provide cash assistance to two-parent families  outside of TANF. State officials have told us that two-parent families often  have as many or more challenges as single parents, and states\u2019 work  participation rate requirement for two-parent families is 90 percent minus  any caseload reduction credit the state receives.

For example, introducing an employment credit would constitute a  significant change in the way states may meet work participation  requirements, but the effects this approach would have on participation  rates and state TANF programs are unknown. Additionally, it is difficult to  anticipate ways that the potential options may interact with one another.  We have reported that allowing states to test approaches can foster  innovation and help identify possible unintended consequences.  Members of Congress have raised concerns about a 2012 announcement  by HHS that the agency would use waiver authority to allow states to test  various strategies, policies, and procedures designed to improve  employment outcomes for needy families.remains controversial and the House of Representatives passed a bill in   The potential for waivers  2013 aimed at preventing HHS from implementing them. According to  HHS, as of February 25, 2013, no state had formally submitted a request  for a waiver related to TANF work requirements. Still, state experience  with many of the potential options outlined above could provide valuable  information to policymakers about the effects of changes if they choose to  alter the work participation rate as it is currently implemented. If  Congress wanted to make changes, it could set parameters for testing  some approaches through pilots in selected states, for example, to gather  additional information for considering changes to TANF that would  maintain or improve its focus on work and self-sufficiency."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Information Available to Assess Recent Trends in TANF Spending is Limited", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Performance Information for Non-Cash Services is Incomplete", "paragraphs": ["We reported in 2012 that the TANF block grant has evolved into a flexible  funding stream that states use to support a broad range of allowable  services, but the accountability framework currently in place in federal law   Declining cash  and regulations has not kept pace with this evolution.assistance caseloads freed up federal TANF and state MOE funds for  states, and over time, states shifted spending to other forms of aid, which  we refer to as non-cash services. Non-cash services can include any  other services meeting TANF purposes, such as job preparation activities,  child care and transportation assistance for parents who are employed,  out-of-wedlock pregnancy prevention activities, and child welfare  services, as well as some cash benefits such as non-recurring short-term  benefits and refundable tax credits to low-income working families. In  fiscal year 1997, nationwide, states spent about 23 percent of federal  TANF and state MOE funds on non-cash services. In contrast, states  spent almost 64 percent of federal TANF and state MOE funds for these  purposes in fiscal year 2011. However, there are no reporting  requirements mandating performance information specifically on families  receiving non-cash services or their outcomes. There is also little  information related to TANF\u2019s role in filling needs in other areas like child  welfare, even though this has become a more prominent spending area  for TANF funds in many states. We reported that while states prepare  state plans and expenditure reports that individually provide some  information on non-cash services, even when considered together, these  do not provide a complete picture on state goals and strategies for uses  of TANF funds. For instance, we noted that state plans currently provide  limited descriptions of a state\u2019s goals and strategies for its TANF block  grant, including how non-cash services fit into these goals and strategies,  and the amount of information in each plan can vary by state. We  reported that HHS is taking some steps to improve expenditure reports  from states. Still, we concluded that without more information that  encompasses the full breadth of states\u2019 uses of TANF funds, Congress  will not be able to fully assess how funds are being used, including who is  receiving services or what is being achieved.

We  reported in 2012 that MOE is now playing an expanded role in TANF  programs.

We reported that several  reasons account for the increase during this period:", "Many states claimed additional MOE to help them meet the work  participation rate requirements, as discussed above.", "During the recession states accessed TANF Contingency Funds,  which required them to meet a higher MOE level, and Emergency  Contingency Funds, which required them to have had increases in  certain expenditures or in the number of families receiving cash  assistance.", "An interim rule temporarily broadened the types of activities on which  states could spend state funds and be countable for MOE purposes.", "We noted that this greater emphasis on the use of MOE increases the  importance of understanding whether effective accountability measures  are in place to ensure MOE funds are in keeping with requirements.", "These recent increases in state MOE have raised questions about how to  ensure that state expenditures represent a sustained commitment to  spending in line with TANF purposes. We noted in 2012 that if MOE  claims do not actually reflect maintaining or increasing service levels, low- income families and children may not be getting the assistance they need  and federal funds may not be used in the most efficient manner.  However, the recent increases in state MOE spending which states have  used to access contingency funds and meet work participation rate  requirements may not represent new state spending. For example,  officials in one state told us in 2012 that they began claiming MOE  expenditures for an existing state early-childhood education program for  needy families in fiscal year 2008. Officials in two other states said they  hired consultants during the economic downturn to identify opportunities  to claim MOE expenditures from existing state programs that were not  originally used for TANF purposes. For example, one state found that  many of its programs could be counted under TANF as \u201cprevention of out- of-wedlock pregnancies\u201d so it claimed funds spent on these programs as  MOE.", "Additionally, we reported in 2012 that many states have recently begun to  count third party nongovernmental expenditures to help meet TANF MOE  spending requirements. In addition to its own spending, a state may  count toward its MOE certain in-kind or cash expenditures by third  parties\u2014such as nongovernmental organizations\u2014as long as the  expenditures meet other MOE requirements, including those related to  eligible families and allowable activities. We reported that between fiscal  years 2007 and 2011, about half of all states reported counting third party  nongovernmental expenditures toward MOE in at least one year, and 17  states reported that they intend to count these expenditures in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Potential Options", "paragraphs": ["Potential options are available to provide additional information on non- cash services and state MOE expenditures that may be useful for making  decisions regarding the TANF block grant and better ensure  accountability for TANF funds (see table 3).

However, it is clear that TANF  has evolved beyond a traditional cash assistance program and now also  serves as a source of funding for a broad range of services states provide  to eligible families. The past 16 years has shown many changes in how  states use TANF funds and the populations they serve.
