Robust federal security programs are critically important to properly protect this information and the privacy of individuals. GAO was asked to testify on VA's information security program, ways that agencies can prevent improper disclosures of personal information, and issues concerning notifications of privacy breaches. In preparing this testimony, GAO drew on its previous reports and testimonies, as well as on expert opinion provided in congressional testimony and other sources."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["For many years, significant concerns have been raised about VA's information security--particularly its lack of a robust information security program, which is vital to avoiding the compromise of government information, including sensitive personal information. Both GAO and the department's inspector general have reported recurring weaknesses in such areas as access controls, physical security, and segregation of incompatible duties. The department has taken steps to address these weaknesses, but these have not been sufficient to establish a comprehensive information security program. For example, it is still developing plans to complete a security incident response program to monitor suspicious activity and cyber alerts, events, and incidents. Without an established and implemented security program, the department will continue to have major challenges in protecting its information and information systems from security breaches such as the one it recently experienced. In addition to establishing robust security programs, agencies can take a number of actions to help guard against the possibility that databases of personally identifiable information are inadvertently compromised. A key step is to develop a privacy impact assessment--an analysis of how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed--whenever information technology is used to process personal information. In addition, agencies can take more specific practical measures aimed at preventing data breaches, including limiting the collection of personal information, limiting the time that such data are retained, limiting access to personal information and training personnel accordingly, and considering the use of technological controls such as encryption when data need to be stored on portable devices. When data breaches do occur, notification of those affected and/or the public has clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to protect themselves from identity theft. Although existing laws do not require agencies to notify the public of data breaches, such notification is consistent with agencies' responsibility to inform individuals about how their information is being accessed and used, and it promotes accountability for privacy protection. That said, care is needed in defining appropriate criteria for triggering notification. Notices should be coordinated with law enforcement to avoid impeding ongoing investigations, and in order to be effective, notices should be easy to understand. Because of the possible adverse impact of a compromise of personal information, it is critical that people fully understand the threat and their options for addressing it. Strong leadership, sustained management commitment and effort, disciplined processes, and consistent oversight will be needed for VA to address its persistent, long-standing control weaknesses."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for inviting us to participate in today\u2019s hearing on  information security and privacy at the Department of Veterans  Affairs (VA).

Virtually all federal operations are  supported by automated systems and electronic data, without which  agencies would find it difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their  missions and account for their resources. The following examples  show the broad array of federal operations and assets placed at risk  by information security weaknesses:  \u25cf  Resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost  or stolen.   \u25cf  Computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to  launch attacks on others.   \u25cf  Personal information, such as taxpayer data, social security records,  and medical records, and proprietary business information could be  inappropriately disclosed, browsed, or copied for purposes of  identity theft, industrial espionage, or other types of crime.   \u25cf  Critical operations, such as those supporting national defense and  emergency services, could be disrupted.   \u25cf  Data could be modified or destroyed for purposes of fraud, theft of  assets, or disruption.  \u25cf  Agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents  that result in diminished confidence in their ability to conduct  operations and fulfill their fiduciary responsibilities.", "The potential disclosure of personal information raise identity theft and privacy concerns.

According to identity theft experts, individuals  whose identities have been stolen can spend months or years and  thousands of dollars clearing their names. Some individuals have  lost job opportunities, been refused loans, or even been arrested fo crimes they did not commit as a result of identity theft. The Feder Trade Commission (FTC) reported in 2005 that identity theft  represented about 40 percent of all the consumer fraud complaints  it received during each of the last 3 calendar years.

Breach  notification is one way that organizations\u2014either in the private  sector or the government\u2014can follow the openness principle and  meet their responsibility for keeping the public informed of how  their personal information is being used and who has access to it.  Equally important, notification is consistent with the principle that  those controlling the collection or use of personal information  should be accountable for taking steps to ensure the implementa of the other principles, such as use limitation and security  safeguards.

In congressional testim ony, the  Federal Trade Commission raised concerns about the thres hold at  which consumers should be notified of a breach, cautioning tha strict a standard could have several negative effects. First,  notification of a breach when there is little or no risk of harm might  create unnecessary concern and confusion. Second, a surfeit of  notices, resulting from notification criteria that are too strict, could  render all such notices less effective, because consumers could  become numb to them and fail to act when risks are truly  significant. Finally, the costs to both individuals and business are  t too  not insignificant and may be worth considering. FTC points out that, in response to a security breach notification, a consumer may ca credit cards, contact credit bureaus to place fraud alerts on credit  files, or obtain a new driver\u2019s license number. These actions cou ld  panies  be time-consuming for the individual and costly for the com involved. Given these potential negative effects, care is clearly  needed in defining appropriate criteria for required breach  notifications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effective Notices Should Pro", "paragraphs": ["Once a determination has been made that a public notice is to be  issued, care must be taken to ensure that it does its job effectively.", "Designing useful, easy-to-understand notices has been cited a in other areas where privacy notices are required by law,  challenge  such as in the financial industry\u2014where businesses are required by  the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act to send notices to consumers ab out  their privacy practices\u2014and in the federal government, which is  required by the Privacy Act to issue public notices in the Federal  Register about its systems of records containing personal  information. For example, as noted during a public workshop  hosted by the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Privacy Office,  designing easy-to-understand consumer financial privacy notices to  meet Gramm-Leach Bliley Act requirements has been challenging Officials from the FTC and Office of the Comptroller of the  Currency described widespread criticism of these notices\u2014that t were unexpected, too long, filled with legalese, and not  understandable.   .", "If an agency is to notify people of a data breach, it should do so in  such a way that they understand the nature of the threat and what  steps need to be taken to protect themselves against identity theft.  In connection with its state law requiring security breach  notifications, the California Office of Privacy Protection has  published recommended practices for designing and issuing security  breach notices. The office recommends that such notifications  include, among other things,  a general description of what happened;  the type of personal information that was involved;  what steps have been taken to prevent further unauthorized  acquisition of personal information;  the types of assistance to be p free contact telephone number for additional information and  assistance;  rovided to individuals, such as a toll- information on what individuals can do to protect th identity theft, including contact information for the three cred reporting agencies; and  it  information on where individuals can obtain additional information on protection against identity theft, such as the Federal Trade  Commission\u2019s Identity Theft Web site (www.consumer.gov/idtheft).", "The California Office of Privacy Protection also recommends  making notices clear, conspicuous, and helpful by using clear,  simple language and avoiding jargon, and it suggests avoiding using  a standardized format to mitigate the risk that the public will  become complacent about the process.", "The Federal Trade Commission has issued guidance to businesses  on notifying individuals of data breaches that reiterates several key  elements of effective notification\u2014describing clearly what is known about the data compromise, explaining what responses may be  appropriate for the type of information taken, and providing  information and contacts regarding identity theft in general. The  Commission also suggests providing contact information for the law enforcement officer working on the case, as well as encouraging  individuals who discover that their information has been misused to  file a complaint with the Commission.", "Both the state of California and the Federal Trade Commission  recommend consulting with cognizant law-enforcement officers  about an incident before issuing notices to the public. In some  cases, early notification or disclosure of certain facts about an  incident could hamper a law enforcement investigation. For  example, an otherwise unknowing thief could learn of the potential  value of data stored on a laptop computer that was originally stolen  purely for the value of the hardware. Thus it is recommended tha organizations consult with law enforcement regarding the timing  and content of notifications. However, law enforcement  investigations should not necessarily result in lengthy delays in  notification. California\u2019s guidance states that it should not be  necessary for a law enforcement agency to complete an  investigation before notification can be given. t  When providing notifications to the public, organizations should  consider how to ensure that these are easily understood. Various  techniques have been suggested to promote comprehension,  including the concept of \u201clayering.\u201d Layering involves providing  only the most important summary facts up front\u2014often in a  graphical format\u2014followed by one or more lengthier, more  narrative versions in order to ensure that all information is  communicated that needs to be. Multilayering may be an option to achieving an easy-to-understand notice that is still complete.  Similarly, providing context to the notice (explaining to consu why they are receiving the notice and what to do with it) has been found to promote comprehension, as did visual design elem such as a tabular format, large and legible fonts, appropriate space, and simple headings.", "Although these techniques were developed for other kinds of  notices, they can be applied to those informing the public of data  breaches. For example, a multilayered security breach notice could include a brief description of the nature of the security breach, thepotential threat to victims of the incident, and measures to be taken  to protect against identity theft. The notice could provide additional  details about the incident as an attachment or by providing links to  additional information. This would accomplish the purpose of communicating the key details in a brief format, while still providi ng  complete information to those who require it. Given that people maybe adversely affected by a compromise of their personal  information, it is critical that they fully understand the nature of the  threat and the options they have to address it.", "In summary, the recent security breach at VA has highlighted the  importance of implementing effective information security  practices. Long-standing information security control weaknesses at  VA have placed its information systems and information, including  personally identifiable information, at increased risk of misuse and  unauthorized disclosure. Although VA has taken steps to mitigate  previously reported weaknesses, it has not implemented a  comprehensive, integrated information security program, which it  needs in order to effectively manage risks on an ongoing basis.  Much work remains to be done. Only through strong leadership,  sustained management commitment and effort, disciplined  processes, and consistent oversight can VA address its persistent,  long-standing control weaknesses.", "To reduce the likelihood of experiencing such breaches, agencies can take a number of actions that can help guard against the  possibility that databases of personally identifiable information are  inadvertently compromised: strategically, they should ensure that a  robust information security program is in place and that PIAs are  developed. More specific practical measures aimed at preventing  inadvertent data breaches include limiting the collection of pe information, limiting data retention, limiting access to personal  information and training personnel accordingly, and considering  using technological controls such as encryption when data need to  be stored on mobile devices.", "Nevertheless, data breaches can still occur at any time, and whe n  they do, notification to the individuals affected and/or the public h clear benefits, allowing people the opportunity to take steps to   dangers of identity theft. Care is  protect themselves against the needed in defining appropriate criteria if agencies are to be required  to report security breaches to the public. Further, care is also  needed to ensure that notices are useful and easy to understand, so  that they are effective in alerting individuals to actions they may want to take to minimize the risk of identity theft.", "We have previously testified that as Congress considers legisla requiring agencies to notify individuals or the public about security  tion  breaches, it should ensure that specific criteria are defined for  incidents that merit public notification. It may want to consider  creating a two-tier reporting requirement, in which all security  breaches are reported to OMB, and affected individuals are notifiedonly of incidents involving significant risk.
