DOD has taken steps to improve its corrosion prevention and control (CPC) efforts. These efforts include reorganizing the DOD-wide Corrosion Office and instituting Corrosion Executive positions in each of the military departments. In response to the Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying the fiscal year 2010 DOD appropriations bill, GAO evaluated to what extent (1) the Corrosion Executives are involved in preparing CPC project proposals for submission, (2) the Corrosion Office has created a process to review and select projects for funding, and (3) the military departments have validated the return on investment (ROI) for funded projects. GAO also reviewed the process the Corrosion Office uses to determine the CPC activities that it will fund. To carry out this study, GAO observed project selection panel meetings, interviewed corrosion officials, and reviewed documents and project proposals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The acceptance of the military departments' CPC proposals varied relative to the types of projects and nature of review that the military Corrosion Executives required before the proposals were submitted to the Corrosion Office for funding consideration. DOD guidance provides that Corrosion Executives coordinate CPC actions, including submitting corrosion project opportunities. Prior to submitting the proposals for a preliminary evaluation by the Corrosion Office's project selection panel, Army and Navy Corrosion Executives and staffs reviewed proposal summaries and provided feedback to the authors. The Air Force did not perform a review that included pre-submission feedback. Later, during a preliminary evaluation, the Corrosion Office's project selection panel determined that a much higher percentage of Army and Navy proposals were acceptable than those submitted by the Air Force. A selection panel member told us that because the Air Force did not perform a pre-submission review of proposals, deficiencies in those proposals were not corrected prior to the panel's evaluation. DOD has criteria and a rigorous multistep procedure for evaluating proposals, but some military department stakeholders indicated that this information is not communicated clearly. Previously, GAO noted involving stakeholders helps agencies target resources to the highest priorities. Criteria used for the project selection panel to evaluate proposed projects are not clearly identified in DOD's Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan, and some project managers said that they were unfamiliar with how projects were evaluated. While the Corrosion Office already takes actions, such as providing in-depth feedback to proposals' authors and assembling corrosion experts to participate on the selection panel, unclear communications on some issues could adversely affect authors' abilities to prepare effective project proposals. The military departments are late in validating ROIs for some completed projects. The Strategic Plan suggests that follow-on reviews with validated ROIs are required for completed projects within 3 years after full project implementation. Project managers have completed these reviews for 10 of the 28 implemented projects funded in fiscal year 2005, with 8 of the 10 completed reviews performed by one Army command. Corrosion Executives told GAO that because CPC funding is awarded only for the 2-year project implementation period, they typically do not have funds remaining for validating ROIs after projects are completed. If the ROI validations of completed projects are not performed, the Corrosion Office will not have needed data to adjust project selection criteria in order to invest limited CPC funds in the types of projects with the greatest potential benefits. The Corrosion Office created Product Teams to implement DOD-wide CPC activities in seven areas. Using volunteers and a budget averaging around $4.5 million per year, the Teams propose activities, such as determining the costs of corrosion and DOD-wide specifications for CPC products, which are then selected for funding by the Director of the Corrosion Office. The Corrosion Executives are becoming more involved in Team activities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations to: 1) improve the oversight of proposals submitted for funding consideration, 2) communicate more clearly the criteria used to select which projects will be funded, and 3) fund and complete ROI validations. In written comments on this report, DOD disagreed with the first two recommendations and agreed with the third, citing alternatives or differing views. GAO believes the recommendations remain valid."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, the Department of Defense (DOD) estimated that corrosion costs  the department over $23 billion annually. Moreover, the Defense Science  Board Task Force estimated in a 2004 report that 30 percent of corrosion  costs could be avoided through proper investment in prevention and  mitigation of corrosion during design, manufacture, and sustainment.  Corrosion negatively affects all military assets, including both equipment  and infrastructure, and is defined as the unintended destruction or  deterioration of a material due to its interaction with the environment.  Corrosion also affects military readiness, taking critical systems out of  action and creating safety hazards. For example, an October 2009 study  estimated that corrosion is responsible for up to 16 percent of the  unavailability of the equipment reviewed in the study. Also, our April 2007  report noted that the Army attributed over 50 aircraft accidents and 12  fatalities to corrosion since 1985. According to DOD, increased  prevention and control efforts are needed to adequately address the wide- ranging and expensive effects of corrosion on equipment and  infrastructure.", "Congress has enacted several legislative requirements to address the high  cost of corrosion\u2019s negative effects on military equipment and  infrastructure. To fulfill these requirements, DOD created the Office of  Corrosion Policy and Oversight (Corrosion Office) in 2003. The Corrosion  Office is responsible for the prevention and mitigation of corrosion of  military equipment and infrastructure. The National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which amended 10 U.S.C. \u00a7 2228,  specified organizational changes to the Corrosion Office and added new  reporting requirements. These changes included assigning the former  duties of the DOD-wide Corrosion Executive to the newly established  position of Director of the Corrosion Office and mandating that the  incumbent report directly to the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics. Additionally, the Act required DOD  to annually report on corrosion funding to Congress. The Duncan Hunter  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 required each  military department to designate a Corrosion Control and Prevention  Executive (Corrosion Executive) to be the senior official in the  department with responsibility for coordinating corrosion prevention and  control (CPC) program activities, and also required each Corrosion  Executive to submit an annual report of recommendations regarding CPC  actions and funding levels to the Secretary of Defense.", "We conducted this work in response to the Senate Appropriations  Committee Report accompanying the fiscal year 2010 DOD appropriations  bill. In the Report the Committee directed us to review selected CPC  projects and activities, identify the methodology and processes the  military services use to forward candidate projects for funding  consideration, and determine why the military services\u2019 entire estimated  requirements are not reflected in the overall DOD funding requirement. In  April 2010, we provided observations on the process that DOD and the  military departments use to estimate funding requirements for CPC  projects and activities, and the reasons why DOD\u2019s funding requirement  did not reflect the estimated requirements identified by the military  departments. This report discusses our evaluation of the extent  the Corrosion Executives are involved in preparing CPC project  proposals for submission,  the Corrosion Office has created a process to review and select  projects for funding, and  the military departments have validated the return on investment  (ROI) for funded projects.", "We also discuss the process used by the Corrosion Office to determine the  CPC activities that it will fund.", "In performing our work we used data on projects that the military  departments submitted to the Corrosion Office for funding consideration  in fiscal years 2005 through 2010. We assessed the reliability of the data by  interviewing staff knowledgeable about the data and the system that  produces them and by testing for missing data, outliers, or obvious errors.  We determined the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  determining how the military departments decide which projects to submit  to the Corrosion Office for funding consideration and how the Corrosion  Office decides which projects to approve for funding. To enhance our  understanding of the review and decision-making processes, we selected  and reviewed a nonprobability sample of 24 project proposals and related  information that the military departments submitted in fiscal years 2006,  2008, or 2010. To select this sample, we used the following four  considerations  the year the project was submitted to the Corrosion Office,    whether the project was accepted or not accepted by the Corrosion  Office,  the Corrosion Office\u2019s and military department\u2019s combined project  cost, and  the estimated return on investment (ROI) of the project.", "As part of these project reviews, we interviewed six officials who were the  principal authors and points of contact for 11 of the projects in our  sample. We additionally met with each Corrosion Executive to discuss the  steps they and their staffs took to oversee CPC efforts for their respective  military department. We met with officials at the Corrosion Office to  discuss the CPC project selection process and also observed two meetings  of the CPC project selection panel as part of the fiscal year 2011 project  selection process. We observed meetings where the panel provided  feedback to military department representatives regarding the panel\u2019s  observations on the project proposals submitted for fiscal year 2011  funding consideration. To determine how the military departments  validate the ROIs for funded projects, we met with the Corrosion  Executives and their staffs, as well as the principal points of contact for 11  of the projects we reviewed. We also obtained the final reports for CPC  projects funded in fiscal year 2005 from the Corrosion Office and reviewed  these reports to obtain data on estimated and validated ROIs for these  projects. We met with representatives from three of the seven CPC  Working Integrated Product Teams to understand how CPC activities are  formulated, funded, and implemented. Further details on our scope and  methodology are included in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2010 through December  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Using fiscal year 2006 data, DOD noted that it spends  approximately $80 billion each year to maintain its ships, aircraft, strategic  missiles, and ground combat and tactical vehicles. Corrosion-related costs  of equipment maintenance were estimated to total $19.4 billion each year,  or 24 percent of the total cost of maintenance. In addition, DOD spends  approximately $10 billion to maintain about 577,000 buildings and  structures at more than 5,300 sites worldwide. Approximately $1.9 billion,  or 11.7 percent, of these maintenance costs were estimated to be related to  corrosion.", "The Director of the Corrosion Office is responsible for the prevention and  mitigation of corrosion of DOD equipment and infrastructure. The  Director\u2019s duties include developing and recommending policy guidance  on the prevention and mitigation of corrosion to be issued by the  Secretary of Defense, reviewing the CPC programs and funding levels  proposed by the Secretary of each military department during the annual  internal DOD budget review process, and submitting recommendations to  the Secretary of Defense regarding those programs and proposed funding  levels. In practice, this review includes the process of selecting projects  proposed by the military departments for funding. In addition, the Director  leads the CPC Integrated Product Team, which is comprised of  representatives from the military departments to accomplish the goals and  objectives of the Corrosion Office, and includes the seven Working  Integrated Product Teams (Product Teams) that implement CPC activities.  These seven Product Teams are: policy and requirements; metrics, impact,  and sustainment; specifications, standards, and product qualification;  training and certification; communications and outreach; science and  technology; and facilities. Until fiscal year 2011, the Corrosion Office  consisted of the Director and contractor support. The Director told us that  4 full-time staff were expected to be hired in early fiscal year 2011.", "The Corrosion Office funds projects and activities aimed at preventing and  mitigating corrosion. Projects are specific CPC efforts with the objective  of developing and testing new technologies. To receive Corrosion Office  funding, the military departments submit project proposals that are  evaluated by a panel of experts assembled by the Director of the  Corrosion Office. The Corrosion Office currently funds up to $500,000 per  project, and the military departments pledge complementary funding for  each project they propose. The level of military department funding and  the estimated ROI are two of the criteria used to evaluate the project  proposals. (See app. II for examples of CPC projects.) Activities  encompass efforts, such as training and cost studies, to enhance and  institutionalize CPC efforts within DOD. These activities are coordinated  through the seven Product Teams discussed above. Product Team  representatives told us that funding for these activities is centrally  coordinated through the Corrosion Office in consultation with the Product  Teams.", "According to the Corrosion Office, constrained budgets and competing  requirements to support worldwide military operations have precluded the  full funding of CPC projects that have met the requirements for funding. In  April 2010, we reported on the funding available to the Corrosion Office  for projects and activities. For fiscal years 2005 through 2010, the  Corrosion Office accepted 271 CPC projects with funding requests totaling  $206 million, but DOD provided $129 million, or 63 percent of the funding  required for the Corrosion Office to fund all 271 projects. As a result, the  Corrosion Office funded 169 CPC projects over this 6 year period. As  represented in Figure 1, the historical funding rates for CPC projects have  fluctuated during fiscal years 2005 through 2010. During the same 6 year  period, the Corrosion Office also funded a total of $26 million in corrosion- related activities such as training, outreach, and costs of corrosion studies.", "In April 2010, we reported that the CPC requirements for fiscal year 2011  totaled $47 million, but the fiscal year 2011 budget identified $12 million  for CPC, leaving an unfunded requirement of about $35 million.  Additionally, we reported that the funding level identified in the fiscal year  2011 budget request could result in a potential cost avoidance of $418  million. Similarly, multiplying the average estimated ROI by the amount of  the unfunded requirements shows that DOD may be missing an  opportunity for additional cost avoidance totaling $1.4 billion by not  funding all of its estimated CPC requirements. Both calculations are highly  contingent on the accuracy of the estimated ROIs that have not been  validated by the military departments.

The Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2009 requires the Corrosion Executive of each military department to  serve as the principal point of contact between the military department  and the Director of the Corrosion Office. It also requires each Corrosion  Executive to submit an annual report to the Secretary of Defense  containing recommendations pertaining to the military department\u2019s CPC  program, including corrosion-related funding levels necessary to carry out  all the Corrosion Executive\u2019s duties. In addition, DOD Instruction 5000.67,  Prevention and Mitigation of Corrosion on DOD Military Equipment  and Infrastructure, which was updated in February 2010, reflects certain  legislative requirements and provides Corrosion Executives with  responsibility for certain CPC activities in their military department.

For an entity to run and control its operations, it must  also have relevant, reliable, and timely communications relating to internal  as well as external events.", "During the annual process of identifying and submitting CPC project  proposals for funding consideration, each Corrosion Executive exercises a  different level of review prior to submission of the proposals to the  Corrosion Office. For example, the Army and Navy Corrosion Executives  organized and directed a review of their department\u2019s project proposals  prior to submitting them to the Corrosion Office for fiscal year 2011 CPC  funding, but the Air Force Corrosion Executive\u2019s preliminary oversight  was more limited.", "The Army Corrosion Executive requested the various Army commands to  submit abbreviated project proposals 5 weeks prior to the application  deadline set by the Corrosion Office. Individuals nominated by the Army  commands then reviewed these abbreviated proposals by using criteria the  Army adapted from the project selection evaluation charts included in  DOD\u2019s Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan. The  Corrosion Executive\u2019s office provided the results from this internal peer  review to the authors of the proposed projects, so that comments obtained  from the review could be incorporated into the project proposals before  the Corrosion Executive submitted the projects to the Corrosion Office.  Army staff told us that some authors withdrew their project proposals  following this review, based on the feedback they received.", "The Navy Corrosion Executive directed a similar review process, requiring  that a one-page synopsis of each project proposal be prepared and  submitted to him 7 weeks prior to the Corrosion Office deadline. The  Corrosion Executive assembled a panel with members from each of the  Navy\u2019s system commands to review the synopses. Specifically, individuals  from other system commands reviewed and scored the synopses from the  remaining commands based on the synopses\u2019 alignment with the Navy\u2019s  priorities, and the estimated ROI. The Navy Corrosion Executive then  ranked the synopses based on the aggregate scores received from each  reviewer. A Navy project manager told us that receiving a low ranking did  not preclude project proposals from being submitted to the Corrosion  Office, because the Navy Corrosion Executive did not discourage the  managers of these projects from submitting the full proposal to the  Corrosion Office for funding consideration.", "We found that the Air Force Corrosion Executive did not direct a similar  level of review and feedback for project proposals before they were  submitted to the Corrosion Office for fiscal year 2011 funding. The Air  Force Corrosion Executive requested that the Air Force major commands  submit project proposals to his office prior to submitting project proposals  to the Corrosion Office. However, the Air Force Corrosion Executive did  not establish a process to review the proposals and provide preliminary  feedback for revising them before submission to the Corrosion Office. The  Air Force Corrosion Executive told us that he did not conduct a review of  the proposals because, due to the historically low rate of Air Force CPC  projects accepted for funding, he thought it was appropriate to submit all  of the Air Force proposals to the Corrosion Office. He also said that since  the Corrosion Office is more familiar with the criteria used to judge the  proposals he did not want to reject any project proposals.", "According to a member of the Corrosion Office\u2019s project selection panel,  the additional steps taken by Army and Navy Corrosion Executives to  ensure that their military department\u2019s proposals met the panel\u2019s criteria  were contributing factors for a higher acceptance rate for Army and Navy  proposals. The project selection panel found during the preliminary  evaluation step of the proposal selection process that 66 percent of the  Army project proposals and 61 percent of the Navy project proposals  submitted for fiscal year 2011 funding were acceptable in their current  form, while 11 percent of the Air Force projects were considered  acceptable (see table 1).", "The panel member also told us that the Army and Navy fiscal year 2011  proposals were more complete and more effectively addressed the  selection criteria than those submitted by the Air Force. For example,  most of the Air Force project proposals lacked required information  needed for the project selection panel to judge the merits of the proposal.  The panel\u2019s feedback to the authors of the Air Force project proposals  highlighted areas where the provided information was insufficient or  incomplete, such as  the project managers did not follow the project proposal template in  the DOD Corrosion Prevention and Mitigation Strategic Plan, which  includes topics to be addressed in project proposals;  the contents of the project proposals did not explain the technology  demonstration aspects of the project; or  the project proposals did not include information on matching funds  that would be provided by the Air Force.", "The project selection panel also concluded that most of the Air Force\u2019s  fiscal year 2011 project proposals were requests for replacement funds,  rather than the technology demonstrations that the Corrosion Office\u2019s CPC  program is intended to support.

Following the feedback, the  project managers had three options: prepare and submit information  addressing the feedback provided by the panel, re-submit project  proposals in their original form, or remove projects from consideration  for that year\u2019s funding process. Project managers told us that they  sometimes decide to remove their \u201cno-go\u201d projects from consideration  and that the military departments may implement such projects using  other funding. A project selection panel member told us that if a  project manager decided to modify a project proposal to address the  panel\u2019s feedback, this modified proposal was due to the Corrosion  Office no later than 2 weeks after the feedback session.

However, some continuing uncertainty  about how the Corrosion Executives should fulfill their responsibilities  may be limiting the positive impact that these positions could have on CPC  efforts. For example, the nature and extent of reviews of CPC proposals  before they are submitted to the Corrosion Office were cited as a possible  cause for differences in the rates at which the military departments\u2019  proposed projects are selected for supplemental funding from the  Corrosion Office. Similarly, some issues with how clearly the criteria used  to select projects for funding are communicated may have negative  effects. These effects include significant revisions to project proposals and  can result in fewer projects being accepted. If these concerns are not  addressed, DOD and the military departments may not achieve maximum  benefits from the program and thereby limit the effects of corrosion on the  assets that they manage. An additional area of concern is the limited  follow-through on the requirement to validate the ROIs that were  originally estimated for the funded projects. While the few validations  completed thus far document positive results, the small and non- representative group of findings prevents (1) generalization about the  impact of other funded projects and (2) efforts to identify and focus future  funding toward types of projects that have been shown to have the best  likelihood for high payoffs.

For example, the  sites where the project was  installed are not the originally  planned sites. The contractor  estimates at the originally planned  sites were much higher than the  government estimates. Because  of this the facilities command had  to find a different site to use for  project implementation.", "The Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center, Pacific submitted  this project proposal for a total cost of $450,000, with 56 percent  requested from the Corrosion Office. The estimated ROI was 2:1.  The project was to test results of a technical paper reporting that  an improved backfill and/or galvanic anode system may provide  better cathodic protection than current impressed systems.", "A center official noted that the  Navy removed this from funding  consideration because (1) it could  not find any matching funds and  (2) there was no site selected to  demonstrate the technology.", "The Naval Air Systems Command submitted this project proposal  for a total cost of $940,000, with 29 percent requested from the  Corrosion Office. The project\u2019s estimated ROI was 2:1. The  project was to evaluate alternative paint removal technology that  could be used (1) where spot paint removal is necessary for non- destructive inspections and (2) at intermediate and depot-level  facilities where larger scale removal of coating is required for  inspections and repairs.", "This project was not accepted and  not funded by the Corrosion  Office.
