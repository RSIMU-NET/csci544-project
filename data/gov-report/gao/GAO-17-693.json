They also use SIPs when they seek access to researchers who have established partnerships with diverse population groups across the country. They would not choose the SIP mechanism when the research they want to fund is not focused on public health prevention, including research that is clinical or laboratory-based; would be better suited for an entity other than an academic health center; or would be better funded through a contract to allow CDC to direct the research protocol. CDC's collaborations with experts in the field\u2014including those at other federal agencies\u2014help to inform its development of the research funding opportunities offered through SIPs. For example, CDC officials use information they learn through participation in multiagency workgroups and advisory committees to identify gaps in knowledge that SIP funding could help to address.

Specifically, CDC officials from most of the sponsoring  units we spoke to told us that they use the SIP mechanism when  community participation is important to the research. For example, one  sponsoring unit used a SIP for the development and testing of an  integrated comprehensive communication strategy to promote vaccination  for the human papilloma virus in the United States. The SIP was focused  on developing strategies that engaged local or regional health systems,  community-based organizations, and state health departments as key  community partners, in order to enhance the acceptability of the  vaccination among parents with vaccine-eligible children and to increase  the likelihood that a provider would recommend the vaccination. CDC  officials from one sponsoring unit also told us they use the SIP  mechanism when they need to engage community leaders and members  of the public in order to answer the research questions. For example,  CDC used the SIP mechanism to fund a research project focused on  enhancing the knowledge, skills, and capacity of community health  advocates and leaders from community-based organizations, with the  goal to provide participants with the skills necessary to assess local  community health needs in order to improve community health. According  to CDC, an important aspect of the research was the evaluation of  whether there was an increase in the skills and leadership capacities of  participants and their influence on local improvements in their  communities.", "In addition, CDC officials told us that they choose the SIP mechanism to  conduct research when seeking to access researchers who have  established partnerships with diverse population groups across the  country. PRCs are located across the United States and are expected to  have cultivated relationships with their local communities. For example,  one sponsoring unit used a SIP to fund research on the barriers to  colorectal cancer screening among South Central Asian immigrants,  primarily Indians and Pakistanis, who have been shown to have low  screening rates. The purpose of the research was to inform the  development of culturally relevant strategies to increase colorectal  screening. As such, to be awarded the SIP, a PRC had to demonstrate  that it had established relationships within the South Central Asian  community and an ability to recruit from these populations.", "In contrast, CDC officials explained that they would not choose the SIP  mechanism if the desired research would be better suited for an entity  other than an academic health center. For example:", "Officials from one sponsoring unit told us that a different mechanism  was used for a project testing obesity prevention and management  strategies because the project required working directly with health  care service providers in the community, such as federally qualified  health centers.", "Officials from another sponsoring unit chose not to use a SIP for a  project to evaluate vaccine impact on recurrent respiratory  papillomatosis (a disease in which tumors grow in the respiratory  tract). This research was being conducted by the providers who care  for the patients, as opposed to academic researchers.", "CDC officials provided examples of other instances when they would not  use a SIP, and instead choose another mechanism to support the desired  research. Specifically, officials from one sponsoring unit told us that when  conducting a research project related to cervical cancer, they did the work  through a contract in order to allow the SME to direct the research  protocol, which included collaboration with organizations that maintained  cancer data, as well as the deliverables and timeline for completion of the  work. Sponsoring unit officials also told us that they will not choose the  SIP mechanism when the research they want to fund is not focused on  public health prevention, such as when the research is clinical or  laboratory based, or when the timing of the research does not align with  the PRC funding cycle (e.g., a longitudinal study or a study that would  cross two PRC funding cycles)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collaboration with Federal and Nonfederal Experts Informs Development of SIP Funding Opportunities and Reduces Potential for Unnecessary Duplication", "paragraphs": ["CDC officials told us that CDC SMEs\u2019 relationships and collaboration with  experts in the field\u2014including federal and nonfederal experts\u2014help  inform the development of the research funding opportunities made  available through SIPs, as well as other mechanisms. In our prior work,  we found that interagency collaboration, which can include information  sharing and communication among federal experts, may reduce the  likelihood of unnecessary duplication.", "According to officials from all of the sponsoring units we spoke with,  SMEs have developed collaborative relationships with federal and  nonfederal experts in their fields; these relationships develop through  SMEs\u2019 participation in workgroups, advisory committees, and joint  projects, as well as through informal interactions at in-person meetings  and conferences. (See table 1 for examples of the workgroups and  advisory committees in which CDC SMEs participate.) These interactions,  as well as the SME\u2019s review of the scientific and nonscientific literature,  are used to determine gaps in knowledge and inform the research  proposed to be funded through SIPs or other mechanisms.", "CDC SMEs\u2019 collaboration with federal and nonfederal experts may lead to  the development of specific research projects that are funded through a  SIP. For example:", "SMEs from one sponsoring unit identified a series of research gaps  that existed within skin cancer prevention while working on the  Surgeon General\u2019s Call to Action to Prevent Skin Cancer Report with  multiple federal agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration,  the National Institutes of Health\u2019s (NIH) National Cancer Institute, the  Environmental Protection Agency and the Office of the Surgeon  General. CDC developed a SIP to address one of these gaps\u2014 assessing the knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about skin cancer in  order to develop and test communication strategies for skin cancer  prevention, specifically for adults aged 18 to 49.", "SMEs from another sponsoring unit participate in the Interagency  Coordinating Committee on the Prevention of Underage Drinking with  15 federal partners, including the Substance Abuse and Mental Health  Services Administration, Federal Trade Commission, Department of  Justice, and NIH\u2019s National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and  Alcoholism. According to CDC, this group meets regularly to discuss  their work and efforts to address prevention of underage drinking.  Based on this collaboration and the review of other resources,  including research projects and reports by committee members, CDC  SMEs determined there was a gap in knowledge related to monitoring  youth exposure to alcohol marketing on the Internet, and developed  and awarded a SIP in 2014 to address this issue.", "In 2011, CDC SMEs hosted an expert conference\u2014including federal  and nonfederal researchers, health care providers, and  representatives from advocacy groups\u2014to discuss how patients and  health care providers can communicate effectively before, during, and  after prostate cancer screenings. Recommendations from this  conference resulted in a 2014 SIP focused on the development of a  multimedia decision aid to help patients and their family members  understand treatment options after a positive prostate cancer  diagnosis.", "Collaboration with experts may also increase the resources available for a  specific research project. For example, officials from the CDC unit that  sponsors the National Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network  SIP told us that the network is jointly funded with NIH\u2019s National Cancer  Institute. This joint funding allows for an expanded pool of resources, and  officials stated that the network is able to achieve more than any  individual PRC could achieve on its own.", "CDC officials told us that the knowledge gained through coordination and  information sharing also mitigates the potential for duplication of research  efforts. For example, officials from one sponsoring unit told us that as a  part of their ongoing discussions with NIH on sexually transmitted disease  prevention, they learned of research NIH was conducting that was related  to a SIP that CDC planned to fund. CDC decided not to fund the SIP and  instead entered into a joint funding arrangement with NIH to address its  research needs.

For example, officials we spoke with  from one PRC told us that they typically learn from CDC if their  application for a SIP has been successful in August of a given year, and  awards are made at the end of September, with the expectation that the  research should begin shortly thereafter. These officials added that  because many SIPs are only providing funds for one or two years, there  is no time to waste in getting the research up and running. Officials from  one outside organization noted that this faster turnaround in getting the  research started can result in faster publication of results.", "Officials from CDC and others told us that PRCs have infrastructure in  place to do multidisciplinary research, which an official from one outside  organization told us includes the ability to manage federal funds and  recruit study participants. This infrastructure contributes to the speed with  which PRCs can start a SIP. For example, officials from one CDC  sponsoring unit told us that a PRC\u2019s existing infrastructure means that it is  not starting from scratch when it conducts research through a SIP. In  addition, a representative from one outside organization said that it is a  good use of federal resources to continue to invest in federally supported  infrastructure\u2014as in the case of offering supplemental funding to PRCs in  the form of SIP awards.", "In addition to research infrastructure, officials also told us that PRCs have  established relationships with community partners. One outside  organization told us that these relationships are particularly important for  prevention research, which often involves working with populations who  may be reluctant to participate in research. Research has confirmed the  need for community engagement when studies include disadvantaged  groups. Specifically, a systematic review of the literature on strategies for  increasing participation of disadvantaged groups in research concluded  that researchers need to operate via community partnerships, because  they can increase trust among the study population. Similarly, one  sponsoring unit told us about the importance of the PRCs\u2019 credibility in  the neighborhoods where the research is being done. Given this, for  some SIPs, the FOA explicitly requires PRCs to outline their partnerships  with community organizations in their applications or notes that  descriptions of these relationships will be considered when applications  are scored by reviewers. For example, the fiscal year 2015 FOA for a SIP  that was to identify means for increasing screening rates for breast and  cervical cancer in Muslim women asked that applicants \u201cdescribe and  provide evidence (such as supporting letters and publications) of  sufficient institutional, community and other necessary support for  carrying out this project.\u201d", "In addition, officials from CDC and outside organizations noted that there  are benefits of having eligibility limited to entities that have already been  vetted, such as an increased likelihood of the research being successful.  To become a PRC, the eligible academic institutions must go through a  competitive peer review process, through which they are evaluated based  on their ability to contribute to improved community and population health,  impact public health programs and practice, and advance the field of  public health promotion and disease prevention, among other things.  Because of this vetting, an official from one outside organization told us  that PRCs are likely to be successful in their work\u2014mitigating the risk  faced were an award to be made to an unknown entity. An official from  another outside organization noted that CDC sponsoring units work  closely with the PRCs on implementing the SIPs, and it is beneficial that  the PRCs are \u201cknown entities\u201d who have established relationships with  CDC.", "Officials from CDC and outside organizations identified a few potential  disadvantages to limiting eligibility for SIPs, including the potential for  reduced access to expertise outside of the PRCs and the risk of being  unable to conduct desired research at the desired time. Specifically,  officials from outside organizations told us that there may be reduced  access to the expertise of researchers from other universities or other  entities. CDC officials and officials from PRCs said that PRCs have the  ability to bring in the expertise from outside the PRC institution through  subcontracts with other entities, which could help alleviate this concern.  For example, for a SIP on skin cancer prevention messaging, the PRC  officials at the University of Pennsylvania told us they had multiple  subcontracts, including one with a researcher at another university with  expertise on indoor tanning.", "Officials from two outside organizations stated that there is a missed  potential for innovation and new approaches if new entities are not  eligible for SIPs or added to the pool of PRCs. Although there is a  competition for PRCs every 5 years, the PRCs have been fairly stable in  recent years\u20142 new PRCs were added in fiscal year 2014, while more  than half (15 of 26) of the current PRCs have been continuously funded  by CDC for at least 15 years.", "Because SIPs are only announced once per year and are awarded at the  end of the fiscal year, one other potential disadvantage of SIPs\u2019 limited  eligibility is the risk that CDC\u2019s desired research may not be conducted, or  may not be able to be conducted at the desired time. If the research  project is ultimately not funded through the SIP, there is not sufficient time  within the fiscal year to pursue an alternative mechanism. CDC  sponsoring unit officials described instances where they did not receive  any applicants or did not receive enough qualified applicants for individual  SIPs and thus were not able to fund a SIP or made fewer awards than  planned. In fiscal years 2014 through 2016, 5 of 51 SIPs included in the  FOAs were ultimately not funded because they received no applications  or the applications received were not a good fit for the desired project.
