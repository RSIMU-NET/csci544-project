Among other things, this report describes (1) recent trends in the capacity of facilities that provide inpatient and residential behavioral health services; (2) how CMS policies related to the IMD exclusion have changed over time; and (3) how selected states finance IMD services for adult Medicaid beneficiaries. GAO examined federal laws, regulations, and guidance, interviewed officials in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the department that includes CMS, and analyzed the most current data from three national HHS surveys. GAO also interviewed Medicaid officials in six states selected based on geography and use of options to provide care in IMDs for adult Medicaid beneficiaries. Additionally, GAO interviewed representatives of nine behavioral health facilities in the six states referred to GAO by state Medicaid officials and a hospital association. Selected states' and facilities' experiences are not generalizable. HHS provided technical comments on a draft of this report, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Between 2010 and 2015, inpatient and residential behavioral health services capacity has gone up for adult mental health treatment and stayed about the same for substance use treatment. GAO found that for adult mental health treatment, inpatient and residential capacity increased from about 61 to 69 beds per 100,000 adults between 2010 and 2014. For adult substance use treatment, inpatient and residential capacity remained fairly constant between 2010 and 2015, increasing from 57 to about 58 beds per 100,000 adults. In both types of behavioral health services there was significant variation across states.", "GAO also found that over time, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' (CMS)\u2014the agency that oversees state Medicaid programs\u2014changed policies to allow some states to finance care for adult Medicaid beneficiaries in institutions for mental disease (IMD), in certain circumstances. IMDs are generally facilities larger than 16 beds that primarily provide inpatient, residential, or other services to individuals with behavioral health conditions. These policy changes included the following:", "Medicaid demonstrations. Beginning in 1993, CMS officials said they approved demonstrations in nine states, allowing federal funds to cover behavioral health services in IMDs; these demonstrations were largely phased out by 2009. In July 2015, CMS announced a demonstration that would allow states to use Medicaid funds to cover substance use services in IMDs. As of May 2017, CMS had approved these demonstrations in four states. CMS has also approved applications from some, but not all, states for demonstrations that allow states to pay for substance use or mental health services in IMDs.", "Medicaid managed care. In May 2016, CMS issued a final rule that codified a policy, known as the \u201cin lieu of\u201d policy, under which managed care plans may provide alternative services or services in alternative settings, such as IMDs, under certain circumstances. In the rule, CMS set a 15-day per month limit on the number of days an adult beneficiary may receive behavioral health services in an IMD for which managed care plans will receive payment. According to CMS estimates, at least 17 states had likely been allowing such coverage before the rule was issued.", "Even with multiple funding sources, selected states reported some problems with adult access to IMD services. While CMS does not collect national data on how states finance services for adults in IMDs, officials in six selected states GAO interviewed stated they used between two to four strategies to fund services for adults in IMDs in recent years, including under Medicaid managed care and demonstrations. State officials said that when their states were unable to use Medicaid funds to finance IMD services, they relied on other options, such as state-only funding, or providing services in smaller non-IMD facilities. Officials from each of the six states shared examples of access problems; for instance, one state reported long waits for inpatient mental health services. In addition, some facility officials said they regularly turned away patients and maintained waitlists."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Individuals enrolled in Medicaid experience a higher rate of behavioral  health conditions\u2014mental health and substance use conditions\u2014than  those with private insurance. Although Medicaid, a joint federal-state  program that finances health care coverage for low-income and medically  needy individuals, is the largest source of funding for behavioral health  services nationally, with spending projected to be nearly $71 billion in  2017, our prior work has shown that Medicaid beneficiaries may have  difficulty accessing services. Beginning in 1965 when the program was  enacted, Medicaid excluded federal payments for services provided to  most residents of institutions for mental disease (IMD)\u2014generally  facilities larger than 16 beds that primarily provide inpatient, residential, or  other services to persons with behavioral health conditions. Today the  IMD exclusion applies only to adult Medicaid beneficiaries aged 21-64.  Little is known about how those beneficiaries access needed inpatient or  residential behavioral health care or how much the federal government  pays for these types of services.", "Over the last several decades, changes in the delivery of behavioral  health treatments, which included reductions in the number of inpatient  beds, came about largely because of concerns about poor living  conditions in large institutions, advances in behavioral health treatment  options, including prescription drugs, and the rights of individuals to  receive care in the setting most integrated in the community. From 1990  to 2008, the number of adult inpatient mental health hospital beds and  residential beds decreased by 35 percent, dropping from 290,359 beds in  1990 to 188,951 beds in 2008. As the number of beds has decreased,  questions have been raised as to whether sufficient capacity for inpatient  and residential services exists. Additionally, the abuse of prescription  opioid pain relievers and illicit opioids, such as heroin, have contributed to  increasing numbers of overdose deaths in the United States and calls for  more substance use treatment.", "Inpatient hospital services are more intensive than other types of services, with 24-hour  nursing care, and physicians and counselors available as needed. Residential services  are considered less intensive than inpatient hospitalization, with individual and group  activities provided in a structured 24-hour live-in facility with care provided by trained  counselors.

Both  surveys are a census of facilities that provide either mental health  services or substance use services, respectively. Because IMD  designations are not limited to facilities that provide behavioral health  services, the survey does not include all facilities that are potentially  IMDs. SAMHSA tabulated data for us from N-MHSS and N-SSATS on the  facilities that provided inpatient and residential services, which was the  focus of our analysis. We analyzed SAMHSA\u2019s data to assess the  capacity of facilities from both surveys. We ensured the reliability of the  N-MHSS and N-SSATS data used in this report by performing appropriate  electronic data checks, reviewing relevant documentation, and  interviewing SAMHSA officials knowledgeable about the data. We found  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our analyses. For  more information on the analysis of the N-MHSS and N-SSATS, see  appendix I.", "To describe what is known about adult access to IMD-type services, we  conducted a literature search to identify original research that addressed  the topic.

We also identified articles through searches of government  agency websites and through a bibliographic search based on relevant  articles already identified. We screened abstracts and articles and  excluded international research, research that included no data later than  2005, and research focused on children or elderly adults. The articles we  identified clustered around several key themes, including receipt of  services, self-reported unmet need, use of and length of stay in hospital  EDs, and inpatient readmissions.

Currently the exclusion applies only to Medicaid beneficiaries aged  21-64; the Social Security Act Amendments of 1965 and 1972 allowed  Medicaid beneficiaries age 65 and older and under age 21, respectively,  to receive services in IMDs.

Per the statutory  definition, an IMD is \u201ca hospital, nursing facility, or other institution of  more than 16 beds that is primarily engaged in providing diagnosis,  treatment, or care of persons with mental diseases, including medical  attention, nursing care, and related services.\u201d CMS\u2019s guidance on how  to determine when the IMD exclusion applies is included in its State  Medicaid Manual, which contains criteria for determining whether a facility  is an IMD. Also, according to CMS officials, if needed, CMS is available to  provide technical assistance so states can make IMD determinations. The  State Medicaid Manual lays out IMD criteria that include an assessment of the type of licensure or accreditation the facility or  group of facilities holds; an assessment of the patient population; and whether the facility or group of facilities was established primarily for  the care and treatment of individuals with behavioral health  conditions.", "Understanding which facilities are subject to the exclusion also requires  an understanding of what constitutes a \u201cfacility.\u201d In determining if states  have applied the exclusion correctly, CMS also takes into consideration  whether a group of facilities has a common owner or governing body. If  one owner operates multiple facilities in a state and together the facilities  have more than 16 beds, the facilities jointly may qualify as an IMD and  would therefore be subject to the exclusion.", "In 2015, Congress considered, but did not pass, legislation to fully lift the  IMD exclusion. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that  this legislation would cost the federal government $40 to 60 billion over  10 years (2016-2025). CBO stated that its estimate was highly uncertain  and based on limited data. CBO officials said that they did not take into  account existing or recently available options states have to finance  Medicaid services for adult Medicaid IMD residents, such as Medicaid  disproportionate share hospital (DSH) payments to IMDs,  demonstrations, or care provided by managed care plans.

According to a technical brief from HHS\u2019s Agency for  Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), these factors may include  insufficient inpatient care to stabilize the patient\u2019s condition, inadequate  transition planning, and lack of access after discharge to outpatient  services or to short-term alternatives to rehospitalization, such as partial  hospitalization and crisis residential services.", "An analysis of 2012 data from the State Inpatient Database readmissions  analysis file, part of a collection of health care databases sponsored by  AHRQ, found disproportionately high estimated 30-day readmission rates  among patients with the two most common behavioral health diagnoses  among hospitalized patients. Compared with patients admitted for a  non-behavioral-health condition, patients admitted for mood disorders  were more than twice as likely to be readmitted for the same principal  diagnosis within 30 days (9.0 vs. 3.8 percent), and patients admitted for  schizophrenia were more than four times as likely to be readmitted for the  same diagnosis (15.7 vs. 3.8 percent). This study also found that  patients with these conditions who were covered by Medicaid or Medicare  had higher 30-day readmission rates than privately insured or uninsured  patients.", "Other studies have shown that some behavioral health conditions are a  common diagnosis or a contributing factor in repeat hospitalizations,  including among patients with Medicaid coverage. For example, another  study of Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP) data found that  the two most common principal diagnoses for hospital stays among non- elderly Medicaid patients who had four or more stays in 2012 were mood  disorders and schizophrenia, while the sixth most common principal  diagnosis among these patients was alcohol-related conditions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s IMD Policies Have Changed Over Time to Allow Payments in Certain Circumstances", "paragraphs": ["Over time, CMS policies have changed to allow some states to finance  the provision of care for adult Medicaid beneficiaries in IMDs, in certain  circumstances.

HHS has allowed states to pay for IMD  services in certain circumstances in Medicaid demonstrations, but HHS  has discretion over when to approve such coverage and has done so for  some but not all requesting states. Section 1115 of the Social Security  Act gives the Secretary of HHS authority to waive certain traditional  federal Medicaid requirements and allow costs that would not otherwise  be eligible for federal payments for demonstrations that, in the Secretary\u2019s  view, are likely to promote Medicaid objectives. Under this authority, since  1993 HHS has approved demonstrations allowing certain states to  provide mental health services and substance use services in IMDs. The  demonstrations typically last 3 to 5 years, but can be renewed, and allow  federal payments for adult behavioral health services provided in IMDs.", "According to CMS officials, beginning with Tennessee in 1993, HHS  approved section 1115 demonstrations in 9 states that allowed states to  pay for behavioral health services in IMDs. In addition to Tennessee,  CMS officials said that Arizona, Delaware, Maryland, Massachusetts,  New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and Vermont also had approved  behavioral health demonstrations between 1993 and 2009. By 2009,  CMS officials said that the authority to pay for IMD costs in all of the  states was phased out, except in Massachusetts. CMS officials said the  demonstrations that were phased out were no longer considered  \u201cinnovative or experimental.\u201d CMS officials also said that Massachusetts\u2019s  2005 demonstration was renewed, most recently in November 2016,  because it was innovative and included behavioral health services  reforms.", "In addition to Massachusetts\u2019s demonstration, CMS has recently  approved applications from some, but not all states, for section 1115  demonstrations that allow states to pay for substance use or mental  health services provided in IMDs.", "Substance use: In July 2015, CMS issued a state Medicaid Director  letter informing states that they may seek approval of section 1115  demonstrations to receive federal payments for demonstrations that  provided substance use services to adults in IMD settings as part of a  comprehensive initiative to reform states\u2019 delivery of substance use  services. In the letter to states describing this opportunity, CMS said  the demonstrations would allow states to address the historical lack of  substance use treatment capacity, including inpatient and residential  treatment, particularly in light of the national opioid epidemic, improve  the quality of substance use services, and ensure Medicaid  beneficiary\u2019s access to a full continuum of care for substance use  conditions. Specifically, the demonstration initiative allows federal  payments for short-term residential substance use treatment in IMDs,  limited to an average length of stay of 30 days. According to CMS  officials, as of May 4, 2017, California, Maryland, Massachusetts, and  Virginia had sought and received approval for substance use  demonstrations. CMS officials also said that they were working with  four other states in the process of applying for or obtaining such  approval for substance use demonstrations.", "Mental health: CMS has approved some, but not all, demonstration  applications to provide mental health services in IMDs. For example,  although Maryland was approved to provide substance use treatment  services in IMDs under the substance use demonstration guidance  issued in July 2015, the state had applied at the same time to provide  mental health services in IMDs. According to Maryland Medicaid  officials, CMS denied this part of the request. However, in October  2016, CMS approved a section 1115 demonstration for Vermont that  allows the state to pay for acute inpatient mental health services  provided in an IMD, though the state is required to phase out that  coverage completely by December 31, 2025.", "Medicaid managed care. Historically, Medicaid managed care plans had  the flexibility to provide covered services in alternate settings under  certain conditions, such as behavioral health services in IMDs. In May  2016, CMS issued a final rule designed to modernize its Medicaid  managed care regulations. The rule codified this policy, known as the \u201cin  lieu of\u201d policy, under which managed care plans may provide alternative  services or services in alternative settings, such as IMDs, in lieu of  covered services or settings if they are medically appropriate and a cost- effective substitute for covered services or settings. CMS set a 15-day  per month limit on the number of days a beneficiary may receive  behavioral health services in an IMD for which managed care plans will  receive payment. It is unknown how many states have allowed managed  care plans in their states to cover services provided in IMDs because  CMS does not currently collect such information. However, CMS  actuaries estimated that in 2010, 17 states were likely using the Medicaid  managed care in lieu of authority for services provided in IMDs, and  another 9 were potentially using the authority and that this change would  cost $66 million ($42 million federal; $24 million state) over 5 years (2016- 2020)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected States Use Multiple Approaches to Provide Inpatient and Residential Behavioral Health Services to Adult Medicaid Beneficiaries, and Reported Some Access Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected States Use a Variety of Options to Provide Inpatient and Residential Behavioral Health Services to Adult Medicaid Beneficiaries, Including Medicaid and State Funds", "paragraphs": ["While there are no national data on how states finance services provided  to adult Medicaid beneficiaries in IMDs, officials in our six selected states  told us they used or reported using between 2 to 4 approaches to provide  inpatient and residential behavioral health services to adult Medicaid  beneficiaries from 2012 to 2016 (see table 1). Most of these state  Medicaid officials said that when their states were unable to use Medicaid  funds to finance services in IMDs, they relied on other funding sources,  including state-only funding, or facility officials said they provided  uncompensated care.", "Medicaid managed care \u201cin lieu of\u201d authority: Nationally, in fiscal year  2013, the most recent data available, nearly 54 percent of Medicaid  beneficiaries were enrolled in comprehensive managed care plans.  States with adults enrolled in managed care plans may opt to use the  Medicaid managed care \u201cin lieu of\u201d authority, and some states were  already doing so. Of our six selected states, officials in three states  (Minnesota, Missouri, and Washington) reported using the Medicaid  managed care \u201cin lieu of\u201d authority before the final rule became effective  in July 2016. Officials from these three states said their states used this  authority to pay managed care plans for individuals who were in an IMD  for more than the 15 days per month allowed by the new final rule. These  officials could not provide estimates of the amount spent on these  services because the plans received the same capitation payments  regardless of the services actually provided. These officials expressed  concerns about implementing the new rule, including increasing states\u2019  costs for beneficiaries in need of IMD stays longer than the allowable 15  days per month because they would no longer be able to rely on Medicaid  managed care plans to cover longer IMD stays.", "DSH: Federal law requires states to make DSH payments to offset  uncompensated care costs experienced by certain hospitals serving large  numbers of low-income uninsured and Medicaid patients and establishes  state-specific limits, or allotments, for this purpose. States are allowed,  within certain federal payment limits, to make these payments to mental  health treatment facilities, including IMDs. Within these limits, states  have broad flexibility in deciding how to allocate DSH payments among  eligible hospitals, including IMDs. CMS data showed that nationally,  states provided DSH payments to mental health treatment facilities,  including IMDs, totaling nearly $2.92 billion in fiscal year 2015 (see app.  VI for DSH payments to mental health treatment facilities by state).  Among our six selected states, DSH payments to mental health treatment  facilities in fiscal year 2015 ranged from $26,766 in California to nearly  $357.4 million in New Jersey. Officials from one Missouri IMD we spoke  with said that the facility is very dependent on DSH payments, which  make up about two-thirds of their operating costs.", "Medicaid Emergency Psychiatric Demonstration (MEPD): The MEPD  allowed 11 states and the District of Columbia to reimburse certain private  IMDs for care provided to adult Medicaid beneficiaries to stabilize  emergency mental health conditions. PPACA authorized $75 million in  federal funds for the demonstration, which ran from July 1, 2012 to June  30, 2015, and total federal and state expenditures on IMD claims totaled  approximately $113 million by the end of the demonstration. A CMS  sponsored evaluation of the MEPD found little to no effect on ED  boarding or other measures of access for individuals with mental health  conditions; however, the researchers acknowledged that this finding may  have been attributable to data limitations. Following completion of the  MEPD, the Improving Access to Emergency Psychiatric Care Act of 2015  law was enacted, which included a provision to allow for possible  continuation and expansion of the MEPD through 2019, if the Secretary of  HHS and the Chief Actuary of CMS certified that the MEPD would not  increase program spending. In July 2016, CMS actuaries determined  that they could not make this certification based on the available data and  the MEPD ended in 2015 after 3 years, as required by PPACA.  Additionally, the 21st Century Cures Act, signed into law in December  2016, requires HHS to further study and produce a report on the MEPD  by December 2018.", "Of our six selected states, four states participated in the MEPD:  California, Maryland, Missouri, and Washington. Washington Medicaid  officials said they withdrew from the MEPD early, in 2014, after the state  received approval to cover the costs of IMD services through managed  care. California officials said the two counties that participated in the  MEPD had positive experiences with the demonstration and one county  reported improved access to care, and reduced re-hospitalizations for  beneficiaries with psychiatric diagnoses. Officials from two of the states  expressed frustration and concern that CMS actuaries did not determine  that the demonstration would not increase program spending and, as a  result, the demonstration did not continue.", "Despite the CMS actuaries\u2019 determination, two state officials provided  data showing the average cost of a day in an IMD was less than the  average cost in a non-IMD. One state official told us that IMDs cost less to operate than a hospital since they do not have to purchase or maintain  equipment used in a typical hospital such as lab or surgical equipment.  For example, Missouri Medicaid officials provided data showing that in  2014, IMD daily rates were about 45 percent less than a non-IMD (see  Table 2). Likewise, Maryland Medicaid officials provided data showing  that in 2015, the IMD daily rate was about 24 percent less than the  average daily rate for two non-IMDs in the state.", "Section 1115 substance use services demonstrations: CMS officials  said that nationally, as of May 4, 2017, 4 states have sought and received  approval for substance use services demonstrations (California,  Maryland, Massachusetts, and Virginia).

While CMS officials  said they do not track national data on facilities that have 16 or fewer  beds, officials in each of our six selected states said they had such  facilities in their state and several state and facility officials said they  created inpatient 16-bed or smaller facilities specifically to obtain  Medicaid funding without triggering the IMD exclusion.", "While 16-bed facilities are able to receive federal Medicaid payments for  the same services an IMD may provide, state and facility officials noted  challenges with facilities this size. Some state and facility officials noted  that facilities with 16 or fewer beds, as opposed to larger facilities, may  experience financial challenges because it costs more to offer the same  breadth of services to a smaller number of patients, or because smaller  facilities may not be able to offer certain services larger ones can.

Medicaid officials said that  residential substance use services would be available in counties that  chose to participate in the demonstration, but access to these  services would be difficult in counties that chose not to participate in  the demonstration. When beds are not available, an official at one  California facility said that they keep a waitlist and offer the next best  level of care available, typically outpatient care, until an appropriate  bed becomes available.", "Maryland: Medicaid officials said that while they were not aware of  systematic access problems, they had heard anecdotally that some  hospitals had trouble finding beds for Medicaid beneficiaries outside  of EDs and other acute-care hospital settings. Officials also reported  that stays in acute-care hospital settings, which are covered by  Medicaid, may be longer than stays at lower levels of care in IMDs.", "Minnesota: Medicaid officials said that it may be more difficult for  Medicaid beneficiaries with acute mental health needs to access  inpatient services than it is for beneficiaries seeking outpatient mental  health services.", "Missouri: More than 61 percent of hospitals that responded to a  survey by the Missouri Hospital Association (38 of 62 hospitals)  reported boarding behavioral health patients in EDs during a specific  week in May 2016 and 76 percent of those boarded patients were  between the ages of 21 to 64. The survey data also showed that of  the hospitals that reported boarding behavioral health patients, 94.7  percent said that they boarded patients because they could not  identify a facility with a mental health bed that would accept the  patient. Other reasons reported for boarding included not having an  in-house mental health bed available (47.4 percent) and not having  access to appropriate transportation services (23.7 percent).", "New Jersey: Medicaid officials said that accessing behavioral health  services can be challenging. For example, officials said there is a  problem with ED boarding in the state and there are oftentimes  waitlists for substance use services. Additionally, officials said it can  be difficult to qualify for a bed in a substance use treatment facility. To  address the shortage of inpatient treatment beds, in January 2017,  the governor announced plans to increase the number of beds  allowed for individuals with co-occurring mental health and substance  use conditions by almost 40 percent, adding 864 beds. Up to 5  percent of the new beds are to be available for Medicaid beneficiaries  and the uninsured population.", "Washington: Medicaid officials said that there is not enough capacity  to meet the demand for services within the state even though over  100 additional beds opened statewide in 2014.Officials at two  Washington facilities reported turning away patients because of a lack  of available beds and patients were sometimes sent to geographically  distant treatment facilities. Officials at one 15-bed facility said that  demand would justify an expansion to 20 to 25 beds in their facility if it  were not for the IMD exclusion; these officials also noted that they  were in the process of building two new 16-bed treatment facilities.
