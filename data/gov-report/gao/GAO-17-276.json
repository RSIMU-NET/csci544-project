GAO analyzed purchase card policies and guidance issued by OMB and GSA; obtained purchase card data on fiscal year 2014 transactions; tested three elements of the approval process through a generalizable random, stratified sample of 300 transactions from a population of over 17 million across the government; and conducted targeted data mining for improper or potentially fraudulent purchases."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2008, the General Services Administration (GSA) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) have taken several steps, in part to address prior GAO recommendations, to enhance purchase card program controls over micropurchases, which are currently capped at $3,500 for most purchases. These steps include developing training, monitoring tools, and guidance. For example, according to OMB guidance, a cardholder should maintain documentation to minimize risk of erroneous and improper purchases, including documentation of the purchase request and preapproval for self-generated purchases.", "GAO's government-wide review found some weaknesses in the approval process for micropurchases due to inadequate documentation. Specifically, in its sample, GAO found that 22 percent of transactions government-wide did not have complete documentation to substantiate the transactions' approval process. Additionally, GAO estimated that 23 percent of Department of Defense (DOD) transactions and 13 percent of Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) transactions had incomplete documentation. Together, DOD and VA accounted for about two-thirds of all micropurchase spending in fiscal year 2014.", "GAO's government-wide review and targeted data mining of selected categories for potentially improper purchases found little evidence of improper or potentially fraudulent purchases among micropurchase transactions. However, incomplete documentation increases the risk that fraud, charge card misuse, and other abusive activity could occur without detection. One agency, the Department of the Interior (DOI), granted blanket purchase authority for cardholders for most transactions under the micropurchase limit, and therefore did not require any documentation of the purchase request or preapproval. This blanket authority may increase the risk that fraudulent, improper, and other abusive activity could occur. Following OMB guidance for documentation can help reduce such risks."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that GSA reemphasize OMB guidance to obtain and retain complete documentation of micropurchases, and that DOI require cardholders to document purchase request and preapproval for self-generated purchases.

Individual agencies decide  which bank to use to support their purchase card requirements and are  responsible for monitoring the actions of their cardholders as well as  issuing agency-specific policies and procedures on the appropriate use of  purchase cards.", "We have previously reported that using purchase cards for smaller  purchases has reduced administrative costs and increased the flexibility  to meet a variety of government needs; however, if not properly managed  and controlled, it can also expose the government to significant risk. In  our last government-wide review of the purchase card program issued in  2008, we found that internal-control weaknesses in agency purchase card  programs\u2014such as purchases without proper authorization or lacking  evidence that the goods and services were received by an independent  party\u2014left the government vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.", "In our 2008 report, we made a number of recommendations to GSA and  OMB to improve internal controls and management in the purchase card  program. OMB responded to our recommendations in part by issuing  revised guidance in 2009, and Congress subsequently imposed new  requirements to improve internal controls in the purchase card program  by enacting the Government Charge Card Abuse Prevention Act of 2012  (Charge Card Act). In light of these changes to the purchase card  program, and the predominance of micropurchases among purchase card  transactions, you asked us to conduct another government-wide review of  the purchase card program with a focus on micropurchases.", "This report addresses (1) what actions GSA and OMB have taken since  2008 to enhance program controls over micropurchases made using  government purchase cards, and (2) whether weaknesses exist in the  approval process for micropurchase transactions and, if so, whether there  are indicators of improper or potentially fraudulent purchases.", "To determine what actions GSA and OMB may have taken to enhance  program controls in the federal purchase card program, we reviewed  purchase card policies and guidance issued by OMB and GSA since  2008. In addition, we obtained and analyzed purchase card training data  from 2011 to 2015 from GSA, which were the most recently available data  at the time of our review. We determined that the training data were  sufficiently reliable for the purpose of reporting on the total number of  completed training per year.

On the day of the act\u2019s enactment, an Executive Order was  issued that directed agencies to expand the use of purchase cards and  take maximum advantage of the micropurchase authority provided in the  act. As a result, purchase card use broadened, improving the ability of  agencies to quickly and easily acquire items needed to support daily  operations and reducing the administrative costs associated with such  small purchases. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) designated  the purchase card as the preferred method of making micropurchases,  the threshold for which was set at $3,000 for the period of our review  (fiscal year 2014) and was raised to its current level, $3,500, for most  purchases, on October 1, 2015.", "Government purchase card spending grew rapidly from the late 1990s  into the early 2000s. During the 10-year period from fiscal year 1999  through 2008, annual purchase card spending increased by nearly 60  percent\u2014from about $14 billion in fiscal year 1999 to a peak of over $22  billion in fiscal year 2008, in 2015 dollars.

Of  these transactions, over 18.5 million (95 percent) were for  micropurchases, which accounted for about half of the total spending  using purchase cards ($8.7 billion). DOD and VA together accounted for  over three-fourths of all purchase card spending and about two-thirds of  all micropurchase spending in fiscal year 2014, as shown in table 1. DOD  micropurchase spending covered a wide range of items to support its  civilian and military operations, such as housing-repair services on a  military base. According to VA officials, the majority of VA\u2019s  micropurchase spending was through the Veterans Health Administration  for medical supplies for veterans.", "GSA\u2019s Center for Charge Card Management administers the SmartPay  charge card program, which includes purchase cards (for supplies and  services), travel cards (for airline, hotel, and related travel expenses),  fleet cards (for fuel and supplies for government vehicles), and integrated  cards (a combination of purchase, travel or fleet cards). GSA currently  maintains purchase card contracts\u2014as part of the SmartPay program\u2014 with three commercial banks. These three contracts are collectively  referred to as the GSA SmartPay2 Master Contract. The current master  contract base year began in November 2008. With all option years  included, it is set to expire in November 2018. According to GSA\u2019s  SmartPay website, the replacement of paper-driven acquisition processes  of the past with the use of purchase cards saves the government about  $1.7 billion annually in administrative costs. Further, when selecting which  bank to use for its purchase card program, an agency can negotiate with  its bank the terms for purchase card refunds under the purchase card  program\u2019s contract. These refunds are based on speed of payment and  volume of transactions and may also result in a cost savings for agencies.  GSA\u2019s SmartPay website indicates that the government has received  approximately $3 billion in refunds from purchase card spending since the  SmartPay program\u2019s inception in 1998.", "Along with deciding which bank to use to support its purchase card  requirements, individual agencies are responsible for monitoring the  actions of their cardholders as well as issuing agency-specific policies  and procedures on the appropriate use of purchase cards. Individual  cardholders have primary responsibility for the proper use of purchase  cards, including following agency policies and other acquisition laws and  regulations. Cardholders must also reconcile the transactions that appear  on their monthly statements with receipts and other supporting  documentation, and ensure records are maintained in accordance with  agency policies. Cardholders are assigned to an Approving Official (AO),  who is often the cardholder\u2019s supervisor.

According to HHS officials, PSC program administrators reviewed  the monthly statements for anomalies and occurrences of potentially  fraudulent purchases, but at the time of our review the agency did not  have a formal process of AO approval after the transaction posted to the  bank. Therefore, the transactions we identified had incomplete  documentation due to missing documentation of AO approval.

While the bank\u2019s online purchase card management  system enabled AOs to electronically approve transactions, the bank\u2019s  system did not retain transaction approval history information, including  final approval by the AO, beyond 2 years of the transaction. According to  the GSA SmartPay2 master contract and the FAR, in fiscal year 2014  contractors were required to maintain electronic records for a minimum of  3 years after payment. However, according to a bank official, the bank  did not consider the transaction approval process part of the transaction  but rather information appended through the online system. Under the  SmartPay2 master contract, the bank was only required to allow access  to that online system for 18 months. Failure to retain records for 3 years  after final payment limits the ability of the agency, GAO, and other  oversight groups to provide oversight of the program as part of an overall  effort to reduce instances of fraudulent, improper, and abusive purchase  card activity.", "As a result of our current review, GSA worked with the bank used by  these two agencies to develop short- and long-term solutions for the  retention of AO approval records. In the short term, the bank developed a  transaction-specific manual process to locate and produce AO approval  records for transactions that had aged out of the online system. The bank  also agreed to provide this manual service on a case-by-case basis for  audits and investigations for the duration of the SmartPay2 master  contract. In the longer term, GSA will pursue a contract modification in the  SmartPay2 master contract in fiscal year 2017 to further clarify review  and approval record-retention requirements, according to a GSA official.

According to OMB guidance,  documentation that a purchase cardholder should maintain to minimize  erroneous and improper purchases includes documentation of the  purchase request and preapproval for self-generated purchases.

Since 2008, GSA, OMB, and federal  agency purchase card managers have taken many steps to enhance their  oversight capabilities. New training and tools from GSA, and ongoing  guidance from GSA and OMB, provide agency purchase card managers  the opportunity to enhance their oversight of purchase card activity within  their agencies. While we found little evidence of potentially fraudulent  purchases in our current review\u2014which is an improvement from the  past\u2014documentation issues exist. We estimated that agencies had  incomplete documentation of the transaction approval process for 22  percent of fiscal year 2014 micropurchases. Maintaining sufficient  documentation as required by the Charge Card Act is an important  element of effective oversight of the purchase card program. The key  elements in managing the approval process of purchase card activity are  written documentation of the purchase request, including preapproval for  self-generated purchases; maintaining a receipt of the purchase; and  reconciling/approving the charge on the monthly bank statement. Absent  continued vigilance to ensure that data for all three elements are  consistently collected and maintained, agencies will not be able to confirm  the integrity of their purchase card programs. While federal government  purchases are vast and varied, of the agencies we reviewed only DOI  granted blanket purchase authority for cardholders for most transactions  under the micropurchase limit in fiscal year 2014.

Specifically, DOI noted that it  understands that risk assessment and mitigation is an ongoing process.  DOI said the department will continue evaluating its charge card policies  and procedures and update them as appropriate to maintain effective  controls that reduce the risk of fraud, waste, and misuse.

DOI noted that, as a field-based agency, its mission is carried out in many  remote locations outside of the traditional office environment (e.g.,  wildland fire fighting, law enforcement, and emergency response). As  such, according to DOI, it is not always possible or practical for  employees to obtain preapproval to make micropurchases. As discussed  in the report, we recognize that challenges may arise with obtaining  preapproval under some circumstances in the field. However, rather than  forgoing the preapproval process by granting blanket purchase authority,  we believe agencies can balance flexibility and management oversight in  the Integrated Card Program by defining broad, but not unlimited,  preauthorizations. For example, one agency in our review provided a  purchase cardholder with an annual preauthorization for a range of  purchases including engineering supplies, road crew supplies, and simple  services. After reexamining its policy, DOI could, for example, also  potentially exclude emergency situations from the preapproval  requirement.
