GAO's objectives were to (1) develop a profile of general and flag officer careers and (2) assess DOD's justification for its general and flag officer legislative proposals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["General and flag officers who have retired over the past several years typically retired at age 56 after having served an average of 33 years of active commissioned service and 3-1/2 years in their last pay grade. On average, retired general and flag officers were first promoted to general and flag officer at age 49, upon reaching 26 years of active commissioned service, and served 6 years as a general or flag officer before retiring. DOD did not present evidence that the legislative provisions it seeks to change hinder the management of general and flag officers or the agency's ability to perform its mission. DOD presented various rationales for its proposals and sponsored a study of general and flag officer management but did not provide data to support the need for these proposals. GAO found that DOD can achieve its goal of extending some general and flag officers' careers and assignments within the parameters of the current legislative framework since many general and flag officers retire several years before reaching the statutory retirement limits. More specifically, the career profile data show that more than three-fourths of general and flag officers who retired in grades O-9 and O-10 between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 could have served at least 3 more years before reaching the current statutory retirement limits. Existing legislative authority provides some flexibility in managing general and flag officers, but the Executive Branch has not made frequent use of this authority. In particular, the Executive Branch has rarely used its existing authority to defer the retirement of general and flag officers on a case-by-case basis beyond the statutory limits on age and years of service. Additionally, factors other than the statutory limits, such as personal considerations and military service culture, may account for early retirements of general and flag officers. GAO also found that the proposals (1) would reduce congressional oversight and provide broad latitude to the Executive Branch in managing general and flag officers, (2) could impede the upward flow of officers by limiting promotion opportunities due to the extension of general and flag officer careers, and (3) would likely increase federal retirement outlays for retirement compensation, based on a cost estimate developed by GAO."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["General and flag officers are the senior uniformed leaders of the armed  forces. Since 1996, Congress annually has authorized the military services  a total of nearly 900 active duty general and flag officers. A legislative  framework that has evolved over time shapes the careers of general and  flag officers and the management of these officers. For example, Congress  has enacted legislative provisions limiting the tenure of general and flag  officers, the terms they can serve in specified senior leadership positions,  and the distribution of general and flag officers across pay grades. Such  provisions reflect congressional interest in maintaining oversight and  accountability of general and flag officers. For fiscal year 2005, the  Department of Defense (DOD) has proposed eliminating or amending a  number of general and flag officer provisions to provide greater flexibility  in managing its senior uniformed leaders. Among DOD\u2019s stated goals of the  proposals are to extend the careers of general and flag officers and to  increase the length of individual assignments. The Secretary of Defense  has expressed interest in retaining experienced leaders beyond the current  statutory retirement limits. We initiated this review in response to a  mandate in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2003.  As subsequently agreed with your offices, we developed information and  analysis to assist Congress as it considers DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2005  legislative proposals.

The mandate required DOD to review the existing statutory  framework for the management of general and flag officers and submit any  recommendations for revising the framework. The mandate directed us to  evaluate DOD\u2019s recommendations. Our first report reviewed DOD\u2019s 2003  study of general and flag officer requirements and authorizations and  recommended actions that DOD could take to clarify its general and flag  officer requirements. For example, we recommended that DOD clarify the  magnitude and impact between DOD\u2019s validated requirements for general  and flag officers and congressional authorizations, to include an analysis  of the impact caused by the workarounds DOD uses to fill the gap between  requirements and authorizations.", "To conduct this study, we analyzed career data on retired general and flag  officers who retired between fiscal years 1997 and 2002. We also reviewed  DOD\u2019s rationale and supporting evidence for the legislative proposals,  reviewed the legislative history of provisions affecting general and flag  officers, and obtained information from the military services on the  management of general and flag officers. We also obtained the perspective  of several senior retired general and flag officers and other knowledgeable  individuals with experience in general and flag officer policy and  management. We focused our analysis on the active duty population,  although some of the proposals would also apply to reserve general and  flag officers.

Regarding the retirement age proposal, for  example, DOD stated that two cons were a reduction in opportunities for  organizational change that naturally occur with new leadership and a  reduction in opportunities for promotion to general and flag officer.  Moreover, a data-driven analysis also would have given DOD an  opportunity to consider other options for achieving its goal of extending  general and flag officer careers. For instance, it could have analyzed  options for extending military service of more general and flag officers to  the current statutory retirement age, raising the retirement age by 1 or  2 years versus 6 years, raising the deferment age above age 64, or  increasing the number of authorized age deferments beyond the 10 that  are currently allowed.", "The career profile data we developed show that large numbers of general  and flag officers are retiring several years before the statutory retirement  limits on age and years of active commissioned service.

Altogether, these 133 officers represent 77 percent  of the 172 general and flag officers who retired in these pay grades. The  data suggests that large numbers of senior officers could serve at least one  more assignment prior to retirement under the existing legislative  framework. Factors other than the statutory retirement limits may affect  the career length of general and flag officers. Some of the retired general  and flag officers we interviewed noted that many general and flag officers  in their 50s explore their employment options outside the military to  increase stability for their family and earn higher salaries. Some noted a  \u201cburnout\u201d factor associated with their work as a general and flag officer.  Another factor is a military culture, as expressed in service policies and  practices, that encourages general and flag officers to move aside and  make way for others coming up through the ranks.

The RAND study, using the private sector as a model, identified  strategies for managing general and flag officers that would increase the  time they spend in assignments, the time spent in grade, and total career  length. RAND recommended that the services categorize their general and  flag officer positions as either \u201cdeveloping\u201d or \u201cusing\u201d positions and  determine the desired tenure for each, with a general goal of 2 years for  developing positions and 4 years for using positions. However, RAND  was not specifically tasked in its study to include an analysis of the  legislative proposals, and such an analysis was not included. RAND  concluded that the management changes it suggested could be  implemented largely within DOD\u2019s current legislative authority. Title 10  authority permitting 40-year careers for officers in pay grade O-10 and  38 years for O-9s coupled with a statutory retirement age of 62 generally is  sufficient, the RAND study stated. RAND added that changes in law could  give the services more flexibility to implement its recommended  management changes. For example, allowing officers to retire with less  than 3 years time in grade would allow them to leave as needed. Also,  RAND saw no reason the military retirement age should not increase from  age 62.

The current legislative framework establishes congressional  oversight of officer management through several provisions of Title 10 that  require the President to seek the advice and consent of the Senate in order  to promote or appoint military officers. For example, Title 10 states that  appointments made to grades above O-3 by the President require the  advice and consent of the Senate. Prior to such codifications in Title 10,  the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 contained Senate confirmation  requirements, stating that officers were entitled to the rank, title, pay, and  allowances of a general or lieutenant general only when appointed in such  positions by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the  Senate. The confirmation process also is designed to disclose any  important adverse information about the nominated officer and provides  an opportunity for discussion between nominees and Members of  Congress.

DOD officials have stated that the  proposals, if approved, would be used sparingly in cases where their use is  deemed appropriate. For instance, DOD could use its proposed new  authorities to extend the career of an officer who holds a key  policy-making, operational, or acquisition position if maintaining  continuity in that position is deemed to be in DOD\u2019s best interests.  However, DOD did not present a plan showing how it would institute the  proposed new authorities if approved. The proposed new authorities could  be applied extensively and for purposes other than those currently  intended by DOD. For example, although DOD has stated that one of its  goals is to increase the length of assignments, DOD could use the  authorities to extend the careers of senior officers while continuing to  shift them from assignment to assignment with the same frequency as  today. DOD could also choose to lengthen the time it takes for an officer  to be promoted to general and flag officer rank with the knowledge that  extra time could be gained at the end of the officer\u2019s career. In addition,  the proposed new authorities would not preclude DOD from extending the  careers of numerous general and flag officers rather than a selected few as  DOD has stated is its intent. Currently, the maximum number of age  deferments authorized at any one time is 10 officers above pay grade O-8;  DOD has proposed eliminating this limit. In addition, DOD has proposed  eliminating existing provisions that require most general and flag officers  to serve at least 3 years time in grade in order to retire in that grade. Under  its proposed new authorities, DOD could retire numerous general and flag  officers in their current pay grade after they have served satisfactorily for  a few months, weeks, or even days.", "On the other hand, he should not remain indefinitely as the head of that service.

Therefore,  upward flow could be impeded if some general and flag officers are  retained longer on active duty.", "Promotion of a steady and predictable upward flow of officers from junior  to more senior positions is a long-standing precept of military officer  management that is grounded in the legislative framework. The \u201cup-or-out\u201d  promotion system, created by the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, requires  most commissioned officers at or below pay grade O-4 who have twice  been passed over for promotion to leave military service. The up-or-out  system, among other things, creates promotion opportunities for lower  level officers, limits stagnation, and maintains youth and vigor in the  officer corps. As instituted under the Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act of 1980, expectations are built into the officer  management system concerning the points in an officer\u2019s career when  promotions should occur from one pay grade to the next higher level. In  hearings preceding adoption of the Defense Officer Personnel  Management Act, DOD affirmed the value of the up-and-out system in  fostering a combat ready military. A DOD official also stated that the  up-or-out system eliminated the turbulence and errors associated with  replacing an aged senior leadership and provided a regularized way of  replacing people that maintains a proper age and experience balance.", "Service policies on general and flag officer management also promote  upward flow by encouraging general and flag officers to retire prior to the  statutory limits.", "According to a 2002 Navy policy issued by the Chief of Naval Operations,  a steady process of both promotions and retirements goes hand-in-hand in  the flag community. Since the Navy operates with fixed authorizations,  flag officers promote to vacancies and vacancies come from retirements.  The policy states that to maintain upward flow, there will come a time  when all flag officers must acknowledge the need to step aside and make  room for the youth, vigor, and vitality of those more junior flag officers.  The Navy policy establishes specific retirement expectations for flag  officers in grades O-7 and O-8 and reinforces the Navy\u2019s practice of not  relying on statutory retirements.  In 2004, the Marine Corps reiterated its general and flag officer retirement  policy to support the service\u2019s goal of maintaining a steady promotion  flow. The policy states that general officers in pay grade O-7 who twice  have been passed over for promotion should voluntarily retire after  30 years of service and general officers in pay grade O-8 who have not  been nominated for appointment to a higher position should plan to  voluntarily retire after 3 years time in grade.

According to an Army official, the Army rescinded this policy because  Title 10 restrictions were deemed to be sufficient.", "Air Force officials told us they did not currently have a written policy on  the timing of general officer retirements. A former senior official we  interviewed who was familiar with Air Force policy told us that while the  Air Force did not have a written policy, general officers were orally briefed  that they were expected to retire after 3 years in grade if they were not  selected for promotion.", "The potential effects of impeding the upward flow of general and flag  officers are reduced promotion opportunities, stagnation, and aging of the  general and flag officer population. However, the impact would depend on  the extent that DOD uses its proposed authority to extend general and flag  officer careers. Some of the former senior officials we interviewed thought  that youth and vigor should be maintained and that aging the general and  flag officer population would therefore be a mistake. Concern was also  expressed about the creation of promotion bottlenecks and the possibility  that older general and flag officers may become out of touch with current  technology, training, and other aspects of the military. Others were not  concerned about aging this population, stating that individuals are  different and their vigor should not be judged based solely on age. Life  expectancy in the United States increased by about 10 years (16 percent)  since the Officer Personnel Act of 1947 and about 3 years (5 percent) since  the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act of 1980.", "Upward flow could be retained under DOD\u2019s proposal to eliminate the  statutory requirement that an officer must serve 3 years time in grade in  order to retire in that grade. Currently, other statutory provisions allow for  a small number of individuals to retire with less than 3 years time in  grade. Eliminating the time-in-grade requirement would theoretically  enable the services to balance the extensions of some general and flag  officer careers with the earlier retirement of other officers in order to  continue the upward flow of officers. The 3-year rule was instituted under  the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act. The former senior  officials we interviewed generally favored some time-in-grade requirement  rather than eliminating the requirement altogether. They stated that at  least a year or two is needed for newly promoted individuals to learn their  new job, make an impact on the organization, and recover from any early  mistakes. A time-in-grade requirement also gives the service time to assess  the performance and future potential of these officers.", "Another DOD proposal that could affect the upward flow of general and  flag officers is the elimination of the statutory limit requiring that no more  than 50 percent of a service\u2019s general or flag officers serve in a pay grade  above O-7. Eliminating this limit could result in an increase in the number  of positions at pay grade O-8 and a decrease in the number of positions at  pay grade O-7. Consequently, the services may have to be less selective in  promoting general and flag officers from pay grade O-7 to O-8. For  instance, the Marine Corps already promotes, on average, 71 percent of its  general and flag officers from pay grade O-7 to O-8. If its pool of O-8  positions increases relative to the O-7 pool, the Marine Corps would have  to promote an even larger percentage of officers from pay grade O-7,  thereby decreasing selectivity. Service officials said that the job structure  for their general and flag officers is based on the current 50-percent  distribution limit. DOD reviewed its general and flag officer positions in  2003 and validated requirements for 1,039 active duty general and flag  officer positions, including 524 (50 percent) at the O-7 pay grade. Some of  the former senior officials we interviewed expressed concerns about  removing the distribution limit. The current limit creates a pyramid-shaped  general and flag officer corps, with a large pool of O-7s at the base and  fewer numbers at each higher rank. This pyramid shape enables the  services to manage their general and flag officers in a way that allows for  predictability and selectivity."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposed Compensation Changes Would Increase Federal Retirement Outlays", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of DOD\u2019s retirement compensation proposals to remove the  basic pay cap and the 75-percent cap shows that, if implemented, they  would likely result in an increase in federal retirement outlays. Based on a  cost estimate we developed, federal retirement outlays would increase by  a total of approximately $55 million in fiscal year 2004 dollars over a  10-year period. Outlays over the longer term would continue to grow as  more general and flag officers retire under the revised formulas and  continue to receive higher retirement pay over their lifetime. Information  on how we calculated this cost estimate, including the limitations of our  methodology, is provided in the scope and methodology section at the end  of this letter. We did not calculate the annual amount that would have to  be appropriated for the military retirement fund if the proposals were  implemented.", "DOD did not develop a cost estimate for its general and flag officer  proposals. DOD officials, however, stated that the costs of its proposals  taken together would be minimal because a smaller number of officers  would serve longer in senior positions than is currently the case.  A Congressional Budget Office analysis of legislative provisions to allow  certain senior officers to remain on active duty longer and others to retire  with less time in grade would have an insignificant impact on direct  spending. According to the Congressional Budget Office analysis, the  costs and benefits of these adjustments would offset each other. The  Congressional Budget Office analysis did not include the retirement  compensation proposals.", "DOD stated that its proposals to improve retirement pay would provide  greater incentive for general and flag officers to remain on active duty and  would provide more appropriate compensation for general and flag  officers who serve longer careers. Our interviews with retired general and  flag officers indicated that retirement pay was not a driving factor in their  decision about when to retire. Some expressed the opinion that retirement  pay was adequate, while others stated that retirement pay should be  improved to recognize and reward longer military service.", "Retirement pay for general and flag officers, as well as other  servicemembers, is based on a servicemember\u2019s basic pay while on active  duty times a multiplier. The multiplier is equal to 2.5 percent times  their years of service. At this rate, retirement pay rises from 50 percent of  basic pay with 20 years of service until reaching 75 percent of basic pay  with 30 years of service. At that point, retirement pay is capped at  75 percent of basic pay. Based on basic pay rates effective January 1, 2004,  the maximum basic pay for a general or flag officer (for an officer in pay  grade O-10 with more than 26 years of service) is $13,304 per month, or  $159,654 per year. However, a legislative cap on basic pay limits basic pay  to the rate of pay for level III of the Executive Schedule, which for 2004  equals the rate of $12,050 per month, or $144,600 per year.", "Our analysis of DOD\u2019s retirement compensation proposals shows that  DOD\u2019s proposal to eliminate the basic pay cap would increase retirement  pay for officers in pay grade O-10, although general and flag officers at  lower pay grades could be affected in later years if basic pay increases at a  faster rate than the cap. DOD\u2019s proposal to eliminate the 75-percent  retirement pay cap would increase retirement pay for general and flag  officers at any pay grade who retire with more than 30 years of service.  Table 6 shows the estimated impact of eliminating one or both of these  caps on a general or flag officer\u2019s retirement pay.

In addition, service Secretaries may  defer the retirement of officers in the health professions and the chaplain  corps until age 68 if such a deferral is deemed to be in the best interest of  the military service. Title 10 also authorizes a service Secretary, based on  the needs of the service, to defer the retirement of officers in the grades  of O-7 and O-8 for up to 5 years beyond their years of service limit.  Deferment for any officer in a grade above O-8 requires Presidential  approval.", "The Executive Branch has not made frequent use of its existing authority  to extend the careers of general and flag officers. Although DOD does not  track the extent that this authority is used, DOD officials told us it has  been used rarely. For instance, they stated that just one age deferment was  currently in effect. Our analysis showed that few general and flag officers  have exceeded the statutory retirement limits. Only three general and flag  officers who retired between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 exceeded the age  62 limit, and eight general and flag officers exceeded the years of service  limits. According to an official in the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense (Personnel and Readiness), Officer and Enlisted Personnel  Management, the existing authority to extend general and flag officer  careers is seldom used because DOD prefers not to sanction routine  exceptions to the normal retirement limits. The official also characterized  the department\u2019s process for gaining approval of these exceptions as  onerous and time-consuming. DOD\u2019s procedures call for six individuals to  approve a deferment\u2014the service chief, the service secretary, the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the Under Secretary of Defense  (Personnel and Readiness), the Secretary of Defense, and the President.  Some deferments, however, do not have a statutory requirement for  approval beyond the service secretary. In addition, deferments have been  included as part of the Presidential nomination process rather than treated  as separate actions. In such cases, the nomination package from the  Secretary of Defense to the President requesting appointment of an officer  to a general and flag officer position simultaneously requests Presidential  approval of a retirement deferment if a deferment is determined to be  required for the officer to serve in the position.", "While DOD expressed misgivings about using its existing legislative  authority to exceed statutory retirement limits, DOD could make greater  use of this authority in order to extend the careers of general and flag  officers on a case-by-case basis.

Furthermore, some of the proposed changes  would reduce congressional oversight of general and flag officers and  could impede the upward flow of general and flag officers. DOD may have  options for extending the careers and assignments of general and flag  officers without raising the statutory retirement age or the limit on  total years of active commissioned service. Efforts to extend general and  flag officer careers, however, would have to account for factors other than  the statutory limits that have a role in the timing of general and flag officer  retirements\u2014factors including personal considerations and a military  culture that encourages senior leaders to step aside and make way for  others to move up. DOD also has the authority, on a case-by-case basis, to  extend general and flag officer careers beyond the statutory retirement  limits. We see no reason for DOD not to use this authority to the fullest  extent allowable under the law. If DOD makes full use of its existing  legislative authority but finds that it is inadequate to achieve its goal of  retaining experienced leaders, then it may be in a better position to argue  for changes to this authority.

In its comments,  DOD did not concur with our recommendation and stated that it opposed  the premise that the desired flexibility can be achieved within the current  statutory framework. We recognize that the national security mission,  including the Global War on Terrorism and transformation of the force,  presents increasing complexities for military leaders, and we do not take  issue with the department\u2019s position that it needs experienced and agile  senior leaders. The question is whether the current legislative framework  has hindered DOD\u2019s ability to manage general and flag officers effectively  or the agency\u2019s performance. We continue to believe that DOD has not  presented a sound business case to support the need for changing the  existing legislative framework. This is not to say that changes are not  needed for the future, but that DOD has not provided data to make a  determination either way. Unless and until a business case for change is  made, we believe our recommendation will help DOD maximize the use of  its current legislative authorities in order to retain experienced leaders. In  addition, DOD already has the authority to extend the careers of some  general and flag officers beyond the statutory retirement limits but has  rarely used this authority. For example, as noted in our report, just one  age deferment was in effect at the time of our review.", "DOD stated that options for extending general and flag officer careers  within the existing legislative framework were considered by the RAND  study and found wanting. However, the statement of work for the study  established a broad objective to assess the management and policy  implications of potential changes in military officer management and  policy. The statement of work did not address specifically DOD\u2019s  legislative proposals for general and flag officer management. The main  thrust of the RAND study was to assess options for varying the length and  number of general and flag officer assignments rather than a review of the  existing legislative framework. RAND advocated that the military services  establish goals on the desired length of assignments based on the nature of  the positions. RAND concluded that the changes it suggested to improve  the management of general and flag officer careers could be implemented  largely within DOD\u2019s current legislative framework, although changes in  law (such as extending the statutory retirement age) could give the  services more flexibility to implement RAND\u2019s recommendations.", "In its comments, DOD stated that it should not have to justify its legislative  proposals by identifying failures in the current general and flag officer  management system. Our report does not imply that this is the standard  for seeking management improvements. However, DOD did not provide  data to support its assertions that there were existing problems with the  current system\u2014such as organizational instability and inconsistent  leadership\u2014that the current statutory framework was a cause of these  problems, or that the proposals would be effective in addressing these  problems. In the absence of data, it is difficult to judge DOD\u2019s assertions  that the proposed authorities are needed. Moreover, a data-driven analysis  may have identified other options for achieving DOD\u2019s goal of extending  general and flag officer careers. Our report provides examples of such  options.", "DOD, in its comments, further stated that retaining senior, experienced  leaders requires a systemic change to the management of general and flag  officers. Making greater use of its existing authorities to extend general  and flag officer careers on a case-by-case basis would, according to DOD,  provide only marginal opportunities for improvement and would be less  preferable than a set of statutes designed to encourage retention of  experienced officers. The issue of whether DOD should make more  extensive use of existing authorities in lieu of the systemic changes it  seeks depends in part on DOD\u2019s intentions for extending the careers of  general and flag officers. During our review, we were told the legislative  proposals, if approved, would be used sparingly in cases where their use is  deemed appropriate. If that is still the case, then making greater use of the  existing authorities could be sufficient for achieving this goal. If DOD  makes greater use of these authorities and ultimately finds them to be  inadequate, then the department may be in a better position to argue for  changes to the existing statutes. As we noted in our report, however, DOD  had not presented an implementation plan, and the proposed new  authorities could be applied more extensively or for purposes other than  those currently intended by DOD.", "DOD also stated that our report did not adequately address the  relationship between service policy and culture and the existing statutory  authorities. DOD stated that the services have had to adopt more stringent  criteria than the law allows to ensure an orderly transition of senior  officers as they approach their statutory age and tenure limits and to avoid  organizational turmoil and personal hardship. Our report states, however,  that a steady upward flow of officers is grounded in the legislative  framework and reinforced by service policies on general and flag officer  management. Because DOD is authorized a fixed number of general and  flag officers, vacancies must open up in the general and flag officer pay  grades in order to allow for promotions of lower-grade officers. The  service policies cited in our report appear to be aimed primarily at  ensuring that general and flag officers will retire when their services are  no longer needed rather than on avoiding problems with the current  statutory retirement limits. In addition, the Army\u2019s decision to rescind its  policy is inconsistent with DOD\u2019s comment that the services have needed  to adopt more stringent criteria than the law allows. As our report states,  many general and flag officers are retiring several years before reaching  their statutory limits on age and years of commissioned service. For  example, more than three-fourths of general and flag officers who retired  in grades O-9 and O-10 between fiscal years 1997 and 2002 could have  served 3 or more years before reaching the current statutory retirement  limits. Factors other than the statutory limits, such as personal  considerations and military service culture, may account for early  retirements of general and flag officers. As part of our recommendation,  we state that DOD should assess these factors as part of its evaluation of  options for extending general and flag officer careers within the current  legislative framework.", "Finally, in its comments, DOD stated that the costs associated with the  retirement compensation proposals would be offset by a reduction in the  number of O-10 retirees and the fact that longer service means fewer years  of actual retirement per retiree. DOD added that a detailed discussion of  this point is provided in the RAND study. DOD, however, has not analyzed  the long-term cost implications of its retirement compensation proposals.  In addition, while the RAND study contains a discussion of retirement  compensation and recommends that DOD consider changes in this area, it  does not provide an analysis of long-term cost implications. RAND  officials told us that they developed some rough cost estimates but that a  cost analysis was not part of their study objectives. We continue to believe  that a full assessment of the retirement compensation proposals should  include a cost analysis. In addition, it should be noted that the proposal to  remove the 75-percent cap would increase retirement pay for general and  flag officers at any pay grade\u2014not just O-10s\u2014who retire with more than  30 years of service.", "DOD\u2019s comments are reprinted in appendix II of this letter."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To develop a career profile of general and flag officers, we obtained data  from the Defense Manpower Data Center covering fiscal years 1997 to  2002.
