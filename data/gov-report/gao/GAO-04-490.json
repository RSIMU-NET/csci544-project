However, researchers disagree about the extent of harm to human health from this transference. Many studies have found that the use of antibiotics in animals poses significant risks for human health, but a small number of studies contend that the health risks of the transference are minimal. Federal agencies have expanded their efforts to assess the extent of antibiotic resistance, but the effectiveness of their efforts to reduce human health risk is not yet known. FDA, CDC, and USDA have increased their surveillance activities related to antibiotic resistance. In addition, FDA has taken administrative action to prohibit the use of a fluroquinolone in poultry. FDA has identified animal drugs that are critically important for human health and begun reviewing currently approved drugs using a risk assessment framework that it recently issued for determining the human health risks of animal antibiotics. However, because FDA's initial reviews of approved animal drugs using this framework have focused on other drugs and have taken at least 2 years, FDA's reviews of critically important drugs may not be completed for some time. Although federal agencies have made some progress in monitoring antibiotic resistance, they lack important data on antibiotic use in animals to support research on human health risks. These data, such as the type and quantity of antibiotics and purpose for their use by species, are needed to determine the linkages between antibiotic use in animals and emerging resistant bacteria. In addition, these data can help assess human health risks from this use and develop and evaluate strategies for mitigating resistance. The United States and several of its key agricultural trading partners and competitors differ in their use of antibiotics in animals in two important areas: the specific antibiotics allowed for growth promotion and availability of antibiotics to producers (by prescription or over the counter). For example, the United States and Canada allow some antibiotics important in human medicine to be used for growth promotion, but the European Union (EU) and New Zealand do not. Regarding over the counter sales of antibiotics, the United States is generally less restrictive than the EU. Antibiotic use in animals has not yet been a significant factor affecting U.S. international trade in meat and poultry, although the presence of antibiotic residues in meat has had some impact, according to government and industry officials. Instead, countries raise other food safety issues, such as hormone use and animal diseases. However, according to these officials, antibiotic use in animals may emerge as a factor in the future. They particularly noted that the EU could object to U.S. use of antibiotics for growth promotion as its member countries are phasing out that use."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Antibiotic resistance is a serious and growing public health problem. As  resistance to antibiotics develops in disease-producing bacteria, it can  become difficult to treat diseases that were formerly treatable with  antibiotics, and this can have deadly consequences. Treating antibiotic- resistant infections often requires the use of more expensive drugs and can  result in longer hospital stays. According to Institute of Medicine estimates,  the annual cost of treating antibiotic-resistant infections may be as high as  $3 billion. Experts cite the widespread use of antibiotics in human  medicine as the principal cause of resistance, but they identify the use of  antibiotics in animals raised for human consumption as contributing to  antibiotic resistance in humans. It is generally agreed that a large  proportion of the antibiotics used in the United States is administered to  animals raised for human consumption.", "While antibiotic use in animals poses potential human health risks, it also  reduces the cost of producing these animals, which in turn helps reduce the  prices consumers pay for food. Antibiotics are an integral part of animal  production in the United States and many other countries where large  numbers of livestock and poultry are raised in confined facilities, which  increases the likelihood of disease. Antibiotics are used to treat animal  diseases; to prevent the spread of diseases that are known to occur during  those phases of production when animals are at a high risk of disease (e.g.,  when animals have been transported to a new location); and to increase  animals\u2019 growth rate. Consumer groups argue that antibiotic use would be  reduced if different animal production methods were used. Public health  officials are particularly concerned about the use of antibiotics in animals  to promote growth because antibiotics used for growth promotion are  administered in low doses over long periods of time to large groups of  animals that are not sick. This practice can allow animals to become  reservoirs of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If a person becomes ill from  handling or ingesting meat or poultry contaminated with antibiotic- resistant bacteria, the infection may be resistant to treatment not only with  the antibiotic of choice for that infection but also with other antibiotics in  the same class of drugs. Use of antibiotics in animals also may lead to the  transference of resistance from one type of bacteria to another type.", "Three federal agencies are primarily responsible for protecting Americans  from the health risk associated with the transfer of antibiotic-resistant  bacteria from meat and poultry to the humans who handle or consume  these products. The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS)  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approves for sale and regulates the  manufacture and distribution of antibiotics used in animals. HHS\u2019s Centers  for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) conducts surveillance and other  research to assess the extent of antibiotic resistance in humans from  animals. The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) gathers data on  antibiotic resistance in animals, conducts surveillance, and funds  epidemiologic and other research on antibiotic resistance in humans,  animals, and the environment. In addition, internationally, the World Health  Organization (WHO) and the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) have  been examining these issues.", "In 1999, we reported that the development and spread of antibiotic- resistant bacteria is a worldwide phenomenon and that the widespread use  of various antibiotics has created the potential for U.S. public health costs  to increase. We further reported that the extent to which the agricultural  use of antibiotics contributes to antibiotic-resistant bacteria in humans is  uncertain and recommended that HHS and USDA work together to develop  and implement a plan with specific goals, time frames, and resources  needed for determining the safe use of antibiotics in agriculture. In  response, in January 2001, the federal Interagency Task Force on  Antimicrobial Resistance, which is composed of FDA, CDC, and USDA, and  several other agencies, issued an action plan to address antibiotic  resistance issues, including those associated with antibiotic use in animals.

These changes can include the transfer of  DNA from resistant bacteria, as well as spontaneous changes, or mutations,  in a bacterium\u2019s own DNA. The DNA coding for antibiotic resistance is  located on the chromosome or plasmid of a bacterium. Plasmid-based  resistance is transferred more readily than chromosomal-based resistance.  Once acquired, the genetically determined antibiotic resistance is passed  on to future generations and sometimes to other bacterial species. The  dose of antibiotic and length of time bacteria are exposed to the antibiotic  are major factors affecting whether the resistant bacteria population will  dominate.

Most chickens are  colonized with campylobacter bacteria, which they harbor in their  intestines, but which do not make them sick. Fluoroquinolones are given to  flocks of chickens when some birds are found to have certain infections  caused by E. coli.

Because fluoroquinolone resistance is located on  the chromosome of campylobacter, the resistance is generally not  transferred to other species of bacteria.

Molecular subtyping found that  human isolates with this strain of multidrug resistance in Salmonella  enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104 in 1995 were indistinguishable from  human isolates with this strain tested in 1985 and 1990. These results  indicated that the widespread emergence of multidrug resistance in  Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium DT104 may have been due to  dissemination of a strain already present in the United States.

A particular concern is the possibility that vancomycin- resistant enterococci could transfer resistance to other bacteria. Some  Staphylococcus aureus infections found in hospitals are resistant to all  antibiotics except vancomycin, and human health can be adversely  affected, as treatment could be difficult, if not impossible, if these strains  develop resistance to vancomycin, too.

However, the  United States and Australia are currently conducting risk assessments to  determine whether to continue to allow the use of some of these antibiotics  for growth promotion. Canada plans to conduct similar risk assessments,  and Japan is reviewing the use of antibiotics for growth promotion if those  antibiotics are from classes used in humans. In contrast, New Zealand has  completed its risk assessments of antibiotics used for growth promotion  and no longer allows the use of any antibiotics for growth promotion that  are also related to antibiotics used in human medicine. Similarly, the EU  has prohibited its member countries from using antibiotics in feed for  growth promotion if those antibiotics are from antibiotic classes used in  human medicine.

The United States, Canada, and South Korea allow  antibiotics from the macrolide class for growth promotion, but the EU  and New Zealand do not. In the United States, tylosin, a member of this  class, is among the most commonly used antibiotics for growth  promotion in swine. As of March 2003, Australia allowed antibiotics  from the macrolide class for growth promotion, but it had a review  under way on some antibiotics in this class, including tylosin, to  determine if growth promotion use should continue.", "Penicillins and tetracyclines.

As  USDA reported in 2003, antibiotic use in animals could become a trade  issue if certain countries apply their regulations on antibiotic use in  animals to their imports. For example, according to some government and  industry officials, the United States\u2019 use of antibiotics could become a trade  issue with the EU as it phases out its use of all antibiotics for growth  promotion by 2006.

In evaluating the safety of animal drugs, FDA considers their effect on  human health. Such drugs are safe in this regard if there is reasonable  certainty of no harm to humans when the drug is used as approved. Using  this critieria, FDA has determined that the potential health risk from  transference of antibiotic resistance from animals to humans is  unacceptable and must be a part of FDA\u2019s regulation of animal antibiotics.", "FDA, CDC, and USDA have made progress in their efforts to assess the  extent of antibiotic resistance from the use of antibiotics in animals  through both individual and collaborative efforts, including work through  the Interagency Task Force. However, the effectiveness of these efforts  remains unknown. FDA has developed guidance to evaluate antibiotics  used in animals and intends to review all new drug applications and  antibiotics currently approved for use with animals for this risk to  determine if it needs to act to ensure that the drugs are safe. Although FDA  has recently begun the reviews using this approach, its initial reviews have  been for drugs other than those that are critically important for human  health. FDA officials do not know how long each review will require. In  addition, it is not yet known what actions FDA would take if concerns  became evident. Although the agency has the authority to deny or  withdraw approval of new or approved animal antibiotics that pose such a  risk, FDA also has a variety of other options available. However, FDA  action to prohibit the use of fluoroquinolone antibiotics in poultry has  continued for more than 3 years.", "Finally, researchers and federal agencies still do not have critical data on  antibiotic use in animals that would help them more definitively determine  any linkage between use in animals and emerging resistant bacteria, assess  the relative contribution of this use to antibiotic resistance in humans, and  develop strategies to mitigate antibiotic resistance. The experience of  countries such as Denmark indicates that data collection efforts are helpful  when making risk-based decisions about antibiotic use in animals. While  we recognize that there are costs associated with collecting additional data  on antibiotic use in animals, options exist for collecting these data that are  not cost-prohibitive. For example, the United Kingdom\u2019s efforts to collect  national sales data on antibiotic use in animals use relatively few  resources. In addition, existing federal programs, such as FDA\u2019s ongoing  monitoring of approved antibiotics and USDA\u2019s CAHFSE, can provide a  data collection framework that can be expanded to begin collecting the  needed data. FDA, CDC, and USDA recognize the importance of such  information and have taken some steps to collect data, although they have  not yet developed an overall collection strategy.

Regarding our conclusion that antibiotic- resistant salmonella and campylobacter bacteria have been transferred  from animals to humans, USDA agreed that it is likely that a transfer has  occurred. However, USDA suggested that some of the studies we cited to  support that conclusion were, by themselves, inadequate to support a  causal link. We believe that our conclusion is firmly supported by a body of  scientific evidence, but we have clarified our description of some studies in  response to USDA\u2019s comments. On the issue of human health risks, USDA  commented that we cited few sources of scientific evidence to support the  view that the human health risks from the transference of antibiotic- resistant bacteria are minimal. We found that only a few studies have  concluded that the risk is minimal, while many studies have concluded that  there is a significant human health risk from the transference. With respect  to our recommendation that USDA and HHS jointly develop and implement  a plan for collecting data on antibiotic use in animals, USDA stated that our  report highlights the importance of the data that the CAHFSE program  could provide on the impact of antibiotic use in various animal species.

HHS provided references to additional research studies that  support our conclusion. We were aware of all of the studies cited by HHS,  but we did not include them in the report because we believe that our  conclusion was already amply supported. Regarding our conclusion that  researchers disagree about the extent of human health risk caused by the  transference of antibiotic resistance, HHS provided information from an  unpublished study that found that the course of illness was significantly  longer for persons with antibiotic-resistant campylobacter cases than for  those with antibiotic-susceptible infections. Most of the studies we  identified found modest but significant human health consequences,  similar to those in the unpublished study described in HHS\u2019s comments.  Regarding our recommendation that the agencies jointly develop and  implement a plan for collecting data on antibiotic use in animals, HHS  stated that the most useful and reliable antibiotic use data are those  maintained by pharmaceutical companies. HHS said current regulations  would have to be revised to put the data that pharmaceutical companies  are required to report to FDA in a more relevant format for research on  antibiotic resistance.

Specifically, these studies estimate  the economic effects of a partial and/or total ban of antibiotics used in  animals. For several decades, antibiotics have been used for a variety of  production management reasons, from therapeutic uses to increased  productivity, such as feed efficiency or weight gain. In economic terms,  higher productivity results in more final product supplied to the market, at  a lower cost to consumers. Despite the use of a variety of economic  models, assumptions about model parameters, and data sets, the economic  impacts on consumers and producers of the studies that we identified were  generally comparable. Overall, the studies conclude that a ban or partial  ban on antibiotics in animal production would increase costs to producers,  decrease production, and increase retail prices to consumers. For example,  the studies indicate that the elimination of antibiotic use in pork  production could increase costs to producers ranging from $2.76 to $6.05  per animal, which translates into increased consumer costs for pork  ranging from $180 million per year to over $700 million per year. Table 2  summarizes the eight studies.", "While these market effects are important to both producers and consumers  of livestock products, they must be balanced against the health care costs  of antibiotic resistance due to agricultural uses of antibiotics. Potential  health costs imposed by increased antibiotic resistance include more  hospitalizations, higher mortality rates, and higher research costs to find  new and more powerful drugs. From the point of view of proposals to  reduce antibiotic use, these potential costs represent the benefits from  reduced antibiotic use. These costs to society, however, are difficult to  measure because of limited data on antibiotic use and resistance as well as  the problematic nature of measuring the value of a human life. Moreover,  while there are some estimates of the costs of antibiotic resistance from  both medical and agricultural sources, no estimates exist that directly link  the human health costs of antibiotic resistance with antibiotics used in  animal production. Nevertheless, studies that have examined the costs of  antibiotic resistance from all sources have found a wide range of estimates  running into the millions and billions of dollars annually. For example, one  recent study (2003) estimated that the health cost to society associated  with resistance from only one antibiotic, amoxicillin, was $225 million per  year.", "We discuss the eight studies we reviewed in reverse chronological order,  from 2003 to 1999. Most examine restrictions on antibiotics in the swine  industry, but a few look at the beef and poultry industries as well.

As part of this effort, Denmark\u2019s National Committee for Pigs  estimated that the cost of removing antibiotic growth promoters in  Denmark totaled about $1.04 per pig, or a 1 percent increase in total  production costs. In the case of poultry, however, there was no net cost  because the savings associated with not purchasing these antibiotics offset  the cost associated with the reduction in feed efficiency. Components of  these costs included excess mortality, excess feeding days, increased  medication, and increased workload.", "A subsequent study by Jacobsen and Jensen (2003) used these costs as part  of the agriculture sector of a general equilibrium model to estimate the  impact on the Danish economy of the termination of antibiotic growth  promoters.

In  1998, the Danish government instituted a voluntary ban on the use of  antibiotics in pork production at the finishing stage, and in 2000 it banned  antibiotics for growth promotion at both the weaning and the finishing  stages. The results of the ban in Denmark, however, may be more  applicable than the Swedish experience because, like the United States,  Denmark is one of the largest exporters of pork and has somewhat similar  production practices. The authors compared the econometric results of a  U.S. baseline without a ban with projected results based on assumptions  taken from the ban in Denmark. Many of the same technical and economic  assumptions that were used in the Swedish study were also used for the  impacts based on the Danish ban. For instance, the authors included a sort- loss cost of $0.64 per animal, a similar assumption for loss of feed  efficiency, and decreases in piglets per sow. Other key assumptions and  features unique to the study include the following:  the use of only one case or scenario\u2014a \u201cmost-likely\u201d scenario\u2014unlike  the study based on the Swedish ban;  increased costs of $1.05 per animal at the finishing stage and $1.25 per  animal at the weaning stage;  a vaccine cost of $0.75 per animal; and   a capital cost of about $0.55 per animal;  According to the study, a major economic impact in the U.S. pork market of  a ban similar to the Danish ban would be a cost increase of about $4.50 per  animal in the first year. Across a 10-year period, the total cost to the U.S.  pork industry was estimated to be more than $700 million. With a lower  level of pork production, retail prices would increase by approximately 2  percent.

Over the period of the  study, the percentage of production units using antibiotics in feed  decreased, in part because antibiotics did not prove to be as cost-effective  as other feed additives that promote growth.  The study did not analyze  data on antibiotics used in chickens for disease treatment. According to  industry officials, producers seldom treat chickens for diseases.", "Table 6 lists the antibiotics identified by the study as being used by at least  10 percent of broiler production units and their purpose of use. Table 6 also  presents information on FDA\u2019s ranking of the importance of the antibiotic  class in human medicine. For those antibiotics not found in these rankings,  we listed them as not important."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the U.S. Department of Agriculture", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Responses to USDA\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["The following are our comments on the USDA letter, dated April 5, 2004. 1. We revised the report to include USDA\u2019s concerns that additional  funding would be needed to expand CAHFSE. 2. We clarified our discussion of some studies. References are cited in  footnotes for studies discussed in the report. 3. We agree that the collection of both aggregate and detailed data on  antibiotic use in animals is useful and that researchers need to know  specifically how antibiotics are used in order to determine which of the  uses is responsible for trends in antibiotic resistance. The report  discusses both aggregate and detailed data. As USDA states, the report  highlights the CAHFSE program, through which USDA is collecting  specific, on-farm data on swine. In addition, the report discusses  Denmark\u2019s system, which collects detailed data on how antibiotics are  used in animals. 4. We found that only a few studies have concluded that the risk is  minimal, while many studies have concluded that there is a significant  human health risk from the transference. 5. We revised the report to include information on research funded by  USDA\u2019s Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service. 6. We clarified the report to reflect comments on specific studies. In  addition, we clarified the report to indicate which results were from  epidemiologic studies alone, and which results were from  epidemiologic studies that included molecular subtyping techniques."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, Gary Brown, Diane Berry Caves, Diana  Cheng, Barbara El Osta, Ernie Jackson, Julian Klazkin, Carolyn Feis  Korman, Deborah J.
