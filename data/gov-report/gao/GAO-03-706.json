The service has taken numerous actions to address these shortages. GAO examined whether the Air Force's strategic plan addresses the mitigation of spare parts shortages, whether key initiatives are likely to mitigate the shortages, and the impact on readiness identified from increased investments for spare parts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force Strategic Plan generally provides an appropriate framework for mitigating spare parts shortages. However, one of two subordinate plans does not contain performance measures and targets linked to the strategic plan, and the other does not contain any performance targets. Therefore, the Air Force is not in a position to determine if the actions taken pursuant to its subordinate plans overcome spare parts shortages and provide assurance that it is getting the greatest readiness return on its spare parts investment. Key logistics initiatives under the Spares Campaign and Depot Maintenance Reengineering and Transformation (DMRT) efforts may help to mitigate spare parts shortages, but the initiatives' potential effectiveness is limited because of some key problems. First, the Air Force is not starting all identified initiatives that relate to the causes of shortages because it did not have needed personnel and funding. It assessed its logistics processes and identified more than 80 initiatives to solve more than 300 deficiencies; 43 initiatives were to improve processes that affect spare parts shortages, with about half relating to depot maintenance and the other half to supply. Although all depot maintenance-related initiatives have been started, 12 of the supply related initiatives have not been started. Second, 23 of the 31 initiatives lack both output-related performance measures and targets. Without output-related measures and targets to assess the initiatives' impact, the Air Force has little means of determining the extent to which it has successfully mitigated spare parts shortages and improved readiness. Third, the Air Force chose not to use the results of one of its initiatives, which identified a new total spares requirement as the basis for its fiscal year 2004 budget request. This decision resulted in a $578 million unfunded spare parts requirement. Finally, management problems--including failure to articulate the need for change, a lack of top-level commitment, and failure to address organizational issues--have hampered implementation of the initiatives. In February 2003, the Air Force established the Innovation and Transformation Directorate to address these problems, but its plans and priorities have not been set. The Air Force can estimate the impact of increased funding on individual weapon systems' supply availability and has done so. Based on its approximately $5.3 billion fiscal year 2004 spare parts budget request, the Air Force reported that aircraft supply availability would range from 73 to 100 percent. However, it cautioned that higher supply availability does not automatically result in higher mission capable rates because of other factors."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since fiscal year 2000, the Air Force reportedly has spent approximately  $10.5 billion from its annual operations and maintenance appropriations  for spare parts, including additional supplemental funding totaling  approximately $745 million. The Air Force has reportedly exceeded the  Department of Defense\u2019s overall supply performance goal of having parts  available 85 percent of the time when they are requested. Nevertheless, the  Air Force continues to report spare parts shortages. While recognizing that  spare parts shortages may never be eliminated, it is reasonable to expect  the services to place a priority on efforts to mitigate (reduce) those  shortages that adversely impact readiness. This priority should be inherent  in their overall stewardship of funds they request from Congress and their  accountability for making spare parts investment decisions that provide a  good readiness return. In numerous reports, we have stated that DOD\u2019s  inventory management is a high-risk area because of long-standing  management weaknesses that could result in unnecessarily spending funds  that could be directed to higher priorities, such as modernization or  readiness.", "This report is one in a series that responds to your request that we assist  your committee in determining ways to improve the availability of spare  parts.

Does the Air Force\u2019s strategic plan address the mitigation of critical  spare parts shortages\u2014those that adversely affect readiness?  2.  How likely will key Air Force initiatives mitigate critical spare  parts shortages?  3.  Does the Air Force have the ability to identify the impact on readiness  of increased investments for spare parts?", "To address these questions, we visited the Air Force Headquarters\u2019  Logistics Directorate and the Air Force Materiel Command, and we  interviewed officials responsible for strategic planning, initiatives  development and implementation, and requirements determination for  spare parts funding. We also analyzed the strategic plans and key  initiatives identified by the Air Force that address spare parts shortages  and logistics support. We used the Government Performance and Results  Act of 1993, prior GAO reports, and other key DOD documents as criteria  to evaluate the Air Force\u2019s strategic plans and initiatives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force recognized that reductions in spare parts inventories since  the early 1990s have negatively affected aircraft readiness indicators  such as mission capable rates, not-mission-capable supply, not-mission- capable maintenance, and cannibalizations. Recognizing the need to  reverse this trend and that previous attempts to pinpoint specific  spare parts shortages were piecemeal, temporary, and lacked adequate  personnel to implement, the Air Force began a 5 to7 year logistics  transformation effort in 1999 aimed at improving the efficiency and  economy of the entire logistics process to enhance support to the  warfighter. Rather than focusing on fully eliminating specific spare parts  shortages, the Air Force chose to focus on addressing the process  disconnects that caused the shortages. This included an end-to-end look  at all aspects of the logistics process including commercial supply chain  management, supply, maintenance, transportation, logistics planning, and  financial management. The Spares Campaign initiated in February 2001  and the Depot Maintenance Reengineering and Transformation (DMRT)  effort started in July 2001 were two key parts of the end-to-end review.  In total, they identified the need for 84 initiatives, 43 of which related to  spare parts.", "The Spares Campaign focused on supply process deficiencies, and it was  intended to improve parts supportability to weapon systems and reverse  declining readiness related to spares management. This was considered  a major transformation effort and included five teams that reviewed the  processes needed to produce spares and identified disconnects and  solutions that would improve mission capability and manage cost  (see table 1).", "Each team developed a flowchart showing how it believed processes  related to its focus area should function and be managed to improve  weapon system availability and cost management. The teams also  identified disconnects or barriers preventing the processes from  functioning as they should and recommended solutions to correct  these disconnects. Twelve major deficiencies were noted, and more than  190 corrective actions were identified, which resulted in 20 initiatives,  19 of which were related to spare parts shortages. As of February 2003,  7 of 19 spare parts initiatives have been started.", "The DMRT effort, focused on deficiencies in depot maintenance  processes. Various teams identified disconnects and barriers in these  processes, reviewed Air Force current initiatives that affected depot  maintenance, and identified industry best practices and benchmarking,  receiving input from Air Force management, major commands, and  Air Logistics Centers. More than 300 barriers to depot maintenance  operational and financial performance were identified and consolidated  into more than 40 major issues organized around 8 overarching focus  areas. This resulted in 64 initiatives, 24 of which were related to spare  parts. All 24 of the spare parts related initiatives have been started.

Specifically, the strategic plan has three goals:  Goal 1 is to ensure a high quality force of people, Goal 2 is to enable  commanders to respond to all types of crises, and Goal 3 is to prepare  for an uncertain future by pursuing a modernization program.

It has two mission critical tasks and 19 performance  measures, many specifically related to improving spare parts inventories.  One mission critical task, to \u201cimprove mission effectiveness while  minimizing risk,\u201d cites the percentage of aircraft that cannot perform their  mission because spare parts are not available as a performance measure.  It also cites performance targets for each aircraft. For example, the target  for the F-15E is 9 percent and for the B-1 it is 22 percent, meaning that  percent of the aircraft cannot perform their mission because of spare  parts shortages (see appendix III for the not mission capable supply rate  targets). The second mission critical task, to \u201cmaximize the efficiency of  operating and maintaining the Air Force resources,\u201d has the elapsed time  between when a customer submits an order and receives the part as a  performance measure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Measures and Targets in Subordinate Plans Are Not Consistent with Strategic Plan", "paragraphs": ["The major subordinate plans for implementing the Air Force Strategic  Plan include goals similar to those in the strategic plan.

For  example, the completion of combat support doctrine is the performance  measure cited for accomplishing the objective to improve combat support  to warfighters by developing and applying an Agile Combat Support  doctrine. Another nonquantitative or qualitative performance measure was  full fielding of identified total asset visibility capabilities for the objective  to fully implement total asset visibility.", "The Supply Strategic Plan was intended to (1) create an integrated  process for Air Force supply planning, (2) establish the planning  infrastructure to facilitate information exchange throughout Air Force  Supply, and (3) improve Air Force Supply\u2019s measures of effectiveness.

Some  end-states are similar to the strategic plan\u2019s output-related performance  measures, but do not have corresponding performance targets. For  example, one end-state discusses incidents of aircraft being not mission  capable due to the lack of spare parts, but it does not specify a target  (i.e., the desired percentage of incidences) against which to measure  improvement. Other end-states did not discuss performance measures  at all. For example, one end-state is completion of the new Air Force  Supply Stockage Policy Guide and making it available to supply  officers worldwide.", "Without effective quantitative and qualitative measures that flow from the  Strategic Plan structure to the subordinate plans, the Air Force cannot  determine the extent to which the implementation of these plans is  contributing to its overall strategic goal relating to overcoming spare  parts shortages.

In the past, the Air Force had budgeted for spares based on annual  flying-hour requirements with little consideration for the spares needed to  meet non-flying-hour requirements, such as the pipeline or safety stock.  As a result, the Air Force experienced parts shortages because demands  for non-flying-hour spare parts had not been sufficiently budgeted.

However, the Air Force does not link funding  for spare parts directly to readiness because other factors also affect  readiness. In its fiscal year 2004 budget request for spare parts funding, the  Air Force included information on how spare parts funding in the working  capital fund affected the supply availability for various types of aircraft  (see app. I for projected aircraft availability rates). The budget request  indicated that spare parts funding of approximately $5.3 billion would  allow for aircraft supply availability ranging from 73 percent for the H-60  to 100 percent for the F-111.", "The Air Force drew this data from its Funding/Availability Multi-Method  Allocator for Spares model, which estimates how many and which  additional parts (i.e. supply availability) it can procure with different  amounts of operating authority. The Air Force said that the model has  some weaknesses, but it does provide a good mechanism for projecting  aircraft supply availability. One weakness, according to DOD, is that while  the model attempts to optimize supply parts availability, it is generally  biased towards the purchase of low cost/high-demand items versus those  critical spare parts that would most improve mission capable rates.", "The Air Force can also use this model to show how additional funding  could increase spare parts availability by estimating the cost of additional  supply availability in 1 percent increments by weapon system. For  example, in 2002 the cost for the F-15E to achieve an 88 percent supply  availability rate was approximately $237 million. To increase this  availability 1 percent would have cost an additional $7 million. Similarly,  it cost the Air Force approximately $301 million for the C-5 to achieve an  82 percent supply availability rate. To achieve an additional 1 percent  supply availability would have cost an additional $3.6 million.", "According to the Air Force, additional supply availability results in  improved stockage effectiveness and reduced customer wait time,  back orders, and cannibalization rates, which all contribute to increased  readiness. However, the Air Force cautioned that increased supply  availability does not automatically result in increased mission capable  (readiness) rates because other factors, such as maintenance and  transportation, affect these rates.
