GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and agency guidance; analyzed agency data for fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the most recent time period for which data were available; and interviewed agency officials at headquarters, three divisions, and three districts\u2013selected based on geographic distribution and the amount of Section 219 project expenditures."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal years 2013 through 2017, the most recent available data, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) spent approximately $81 million on 29 Section 219 projects to develop drinking water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure. For example, through the St. Croix Falls, Wisconsin Section 219 project, the Corps assisted with improvements to a wastewater treatment plant. Of the 29 projects, the Corps spent over half of the funding during this period on four projects: (1) Calumet Region, Indiana; (2) Desoto County, Mississippi; (3) Jackson County, Mississippi; and (4) Lakes Marion and Moultrie, South Carolina.", "The Corps generally follows its standard budget prioritization process\u2014which involves districts, divisions, and headquarters ranking each project and headquarters making final funding decisions\u2014to prioritize Section 219 funding. However, the Corps has not developed criteria to guide this process. GAO found the Corps varies in the factors it uses to rank Section 219 projects. For example, one district considers whether a project can be completed within the fiscal year, while another considers the level of congressional support and dollar value of the project. Headquarters officials said the agency views Section 219 projects as outside its core mission areas and therefore has not developed written criteria. Congressional direction has indicated that the Corps is to consider characteristics\u2014such as projects with the greater economic impact\u2014in prioritizing Section 219 project funding. While aware of this direction, Corps officials said they do not consider it when ranking projects.

The Corps also carries out other activities. For  example, the Corps provides design and construction assistance for  environmental infrastructure projects. These projects focus on a variety of  purposes, such as drinking water treatment and distribution and  wastewater treatment.", "Among the environmental infrastructure projects for which the Corps  provides assistance are those authorized by Section 219 of the Water  Resources Development Act (WRDA) of 1992, as amended, known as  the Section 219 program. Under the Section 219 program, the Corps  manages private contractors that construct, among other things, drinking  water, wastewater, and stormwater infrastructure, for nonfederal  sponsors, such as cities, counties, and regional authorities.

We have previously reported on aspects of the  Corps\u2019 Section 219 budget process. Specifically, in December 2009, we  found that the Corps did not have criteria for funding Section 219 projects  along the U.S.-Mexico border and recommended that the Corps develop  eligibility criteria and a standard process to review and select projects for  funding so that those with the greatest need receive assistance.", "You asked us to review projects carried out under Section 219 of the  1992 WRDA. This report (1) describes the number and type of Section  219 projects and expenditures from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, and  (2) examines how the Corps prioritizes funding for Section 219 projects.", "To address these objectives, we reviewed relevant laws, including  Section 219 of the 1992 WRDA, as amended. For background purposes,  we obtained and summarized data from the Corps of Engineers Financial  Management System (CEFMS) on the total number of authorized projects  since 1992; the total amount of authorized dollars and expenditures on  those projects; and the number of deauthorized projects, including the  date of deauthorization. We interviewed Corps headquarters officials  responsible for Section 219 budget development. In addition, we  interviewed officials from a nongeneralizable sample of three Corps  districts (Charleston, Chicago, and Los Angeles) and three divisions  (South Atlantic, Great Lakes and Ohio River, and South Pacific) who  oversee Section 219 projects. We selected these districts and divisions  based on geographic distribution and the amount of Section 219 project  expenditures. From August to October 2018, we visited the Chicago and  Los Angeles district offices and four Section 219 projects, and interviewed  nonfederal sponsors responsible for the four projects. We reviewed  documents, such as fact sheets, from district officials and nonfederal  sponsors on each of the Section 219 projects included in the site visits.  We also conducted telephone interviews with officials from the Charleston  District and South Atlantic Division, as well as a nonfederal sponsor  responsible for a project within their jurisdictions. Because this was a  nongeneralizable sample, our findings cannot be generalized to all Corps  districts and divisions but provide illustrative examples of Section 219  program operations.", "To describe the number and type of Section 219 projects and  expenditures from fiscal years 2013 through 2017, we analyzed and  summarized data from CEFMS on the total number of active and  completed projects for this period and the total amount expended on the  projects. We selected fiscal years 2013 through 2017 because it was the  most recent period for which data were available. We summarized data  on Section 219 projects, such as the division and district responsible for  managing the project, location, description, year of authorization, and  phase of the project. To assess the reliability of the Corps\u2019 data, we  reviewed program documentation on system controls, interviewed officials  responsible for data quality, and reviewed the Corps\u2019 data to identify any  potential missing fields, duplicate entries, or other anomalies. As a result  of our assessment, the Corps updated its data set for fiscal years 2013  through 2017, including removing some duplicate projects. We concluded  that the updated Corps data on Section 219 projects were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of our review. We also reviewed fact sheets and  other Corps documents on Section 219 projects.", "To examine how the Corps prioritizes funding for Section 219 projects, we  reviewed Corps guidance, including the Corps\u2019 policy guidance for budget  development (budget guidance) from fiscal years 2013 through 2017.  We also reviewed appropriations acts for the period, including  congressional direction that accompanies these acts on how the Corps is  to prioritize funding for environmental infrastructure projects. We  examined the Corps\u2019 annual work plans for the period, which contain the  final list of Section 219 projects that the Corps allocated funding to in  each fiscal year. In addition, we examined a list of Section 219 projects  that were not selected to receive funding in fiscal year 2018 (the most  recent budget cycle), along with the Corps\u2019 rationale for the funding  decisions. We discussed the Corps\u2019 procedures for prioritizing Section  219 funding with headquarters, division, and district officials.

If funds are not obligated for planning, design, or construction  of a project on that list during the next fiscal year, the project is  deauthorized. The Secretary of the Army publishes a list of deauthorized  projects in the Federal Register. Based on this process, the Corps  considered deauthorizing 197 additional Section 219 projects in its fiscal  year 2017 report to Congress.

The purpose of this  phase is to complete any additional planning studies and all of the  detailed technical studies and designs\u2014such as environmental impact  studies\u2014needed to begin construction. During this phase, the Corps also  completes an environmental assessment of the proposed project.", "To initiate construction, the Corps and the nonfederal sponsor sign a  project partnership agreement that specifies how the parties will  collaborate, their respective roles and responsibilities, and the terms and conditions under which they will execute their responsibilities. The project  partnership agreement typically requires the sponsor to provide without cost to the U.S. government all lands, easements,  rights-of-way, relocations, and disposal areas necessary for the  construction and subsequent maintenance of the project; maintain and operate the project after completion without cost to the provide cash or work-in-kind contributions to make the sponsor\u2019s total  contribution equal to 25 percent if the value of the sponsor\u2019s land  contribution does not equal or exceed 25 percent of the project cost.", "The Corps manages the construction phase, contracting out construction  work to private engineering and construction contractors.

The Corps manages a  Section 219 project that includes the development of water  desalination infrastructure in various sections of the South Perris  community, located east of Los Angeles, California. In general, the  South Perris area relies on a mixture of groundwater and water  imported from different sources, including the Colorado River.  According to the Corps\u2019 environmental assessment, various factors,  such as drought, caused the community to supplement its drinking  water supply through increased use of groundwater; however, the  groundwater in the area historically contained high salt content. Since  the project\u2019s authorization in fiscal year 2001 through fiscal year 2017,  the Corps has helped construct groundwater wells and pipelines,  which connect to drinking water treatment facilities that reduce the  amount of salt in the water (see fig. 2). According to the nonfederal  sponsor for the South Perris project, the overall project has provided  benefits such as creating a local potable water source to meet  anticipated population growth and reducing the community\u2019s  dependence on imported water.", "Wastewater Treatment. The Corps manages a Section 219 project  that includes the rehabilitation of sewer lines within the metropolitan  area of St. Louis, Missouri.

From the  project\u2019s authorization in fiscal year 1999 through fiscal year 2017, the  Corps has assisted the community, among other things, in sewer  rehabilitation of deep tunnels. According to documentation from the  Corps\u2019 St. Louis District, the rehabilitation of sewers is important in  protecting the health and safety of the public, given the risk of  untreated sewage being discharged into the environment.", "Stormwater Management. The Corps manages a Section 219  project that involves the development of stormwater infrastructure,  among other things, across a five-county region (Calumet region) in  northern Indiana. For example, flooding is a widespread problem in  the region and it has affected commercial corridors, including within  Gary, Indiana. From the project\u2019s authorization in fiscal year 1999  through fiscal year 2017, the Corps has been assisting the region with  measures to alleviate flooding, such as constructing stormwater  storage areas under the street (see fig. 2).
