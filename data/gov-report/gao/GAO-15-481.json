According to CMS, by contracting with various types of  Medicaid MCOs to deliver services, states can reduce program costs and  better manage utilization of health care services. However, since MCOs  receive a fixed amount per beneficiary regardless of the number of  services used, we have noted in our prior work that there may be financial  incentives for MCOs to limit access to services, potentially compromising  quality of care and leading to underutilization of services.", "Historically, most Medicaid programs relied on a FFS delivery model.  Under the FFS model, states pay providers directly for each service  provided to a Medicaid beneficiary and the data included on a Medicaid  FFS claim includes a specific amount for services delivered to a  beneficiary.
