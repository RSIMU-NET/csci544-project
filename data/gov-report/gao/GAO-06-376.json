With respect to the formation of LLCs, four states require some information on members, who are owners of the LLC. Some states require companies to list the names and addresses of directors, officers or managers on filings, but these persons may not own the company. Nearly all states screen company filings for statutorily required information, but none verify the identities of company officials. Third-party agents may submit formation documents to the state on a company's behalf, usually collecting only billing and statutorily required information for formations. These agents generally do not collect any information on owners of the companies they represent, and instances where agents told us they verified some information were rare. Federal law enforcement officials are concerned that criminals are increasingly using U.S. shell companies to conceal their identity and illicit activities. Though the magnitude of the problem is difficult to measure, officials said U.S. shell companies are appearing in more investigations in the United States and other countries. Officials told us that the information states collect has been helpful in some cases because names on the documents, such as names of directors, generated additional leads. However, some officials said that the information was limited and that cases had been closed because the owners could not be identified. State officials and agents said that collecting company ownership information could be problematic. Some state officials and agents noted that collecting such information could increase the cost of company filings and the time needed to approve them. Some officials said that if they had additional requirements, companies would go to other states or jurisdictions.

However, shell  companies can provide beneficial owners with the means to conduct illegal  activities while hiding the owners\u2019 identity and involvement. Also, company  formation agents who help individuals form companies may facilitate the  formation of these shell companies, further shielding the identity of the  individuals controlling the company.

All formation documents filed with the state are matters of public  record and are available to anyone. Documents may be submitted in  person, by mail or, increasingly, online. A minimal amount of basic  information generally is required to form a company, although these  requirements also vary from state to state. Generally, the documents must  give the company\u2019s name, an address where official notices can be sent to  the company, share information for corporations, and the names and  signatures of the persons incorporating (see fig. 1). State officials generally  check to see that the documents supply the information required by  statute. Fees vary by state from $25 to $1,000, and the process can take  anywhere from 5 minutes to 60 days. See appendix II for more information  on how formation documents are submitted and on the company formation  fees in each state. Expedited services, available in some states, decrease  processing times but may require an additional fee.

In this hypothetical case, the  owners\u2019 personal assets, such as their home and retirement savings,  generally would not be subject to any award if the customer won the  lawsuit. Limited liability means that owners or shareholders in a business  entity are personally responsible only for the amount they have invested in  the business, while the corporation itself is responsible for the debts and  other obligations it incurs. The exception occurs when a court \u201cpierces the  corporate veil,\u201d or disregards the legal entity that is the corporation, and  holds the owners, shareholders, and sometimes the officers and directors  responsible for the corporation\u2019s acts and obligations.

Wyoming passed the first  law permitting formation of LLCs in 1977, and Florida followed suit in 1982.  By the mid-1990s, all states had enacted LLC statutes. Like a corporation,  an LLC protects its owners, which are referred to as members, from some  debts and obligations; like partnerships and sole proprietorships, however,  it may confer certain tax advantages.

Directors serve on the  governing board of a corporation and are responsible for making important  business decisions, especially those that legally bind the corporation. Two  states require officers\u2019 names and addresses on company formation  documents, 10 states require the names of directors, and 9 states require  the addresses of directors (see fig. 5) . Some states have additional  information requirements for company formations. For instance, our  review of state statutes found that Louisiana does not require information  on directors on the incorporation documents, but does require directors\u2019  names and addresses on an initial report that must be filed with the  incorporation documents. We also found that Oklahoma requires the  names and addresses of the directors only if the persons incorporating the  company are not responsible for its operations after the incorporation  documents are filed.

Many states specify that the agent\u2019s  address must be a physical street address and not a post office box. In  addition, a majority of the states include on their formation documents  space for an individual to sign as the incorporator (in the case of a  corporation) or organizer (in the case of an LLC) of the company. The  incorporator or organizer may be the agent who is forming the company on  behalf of the owners or it may be an individual affiliated with the company  being formed. Most states permit an individual or entity to serve as  incorporator without regard to state residency or later participation in the  company, but at least two states require that the incorporator be associated  with the company in some way. For example, the articles of incorporation  for Arkansas and California state that if a newly incorporated company has  chosen initial officers or directors, one or more of them must sign as the  incorporator. Otherwise, an unaffiliated individual can sign as the  incorporator.", "Many states require a brief statement of purpose or a principal office  address in order to form a corporation or LLC. In reviewing state statutes  and state forms, we found that 20 states require a statement on the purpose  of a corporation and 16 require a statement of purpose for LLCs on  formation documents. In some states that ask for a statement of purpose, a  general statement such as \u201cthe purpose of the corporation is to engage in  any lawful act or activity\u2026\u201d is sufficient. Alaska requires an additional  form that discloses the North American Industry Classification System  (NAICS) number that most closely describes the activities of a  corporation. Fourteen states require a principal office address to form a  corporation, and 23 states require a principal office address to form an LLC.  The principal office generally means either the address of the company\u2019s  place of business or its mailing address. Therefore, even in states where a  principal office address is required, this address may not indicate the  company\u2019s actual place of business. For example, Arizona\u2019s form asks for a  known place of business in Arizona, but the instructions for the form state  that this address may be in care of the address of the company\u2019s agent.", "Some states have unique requirements for information on newly forming  companies. For example, the articles of incorporation forms for Louisiana,  Rhode Island, and South Dakota must be notarized. Similarly, an attorney  licensed to practice in South Carolina must sign company formation  documents in that state. Private sector officials told us that more states  used to require a notary\u2019s signature on company formation documents, but  that most had repealed this provision. A Louisiana state official said that  requiring a notary\u2019s signature was a \u201chistorical\u201d decision and, despite an  effort to change the law, was likely to remain a requirement.", "A few states (Louisiana, Massachusetts, Mississippi, and Pennsylvania)  also require a federal taxpayer identification number (TIN) on some  company formation documents. Kansas requests a TIN on formation  documents, but it is not required by statute. Louisiana and Massachusetts  state officials told us that even though a TIN is required, company  formation documents are not rejected if it is not included. These states  originally used the TIN as a tracking number for filings. For instance, the  Kansas Department of Revenue uses the information to match companies  in its database. A Massachusetts official said that the state was moving  away from using TINs in all cases and now assigns a private unique  identification number to each company for tracking purposes. While the  requirement to include a TIN is still in place for LLCs in Massachusetts, it  was recently deleted from the corporation statute because the Secretary of  State\u2019s office received many complaints about this number being publicly  available on filing documents.", "Forty-two states reported on our survey that their information  requirements for persons or entities from outside the United States forming  a U.S. company were the same as for U.S. citizens. Those states that say  there was a difference also said that the difference was simply that proof of  the company\u2019s existence had to be included and that documents had to be  translated into English. For example, Minnesota and North Carolina  commented that if an entity from another country was applying to conduct  business in those states, the entity must provide proof of good standing or a  document certifying that the company existed in the original country.  Alaska is the only state that requires the name and address of each alien  affiliate or a statement on the articles of incorporation that there are no  alien affiliates. An \u201calien affiliate\u201d is an individual from another country  who has some ownership or control of a company or an entity controlled  by an individual or a corporation from another country.

Other state officials said they also rejected filings  because they were missing key information, the company name was not  available, or the fee was not included. Many states also reported that they  reviewed filings to ensure compliance with state laws. In Virginia, for  instance, filings are reviewed for more than just the required information.

In fact, 45 states reported that they did  not have investigative authority to take action if they identified information  that could indicate criminal activity, although some state officials said they  can refer suspicious activity to law enforcement. Only two  states\u2014Colorado and North Carolina\u2014reported that they did have  investigative authority. Further, two states noted that their state statutes  required them to file formation documents as long as the documents  contained the required information.

An official in Missouri said  that despite not having a formal procedure or policy for reviewing filings  for suspicious activity, staff were trained to look for things that were out of  the ordinary. Such things might include discrepancies like two signatures of  the same name with different handwriting. However, most states reported  that they did not direct staff to look for suspicious information. According  to an official in Alaska, the state has no formal mechanism for identifying  or reporting suspicious information. The official said that staff would  notice unusual fictitious names on filings, but with a filing fee of $250 in  Alaska, this type of activity was rare. Two state officials told us that when  staff noticed something unusual, they typically contacted the applicant for  an explanation but still usually filed the documents.

The state reserves the right to terminate  these contracts at any time but thus far has not done so because of  nefarious behavior. State officials in Florida and Wyoming told us that they  checked their records to ensure that companies acting as agents for service  of process were authorized to conduct business in the state.", "Thirty-nine states said they did not track the number of agents for service  of process operating in the state and 36 did not have an official listing of  agents. However, a couple of states have registration requirements for  operating within their boundaries. Wyoming requires agents serving more  than five corporations to register with the state annually, under a law that  was enacted after some agents gave false addresses for their offices,  according to a state official. To register, agents must pay a $25 annual fee  and complete a form each January giving contact information, including a  physical and mailing address, and indicating whether the applicant or any  company principal has ever been convicted of a felony. The state official  said that the office kept the information on file in case an agent was  investigated. California law requires any corporation serving as an agent  for service of process to file a certificate with the Secretary of State\u2019s office  and to list the California address where process can be served and the  name of each employee authorized to accept process. Seventeen states  indicated on the survey that they provide the names of all or some agents  on a Web site, and 6 states reported having some requirements for agents  wanting to be listed on the Web site. For example, Delaware requires a  business to have been operating for at least 1 year, to be in good standing,  and to serve more than 50 clients.", "Although the notion is controversial, some state officials and agents said  that some level of uniform registration or certification in the industry might  be desirable, for several reasons. One agent told us that the few agents who  do not follow the current rules give the industry a bad name and that  regulation would eliminate some of these agents. Another agent felt that  registration would create some standards in the industry and provide some  legitimacy for firms conducting business in international jurisdictions that  require registration. However, some agents felt that regulation would be  difficult if not detrimental to the industry. One agent felt that if the industry  were regulated, individuals would avoid using agents and form their  companies themselves. Another agent believed that the costs associated  with meeting standards could be high enough to drive smaller firms out of  business. In either case, both agents that supported and opposed regulation  said that the industry should be involved in efforts to develop some type of  registration or regulation that would affect their business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agents We Talked with Said They Generally Do Not Collect Ownership and Management Information on Companies Because States Do Not Require Them to Collect It", "paragraphs": ["Agents we spoke with generally collected only contact information and the  information required by a state for company formation documents or  periodic reports.

In general, agents said they collect the names  and addresses of officers and managers, if required, and when serving as an  incorporator, agents may collect information on the company directors or  shareholders, even if it is not required. This information allows agents to  resign as incorporators and pass on the authority to conduct business to  the new company principals. Depending on the size of the company, the  directors and the officers may also be the owners, but one agent told us  that he did not try to determine if they were. Several agents also told us that  they do not always work directly with the principals of the company  because the agents interact directly with law firms or transact a large part  of their business online, and therefore may not have access to additional  information not required by the state. One agent also noted that collecting  ownership information was not necessary to doing his job.", "Even if agents collect information such as the names of officers and  directors, a few agents said that they might not keep records of the  information. For example, two agents told us that their firms did not keep a  database of company information, in part because company documents  filed with the state are part of the public record. Because the information is  public, one agent felt it was not necessary to bear the additional cost of  storing it internally. According to our review of state statutes, some states  have record retention requirements that oblige corporations to make  shareholder lists or the stock ledger available at the registered office within  the state (which may be the agent\u2019s office), although the requirements vary  by state. For example, in Nevada, the registered office is required to keep  the stock ledger or a file listing the location of the ledger, and in New  Mexico, a list of shareholders must be available at a company\u2019s registered  office 10 days prior to a shareholders\u2019 meeting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agents Are Not Required to Verify Information in Company Filings, but a Few Do", "paragraphs": ["States generally do not require agents to verify the information collected  from clients, and few agents we interviewed do.

These  agents said they might check names against caller identification systems on  their telephones or against the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) list  of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons. One agent said  that her firm created a document to collect additional information from  clients from unfamiliar countries.

In some cases,  international agents contact the Delaware agent for assistance in forming  U.S. companies for their clients in other countries. According to this  agreement, international agents must verify the identity of an individual  wishing to form a company through the Delaware agent by requiring their  client to provide the principals\u2019 names, addresses, dates and places of birth,  nationalities, and occupations, as well as certified copies of their passports,  proof of address, and a reference letter from a bank. This agent also  required a client requesting mail forwarding services to provide additional  information, such as a Social Security number, in addition to the  information required by the U.S. Postal Service on its mail forwarding form.  The agent said the firm collected this information to screen potential  clients and protect the firm and that it would stop representing a client if  the client generated a significant amount of service of process, complaints,  or visits from investigative agents. In general, the agent felt the additional  requirements were not burdensome.

A few agents we interviewed in Delaware  used commercially available software to screen client names against the  OFAC list, a step strongly encouraged by the Secretary of State.

One  agent felt that running checks on the names listed on company documents  could add time to the process but would likely not be a burden. Other  agents found the list difficult to use and saw using it as a potentially costly  endeavor.

In December 2005, several agencies of the federal  government, including the Departments of the Treasury, Justice and  Homeland Security, issued the first governmentwide analysis of money  laundering in the United States, which described, among other things, how  shell companies can be used to launder money. Shell companies can aid  criminals in conducting illegal activities by providing an appearance of  legitimacy\u2014for example, an artificial source of income or proof of the type  of transactions legitimate companies conduct. Shell companies can also  provide access to the U.S. financial system through U.S. bank accounts or  offshore accounts in banks that have a correspondent relationship with a  U.S. bank. For example, in a Financial Crimes Enforcement Network  (FinCEN) December 2005 enforcement action, FinCEN determined, among  other things, that the New York branch of ABM AMRO, a banking  institution, did not have an adequate anti-money-laundering program and  had failed to monitor approximately 20,000 funds transfers\u2014with an  aggregate value of approximately $3.2 billion\u2014involving the accounts of  U.S. shell companies and institutions in Russia or other former republics of  the Soviet Union.", "Determining a precise number of criminal cases involving the use of shell  companies to hide illicit activity is difficult because forming such  companies is not a crime but rather is sometimes used as a method for  moving money that may be associated with a crime. Therefore, the use of  shell companies for illicit activities is not tracked by law enforcement or government agencies. However, law enforcement officials told us they are  seeing a wide range of indicators that suggest the increased use of U.S.  shell companies for illicit activities.", "FinCEN officials told us they see many suspicious activity reports (SAR)  filed by financial institutions that potentially implicated shell companies  in the United States. For example, FinCEN reported in the U.S. Money  Laundering Threat Assessment that financial institutions filed 397 SARs  between April 1996 and January 2004 involving shell companies, East  European countries, and correspondent bank accounts. The aggregate  amount of activity reported in these SARs totaled almost $4 billion.", "Justice officials said that law enforcement officials from other countries  have asked the United States to help them track down the individuals  that had formed U.S. shell companies to hide illicit activity, but the lack  of ownership information is obstructing their investigations. For  example, a review by Justice of requests for legal assistance in 2005  from Russia and Ukraine found 30 requests for assistance from Russian  authorities and 75 requests from Ukraine authorities involving U.S. shell  companies. These requests typically ask for assistance in identifying  individuals associated with the U.S. companies. However, Justice\u2019s  attempts to gather information in response to these requests on the  companies are obstructed by the lack of information maintained by  states and agents. These requests often involve serious crimes occurring  in other countries but implicate a U.S. company. For example, in early  2006, one request was seeking information on a U.S. corporation  allegedly used to smuggle a toxic controlled substance between two  Eurasian countries because the name of the U.S. corporation was on the  foreign customs papers.", "OFAC expressed concerns that shell companies can be used to facilitate  transactions with targets (individuals, entities, or countries) of U.S.  economic sanctions. In one example, during the period when the United  States maintained sanctions against Yugoslavia (Serbia and  Montenegro), a U.S. company formation agent filed incorporation  papers for a Serbian entity, which then opened bank accounts in the  United States as a U.S. company to transfer money through the United  States.", "The FBI told us they currently have over 100 ongoing cases investigating  market manipulation and that the majority of these cases involve the use  of shell companies. One closed case, for example, involved the sale of  fraudulent private placement offerings to the investing public. The  convicted individuals used U.S. shell companies to give investors the  impression that they were investing in legitimate companies, but instead  the individuals stole the investors\u2019 proceeds. In some cases, individuals  have used shell companies to pump up the price of a stock and then sell  their entire position in the stock while legitimate investors are left with  worthless stock.", "The FBI has also expressed concern about the use of third-party agents  to form thousands of shell companies in the United States for criminals  operating in other countries; the criminals then use the shell companies  to open U.S. bank accounts. The FBI believes that U.S. shell companies  are being used to launder as much as $36 billion from the former Soviet  Union. An FBI analysis of the use of these third-party agents found that  they often register the shell company using nominee officers to keep the  foreign beneficial owner anonymous and use companies created at an  earlier date\u2014\u201caged shelf companies\u201d\u2014to give banks and regulatory  authorities the impression the company has longevity.", "Law enforcement officials provided us with examples of cases involving  the use of U.S. shell companies. According to a Department of Justice  report on Russian money movements, many of the investigations involving  shell companies use common schemes to launder money and conceal  money movements. In a \u201cfictitious services\u201d scheme, the criminals enter  into a contract with a company purportedly offering an intangible service,  such as consulting. The consulting company is actually a shell company  owned by the criminals, so that payments for consulting services are  actually payments into a bank account under their control. In one case  involving a fictitious services scheme, a former public official from the  Russian Federation allegedly helped to unlawfully divert international  nuclear assistance funds that were intended to upgrade the safety of  nuclear power plants operating in Russia and several former republics of  the Soviet Union. The indictment stated that the suspects formed shell  companies in Pennsylvania and Delaware that received the nuclear  assistance payments and then diverted over $15 million of this money to  corporate bank accounts. Ultimately the money was allegedly transferred  to other personal bank accounts in the United States and other countries  and the transfers concealed behind fictitious business contracts. The  subjects of the indictment allegedly used at least $9 million to fund  business investments and loans for their personal enrichment.", "IRS investigations have also uncovered the use of U.S. shell companies in  tax evasion schemes. In one tax evasion case, two co-conspirators used  nominee names to open bank accounts and form U.S. corporations in  Florida to hide their assets and income to avoid tax liabilities. One  co-conspirator was sentenced to 10 years in prison and ordered to pay $1.6  million in restitution.

One state official commented that such requirements  would create a burden for honest business people who would have  provided accurate information in the first place but would not deter  criminals, who would provide false information in any case. According to a  report on the use of companies for illicit purposes, requiring companies to  disclose up front and to update ownership information may impose  significant costs, particularly on small businesses. A few state and some  private sector officials noted that an increase in the time and costs involved  in forming a company might reduce the number of companies formed,  because entrepreneurs and investors might be less likely to take the risks  involved in forming or investing in new companies.", "Some state officials also noted that to change the information  requirements, state legislatures would have to pass new legislation and  grant company formation offices new authority. A few states indicated that  collecting additional information would require higher fees that would also  need to be set by their state legislatures.

Information collected at formation, for instance, might not be  useful because ownership information can change frequently throughout  the year. For example, an official from Delaware commented that many  privately held LLCs and corporations in Delaware and other states may  have thousands of shareholders and LLC members that buy and sell shares  and memberships on a daily basis. Another state official commented that  collecting this information at formation would not be useful without  requiring that it be updated frequently. In addition, since LLCs can be  owned by individuals or other businesses, even if states required LLCs to  list a member name, the name provided may not be that of an individual but  another company. Disclosing ownership information on periodic reports,  however, could mean that a year or more would pass before it was  collected\u2014too long to be of use in many investigations. In addition, we  found that some states do not require these reports. Further, once it is  formed, a shell company being used for illicit purposes in the United States  or other countries may not file required periodic reports.

However, one official from Maryland said that  keeping some information private would not be a problem since the office  that accepted company formation and periodic report filings also handled  tax filings and already had procedures for keeping information such as  taxpayer identification numbers confidential. An official in Oregon also  told us that the Corporations Division office had recently enacted  procedures to keep some information private in cases such as domestic  abuse.

One company service provider said the time required to  form a company increased, as the due diligence requirements company  service providers must follow can take weeks to complete depending on  the client, though once documents are submitted to the Jersey or Isle of  Man registry offices, formations are finished in 48 hours or less. The  workload of company service providers has also increased. One company  service provider told us that the company had increased its staff by 25  percent to 30 percent because of the requirement that the company verify  customer information. Fewer companies are formed in Isle of Man,  according to an Isle of Man official. Before the regulations, Isle of Man had  40,000 incorporated entities, but it now has 35,000.

In Jersey, ownership information is  updated on annual reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Potential Sources of Company Information May Be Available, but Obtaining Information from These Sources May Also Be Challenging", "paragraphs": ["State officials, agents, and others told us that some other sources of  company ownership information that law enforcement officials could  access existed, including internal company documents, financial  institutions, and the IRS."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Internal Company Documents", "paragraphs": ["Our review of state statutes found that all states require corporations to  prepare a list of shareholders, typically before the mandatory annual  shareholder meeting, and that almost all states require that this list be  maintained at the corporation\u2019s principal or registered office. Industry  experts told us that LLCs also usually prepare and maintain operating  agreements that generally name the members and outline their financial  interests. These documents are generally not public record, but law  enforcement officials can subpoena them to obtain ownership information,  and ICE officials in one field office said they always looked at LLC  operating agreements during an investigation. However, accessing these  lists may be problematic, and the documents themselves might not be  accurate or even exist. For example, law enforcement officials said that  shell companies may not prepare these documents and that U.S. officials  may not have access to them if the company is located in another country.  In addition, law enforcement officials may not want to request these  documents in order to avoid tipping off a company about an investigation.", "Industry experts also cautioned that even these internal documents may  not reveal the true beneficial owners of a company. For example, the list  could include nominee shareholders, which would reduce the usefulness of  the shareholder list because the shareholder on record may not be the beneficial owner. In addition, shareholders could sell their stock and not  register the sale with the company; in such cases, the new owners would  not be known. Shareholders could also sell their stock before the filing date  and then buy it back after the filing date to avoid being listed. Further, in  states that allow bearer shares, the owners\u2019 names are anonymous because  bearer share certificates do not contain the names of the shareholders.  Therefore, while law enforcement authorities could obtain lists of  shareholders from companies by subpoena, further investigation might still  be needed to find the true beneficial owners."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Financial Institutions", "paragraphs": ["Financial institutions may also have ownership information on some  companies. Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements  implemented by the USA PATRIOT ACT in 2001 establish minimum  standards for financial institutions to follow when verifying the identity of  their customers in connection with the opening of an account. Under  these standards, financial institutions must collect the name of the  company, its physical address (for instance, its principal place of business),  and an ID number, such as the tax identification number. The regulations  also mandate that financial institutions develop risk-based procedures for  verifying the identity of each customer to the extent that doing so is  reasonable. For example, representatives from financial institutions told us  that they typically requested a company\u2019s articles of incorporation when a  new account was opened to verify that the entity existed. One  representative said that his institution also checked names against the  OFAC list and requested photo identification from all signers on the  account. Industry representatives noted that institutions may also compare  the customer information with information obtained from a consumer  reporting agency, public database, or other sources. Finally, based on a risk  assessment, the institution may obtain information about individuals with  authority or control over the account in order to verify their identities.", "Representatives of financial institutions told us that although they are not  required to obtain ownership information in all cases, they may investigate  high-risk applicants to uncover the ultimate beneficial owners. These  applicants may include casinos, companies that are not listed on world  stock exchanges, companies with complex structures, or companies from  certain high-risk countries. For such applicants, financial institutions may  ask about information such as beneficial owners and officers of the  company. Financial industry representatives said that conducting the  necessary due diligence on a company absorbs time and resources,  because institutions must sometimes peel back layers of corporations or  hire private investigators to find the actual beneficial owner or owners of a  company.", "One financial institution we interviewed collects the name, date of birth,  and tax identification number of all individuals with ownership and control  of a corporation or LLC. However, officials from some institutions told us  that obtaining such information on all applicants would be an added  burden to an industry that is already subject to numerous regulations.  Some industry officials also said that financial institutions may not want to  request ownership information in all cases for fear of losing a customer. In  addition, industry representatives noted that collecting ownership  information at financial institutions might not always be useful or available,  because ownership might change after the account was opened and not all  companies opened bank or brokerage accounts. Furthermore, Department  of Justice officials noted that, in some instances, the financial activity of a  shell company under investigation does not involve U.S. financial  institutions. Finally, correspondent accounts create opportunities to hide  the identities of the account holders from the banks themselves. A foreign  bank can open a correspondent account with a U.S. bank to avoid bearing  the costs of licensing, staffing, and operating its own offices in the United  States. Many of the largest international banks serve as correspondents for  thousands of other banks. The USA PATRIOT ACT requires financial  institutions that provide correspondent accounts to foreign banks to  maintain records of the foreign bank\u2019s owners and of the name and address  of an agent in the United States designated to accept service of process for  the foreign bank for records regarding the correspondent account.  However, law enforcement and industry representatives told us that the  foreign banks may commingle funds from many different customers into  one correspondent account, making it difficult for U.S. banks to identify  the individuals with access to the account.", "IRS was mentioned as another potential source of company ownership  information for law enforcement, but IRS officials pointed to several  limitations with this data. First, IRS may not have information on all  companies formed. The agency collects company ownership information  on certain forms, such as the application for an employer identification  number (EIN) (SS-4). Form SS-4 requires the name and tax identification  number (such as the Social Security number) of the principal officer if the  business is a corporation, or general partner if it is a partnership, or owner  if it is an entity that is disregarded as separate from its owner (disregarded entity), such as a single member LLC. Disregarded entities owned by a  corporation enter the corporation\u2019s name and EIN. However, not all LLCs  are required to have EINs. In addition, the name of an owner may be on  the form LLCs file to select how they will be taxed. IRS also currently  collects some general ownership information, including an identifying  number, name, and address, on certain LLCs on separate schedules that the  company files with the IRS. For LLCs that are taxed as partnerships, this  form specifies whether members are member-managers or another type of  member of an LLC and reports the member\u2019s share of the company profits,  losses, and capital. But if an LLC has only one member, the individual  reports income on an individual tax return. In addition, IRS classifies  certain LLCs as corporations for tax purposes, and others may choose to be classified as corporations. Ownership information is available for LLCs  that are classified as corporations and file as S corporations, but generally  not for those that are taxed as C corporations.", "Second, IRS officials reported that the ownership information the agency  collected may not be complete or up to date. As we have discussed, the  agency does not have information on every company, because some  companies do not request or need EINs. In addition, some EINs become  inactive after a certain period, dropping off the IRS database. For example,  Department of Justice officials told us that U.S. shell companies being used  in foreign criminal activity are sometimes inactive in the United States. In  addition, ownership information on LLCs owned by foreign individuals or  entities would only be available if the LLC obtained an EIN for income that  was subject to tax in the United States. Further, data gathered on IRS forms  may not always be accurate. In a recent report, we found that data  transcription errors made by IRS staff entering data into a database and  invalid taxpayer identification numbers submitted by companies lowered  the accuracy of these data. IRS officials also noted that the information  collected might not always be useful in finding the ultimate beneficial  owner of a company, because another entity could be listed as the owner,  requiring further investigation to identify the true owner. Finally, IRS  officials said that the information in the agency\u2019s records might not be up to  date because IRS was not always notified when ownership changed.", "Third, law enforcement officials could have difficulty accessing IRS  taxpayer information. As part of the administration of federal tax laws, IRS  investigators can use IRS data in their investigations of tax and related  statutes, but access by other federal and state law enforcement is restricted  by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103. IRS officials said that federal law enforcement  officials can access IRS information provided by taxpayers (or their  representatives) when a federal court issues an ex parte order. Under 26  U.S.C. \u00a7 6103(i)(1), the federal law enforcement agency requesting the  information through an ex parte order must show that it is engaged in  preparation for a judicial, administrative or grand jury proceeding to  enforce a federal criminal statute or that the investigation may result in  such a proceeding. Information IRS receives from a source other than  taxpayers (or their representatives), such as taxpayers\u2019 employers or  banks, can be obtained without a court order. Moreover, in certain limited  situations, there are additional provisions currently in the tax code  providing for disclosure of such information relating to criminal or terrorist activities or emergency circumstances. State law enforcement officials  can access IRS information for enforcement of state tax laws when IRS has  sharing agreements with state taxing authorities. Law enforcement  officials can also obtain IRS information with the taxpayer\u2019s consent.  Officials in one ICE field office told us that they have obtained IRS  information; however, officials in another ICE field office said that  obtaining this information was difficult. IRS officials commented that  collecting additional ownership and control information on IRS documents  would provide IRS investigators with more detail when conducting  investigations but that the agency\u2019s ability to collect and verify such  information would depend on the availability of resources."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["States and agents collect a variety of information when individuals form  companies, but most state statutes do not require that they collect or verify  information on ownership. Therefore, minimal information is collected on  the owners of these companies. During our review, we encountered a  variety of legitimate concerns about the merits of collecting ownership  information on companies formed in the United States. Many of these  concerns reflected conflicting interests. On the one hand, federal law  enforcement agencies were concerned about the lack of information,  because criminals can easily use U.S. shell companies to mask the  identities of those engaged in illegal activities. From a law enforcement  perspective, having more information would make using U.S. shell  companies for illicit activities harder and give investigators more  information to use in pursuing the actual owners. In addition, since U.S.  shell companies are used in criminal activity abroad because of their  perceived legitimacy, collecting more information when a company is  formed could improve the integrity of the company formation process in  the United States. On the other hand, states and agents were concerned  about increased costs, potential revenue losses, and privacy protection.  Collecting more information would require more time and resources and  could reduce the number of start-ups. Approving applications could take  longer, potentially creating obstacles for those forming companies for  legitimate business purposes. And importantly, because information on  companies is currently part of the public record, requiring certain  information on ownership could be considered a threat to the current  system, which values the protection of privacy and individuals\u2019 personal  assets.", "Any requirement that states, agents, or both collect more ownership  information on certain types of companies would need to balance these  conflicting concerns. Further, such a requirement would need to be  uniformly applied in all U.S. jurisdictions.

Specifically, this report discusses 1. the kinds of information\u2014including ownership information\u2014that the  50 states and the District of Columbia collect during company  formation and the states\u2019 efforts to review and verify it; 2. the roles of third-party agents, such as company formation agents, and  the kinds of information they collect on company ownership; 3. the role of shell companies in facilitating criminal activity, the  availability of company ownership information to law enforcement, and  the usefulness of such information in investigating shell companies;  and 4. the potential effects of requiring states, agents, or both to collect  company ownership information.", "To respond to the first objective and describe the ways company formation  and periodic reporting documents can be filed, we conducted a Web-based  survey of the 50 states and the District of Columbia on formation and  reporting practices. We worked to develop the questionnaire with social  science survey specialists. Because these were not sample surveys, there  are no sampling errors. However, the practical difficulties of conducting  any survey may introduce errors, commonly referred to as nonsampling  errors. For example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted,  in the sources of information that are available to respondents, or in how  the data are entered into a database can introduce unwanted variability  into the survey results. We took steps in the development of the  questionnaires, the data collection, and data analysis to minimize these  nonsampling errors. For example, prior to administering the survey, we  pretested the content and format of the questionnaires with state officials  in Florida, Maine, Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., to determine  whether (1) the survey questions were clear, (2) the terms used were  precise, (3) respondents were able to provide the information we were  seeking, and (4) the questions were unbiased. An official from the  International Association of Commercial Administrators (IACA) also  reviewed a draft of the survey. We made changes to the content and format  of the final questionnaires based on pretest results. We sent the finalized  survey to contacts responsible for company filings in secretary of state  offices (or their equivalents) in all 50 states and the District of Columbia.  See Survey of State Officials Responsible for Company Formation,   GAO-06-377SP, for the final version of the survey and state-by-state results.  We received survey responses from each of the 50 states and the District of  Columbia. In that these were Web-based surveys whereby respondents  entered their responses directly into our database, the possibility of data  entry error was minimized. We also performed computer analyses to  identify inconsistencies in responses and other indications of error. We  contacted survey respondents as needed to correct errors and verify  responses. In addition, a second independent analyst verified that the  computer programs used to analyze the data were written correctly.", "To test the reliability of survey data, we compared state responses on our  survey with data states provided to IACA in its 2005 annual report of  jurisdictions for four key variables\u2014the number of LLCs and corporations  filed in 2004 and the total number on file. The data were markedly the  same, with very high correlations and no significant differences in mean  values. Based on this testing, we believe our reporting of the trends based  on the number of corporations and LLCs to be reliable. We also  corroborated the survey results with information we collected from a  systematic review of state Web sites and state statutes. Where we found a  discrepancy on key variables, we contacted the relevant state official for  clarification of the state\u2019s requirement. Our review of the state corporation  statutes included analysis of provisions regarding company formation,  registered agents, shareholder identification, requirements for record  keeping, and periodic reporting. In addition, we reviewed provisions in  state LLC statutes relating to company formation, periodic reporting, and  registered agents. We also reviewed the content of company formation  forms and other information available on state Web sites. The data  collected from our review of state statutes and Web sites is as of October  2005. We also visited Arizona, Delaware, Florida, Nevada, and Oregon to  conduct in-depth interviews with state officials about practices in these  states. We selected these states because of the number of companies  formed there or unique practices we identified from the statutes, forms, or  survey responses.", "To respond to the second objective and describe the roles of third-party  agents, we interviewed academics with expertise in corporate and LLC law,  selected professional agents, and state officials. In selecting agents to  interview, we interviewed only companies that act as agents for service of  process for more than one client. We chose a range of large national  companies (three) as well as midsize or small companies (nine). We  interviewed selected agents about the information they collect on  companies and analyzed survey results on states\u2019 requirements regarding  oversight of these agents. We also interviewed officials from the National  Public Records Research Association, an association that represents  companies providing corporate services and public records research, and  the Nevada Resident Agent Association, which represents a number of  resident agents in Nevada.

We also interviewed selected state and federal  law enforcement officials about their experiences in obtaining company  information from states to aid their investigations, including officials from  the following state and federal agencies: the Arizona Attorney General,  Drug Enforcement Agency, Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Florida  Attorney General, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Internal  Revenue Service/Criminal Investigations, Financial Crimes Enforcement  Network, U.S. Attorneys Office, and Office of Foreign Assets Control.", "To respond to the fourth objective and determine the implications of  requiring states or agents to collect company ownership information, we  analyzed survey results and interviewed selected state officials and a range  of professional agents.

Jersey and Isle of Man are two of a small number of  jurisdictions that require disclosure of beneficial ownership information  when a company is formed. We also reviewed an Organization for  Economic Co-operation and Development report describing requirements  in one of the jurisdictions. To determine other potential sources of  company information, we asked academics, agents, state officials, law  enforcement officials, and representatives of professional associations  their perspectives on where this information could be obtained.
