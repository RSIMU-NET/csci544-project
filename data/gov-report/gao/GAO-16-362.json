For example, in 2012 we reported on almost $800 million in undisbursed  balances in expired grant accounts at the end of fiscal year 2011 in the  largest civilian payment system. Undisbursed balances occur when the  grant recipient has not drawn down or the awarding agency has not  disbursed all the authorized federal grant funds by the period of  performance end date. Grant closeout is an important final point of  accountability and is necessary for effective management of expired  grants. Effective and efficient grant closeout processes allow awarding  agencies to make better use of unspent funds or return these funds to the  Department of the Treasury (Treasury). Also, the existence of unspent  funds can hinder the achievement of national objectives by leaving  projects incomplete. Reducing undisbursed balances in expired grant  accounts is crucial to making the best and most efficient use of federal  funds to support a grant program\u2019s mission and, ultimately, national  priorities.", "In 2008, we stated that tracking undisbursed balances in expired grant  accounts, including the status of grant closeouts on annual performance  reports, could raise the visibility of this issue both within the agency and  government-wide.

OMB  generally agreed with this recommendation but did not require agencies  to report undisbursed balances in expired grant accounts.

During the award stage,  the federal awarding agency enters into an agreement with the grantee  stipulating the terms and conditions for the use of grant funds including  the period funds are available for the grantee\u2019s use. The awarding agency  also opens accounts in a federal payment management system through  which the grantee receives payments.

OMB is responsible for developing government-wide policies to  ensure that grants are managed properly and the grant funds are spent in  accordance with applicable laws and regulations. For decades, OMB has  published circulars to aid grant-making agencies on various subjects,  including administration, audit, record keeping, and allowability of costs.  In December 2013, OMB consolidated its grants management circulars  into a single document, Uniform Administrative Requirements, Cost  Principles, and Audit Requirements for Federal Awards, (Uniform  Guidance) to streamline its guidance, promote consistency among  grantees, and reduce administrative burden on nonfederal entities. The  Uniform Guidance includes revised rules that set the standard  requirements for financial management of federal awards across the  federal government. In December 2014, OMB, along with federal grant- making agencies, issued a joint interim final rule implementing OMB\u2019s  Uniform Guidance for new grant awards made on or after December 26,  2014. Federal agencies that award and administer grants and  agreements are responsible for issuing regulations\u2014with which grantees  must comply\u2014that are consistent with the Uniform Guidance, unless  different provisions are required by federal statute or are approved by  OMB.", "Agency regulations issued under the Uniform Guidance typically impose  closeout procedures upon both the grantee and the awarding agency. To  close an awarded grant, the grantee and the awarding agency must  complete certain actions within the time frames specified by agency  regulations and the Uniform Guidance (see figure 2). Generally, within  90 calendar days from the period of performance end date, the grantee  must submit all financial, performance, and other reports as required by  the terms and conditions of the award and liquidate all permissible  expenses incurred under the award. Grantees then are to promptly  refund any remaining balances to the awarding agency and account for  any real and personal property acquired with federal funds or received  from the federal government. The awarding agency must make prompt  payments to the grantee for allowable reimbursable costs under the  award being closed out. If required by the terms and conditions of the  award, the awarding agency must also make a settlement for any upward  or downward adjustments to the federal share of costs after the closeout  reports are received. Upon the receipt and acceptance of all required final  reports from the grantee, the awarding agency should complete all  closeout actions within 1 year. Some federal agencies\u2019 grant policies  require less than the 1 year closeout period allowed by the Uniform  Guidance. For example, HHS\u2019s grant policies specify that all closeout  actions must be completed within 180 days of the receipt and acceptance  of all required grantee final reports, allowing for a maximum of 270 days  for the total closeout process.", "Closing out grants could allow an agency to redirect resources toward  other projects and activities or return unspent funds to the Treasury (see  figure 3). Generally, if the undisbursed balances that are deobligated from  closed grant accounts are still available for incurring new obligations, the  agency may use the funds to enter into new grant agreements. This  may allow the federal agencies to use existing resources to fund new  grant projects. If the undisbursed balances are returned to expired  appropriation accounts, the agency may not use the deobligated funds to  make new grants. However, the agency may use the deobligated funds to  make adjustments to, or liquidate existing, obligations that were incurred  before the appropriations account expired. Expired appropriations  accounts remain available for 5 years to make adjustments, after which  the undisbursed balances are canceled and returned to the Treasury. At  this point, these funds are no longer available for agency use.

Payment systems represent an important  control point for managing federal grant funds. After a grant agreement  reaches the period of performance end date, an agency may need to  close out a grant in multiple systems including in its payment system, the  agency\u2019s general ledger, or in a separate grant management system.

ACF officials said the separation between grants  management systems and payment systems can present challenges  when awarding agencies attempt to reconcile final reports and close out  grants in the two separate systems. According to ACF officials, grant  closeout can become a manual process that presents challenges for  agencies that may have a limited number of grants specialists.

According to these officials, it could be possible for ACF to close a grant  award in its grants management system while the grant remains open in  the payment system due to a difference in the payments reported to the  awarding agency and PMS. As a result, the disconnection between  these systems can lead to undisbursed funds remaining in the payment  system when the grant is closed in the agencies\u2019 grants management  system. In these cases, ACF grant managers may need to deobligate  funds from the grant and this requires taking additional steps to reopen  the grant in the grant management system.

Indirect costs  include, for example, building utilities and administrative staff salaries. To  determine the share of indirect costs that may be charged to federally  funded awards, grantees use a mechanism called the indirect cost rate,  which may be applied to a portion of direct costs and is available to the  grantee for a given period. A grantee may continue using a provisional  rate until agreement is reached on a new final rate.

For example, NASA officials said grant closeout  challenges can occur if the final approved rate differs from the provisional  indirect cost rate used when the grant was awarded. The officials said  that in those cases the grantee must make reporting adjustments based  on the final approved rate for the period of performance. In some cases,  NASA officials said negotiating a final indirect cost rate agreement can  take years. OMB staff told us that one of the main reasons for grant  closeout delays involves the complexity of finalizing indirect cost rate  agreements. OMB staff explained that while a majority of grantees have  negotiated indirect cost rate agreements, the status of the agreement,  whether it is a provisional or a final negotiated indirect cost rate, can  affect when a grantee can close out. OMB staff said if a rate is not  finalized and the award has reached the end date, closing out a grant  using a provisional rate may involve subsequent complexities. Indirect  cost rate agreements are also an issue for closing grants at the National  Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). According to NIST officials,  grantees have to negotiate a final rate in order for NIST to properly close  an award, and grantees have to wait for their next audit cycle to be able  to negotiate a final rate, which could be over a year after the award has  expired. Consequently it may not be ideal to close out grants without a  final rate. For example if the final indirect rate after closeout is lower, the  grantee owes money to the federal government, and the agency would  have to recover the funds.

According to DPM, the main purpose of PMS is to serve as the fiscal  intermediary between awarding agencies and the recipients of grants and  contracts. Its main objectives are to expedite the flow of cash between the  federal government and recipients, transmit recipient disbursement data  back to the awarding agencies, and manage cash flow advances to grant  recipients. PSC personnel operate PMS, making payments to grant  recipients, serving as user/recipient liaisons, and reporting disbursement  data to awarding agencies. Awarding agencies\u2019 responsibilities include  entry of authorization data into PMS, program and grant monitoring, grant  closeout, and reconciliation of their accounting records to PMS  information. Awarding agencies pay PSC a service fee for maintaining  accounts and executing payments through PMS.

These closeout reports list all expired grant accounts that,  according to the data system, have not completed all of their closeout  procedures. A grant account is considered expired in PMS if (1) the grant  end date is more than 3 months old, and (2) the latest date of  disbursement was at least 9 months old. PMS does not close a grant  account until instructed to do so by the awarding agency. For each grant  account, the report includes such information as the identification number,  the amount of funding authorized for the grant, the amount disbursed, and  the beginning and end dates for the grant. The grant end date is a  mandatory field completed by the awarding agency.", "PSC provided us with the PMS quarterly closeout report for the end of  fiscal year 2015 (September 30, 2015). PSC appended to the closeout  data an additional field showing the applicable number from the Catalog  of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) for each grant account. We used  the CFDA number provided by PSC to help determine which accounts to  exclude from our analysis. The purpose of these exclusions was to avoid  including accounts that would distort the calculation of undisbursed funds  in expired PMS grant accounts and to provide comparability with our  previous findings. Our criteria for excluding accounts were consistent with  the methodology we used in our 2008 and 2012 reports. We excluded  127 programs from our review. We included programs that were grants or cooperative agreements; had a time limit for spending; had a zero or positive undisbursed balance; had a readily identifiable CFDA number and program description in did not have special financial reporting procedures.", "For reporting purposes, we separated data into two sets of expired grant  accounts: (1) one set consisted of expired accounts for which all of the  funds made available had been disbursed and (2) a second set of  accounts included expired accounts with a positive undisbursed balance.  To obtain an estimate of the total amount of fees paid for maintaining  accounts with no undisbursed balances remaining, we requested data  from PSC for all accounts that appear on the year-end fiscal year 2015  closeout report (i.e., as of September 30, 2015) with a unique accounting  status symbol indicating that no undisbursed balances remained and that  the awarding agency only needed to submit the final closeout code to  PSC to finalize grant closeout.

We discussed with HHS officials any known limitations  associated with the data. According to HHS officials, no-cost extensions  that extend the grant period without changing the authorized amount of  funding may not be reflected in PMS data. As a result, PMS closeout  reports may include grants that have received an extension and are  therefore not eligible for closeout.
