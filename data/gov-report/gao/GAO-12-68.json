In addition to immediate relief efforts, in July 2010, Congress appropriated $1.14 billion in supplemental funds for reconstruction, most of which was provided to the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Department of State (State). USAID and State are administering about $412 million in supplemental and regular fiscal year appropriations for infrastructure construction activities. In May 2011, in response to a congressional mandate, GAO reported on overall U.S. plans for assistance to Haiti. This report addresses infrastructure construction activities, including (1) USAID and State obligations and expenditures; (2) USAID staffing; (3) USAID planning; and (4) potential sustainability challenges USAID faces.

As of September 30, 2011, USAID and State had allocated almost $412 million for infrastructure construction activities, obligated approximately $48.4 million (11.8 percent), and expended approximately $3.1 million (0.8 percent). Of the almost $412 million, about 87 percent was allocated from the 2010 Supplemental Appropriations Act and 13 percent from regular fiscal year appropriations. USAID accounts for about 89 percent of the $412 million, including funds for construction in the energy, ports, shelter, health, and food security sectors. State activities in the governance and rule of law sector account for the remaining 11 percent. USAID had difficulty staffing the Haiti mission after the earthquake, a factor that has contributed to delays in infrastructure construction activities. Soon after the earthquake, 10 of the 17 U.S. citizen Foreign Service Officers, known as U.S. direct-hire staff, in Haiti left. USAID, lacking a process for expediting the movement of staff to post-disaster situations, had difficulty replacing them and recruiting additional staff. These staff included key technical personnel such as engineers and contracting officers needed to plan and implement infrastructure activities in sectors such as energy and ports, where the mission had not previously worked. With limited U.S. direct-hire staff on board, the mission relied heavily on temporary staff, and remaining staff assumed duties outside their normal areas of expertise. The mission plans to have all U.S. direct-hire staff on board by February 2012. Since infrastructure activities will continue until at least 2015, the mission will need to maintain sufficient staff for several years to manage the activities supported by the increase in Haiti reconstruction funds. USAID and State are planning activities in Haiti, but various challenges have contributed to some of USAID's delays. As of October 2011, USAID had drafted eight Activity Approval Documents (AADs) that include planned activities, costs, risks, and assumptions. AADs for the education, energy, food security, governance and rule of law, health, and shelter sectors have been approved. The AAD process has been more comprehensive and involved than is typical for such efforts, according to USAID officials. Although USAID made progress in planning, construction of some activities was delayed for various reasons, and some activities do not yet have planned start dates. For example, the mission was delayed in awarding contracts in the shelter sector due to issues such as identifying sites for shelter and obtaining land title. The sustainability of USAID-funded infrastructure depends, in part, on improvements to the Haitian government's long-standing economic and institutional weaknesses. USAID has considered various sustainability issues and is planning institutional strengthening activities, such as management reform of the power utility, but USAID planning documents acknowledge that these reforms will be challenging and that infrastructure activities face risks. These challenges are consistent with prior GAO reports that address sustainability of U.S. infrastructure projects in other countries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate USAID's progress in planning and implementing its many post-earthquake infrastructure construction activities in Haiti over the next several years, particularly those requiring key technical staff, GAO recommends that the USAID Administrator ensure that U.S. direct-hire staff are placed at the mission within time frames that avoid future staffing gaps or delays.

Since then, Haiti has suffered from a cholera epidemic that has  affected over 450,000 persons and caused over 6,000 deaths. In addition,  Haiti has experienced political uncertainty following the earthquake. Due  to the inconclusive presidential election of November 2010, the new  President was not inaugurated until May 2011. On May 13, 2011, the U.S.  and Haitian governments signed the Haiti Reconstruction Grant  Agreement. Later, the Haitian Parliament rejected two candidates  nominated by the new President for the post of Prime Minister, who  serves as head of government. In early October 2011, the Parliament  approved the President\u2019s third nominee.", "In response to the earthquake, in the Act, Congress provided more than  $1.14 billion in reconstruction funds for Haiti, available through the end of  fiscal year 2012. Of this amount, about $918 million was directed to  USAID and State, of which $770 million was provided through the  USAID-administered Economic Support Fund (ESF) account and about  $148 million through the State-administered International Narcotics  Control and Law Enforcement account (see table 1).", "Of the almost $918 million in supplemental funds, as of September 30, 2011,  $356.9 million was allocated for the construction and rehabilitation of  infrastructure. In addition to these supplemental funds, USAID and State  allocated funding for reconstruction activities from other budgetary sources,  such as annual appropriations for fiscal years 2010 and 2011, of which $54.8  million was allocated for construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure. In  total, the agencies allocated almost $412 million from both supplemental and  other budgetary sources for construction and rehabilitation of infrastructure.", "In September 2010, State and USAID, as required by the Act, issued a joint  spending plan that showed allocations of supplemental reconstruction funds  (see fig. 1 for a timeline of key government of Haiti and international donors  and U.S. government actions and events after the earthquake).", "In January 2011, the U.S. government issued the 5-year Post-Earthquake  USG Haiti Strategy: Toward Renewal and Economic Opportunity.

According to mission  officials, U.S. direct-hire staff were permitted to leave for several reasons,  primarily because approximately 40 percent of U.S. embassy housing  was damaged or destroyed, the school for mission staff children was  damaged and not functional, and staff were experiencing emotional  challenges after the earthquake.", "To fill the U.S. direct-hire vacancies, USAID posted 10 routine agency  wide job announcements in March 2010, but no U.S. direct-hire staff  applied. According to USAID officials, potential applicants did not apply  due to, among other things, the damaged school, uncertainty about the  quality of life in Haiti, and the lack of financial or other incentives in the job  announcements. In May 2010, USAID again posted the 10 job  announcements and, this time, attracted a number of applicants because  the postings included financial incentives and waived the requirement that  successful applicants bid on positions in four USAID-designated critical  priority countries\u2014Afghanistan, Iraq, Pakistan, and Sudan\u2014upon  completion of their tours in Haiti. Having received a sufficient number of applicants for the May 2010 posting, the mission soon selected the staff.  However, U.S. direct-hire staff did not begin to arrive in Haiti until early  2011 because, among other things, households and families had to be  moved and some staff required up to 6 months in language training. In  addition to filling existing positions, USAID received approval from the  U.S. Ambassador to Haiti in February 2011 for 15 additional U.S. direct- hire staff to manage the surge in earthquake-related funding.

During that time, the mission experienced  delays in planning and implementing some construction activities.  According to USAID officials, U.S. direct-hire staff are essential in  planning and establishing continuity for long-term reconstruction activities,  including infrastructure activities such as the design of power generation  facilities, which require specific skills. Delays in staffing key positions,  such as engineers, contracting officers, and sector specialists, created  particular difficulties. For example:  Engineering: Although USAID allocated more than $300 million in  supplemental funds for infrastructure activities that would require  engineering skills, the mission\u2019s planning process was delayed due, in  part, to the lack of U.S. direct-hire engineers, according to USAID  officials. USAID was unable to reassign U.S. direct-hire engineers from  other missions around the world because USAID has few engineers  worldwide, according to mission officials. At the time of the earthquake,  the mission had two Haitian engineers on its staff, but these individuals  had experience in constructing and repairing roads and bridges and  rehabilitating small infrastructure\u2014with no experience in energy and ports  construction. In anticipation of its pending involvement in infrastructure  activities, the mission created a new Office of Infrastructure, Energy, and  Engineering, but staff with specialized engineering skills did not begin to  arrive at the mission until early 2011. For example, the mission\u2019s chief  engineer, who is responsible for overseeing construction activities in the  energy sector, arrived in April 2011, and an engineer overseeing the  construction of health facilities arrived in May 2011.", "Mission officials in the health sector stated that initial delays in staffing an  engineer in the Office of Infrastructure, Energy, and Engineering  presented a planning challenge because in-country engineering expertise  is essential to rehabilitate a major hospital and numerous smaller health  clinics. According to mission officials, the lack of staff and expertise made  planning difficult for several reasons. For example, some staff who were  involved in developing certain cost and planning estimates and assessing  potential constraints had limited expertise, thus requiring more review by  others. Further, some construction activities experienced delays as a  result of staff shortages. For example, on September 22, 2011, about 3  months later than initially planned, the mission awarded a feasibility study  related to its plans to invest in port development in the Cap-Ha\u00eftien  development corridor. According to USAID officials, the delay occurred  because mission staff were focused on energy-sector issues related to  the North Industrial Park. The feasibility study is needed before the  mission can determine its specific plans for port construction and set an  award date for the construction contract that is expected to follow.", "Contracting: The mission also experienced delays in awarding some  infrastructure construction contracts as originally scheduled because it  had only one U.S. direct-hire contracting officer in country with the  authority to approve contracts of more than $3 million, according to  USAID officials. The mission plans to award several complex contracts  for more than $3 million each from the more than $300 million in  supplemental funding it has allocated for infrastructure activities. The  mission currently has three other contracting officers with lower  contracting authority approval limits, and as of September 2011, the  mission had requested additional contracting officers it anticipates will be  needed to keep pace with the planned time frames for the mission\u2019s  planned infrastructure activities.", "Programming: The mission also experienced delays because, for more  than 1 year following the earthquake, it did not have several sector  directors, including a program office chief and office chiefs for economic  growth and democracy and governance offices, among other  programming positions. According to mission officials, key decisions  during the design and planning of construction activities were delayed, in  part, because the mission had not been involved in such activities before  the earthquake and there was limited expertise among existing staff. In  addition, mission staff have experienced increased workloads and some  mission staff have had to take on additional responsibilities outside their  normal areas of expertise. For example, the deputy mission director  assumed the additional role of leading energy sector planning for about  15 months until the April 2011 arrival of the chief engineer. In addition to  other staffing issues, three of USAID\u2019s Haitian employees died in the  earthquake. Further, mission officials stated that numerous surviving  Haitian employees have been unable to contribute quickly to post- earthquake planning efforts because some had family members who died  or were injured in the earthquake and many had residences that were  damaged or destroyed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID Haiti Relied Largely on Temporary Staff Following the Earthquake", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review of USAID policies and guidance, including its  Automated Directives System, and statements of mission officials, USAID  does not have an expedited process for placing U.S. direct-hire staff to  work on reconstruction efforts in an urgent post-disaster or post-crisis  situation such as Haiti. Absent such a process, USAID Haiti used  USAID\u2019s routine but lengthy staffing process, which involves, among  other things, posting job opportunities agency-wide, receiving  applications, selecting staff, and waiting until they are released from their  current assignments.", "To meet the increased need for mission staff to manage the program, the  agency temporarily hired or reassigned staff, including staff from its Haiti  Task Team in Washington, D.C., to complete more than 400 temporary  duty assignments for periods ranging from one week to several months.  For example, USAID used personal services contracts to hire staff to  provide financial management expertise; assigned headquarters-based  staff from its Latin America and Caribbean Bureau to manage and  oversee rubble removal and other efforts; and provided fiscal year 2010  supplemental funding to an implementing organization to manage people  who repaired roads, cleaned drainage canals, and performed other  rehabilitation activities.", "According to mission officials, planning and implementation of  reconstruction activities were delayed because the few staff remaining in  Haiti were heavily involved in recruiting, placing, and training temporary  staff in Haiti. Senior mission staff stated that, for many temporary staff  positions, the mission had to develop detailed scopes of work for the  positions and then brief and train newly arrived staff on substantive  issues.

These six AADs account for 87 percent of USAID\u2019s  available supplemental and program funds, according to USAID. The two  remaining AADs require additional work before they can be approved,  according to USAID officials. Specifically, the AAD for economic  security\u2014which does not include any planned infrastructure  construction\u2014requires further interagency discussion with the U.S.  Department of the Treasury (Treasury), which is the co-implementer of  economic activities in Haiti, and the AAD for ports has not been approved  because, among other things, USAID is waiting for the Haitian  government to make key decisions regarding port regulations, use of  territorial waters and the Haitian customs code.", "According to USAID officials, the AADs for Haiti are more comprehensive  and have involved a more extensive review process than is typical. For  example, USAID officials stated that the AADs for USAID activities in Haiti  have included more analytical metrics, such as the results USAID plans to  achieve in return for its investment. These AADs incorporate a discussion  of how each sector will meet USAID\u2019s agency wide procurement reform  known as USAID Forward, which has, among other objectives, the goal of  broadening the base of USAID\u2019s implementing partners. According to  USAID officials, incorporating USAID Forward has changed the  procurement plan structure in the AADs, requiring more scrutiny by  agency officials. For example, USAID indicated for activities described in  the AAD procurement plans whether those activities will be targeted at  local firms or organizations or use traditional partners.", "In addition, several factors led to a more extensive review process for the  AADs for activities in Haiti. According to USAID officials, AADs are  usually drafted at the mission and approved by the mission director.  However, due to U.S. foreign policy interests in Haiti, in addition to the  review and approval of the Haiti mission director, these AADs have  undergone high-level review by USAID and State\u2019s Office of the Haiti  Special Coordinator. Because the U.S strategy is a whole-of-government  strategy, a number of other U.S. agencies were involved in reviewing and  approving the AADs. These agencies included the U.S. Department of  Agriculture for food security, Treasury for economic security, and the  Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for health. According to  USAID and State officials, the inclusion of other agencies in the process  added levels of review that have extended AAD development and  approval.", "Prior to AADs being approved in Washington, D.C., the Haiti mission  continued with other planning efforts. The mission\u2019s Office of Acquisition  and Assistance developed a procurement plan to manage contract  actions\u2014such as the award of contracts for planning, design, and  construction services\u2014that enable implementation of the activities. In the  shelter sector, for example, the mission has awarded contracts for the  design of the proposed residential sites; the design includes site layout  plans, environmental impact assessments, and housing-unit design  specifications. In instances where an AAD had not been approved but  where the mission deemed that sufficient planning had been completed,  the mission used activity-specific approval memoranda to initiate  procurement actions, and, in some instances where design work was  completed, award construction contracts.

Some of the delay was to allow contractors time to respond to  USAID\u2019s clarifications and new contract requirements that were the  result of contractor questions, changes to documents in the original  solicitation, and the addition of environmental mitigation requirements.  Some of the delay was also due to time spent by USAID mission staff  focusing on a bid protest of the Port-au-Prince substation  rehabilitation contract.", "Some key USAID activities experienced delays in their original schedule  due to technical issues, and other activities do not yet have a planned  award date.

Based on  data from the UN Office of the Special Envoy for Haiti, aid from bilateral  and multilateral donors represented approximately 57 percent of the  government of Haiti\u2019s total revenue in 2009. Following the earthquake, the  percentage increased substantially, to an estimated 80 percent of total  government revenue in 2010. Additionally, more than 16,000 civil  servants died in the earthquake and, including those who left the country,  the Haitian government workforce is now reduced by 33 percent,  according to the United Nations Development Program. Further,  according to the U.S. government strategy and USAID documents and  officials, electricity laws, the structure of the health care system, the  customs code, and housing and urban development policy, among other  areas, all need reform.", "As part of its required planning processes, USAID considered various  sustainability issues for its infrastructure activities. Some activities face  sustainability challenges. In planning and assessing the sustainability of  its activities in Haiti, USAID used a variety of resources. These included  relevant provisions in the Foreign Assistance Act, guidance from the   the agency\u2019s project  agency\u2019s Automated Directives System (ADS),design guidance, and studies and assessments by USAID and other  donors such as assessments of Haitian government ministries by the  Inter-American Development Bank. In addition, for infrastructure activities,  the mission relied on general principles for estimating costs, including  projecting operations and maintenance costs and estimating basic returns  on investments.", "For four activities, as of September 2011, USAID has also completed  certification required by the Foreign Assistance Act indicating that Haiti is  capable of effectively maintaining and utilizing the projects. In addition,  each AAD contains a section broadly describing the sustainability issues  of the activities planned in each sector.", "The following are examples of some of the challenges identified by  USAID and its plans to address those issues.", "Energy sector: The power utility, Electricit\u00e9 d\u2019Haiti (EDH), faces  considerable technical and managerial challenges that have resulted in  financial losses. The utility receives an annual subsidy from the Haitian  government of approximately $100 million, which, according to USAID\u2019s  energy AAD, represents approximately 12 percent of the government of  Haiti\u2019s national budget. To assist the EDH, in April 2011 the mission  awarded a 2-year contract to improve EDH management while long-term  modernization options are developed and evaluated. In addition, USAID  plans for the North Industrial Park power generation facility to be  managed independently of EDH through September 2016. This facility is  expected to generate enough revenue to cover operations and  maintenance costs, including the replacement of major equipment.  However, modernization of the energy sector is based, among other  things, on the assumption that the Haitian government will decide on an  appropriate modernization model and take necessary, but politically  challenging steps, to implement that model, according to the energy AAD.", "Health sector: The Haitian government has made efforts to decentralize  the health care system since the 1990s, but only 12 of 63 local health  networks are currently operational. To support Haitian government  efforts to decentralize the health care system, USAID is planning to  provide resources, such as repair or construction of health facilities, to 9  to 12 local health networks in the U.S. development corridors. USAID is  also requiring business plans in this sector so that USAID will no longer  need to contribute to operations and maintenance of new or renovated  health facilities within 3 to 5 years of completion. USAID acknowledges  that strengthening the Haitian Ministry of Health and a decentralized  health care system\u2014both of which would likely enhance sustainability\u2014 are complex undertakings that will require long-term efforts. According to  USAID, there are also shortages of community health workers, low  retention of doctors and nurses who can earn more money in private  practice or working for nongovernmental organizations, and a low skill  and knowledge base at all levels.", "Ports sector: According to USAID\u2019s draft ports AAD, the Haitian  government does not have a well-defined legal and regulatory framework  for ports, and the three Haitian government entities involved in port  operations have unclear roles and responsibilities. Furthermore, the sector is characterized by excessively high port charges, unreliably slow  port clearance processes, inadequate human and institutional capacities,  and poor integration between international and regional ports. To assist  with port construction in the Cap-Ha\u00eftien development corridor, according  to USAID\u2019s draft ports AAD, (1) a public-private partnership will be  created and (2) USAID will provide technical assistance to Haitian officials  to help them lower port charges in the northern port and introduce  processes to expedite port clearance and tax collection. However, the  ports sector AAD notes that port construction is a \u201chigh-risk\u201d program  whose success depends on, among other things, the political will of the  Haitian government to make improvements in a sector controlled by a few  individuals, tens of millions of dollars in additional funding from other  donors, and sufficient demand for port use.", "Shelter sector: Haiti lacks a single agency for housing and urban  development policy resulting in a sector characterized by fragmented  authorities and unenforced policies, according to the shelter sector AAD.  Among other things, Haiti does not have an effective national land  register\u2014known as a cadastre\u2014and system to record land ownership; a  policy framework that establishes and streamlines building standards and  other controls to promote disaster-resistant housing; and has poor  capacity to support the community organizations needed for shelter  infrastructure and service delivery. USAID plans to provide assistance in  areas such as building standards and enforcement mechanisms; land  tenure, land title, and property tax records; and housing finance and  mortgage markets. The shelter AAD notes that sustainability depends on  the ability of the Haitian government to manage and maintain  infrastructure and services over the long term. Policy change requires the  political will and dedication of the Haitian government, as well as support  from other members of the donor community. Sustainability also depends  on economic growth, governance reform, and the ability of Haitians to pay  taxes. If economic opportunities at the planned new shelter sites in  locations outside of the capital are insufficient, people may return to Port- au-Prince. The success of USAID plans will depend on new economic  opportunities that would enable municipalities to pay for road  maintenance at the new sites and for housing beneficiaries to pay fees for  water services and basic maintenance, according to U.S. officials.", "Our past work on U.S. assistance in developing countries shows that the  U.S. government has previously encountered challenges in ensuring the  sustainability of infrastructure activities. For example, following the 2001  earthquakes in El Salvador, we reported on sustainability challenges to  USAID-funded shelter and health clinic construction, including residents  who could not afford the cost of connecting to the potable water and  electricity systems in the new houses. In addition, in July 2011, we  reported that the governments of Cape Verde and Honduras faced  challenges sustaining several activities funded through the Millennium  Challenge Corporation (MCC). For example, in Honduras, uncertainty  about government funding for maintenance and other construction  activities may jeopardize the sustainability of some major roads built with  MCC funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["The United States is providing over one billion dollars to Haiti for  reconstruction but faces an enormous task in helping the country begin to  recover from the 2010 earthquake. A number of factors have delayed  USAID\u2019s planning and implementation of projects to rebuild infrastructure  in the energy, ports, and shelter sectors\u2014areas where the agency has  not previously worked and that require specific skills or expertise. Haiti  has always been a challenging operating environment, and the  earthquake created additional difficulties. Further, USAID had difficulties  securing staff\u2014particularly technical staff such as contracting officers and  engineers\u2014who were willing to live and work in the country after the  earthquake and who could bring the expertise necessary to plan and  execute large, complex infrastructure projects. Such difficulties have  contributed to delays in U.S. efforts, with only a few contracts awarded to  date. Additional issues, such as difficulties in obtaining land title and the  time needed to conduct environmental assessments, have led to delays  in planning construction activities, and some activities do not yet have  start dates. Further, the Haitian government\u2019s long-standing economic  and institutional weaknesses are complicating U.S. efforts and could  affect the future of this assistance, and the political will of the recently  formed Haitian government to implement reforms and undertake  sustainability efforts is unknown. Even though USAID is taking some  steps to address the long-term future of U.S.-funded infrastructure, it is  unclear at this point in time if those projects will ultimately be sustainable.  U.S. activities in Haiti will continue for many years, and USAID staff can  be expected to turn over numerous times.
