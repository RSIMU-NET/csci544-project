Our analysis showed that even after adding a 30-percent adjustment to VA rates to account for differences between the Medicare and VA programs, Medicare would have saved over $500 million in fiscal year 1996 had it reimbursed oxygen suppliers at the adjusted VA rates. In June 1997, we provided additional information on our comparison of Medicare and VA rates to the Chairman, Subcommittee on Health, House Committee on Ways and Means. Subsequently, the Congress mandated reductions in Medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen, beginning January 1, 1998, as specified in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. The act also gives the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) the authority to restructure reimbursement rates in a budget-neutral manner and requires the Secretary to develop service requirements for Medicare home oxygen suppliers.", "This report (1) recaps our comparison of Medicare and VA payment rates, (2) addresses concerns about access to liquid oxygen systems and lightweight portable equipment for patients who are highly active, and (3) discusses standards for the services associated with meeting patients\u2019 home oxygen needs.", "To address these issues, we reviewed Medicare regulations and VA policies regarding home oxygen benefits. We also obtained information from the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA), which administers the Medicare program; the VA central office and selected VA medical centers; home oxygen suppliers and industry representatives; and patient advocacy groups, physicians, and respiratory therapists.

Supplemental oxygen has been clinically shown to assist many of these patients. Medicare\u2019s eligibility criteria for the home oxygen benefit are quite specific. Patients must have (1) an appropriate diagnosis, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; (2) clinical tests documenting reduced levels of oxygen in the blood; and (3) a certificate of medical necessity, signed by a physician, prescribing the volume of supplemental oxygen required in liters per minute and documenting whether the patient needs a portable unit in addition to a home-based stationary unit.", "Physicians can prescribe a specific type of oxygen system on the certificate of medical necessity, or they can allow the oxygen supplier to decide which type of system best meets a patient\u2019s needs. Currently, there are three methods, or modalities, through which patients can obtain supplemental oxygen: compressed gas, which is available in various sized tanks, from large stationary cylinders to small portable cylinders; oxygen concentrators, which are electrically operated machines about the size of a dehumidifier that extract oxygen from room air; and liquid oxygen, which is available in large stationary reservoirs and portable units.", "For most patients, each of the three modalities\u2014compressed gas, liquid oxygen, and oxygen concentrator\u2014is clinically equally effective for use as a stationary unit. However, liquid oxygen is most often prescribed for the small proportion of patients that require a very high oxygen liter flow. As shown in table 1, over the past 10 years the use of oxygen concentrators has increased substantially, and the use of compressed gas as the primary, home-based unit is now negligible.", "At the time of our review, the monthly Medicare fee schedule allowance for a stationary oxygen system was about $285, and it is currently about $300. Medicare pays 80 percent of the allowance, and the patient is responsible for the remaining 20 percent. The Medicare allowance covers use of the equipment; all refills of gas or liquid oxygen; supplies such as tubing; a backup unit, if provided, for patients using a concentrator; and services such as patient assessments, equipment setup, training for patients and caregivers, periodic maintenance, and repairs.", "In addition to a stationary unit for use in the home, about 75 percent of Medicare home oxygen patients have portable units that allow them to perform activities away from their stationary unit and outside the home.The most common portable unit is a compressed gas tank set on a small cart that can be pulled by the user. Highly active individuals who spend a great deal of time outside the home may use a portable liquid oxygen cylinder or a lightweight gas cylinder, both of which can be carried in a backpack or shoulder bag. These units may be used with an oxygen conserving device to increase the amount of time a single cylinder can be used. The Medicare monthly allowance for portable equipment is currently about $48, regardless of the type of unit. For the period we reviewed, the allowance was about $45.", "The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 reduced Medicare reimbursement rates for home oxygen by 25 percent effective January 1, 1998, and by an additional 5 percent effective January 1, 1999.

Such factors could include clinical characteristics of each patient population as well as differences in how the two programs are administered. Regarding clinical differences, Medicare and VA patients with pulmonary insufficiency must meet the same medical eligibility criteria for home oxygen, and clinical experts and suppliers told us that the home oxygen needs of the two patient groups are essentially the same. We excluded from our analysis the small number of VA patients who were receiving home oxygen for conditions other than pulmonary insufficiency, such as cluster headaches. Utilization patterns for stationary equipment were remarkably similar. Of the 5,000 VA patients in our nationwide sample, about 84 percent used an oxygen concentrator, and 16 percent used stationary liquid oxygen systems.

During the same period, monthly VA payments averaged about $125 for patients with concentrators and $315 for patients with stationary liquid systems. Yet about 15 percent of both Medicare and VA patients had liquid stationary systems, an indication that the Medicare modality-neutral rates then in effect did not restrict patient access to liquid systems.", "The upcoming reduction in Medicare payment rates, however, could lead some suppliers to shore up their profits by offering only oxygen concentrators for stationary systems, which would also reduce access to liquid portable refills from stationary units. Most Medicare suppliers now provide relatively few stationary liquid systems or none at all. Of about 6,500 Medicare home oxygen suppliers, about 82 percent obtained 5 percent or less of their Medicare revenues from stationary liquid oxygen systems. Furthermore, almost 25 percent of oxygen suppliers received virtually all of their Medicare revenue from oxygen concentrators. Providing only concentrators allows these suppliers to maximize their profits by avoiding the higher costs associated with stationary liquid as well as with portable units. (Medicare considers the monthly fee for the stationary unit to cover supplies and services for portable units, so providing portable units costs suppliers more.)", "Since VA acquires home oxygen services under a fee-for-service payment system, VA can ensure that its patients have access to stationary liquid oxygen systems by paying more for them. In addition, VA doctors prescribe the type of system that they feel is most appropriate for their patients.

These supporters of the modality-neutral rate also believe that the lack of clinical criteria for deciding which patients need a lightweight ambulatory unit means far more patients will obtain such ambulatory units than will benefit from them. Also, once a patient obtains an ambulatory unit, a lack of adequate controls in the Medicare program could lead to continued payment for the more costly unit when it is no longer needed. Since chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is progressive, a patient\u2019s activity level and the need for a portable or ambulatory system can be expected to eventually decline.

Other than these requirements, Medicare has no standards specific to the needs of home oxygen patients.", "In contrast, VA has both broad accreditation standards and specific contract terms that often define the specific type and frequency of services VA home oxygen patients should receive. VA contracts frequently specify company and personnel qualifications; requirements for staff training, patient education, and development of a patient plan of care; the type and number of patient service visits necessary; required response time for emergencies; and procedures for addressing patient concerns.

The industry study noted above quantifies this risk as adding 5 percent to the cost of the VA rate in order for the VA program to serve a Medicare beneficiary.", "Our analysis of Medicare claims data showed that 18.7 percent of home oxygen claims in the first quarter of fiscal year 1996 were denied. However, most of these denials were for administrative reasons, such as duplicate claims or missing information. The actual denial rate for medical ineligibility was 2 percent. Medicare\u2019s criteria for eligibility are specific and clear cut, and suppliers told us they know if patients are going to qualify for coverage.", "We concluded that the risk of medically based claims denial is not a major factor in explaining the cost differential between VA and Medicare. However, because this factor results from the different ways home oxygen is authorized in the two programs, we considered it as part of our overall adjustment of VA payment rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Less Cumbersome Administrative Process", "paragraphs": ["Industry representatives stated that the administrative burden of complying with Medicare requirements accounts for a major portion of the difference between VA and Medicare payment rates. One major burden they cited is the certificate of medical necessity, which must be completed by the prescribing physician before the claim can be submitted to Medicare for payment. Every supplier we interviewed complained about the difficulty in quickly obtaining this document. The industry study estimated that documenting patient eligibility represents 4 percent of the difference between VA and Medicare payment rates. requirements for this expensive, often lifelong benefit should be fairly stringent. Recent changes have reduced the administrative burden by allowing many patients to receive lifetime certification. Also, HCFA recently issued a draft revision of the certificate of medical necessity in an attempt to simplify the form and make it easier for doctors to complete. For example, the revised certificate no longer requires doctors to justify the portable unit.", "Our review of patient case records showed that, while most certificates are completed within 30 days of service setup, there is documentary support for the suppliers\u2019 contention that there are significant problems with this process. We found several examples of long delays and one case in which a patient died and the doctor refused to fill out the certificate, so the firm was not paid at all for its services. Most suppliers we talked with had developed strategies to facilitate the completion of these certificates. These strategies involved extra staff time and costs: for example, sending a representative to doctors\u2019 offices to request the certificate in person. For the records we reviewed, we found that 64 percent of the certificates were completed within 30 days of the supplier\u2019s starting service and 88 percent were done within 90 days.", "While obtaining the certificate of medical necessity represents a major start-up cost, the impact on the difference between the monthly VA and Medicare payment rates is less when that cost is amortized over the length of time that the certificate is valid. For most patients, eligibility must be renewed after the first year. At that time, the doctor may certify the patient for lifetime eligibility, and the patient never has to be recertified again. Once a patient\u2019s eligibility is established, Medicare billing is usually electronic and fairly straightforward. One VA contractor we visited noted that the electronic billing process for Medicare is far less cumbersome than submitting paper invoices each month to the local VA medical center. This indicates that the VA system is not entirely without processing costs, although when the medical eligibility documentation is included, Medicare\u2019s overall administrative burden on suppliers is greater.", "We concluded that the administrative burden for documenting medical eligibility and obtaining Medicare reimbursement is significantly greater than that associated with providing services under a VA medical center contract. Therefore, an adjustment to the VA rate is appropriate for comparison with the Medicare rate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Lack of a Copayment Requirement", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare home oxygen benefit requires that beneficiaries pay an annual deductible and 20 percent of the allowed reimbursement amount every month. Industry representatives contend that the cost of billing and collecting this copayment adds to the cost of providing services to Medicare beneficiaries. In addition, they point out that a portion of the copayment owed to them may never be collected. The VA program, in contrast, pays 100 percent of the contract price. The industry estimate states that this accounts for 6 percent of the difference between the cost of the VA program and Medicare.", "Noncollection of copayments does represent a cost differential between VA and Medicare but can only justify a small amount of the difference in payment rates. Our review of case records at the suppliers we visited showed that 86 percent of the Medicare beneficiaries whose records we saw either had supplemental insurance or were covered by Medicaid. Of the 14 percent of beneficiaries with neither private supplemental insurance nor Medicaid coverage, we found that only 3 percent had financial hardship waivers in their records. Even if suppliers were not able to collect copayments from three times the number of patients with hardship waivers, the uncollected amount would represent only 2 percent of the total revenue suppliers receive for Medicare home oxygen.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
