The federal government has a major stake in nursing home care, having paid the nation\u2019s roughly 17,000 homes $28 billion in 1997 through the Medicare and Medicaid programs. While the public relies on nursing homes to provide care to one of the most vulnerable segments of our population, allegations were raised to your Committee that some 3,000 residents died in more than 900 California nursing homes in 1993 as a result of malnutrition, dehydration, sepsis from improperly treated urinary tract infections, and other serious conditions for which they did not receive acceptable care.", "The information I am presenting today is based on our recently issued report to your Committee. Although I will begin with the care problems found through reviewing medical records for a sample of 62 residents who died in 1993, the majority of my comments will focus on our analysis of the current information on the quality of care in all California nursing homes. This analysis focused on care problems identified in recent state and federal quality reviews that California conducted in the last 2 or 3 years, obstacles to federal and state efforts to identify care problems, and implementation of federal enforcement policies to ensure that homes correct problems identified and then sustain compliance with federal requirements. The federal and state agencies with oversight responsibility for homes receiving funds from Medicare and Medicaid are the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and the state of California\u2019s Department of Health Services (DHS). Together, they oversee care in the more than 1,400 California nursing homes, representing more than 141,000 resident beds. Medicare and Medicaid paid these homes approximately $2 billion in 1997 to care for nursing home residents.", "In brief, we found that despite the presence of a considerable federal and state oversight infrastructure, a significant number of California nursing homes were not and currently are not sufficiently monitored to guarantee the safety and welfare of nursing home residents. We came to this conclusion, for the most part, by using information from California\u2019s DHS reviews of nursing home care covering 95 percent of the state\u2019s nursing homes and HCFA data on federal enforcement actions taken.", "Looking back at medical record information from 1993, we found that, of 62 resident cases sampled, residents in 34 cases received care that was unacceptable. However, in the absence of autopsy information that establishes the cause of death, we cannot be conclusive about whether this unacceptable care may have contributed directly to individual deaths.", "As for the extent of care problems currently, between July 1995 and February 1998, California surveyors cited 407 homes\u2014nearly a third of the 1,370 homes in our analysis\u2014for care violations they classified as serious under federal or state deficiency categories. Moreover, we believe that the extent of current serious care problems portrayed in these federal and state data is likely to be understated. The predictable timing of on-site reviews, the questionable accuracy and completeness of medical records, and the limited number of residents whose care was reviewed by surveyors in each home have each likely shielded some problems from surveyor scrutiny.", "Finally, even when the state identifies serious deficiencies, HCFA\u2019s enforcement policies have not been effective in ensuring that the deficiencies are corrected and remain corrected. For example, DHS surveyors cited about 1 in 11 California homes\u2014accounting for over 17,000 resident beds\u2014twice in consecutive annual reviews for violations involving harm to residents. (The national average was slightly worse\u2014about one in nine homes were cited twice consecutively for violations of federal requirements involving harm to residents.) Nevertheless, HCFA generally took a lenient stance toward many of these homes. California\u2019s DHS, consistent with HCFA\u2019s guidance on imposing sanctions, grants 98 percent of noncompliant homes a 30- to 45-day grace period to correct deficiencies without penalty, regardless of their past performance. Only the few homes that qualify as posing the greatest danger are not provided such a grace period. In addition, only 16 of the roughly 1,400 California homes participating in Medicare and Medicaid have been terminated from participation, most of them have been reinstated quickly, and many have had subsequent compliance problems. Recognizing shortcomings in enforcement, California officials told us that they launched a pilot program this month intended to target for increased vigilance certain of the state\u2019s nursing homes with the worst compliance records."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal responsibility for overseeing nursing homes belongs to HCFA, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Among other tasks, HCFA defines federal requirements for nursing home participation in Medicare and Medicaid and imposes sanctions against homes failing to meet these requirements. HCFA funds state survey agencies to do the on-site reviews of nursing homes\u2019 compliance with Medicare and Medicaid participation requirements. In California, DHS performs nursing home oversight, and its authority is specifically defined in state and federal law and regulations. As part of this role, DHS (1) licenses nursing homes to do business in California; (2) certifies to the federal government, by conducting reviews of nursing homes, that the homes are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid payment; and (3) investigates complaints about care provided in licensed homes. To assess nursing home compliance with federal and state laws and regulations, DHS relies on two types of reviews\u2014the standard survey and the complaint investigation. The standard survey, which must be conducted no less than once every 15 months at each home, entails a team of state surveyors spending several days on site conducting a broad review of care and services with regard to meeting the assessed needs of the residents. The complaint investigation involves conducting a targeted review with regard to a specific complaint filed against a home.", "The state and HCFA each has its own system for classifying deficiencies that determines which remedies, sanctions, or other actions should be taken against a noncompliant home. For standard surveys, California\u2019s DHS typically cites deficiencies using HCFA\u2019s classification and sanctioning scheme; for complaint investigations, it generally uses the state\u2019s classification and penalty scheme.", "Table 1 shows HCFA\u2019s classification of deficiencies and the accompanying levels of severity and compliance status.", "HCFA guidance also classifies deficiencies by their scope, or prevalence, as follows: (1) isolated, defined as affecting a limited number of residents; (2) pattern, defined as affecting more than a limited number of residents; and (3) widespread, defined as affecting all or almost all residents."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Review of Records for 1993 Deaths Uncovered Serious Care Problems", "paragraphs": ["Our work indicates that 34 residents\u2014more than half of our sample of 62 of California\u2019s nursing home residents who died in 1993\u2014received unacceptable care. In certain of those cases, the unacceptable care endangered residents\u2019 health and safety; however, without an autopsy that establishes the cause of death, we cannot be conclusive about whether the unacceptable care directly led to any individual\u2019s death. Nevertheless, the care problems we identified were troubling, such as unplanned weight loss and failure to properly treat pressure sores. For example:", "A resident lost 59 pounds\u2014about one-third of his weight\u2014over a 7-week period. Only a small share of the weight loss was attributable to fluid loss. Until 2 days before the resident\u2019s death, the nursing home staff had not recorded his weight since the day he was admitted to the home or notified the physician of the resident\u2019s condition.", "A resident was admitted to a nursing home with five pressure sores, four of which exposed the bone. Although the physician ordered pain medication during treatments that removed the blackened dead tissue from her sores, the resident\u2019s medical record indicated that she received pain medication only three times during 5 weeks of daily treatments.

(See fig. 1, \u201cCaused Death or Serious Harm.\u201d) These homes were cited for improper care leading to death (26 homes), posing life-threatening harm to residents (259 homes), other serious violations involving improper care (111 homes), or falsifying or omitting key information from medical records (11 homes).", "Caused Death or Serious Harm (407 Homes)", "Caused Less Serious Harm (449 Homes)", "The four wedges in figure 1 correspond to the federal deficiency categories shown in table 1 and include comparable-level deficiencies cited using the state\u2019s separate classification scheme, as shown in table 2.", "Improper care leading to death, imminent danger or probability of death, intentional falsification of medical records, or material omission in medical records.", "Violations of federal or state requirements that have a direct or immediate relationship to the health, safety, or security of a resident.", "California has no state citation directly equivalent to the federal category.", "California has no state citation directly equivalent to the federal category.", "Within the \u201ccaused death or serious harm\u201d group are homes cited for several types of federal violations, including \u201cimproper care leading to death\u201d and \u201clife-threatening harm.\u201d Following is an example from the 26 homes California surveyors cited for improper care leading to death:", "A resident who was admitted to a home for physical therapy rehabilitation following hip surgery died 5 days later from septic shock, caused by a urinary tract infection.

After we discussed these observations with California DHS officials, they acknowledged that a review of survey scheduling showed that the timing of some homes\u2019 surveys had not varied by more than a week or so for several cycles. DHS officials have since instructed district office managers to schedule surveys in a way that will reduce their predictability. surveys to make them less predictable and maximize the element of surprise. Subsequently, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA 87) nursing home legislation and HCFA\u2019s implementing guidance attempted to address the predictability issue.

The following two examples of such discrepancies were found in these records:", "During the hospital stay of a nursing home resident, doctors discovered that the resident was suffering from a fractured leg and that the fracture had occurred at least 3 weeks before the hospitalization.

However, HCFA\u2019s protocol\u2014designed to increase the likelihood of detecting problems with care\u2014does not call for randomly selecting a sufficient sample of residents. Instead, it relies primarily on the use of the individual surveyor\u2019s professional expertise and judgment to identify resident cases for further review.", "In contrast, our expert nurses, in reviewing current medical records to identify areas with potential for poor care, took a stratified random sample\u2014cases from different groups of the home\u2019s more fragile as well as average residents. Each sample was of sufficient size to estimate the prevalence of problems identified. In addition, the nurses used a standard protocol to collect and record quality-of-care information from chart reviews, staff interviews, and data analyses to ensure that the information was in a consistent format across the various individuals interviewed and documents reviewed.", "For two homes receiving their annual surveys, we compared the findings of the DHS surveyors, who followed HCFA\u2019s survey protocol, with the findings of our expert nurse team, who accompanied the state surveyors and conducted concurrent surveys. The methodology our expert nurses used examined primarily quality-of-care outcomes and related issues, whereas state surveyors, following federal guidance, reviewed this and 14 additional areas, such as social services, resident assessment, and transfer and discharge activities. As a result, DHS surveyors sought and found deficiencies in some important areas that our expert nurses did not document.

The national compliance rate for about the same period and for the same repeated, serious harm deficiencies was slightly worse: about 1 in 9 homes, representing more than 232,000 beds, were cited.", "However, HCFA enforcement policies have led to relatively few federal disciplinary actions taken against these homes in California. Before  OBRA 87, the only sanction available to HCFA and the states to impose against such noncompliant homes, short of termination, was to deny federal program payments for new admissions. OBRA 87 provided for additional sanctions, such as denial of payment for all admissions, civil monetary penalties, and on-site oversight by the state (\u201cstate monitoring\u201d).

Since July 1995, when the federal enforcement scheme established in OBRA 87 took effect, 59 California nursing homes have been cited for immediate jeopardy deficiencies and about 25 have been designated poor performers. HCFA guidance permits the state to broaden the definition of poor performer, but California has chosen not to do so.", "Noncompliant homes that are not classified in the immediate jeopardy or poor performer categories do not meet HCFA\u2019s criteria for immediate referral for sanctioning, even though some may have seriously harmed residents.

Between July 1995 and May 1998, California\u2019s DHS gave about 98 percent of noncompliant homes a grace period to correct deficiencies.

In principle, sanctions imposed against a home remain in effect until the home corrects the deficiencies cited and until state surveyors find, after an on-site review (called a \u201crevisit\u201d) that the home has resumed substantial compliance status. However, if some of the home\u2019s deficiencies persist but are no more serious than those in the \u201cpotential for harm\u201d range, HCFA policy is to forgo a revisit and accept the home\u2019s own report of resumed compliance status.

HCFA has the authority to terminate a home from participation in Medicare and Medicaid if the home fails to resume compliance. However, termination rarely occurs and is not as final as the term implies. In the recent past, California\u2019s terminated homes have rarely closed for good.

Together, these factors can mask significant care problems from the view of federal and state regulators.", "HCFA needs to reconsider its forgiving stance toward homes with serious, recurring violations. Federal policies regarding a grace period to correct deficiencies and to accept a home\u2019s report of compliance without an on-site review can be useful policies, given resource constraints, when applied to homes with less serious problems. However, regardless of resource constraints, HCFA and DHS need to ensure that their oversight efforts are directed at homes with serious and recurring violations and that policies developed for homes with less serious problems are not applied to them.", "Under current policies and practices, noncompliant homes that DHS identifies as having harmed or put residents in immediate danger have little incentive to sustain compliance, once achieved, because they may face no consequences for their next episode of noncompliance. Our findings regarding homes that repeatedly harmed residents or were reinstated after termination suggest that the goal of sustained compliance often eludes HCFA and DHS. Failure to bring such homes into compliance limits the ability of federal and state regulators to protect the welfare and safety of residents.", "Our report makes recommendations to the HCFA Administrator to address these issues. Although our report focuses on selected nursing homes in California, the problems we identified are indicative of systemic survey and enforcement weaknesses. Our recommendations therefore target federal guidance in general so that improvements are available to any state experiencing problems with seriously noncompliant homes. Thus, through HCFA\u2019s leadership, federal and state oversight of nursing homes can be strengthened nationally and residents nationwide can enjoy increased protection. In summary, we are recommending that HCFA revise its guidance to states in order to reduce the predictability of on-site reviews, possibly by staggering the schedule or segmenting the survey into two or more reviews; revise methods for sampling resident cases to better identify the potential for and prevalence of care problems; and, for those homes with a history of serious and repeated deficiencies, eliminate the offer of a grace period for resuming compliance and substantiate all of the home\u2019s reports of resumed compliance with an on-site review.", "HCFA, DHS, and nursing home industry representatives have reviewed our report. Acknowledging that the findings were troubling, HCFA officials informed us that they are planning to make several modifications in their survey and enforcement process. DHS also suggested a number of changes\u2014in addition to its new, focused enforcement program\u2014intended to improve the federal survey and enforcement process. Last week, the administration announced a series of actions related to federal oversight of nursing homes, including night and weekend survey visits and increased inspection of homes with a record of noncompliance. HCFA, DHS, and industry representatives generally concurred with our recommendations, although both HCFA and DHS expressed some reservations about segmenting the standard survey. They contend that dividing the survey into two or more reviews would make it less effective and more expensive. However, we believe that this option\u2014which could largely eliminate the predictability issue and increase the frequency of surveyors\u2019 presence at problem homes\u2014warrants consideration of the benefits to be derived relative to the disadvantages that were raised.", "Finally, despite the survey and enforcement modifications promised by HCFA and DHS, we remain concerned about the gap between stated goals and results. In 1995, HCFA enunciated its emphasis on encouraging sustained compliance and appropriately sanctioning deficient providers. Its practices since that time, however, argue for swift and significant changes, as illustrated in California by the persistence of problem homes with little federal sanctioning. We support the administration\u2019s recent initiative to strengthen the survey and enforcement process.
