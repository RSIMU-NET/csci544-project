This settlement\u2014referred to as the Master Settlement  Agreement (MSA)\u2014is the largest civil settlement in U.S. history and  commits tobacco companies to pay approximately $206 billion over the  first 25 years of the agreement. The four states that are not party to the  MSA\u2014Florida, Minnesota, Mississippi, and Texas\u2014had reached earlier,  individual settlements with the tobacco companies that call for payments  totaling $40 billion over 25 years.", "The MSA imposes no requirements on how states spend their MSA  payments; states are free to use the funds for any purpose. As a result, the  receipt of millions of MSA dollars has presented states with a unique  opportunity to finance programs in a variety of policy areas. Although the  MSA does not require states to spend settlement payments on tobacco  control programs, many antismoking and health care observers are  concerned that states are not using enough of the MSA payments to  enhance their tobacco prevention and control efforts.", "The scope of the MSA and the magnitude of the payments involved have  generated a great deal of attention. During the past year, several  organizations have issued reports on states\u2019 use of their MSA payments  and/or state spending on tobacco control, including the Campaign for  Tobacco-Free Kids, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),  the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), and the National  Governors\u2019 Association (NGA).", "You asked us to provide a comprehensive review of how states are using  their MSA payments\u2014in particular, to what extent states are using these  funds for smoking prevention and cessation programs. Our report responds  to your request by examining (1) the amount of payments received by  states and the states\u2019 decision-making processes regarding allocation of the  MSA payments in state fiscal years 2000 and 2001, and (2) the types of  programs that states funded with their MSA payments in those two fiscal  years. As agreed with your staff, our report focuses exclusively on the 46  states covered by the MSA and exclusively on MSA payments.", "To address our objectives we studied the allocation of all MSA payments  through states\u2019 fiscal year 2001. We collected and analyzed budget-related  and legislative documents and interviewed officials from each of the 46  state executive budget offices about the plans for use of the MSA payments  for the two fiscal years in our study. In some cases, state budget officials  included staff from the state attorney general\u2019s office, the governor\u2019s office  and the state agency responsible for tobacco control programs in the  interview. In order to present as comprehensive a review as possible, we  collected data on all estimated MSA payments to the 46 states and the  allocations of those payments regardless of whether a decision was made  on the use of the funds or whether all funds were appropriated by the  legislature. Our study focuses only on the state shares of MSA payments. In  California and New York, the two states in which the counties receive MSA  payments, we did not track the MSA payments to counties or the allocation  of those payments. We did not collect information on payments to the  District of Columbia or the five territories that are also party to the MSA.  We categorized states\u2019 use of settlement payments for state fiscal years  2000 and 2001 according to selected program areas and developed a  methodology for allocating dollars to specific categories. To obtain a  comprehensive understanding of the states use of MSA payments, we  reviewed recent reports and studies and spoke with representatives from  the organizations conducting these studies. See appendix I for a more  detailed description of our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in the mid 1990s, more than 40 states and some localities sued  tobacco companies, alleging that the industry violated antitrust and  consumer protection laws, withheld information about the adverse health  effects of tobacco, manipulated nicotine levels to keep smokers addicted,  and conspired to hold back less risky and less addictive tobacco products  from the market. In 1997 and 1998, four states\u2014Florida, Minnesota,  Mississippi, and Texas\u2014settled their lawsuits by negotiating independent  agreements with the tobacco industry. In November 1998, four of the  nation\u2019s largest tobacco companies\u2014Philip Morris Incorporated, R.J.  Reynolds Tobacco Company, Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation,  and Lorillard Tobacco Company (referred to as the \u201coriginal participating  manufacturers\u201d)\u2014 negotiated an agreement with the attorneys general of  the remaining 46 states thereby settling a number of lawsuits brought by  these states against these tobacco companies. The terms of this  agreement, known as the Master Settlement Agreement (MSA), apply only  to those tobacco companies and states that are parties to the agreement.  Under the MSA, the tobacco companies are required to provide monetary  relief to states in the form of annual payments and reimbursement for  attorney fees. The MSA also imposes restrictions on the tobacco  companies\u2019 marketing and advertising practices. Furthermore, the MSA  established a national foundation to support study and programs to  (1) reduce youth tobacco use and substance abuse and (2) prevent diseases  associated with tobacco use. Tobacco companies are required to provide  funding for this foundation, as well as funding for the National Association  of Attorneys General (NAAG), which is responsible for assisting states in  the implementation and enforcement of the MSA.", "After the MSA was signed, each state had to take action to receive approval  of the agreement from its respective state court in order to make the terms  of the agreement legally binding within that state. Under the MSA, once  state court approval was final, the state achieved \u201cstate-specific finality\u201d  status, thereby permitting that state to receive payments under the MSA.  No state payments were to be released to any of the states, however, until  the agreement reached final approval. This occurred in November 1999  when 80 percent of the states whose shares equaled 80 percent of the total  settlement payments had achieved state-specific finality.", "In addition, to receive its full share of the settlement payments, each state  was required by the MSA to enact a statute addressing the potential  competitive advantage that tobacco companies not party to the MSA may  experience. Under the MSA, if the aggregate market share of the tobacco  companies that are party to the agreement (\u201cparticipating manufacturers\u201d)  falls more than two percent below their base level of 1997 and the loss is  caused in significant part by provisions of the MSA, the MSA payments may  be reduced based on a formula that corrects for this market share loss.  The MSA provided that individual states can avoid this downward  adjustment\u2014known as the \u201cnon-participating manufacturers\u201d (NPM)  adjustment\u2014to their payments by enacting and enforcing a statute that is  intended to prevent a competitive disadvantage for the participating  manufacturers. The MSA provided a model statute that, if enacted and  enforced by a state, would protect that state from any adjustment for  market share loss, although states are permitted to enact and enforce any  statute that achieves the same desired result.", "The MSA also placed restrictions on the tobacco companies\u2019 business  practices, primarily in marketing targeted to youth, advertising, and  lobbying. For example, the MSA banned all outdoor advertising by the  tobacco companies such as billboards and signs in arenas and stadiums, as  well as sponsorship of sporting events with a significant youth audience.  Moreover, the tobacco companies are prohibited from lobbying the state or  any political subdivision against efforts to enact certain kinds of state laws  and regulations intended to reduce underage tobacco access and use.  Tobacco companies are not prohibited from lobbying against legislation  that would raise excise taxes or restrict smoking in public places. The MSA  also required the tobacco companies to pay a total of $50 million for  enforcement activities including state enforcement of the terms of the  agreement and investigation of suspected violations of antitrust or  consumer protection laws related to tobacco products. In addition, the  MSA required the tobacco companies to fund a national foundation, the  American Legacy Foundation, dedicated to discouraging youth tobacco use  and to preventing disease associated with tobacco use through supporting  study and education. The participating tobacco companies are required to  pay a total of $1.45 billion over 5 years for the advertising and education  programs (performed directly or through grant-making) aimed at  countering youth tobacco use and informing consumers about prevention  of tobacco-related diseases, and an additional $250 million over 10 years  for other activities of the foundation.", "The MSA was preceded by a proposed national settlement between the  states and the tobacco industry reached in June 1997. This earlier more far- reaching proposal included payments to states and was a blueprint for a  comprehensive national tobacco-control policy, including federal  regulation and oversight. The June 1997 proposal could take effect only  after federal legislation was enacted. Several comprehensive tobacco  policy bills, including legislation to implement the June 1997 proposal,  were introduced in the 105th Congress. However, only the National  Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act (S. 1415), introduced by  Senator McCain, saw legislative action. The bill debated on the Senate floor  provided for new authority for the Food and Drug Administration to  regulate tobacco products, measures to restrict tobacco industry  marketing and advertising, and measures to reduce underage tobacco use.  The bill also required up-front and annual payments by the tobacco  companies to provide for settlement of relevant state lawsuits. These and  other payments would be deposited into a fund for the benefit of states that  settled their lawsuits against the tobacco companies and for the benefit of  the federal government.", "When S. 1415 did not pass in the summer of 1998, states resumed  negotiations with the tobacco industry that eventually resulted in the  November 1998 Master Settlement Agreement. The MSA was a scaled- down version of the June 1997 proposal and did not require federal action  to be implemented. This agreement did not resolve states\u2019 uncertainty over  whether the federal government might lay claim to a portion of the  payments to the states. In May 1999, Congress moved to resolve that  uncertainty by enacting legislation that prohibited treating states\u2019 MSA  payments as federal overpayments for purposes of Medicaid."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Have Received Billions to Date From the Master Settlement Agreement", "paragraphs": ["As of April 2001, 45 of the 46 states that signed the Master Settlement  Agreement had received nearly $13.5 billion in payments from the tobacco  companies. MSA payments to the states, some of which states will receive  in perpetuity, were originally estimated to total nearly $205 billion through  2025. There are different types of payments, the largest two of which are  \u201cinitial\u201d payments\u2014 made in five installments through 2003\u2014 and \u201cannual\u201d  payments which continue in perpetuity. Both of these types of payments  are distributed based on \u201callocation percentages\u201d for each state agreed to  by the 46 state attorneys general when they negotiated the MSA. (See  appendix IV for the types of MSA payments.) The final agreement resulted  from negotiations that began with a formula. However, unlike many other  legal settlements with a fixed level of compensation, while the MSA  payments are based on set payment amounts, these payments are adjusted  for several factors, most notably, the future sales of the tobacco industry.  Each state\u2019s payments are adjusted annually based on the participating  manufacturers\u2019 cigarette sales and market share, as well as inflation. All  adjustments resulted in reductions of about $1.6 billion between 1999 and  2001."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Payment Shares Were Determined Through Negotiations", "paragraphs": ["The formula that provided the basis for determining the allocation  percentages for the MSA payments was composed of two variables each  weighted equally:  smoking-related Medicaid expenditures and smoking- related non-Medicaid health care costs of each state. The smoking-related  health care cost variable included factors for each state\u2019s population and  smoking prevalence. After this initial formula was developed, negotiations  resulted in some adjustments for state-specific concerns. For example,  some smaller states argued that they should receive a larger percentage to  enable them to fund smoking cessation programs because they did not  have the same economy of scale as larger states. The negotiations resulted  in the allocation percentages that are applied to each initial and annual  MSA payment. In general, larger states receive a higher percentage of each  payment and smaller states receive a lower percentage, however because  the allocation percentages were determined by negotiations the payments  are not strictly proportional to population. Table 1 shows the final state  allocation percentages as explicitly agreed to in the MSA.", "Prior to the MSA, some counties in California and New York had  independently filed lawsuits against the tobacco industry. In these states,  the counties bear financial responsibility for a share of Medicaid costs, and  the lawsuits sought compensation for the counties\u2019 cost of treating  smoking related illnesses. In both these states, under different  arrangements, counties receive a share of MSA payments.", "The state of California had entered into a memorandum of understanding  (MOU) with its counties and four major cities in August 1998\u2014prior to the  MSA\u2014to coordinate their lawsuits with the state\u2019s suit and provide for the  allocation of any settlement. The terms of the MOU included an even 50/50  split of the financial recovery between the state and local governments,  with the local share further split between the counties and four major  cities. In California\u2019s case, all MSA payments are made to the state and the  state distributes payments to the 58 counties and four cities. (See appendix  II for the counties\u2019 and cities\u2019 share of payments in California.)", "In the case of New York, the state\u2019s consent decree provides for allocation  of a portion of its MSA payments to the counties and New York City based  on the county share of Medicaid costs  and population as well as some  specific considerations for individual counties. In New York\u2019s case, each of  the state\u2019s 57 counties and New York City receive payment directly from the  escrow account established by the MSA rather than the state receiving all  payments and then distributing them to the localities. (See appendix III for  the counties\u2019 and New York City\u2019s share of payments in New York.)

Although there are several types of  potential adjustments to the annual payments received by each state, the  two most significant adjustments are a \u201cvolume adjustment\u201d and an  \u201cinflation adjustment.\u201d The volume adjustment is based on increases or  decreases in the number of cigarettes shipped by the original participating  manufacturers, and the inflation adjustment is set at the actual percentage  increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or 3 percent, whichever is  greater. The terms of the MSA also call for states to receive five initial  payments between 1998 and 2003. These initial payments are also subject  to annual volume adjustments, but they are not adjusted for inflation after  the first payment. (See appendix IV for a summary of payment types and  amounts.)", "A third type of payment, known as the Strategic Contribution Fund (SCF)  payment, will begin in 2008 and continue through 2017. The base amount of  each year\u2019s SCF payment is $861 million and will be adjusted for volume  and inflation. SCF payments are intended to reflect the level of the  contribution each state made toward final resolution of the state lawsuits  against the tobacco companies and will be allocated to the states based on  a separate formula developed by a panel of former state attorneys general.  (See appendix V for estimated Strategic Contribution Fund payments to  states.)", "Finally, tobacco growers and producers in states that grow cigarette  tobacco also receive a fourth type of payment through a separate  agreement, the National Tobacco Grower Settlement Trust Agreement,  known as \u201cPhase II.\u201d The MSA required the tobacco companies to meet  with the political leadership of states with grower communities to address  the economic concerns of these communities. The Phase II agreement  resulted from that requirement. (See appendix VI for information on the  Phase II agreement.) This agreement is intended to provide compensation  for financial losses due to the anticipated decline in cigarette consumption  and payments to the trust fund are expected to total $5.15 billion over 12  years. This report does not track Phase II payments to states or the  allocation of these payments.", "Table 2 summarizes the types of payments that states will receive as a  result of the MSA and Phase II.

The 45 states that had reached  state-specific finality and received payments were originally estimated to  receive $15.1 billion through April 2001 but actually received nearly $13.5  billion during this period\u2014an overall reduction of about $1.6 billion. The  adjustments varied by state, from a high of 26.6 percent in Pennsylvania to  a low of 6.7 percent in Arkansas.", "Consumption has declined since the Master Settlement Agreement was  signed in November 1998\u2014by about 6.5 percent in 1999 alone\u2014mostly due  to one-time increases in cigarette prices that the tobacco companies  implemented after the MSA took effect. Analysts project that in the future  total cigarette consumption will decline by an average of nearly 2 percent  per year. As a result, cigarette consumption is estimated to decline by 33  percent between 1999 and 2020. Declining consumption will result in lower  MSA payments than originally expected.", "Offsetting the sales volume decline is the adjustment for inflation. The  inflation adjustment equals the actual percentage increase in the CPI for  the preceding year or 3 percent, whichever is greater. The effect of  compounding, especially given that the payments are made in perpetuity, is  significant. Assuming a 3-percent inflation adjustment and no decline in  base payments, settlement amounts received by states would double every  24 years. Some analysts estimate the positive inflationary adjustments to be  greater than any negative adjustments for consumption.", "Adjustments were also made for losses in participating manufacturers\u2019  market share. The NPM adjustment encourages states to enact a model  statute in order to receive their full share of MSA payments. Because they  had not enacted a model statute by the end of 2000, 16 states had amounts  withheld from their January 2001 payments. An independent auditor  initially determines how much, if any, market share has been lost and  reduces the MSA payments for this loss. However, amounts withheld from  the payments are held in escrow pending a final determination by an  independent team of economists as to whether the market share loss was a  result of the MSA.

The amounts of the state allocations to these  programs varied widely. In approximately one-third of the states, the  development of a strategic plan for tobacco control is now required. In  allocating MSA payments for tobacco control programs, most states  applied guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention (CDC) to some extent. Tobacco control is one area where  looking only at MSA payments can be misleading.

Sixteen other states reported that they  provided state funding for tobacco control prior to the MSA. Further,  although over one-quarter of the states with decisions on MSA payments  allocated at least 10 percent of their MSA payments to tobacco control,  most of these states had spent little or nothing on tobacco control  programs prior to the settlement.

When the states first began receiving and planning for  the use of their MSA payments for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, they were  budgeting during a period of projected surpluses. Most states had the  budgetary resources to fund mandated needs from other state revenues to  allow them to dedicate the settlement payments for expansions in health  care, tobacco control, and other new projects. As the forecasts for state  budgets begin to change, states may be faced with more difficult choices in  determining the uses of their MSA payments for the near future. The  earmarking of the payment stream may have the effect of subsidizing state  programs if states reduce their own funding in these areas. States that  included provisions against supplantation when they created dedicated  funds for the MSA payments, or established endowment funds that prevent  the use of the principal, have developed some protection against using the  payments to subsidize state programs. States\u2019 future decisions over the use  of the MSA payments will likely require balancing state-specific priorities  and needs within the context of overall budget conditions.", "As agreed with your office, unless you release this report earlier, we will  not distribute it until 30 days from the date of this letter.

In some  cases, our discussions included officials from the state attorney general\u2019s  office, the governor\u2019s office and the state agency responsible for tobacco  control programs. We also reviewed previous GAO reports and other recent  reports and studies, and we spoke with representatives from the  organizations conducting these studies. We spoke with experts to obtain  background information on specific issues covered in this report, such as  the legal provisions of the MSA and securitization of MSA payments.

We conducted our work and collected information  for fiscal year 2001 while the fiscal year was in progress and states were at  various stages in the process of planning for the use of their payments.  Because we completed our fieldwork in April, we did not obtain final  information for the fiscal year, which for most states ends on June 30.

Most states developed plans and allocated  dollars based on estimated payments for the fiscal year. Because the  payments made by the tobacco companies are subject to adjustments that  are not determined until the payments are made, actual payments received  by the states differed from estimated payment amounts and from the states\u2019  allocations of $11.6 billion. The major difference between the $13.5 billion  in payments received and the $11.6 billion in states\u2019 allocations is the  payments to the counties in California and New York.
