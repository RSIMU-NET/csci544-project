When using commercial satellites, federal agencies reduce risks by securing the data links and ground stations that send and receive data. However, federal agencies do not control the security of the tracking and control links, satellites, or tracking and control ground stations, which are typically the responsibility of the satellite service provider. It is important to the nation's economy and security to protect against attacks on its computer-dependent critical infrastructures (such as telecommunications, energy, and transportation), many of which are privately owned.

For example, the Department of Defense (DOD)  typically relies on commercial satellites to fulfill its communications and  information transmission requirements for non\u2013mission-critical data and to  augment its military satellite capabilities. The importance of commercial  satellites for DOD is evident during times of conflict: according to a DOD  study, commercial communications satellites were used in 45 percent of all  communications between the United States and the Persian Gulf region  during Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Further, the federal government\u2019s  reliance on commercial satellites is expected to grow.", "The commercial satellite industry is also a critical component of the  worldwide and national economy: the industry generated $85 billion in  revenue in 2000. Accordingly, disruption of satellite services, whether  intentional or not, can have a major adverse economic impact. One  indication of the importance of satellite services was provided in 1998 by  the failure of the Galaxy IV satellite, which disrupted 80 to 90 percent of 45  million pagers across the United States for 2 to 4 days and blocked credit  card authorization at point-of-sale terminals (such as gasoline pumps).", "Satellites are vulnerable to various threats. Protecting satellite systems  against these threats requires attention to (1) the satellite; (2) the satellite  control ground stations, which perform tracking and control functions to  ensure that satellites remain in the proper orbits and which monitor  satellite performance; (3) the communications ground stations, which  process the data being sent to and from satellites; and (4) communications  links between satellites and ground stations\u2014both those that transmit the  tracking and control information and those that transmit the data. Security  threats to any part of the system could put government and commercial  functions at significant risk. Accordingly, at your request, we reviewed  (1) what security techniques are available to protect satellite systems from  unauthorized use, disruption, or damage; (2) how federal agencies reduce  the risk associated with their use of commercial satellite systems; and  (3) what federal critical infrastructure protection (CIP) efforts are being  undertaken to address satellite system security through improved  government and private-sector cooperation. To accomplish these  objectives, we reviewed technical documents, policy, and directives and  interviewed pertinent officials from federal agencies and the private sector  involved in developing, operating, maintaining, and protecting satellite  systems.

Satellites support direct radio communication and provide  television broadcast and cable relay services, as well as home reception.  Satellite services also support applications such as mobile and cellular  communication, telemedicine, cargo tracking, point-of-sale transactions,  and Internet access. Satellites also provide redundancy and backup  capabilities to ground-based communications, as was demonstrated after  the events of September 11, 2001, when satellites provided critical  communications while ground-based lines were unavailable.", "The commercial satellite industry includes manufacturers, the launch  industry, service providers, and ground equipment manufacturers.  Manufacturers design and build satellites, supporting systems, and ground  stations. The launch industry uses launch vehicles, powered by rocket  engines, to place satellites in orbit. Once commercial satellites are in orbit,  they are operated by service providers, who lease available services.  Commercial satellite service clients include telecommunication  companies, television networks, financial institutions, major retailers,  Internet service providers, and governments. Some companies resell leased  satellite services to their clients. For example, major telecommunication  companies sometimes include satellite services in their product line.  Ground equipment manufacturers build and sell the items needed to use  satellite services, such as ground station hardware (antennas), data  terminals, mobile terminals (truck-mounted units), and consumer  electronics (satellite phones). For the year 2000, the commercial satellite  industry generated revenues of $85.1 billion: $17.2 billion for satellite  manufacturing, $8.5 billion for the launch industry, $41.7 billion for  satellite services, and $17.7 billion for ground equipment manufacturing,  according to an industry association.", "Federal agencies also own and operate satellites. For example, the U.S.  military and intelligence communities have satellites to provide capabilities  for reconnaissance, surveillance, early warning of missile launches,  weather forecasts, navigation, and communications. In addition, some  federal civilian agencies own satellites that are used for communications,  scientific studies, and weather forecasting.", "Further, federal agencies use commercial satellites for services such as  communications, data transmission, and remote sensing. For example,  DOD typically relies on commercial satellites to fulfill its communications  and information transmission requirements for non\u2013mission-critical data  and to augment its military satellite capabilities. The National Defense  Industrial Association (NDIA) reported in December 1998 that the  government\u2019s overall use of commercial satellites for communications and  remote sensing is expected to grow significantly because of increased  communications requirements. According to a DOD official, the  department\u2019s reliance on commercial satellites is expected to grow through  2020. After 2020, DOD officials anticipate that commercial satellites will  provide only surge capacity, as additional military satellites are expected to  be operational. In addition to the U.S. military, several civilian government  agencies also rely on commercial satellite systems. Table 1 provides brief  descriptions of the use of commercial satellites by four civilian agencies  included in our review.", "Collectively, the federal government does not dominate the commercial  satellite market. According to commercial satellite industry officials, the  revenue provided to the satellite industry by the federal government  represents about 10 percent of the commercial satellite market.", "However, the importance of commercial satellites for government  operations is evident during times of conflict. For example, according to a  DOD study, commercial communications satellites were used in 45 percent  of all communications between the United States and the Persian Gulf  region during Desert Shield/Desert Storm. Further, during operations in  Somalia from December 1992 through March 1994, U.S. military and  commercial satellite coverage was not available, so Russian commercial  satellites were used. DOD currently reports approximately 50 percent  reliance on commercial satellites for wideband services, which are leased  through the Defense Information Systems Agency\u2019s Commercial Satellite  Communications Branch.", "The commercial satellite industry is a global industry that includes many  foreign-owned corporations as well as partnerships between U.S. and  foreign corporations. As a result, the U.S. government depends on foreign  and international companies. For example, some commercial space  systems of foreign origin are used by the U.S. military for imagery and  communications support. NDIA reported that foreign ownership of  satellites is expected to grow and predicted that by 2010, 80 percent of  commercial communication satellite services could be provided by foreign- owned companies. This globalization of the satellite industry could affect  the availability of commercial satellite systems to U.S. government or  commercial entities through frequency allocations, tariffs, politics, and  international law."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Satellites Operate through a System of Links and Ground Stations", "paragraphs": ["A satellite system consists of ground stations, tracking and control links  (commonly referred to as the tracking, telemetry, and control (TT&C)  links) and data links, and satellites.

Control stations  perform tracking and control functions to ensure that satellites remain in  the proper orbits (commonly referred to by the industry as \u201cstation  keeping\u201d) and to monitor their performance. Communications ground  stations process imagery, voice, or other data and provide, in many cases, a  link to ground-based terrestrial network interconnections.", "The links between the two types of ground stations and the satellites are  referred to by their function: TT&C and data links. TT&C links exchange  commands and status information between control ground stations and  satellites. Data links exchange communications, navigation, and imaging  data between communications ground stations and satellites. As shown in  figure 1, links are also distinguished by the direction of transmission:  uplinks go from Earth to space, and downlinks from space to Earth.  Satellites can also communicate with each other; these links are referred to  as cross-links.", "The final component of the system is the satellite. Every satellite has a  \u201cpayload\u201d and a \u201cbus.\u201d The payload contains all the equipment a satellite  needs to perform its function, and it differs for every type of satellite. For  example, the payload for a weather satellite includes cameras to take  pictures of cloud formations, while the payload for a communications  satellite includes transponders to relay data (for example, television or  telephone signals). The bus carries the payload and additional equipment  into space and provides electrical power, computers, and propulsion to the  entire spacecraft. A satellite can serve simply as a relay between a source  and a destination (for example, a communications satellite), or it can  perform processing of data and communicate the data to a  communications ground station (for example, an imaging satellite)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Satellite Systems Are Vulnerable to a Range of Threats", "paragraphs": ["Satellite systems face unintentional threats to all parts of the system; such  threats can be ground-based, space-based, and interference-oriented.

Space-based threats include solar and cosmic radiation and related  phenomena, solar disturbances, temperature variations, and natural  objects (meteoroids and asteroids). In addition, the growing number of  satellites is contributing to the problem of space \u201cjunk\u201d (spacecraft and  debris). As of May 2002, DOD identified over 9,000 man-made objects in  space, including active satellites. As additional satellites are developed and  deployed, DOD officials stated that the threat of collisions caused by the  proliferation of satellites and accompanying debris could increase.", "Links are vulnerable both to natural conditions (in space and in the  atmosphere) and to congestion. Links can be severely degraded by the  effects of solar activity and atmospheric and solar disturbances. Both  orbital and spectral congestion are a threat to links (as well as to  satellites). Such congestion may restrict the future use of potential orbits  and frequencies and cause unintentional interference to satellite services.  According to one commercial service provider, satellite service providers  worldwide work together to resolve interference problems, which are  common. In addition, commercial satellite interference is regulated both  internationally and nationally. The International Telecommunication Union  specifies interference resolution policies and procedures, including those  for harmful interference. Further, within the United States, the Federal  Communications Commission (FCC) has the capability to track the  location of interference, at a service provider\u2019s request. Also, service  providers told us that they could locate and identify unintentional or  unauthorized users through a technique called triangulation. Once an  unauthorized user is located, a commercial service provider can jam that  user\u2019s signal if the user cannot be persuaded to stop using the satellite.  However, according to industry officials, typically an unauthorized user  would be identified, located, and contacted through a combination of  industry and government resources before such jamming would be needed.", "In addition, satellite systems are vulnerable to many forms of intentional  human attacks that are intended to destroy ground stations and satellites or  interfere with the TT&C links, data links, and cross-links.

These threats could target all satellite ground  components, including launch facilities, command and control facilities,  and supporting infrastructures.", "Space-based threats to satellites are proliferating as a result of the growing  availability of technology around the world. According to DOD, potential  space-based weapons include interceptors, such as space mines and  orbiting space-to-space missiles, and directed-energy weapons.

Potential cyber attacks include denial of  service, malicious software, unauthorized monitoring and disclosure of  sensitive information (data interception), injection of fake signals or traffic  (\u201cspoofing\u201d), and unauthorized modification or deliberate corruption of  network information, services, and databases. For example, malicious  software (such as computer viruses) can be (1) implanted into computer  systems during development or inserted during operations; (2) used to  manipulate network protocols, deny data or service, destroy data or  software, and corrupt, modify, or compromise data; and (3) used to attack  processor-controlled transmission equipment, control systems, or the  information being passed.", "Links are particularly susceptible to electronic interference threats capable  of disrupting or denying satellite communications. These threats include  spoofing and jamming. A spoofer emits false, but plausible, signals for  deception purposes. If false commands could be inserted into a satellite\u2019s  command receiver (spoofing the receiver), they could cause the spacecraft  to tumble or otherwise destroy itself. It is also feasible to insert false  information or computer viruses into the terrestrial computer networks  associated with a space system, either remotely or through an on-site  connection. Such an attack could lead to space system degradation or even  complete loss of spacecraft utility.", "A jammer emits noise-like signals in an effort to mask or prevent the  reception of desired signals and can be used to disrupt uplinks, downlinks,  and cross-links. An uplink jammer attempts to inject noise or some other  signal into the targeted satellites\u2019 uplink receivers. In general, an uplink  jammer must be roughly as powerful as the emitter associated with the link  being jammed.", "Downlink jamming attempts to inject noise or some other signal directly  into earth terminal receivers. The targets of downlink jammers are ground- based satellite data receivers, ranging from large fixed ground sites to  handheld Global Positioning System (GPS) user terminals. Since downlink  jammers have a range advantage over the space-based emitters, they can  often be much less powerful. Downlink jamming is generally easier to  accomplish than uplink jamming, since very low-power jammers are often  suitable. Since a downlink may be received by multiple earth terminals, it is  often more difficult to jam more than a few earth terminals through  downlink jamming than through uplink jamming, especially if the receiver  terminals are dispersed across a significant geographical area.", "A cross-link jammer attempts to inject noise or some other signal between  two satellites communicating directly with each other.

Presidential Decision  Directive 49, dated September 19, 1996, provides goals for the U.S. space  program and establishes space guidelines. For example, a guideline  regarding the commercial space industry stated that U.S. government  agencies shall purchase commercially available space goods and services  to the fullest extent feasible, and that, except for reasons of national  security or public safety, they shall not conduct activities with commercial  applications that preclude or deter commercial space activities. Neither the  National Space Policy Directive 3 nor PDD 49 specifically addresses the  security of satellite systems used by federal agencies. However, PDD 49  states that critical capabilities necessary for executing space missions must  be ensured. Security of satellite systems has been addressed in policy  documents issued by the National Security Telecommunications and  Information Systems Security Committee (recently renamed the  Committee on National Security Systems). The initial policy was set forth  in National Policy on Application of Communications Security to U.S.  Civil and Commercial Space Systems, National Telecommunications and  Information Systems Security Policy (NTISSP) No. 1 (June 17, 1985),  which governed the protection of command and control uplinks for  government-used satellites other than military.

Usually, only the  military uses spread spectrum techniques.", "Both TT&C and data links can be protected by encryption: generally, for  TT&C links, the tracking and control uplink is encrypted, while the  telemetry downlink is not. Encryption is the transformation of ordinary  data (commonly referred to as plaintext) into a code form (ciphertext) and  back into plaintext, using a mathematical process called an algorithm.  Encryption can be used on data to (1) hide information content, (2) prevent  undetected modification, and (3) prevent unauthorized use.", "Different levels of encryption provide different levels of protection,  including encryption approved by the National Security Agency (NSA) that  is used for national security information.

For satellite systems  transmitting non\u2013national-security information, there is no policy that  security is required for the links, but satellite service providers and federal  satellite owners and operators included in our review stated that they  protect tracking and control uplinks with encryption. However, NSA  officials stated that not all commercial providers\u2019 tracking and control  uplinks are encrypted. Concerning the data links, customers are  responsible for determining whether they are encrypted or not. Most  commercial satellite systems are designed for \u201copen access,\u201d meaning that  a transmitted signal is broadcast universally and unprotected.", "A second security technique for links is the use of high-power RF uplinks:  that is, a large antenna used to send a high-power signal from the ground  station to the satellite. To intentionally interfere with a satellite\u2019s links, an  attacker would need a large antenna with a powerful radio transmitter (as  well as considerable technical knowledge). Two of the commercial  providers we talked to stated that they use high-power RF uplinks as part  of their satellite security approach. According to one commercial provider,  most satellite operators use high-power RF uplinks for TT&C connections  to block potential unauthorized users\u2019 attempts to interfere with or jam the  TT&C uplink.", "A third technique for protecting links is the use of spread spectrum  communication, a technique used by the military and not normally  implemented by commercial providers. Spread spectrum communication is  a form of wireless communication in which the frequency of the  transmitted signal is deliberately varied and spread over a wide frequency  band. Because the frequency of the transmitted signal is deliberately  varied, spread spectrum communication can provide security to links  because it increases the power required to jam the signals even if they are  detected. Spread spectrum communication is primarily used to optimize  the efficiency of bandwidth within a frequency range, but it also provides  security benefits.", "Finally, TT&C links can be protected by the use of a unique digital interface  between the ground station and the satellite. According to one commercial  satellite service provider, most commercial providers use a unique digital  interface with each satellite. Tracking and control instructions sent from  the ground station to the satellite are encoded and formatted in a way that  is not publicly known. Officials from the commercial satellite vendor stated  that even if an attacker were successful in hacking one satellite, the unique  interface could prevent the attacker from taking control of an entire fleet of  satellites.

Commercial satellite service providers  and federal civilian owners and operators told us that they do not harden  their satellites to the extent that the military does. Commercial providers,  federal civilian owners and operators, and the military use varying degrees  of redundancy to protect their satellites.", "As satellites rely increasingly on on-board information processing,  hardening is becoming more important as a security technique. Hardening  in this context includes physical hardening and electronic-component  hardening. Satellites can be hardened against natural environmental  conditions and deliberate attack, and to ensure survivability. Most  hardening efforts are focused on providing sufficient protection to  electronic components in satellites so that they can withstand natural  environmental conditions over the expected lifespan of the satellite, which  could be nearly 15 years. For hardening against deliberate attacks, some  techniques proposed include the use of reflective surfaces, shutters, and  nonabsorbing materials. According to commercial satellite providers,  commercial satellites are not normally hardened against non-natural  nuclear radiation because it is too costly. The drawback of hardening is the  cost and the manufacturing and operational burdens that it imposes on  satellite manufacturers and providers.", "The use of high-quality space parts is another approach to hardening.  Although all parts used in satellites are designed to withstand natural  environmental conditions, some very high-quality parts that have  undergone rigorous testing and have appreciably higher hardness than  standard space parts are also available, including those referred to as class  \u201cS\u201d parts. These higher quality space parts cost significantly more than  regular space parts\u2014partly because of the significant testing procedures  and more limited number of commercial providers manufacturing  hardened parts. According to an industry official, high-quality space parts  are used by the military and are generally not used on commercial  satellites.", "Commercial satellite providers stated that they also use redundancy to  ensure availability, through backup satellites and redundant features on  individual satellites. Backup satellites enable an organization to continue  operations if a primary satellite fails. One provider stated that it would  rather spend resources on backup satellites than on hardening future  satellites or encrypting the TT&C and data links. The provider also  expressed the view that a greater number of smaller, less costly satellites  provides greater reliability than is provided by few large satellites, because  there is more redundancy. According to an industry consulting group,  backup satellites, which include in-orbit and on-ground satellites, are part  of commercial satellite providers\u2019 security approaches. When backup  satellites are used, they are commonly kept in orbit; keeping backup  satellites on the ground is possible, but it has the disadvantage that the  system cannot immediately continue operations if the primary satellite  fails. According to one provider, it could take 4 to 6 months to launch a  backup satellite stored on the ground.", "In addition, individual satellites can be designed to have redundant parts.  For example, a commercial satellite provider told us that redundant  processors, antennas, control systems, transponders, and other equipment  are frequently used to ensure satellite survivability. Another example is that  satellites could have two completely separate sets of hardware and two  paths for software and information; this is referred to as having an A-side  and a B-side.

It  does not apply to systems that process sensitive, non\u2013national-security  information. Issued by the National Security Telecommunications and  Information Systems Security Committee (now the Committee on National  Security Systems (CNSS)), NSTISSP No. 12 has as its primary objective \u201cto  ensure that information assurance is factored into the planning, design,  launch, sustained operation, and deactivation of U.S. space systems used to  collect, generate, process, store, display, or transmit/receive national  security information, as well as any supporting or related national security  systems.\u201d NSTISSP No. 12 also suggests that federal agencies may want to  consider applying the policy\u2019s information assurance requirements to those  space systems that are essential to the conduct of agencies\u2019 unclassified  missions, or to the operation and maintenance of critical infrastructures.", "In addition to having a focus only on national security, the policy is further  limited in that it addresses security techniques only for the links.

Several officials stated that if compliance were required, it would  significantly increase the complexity of managing the satellites, because  encryption key management is cumbersome, and appropriately  controlling access to the hardware is difficult in global companies that have  many foreign nationals. Also, commercial satellite service providers stated  that encrypting the TT&C links could increase the difficulty of  troubleshooting, for example, because the time it takes to encrypt and then  decrypt a command could become significant when a TT&C problem  arises. Other issues raised that make NSTISSP No. 12 difficult to implement  include the following:  Some satellite service providers view compliance with it as not  necessary for selling services to the government, since in the past  agencies have used satellites that did not comply with prior security  policy. For example, DOD has contracted for services on satellites that  were not compliant with the previous and existing policy for various  reasons.

This  draft policy includes a waiver process requiring prior approval before any  satellite system could be used that did not meet the security requirements.  If approved, this policy would apply only to DOD.
