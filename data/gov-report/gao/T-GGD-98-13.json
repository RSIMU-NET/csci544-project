The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (FDICIA) based regulatory practices on a simple principle: if a depository institution fails to operate in a safe and sound manner, it should be subject to timely and forceful supervisory response, including, if necessary, prompt closure. FDICIA also required that banks reform their corporate governance and accounting practices and that the regulatory agencies improve their supervision of insured banks and thrifts. In a November 1996 report, however, GAO noted that questions remain about the effectiveness of FDICIA\u2019s trip-wire provisions which are intended to limit regulatory discretion. As implemented, the trip-wire that enables regulatory action at early stage of problems in a bank does little to limit regulatory discretion.", "In several reports in the early 1990s, GAO also noted limitations in the safety and soundness examinations conducted by the regulatory agencies. The limitations included a lack of comprehensive internal control assessments, insufficient review of loan quality and loan loss reserves, weaknesses related to insider lending, and insufficient assessment of bank holding company activities with insured bank subsidiaries. GAO recommended actions to address these weaknesses, as well as weaknesses in the documentation of the analysis that underlies the examination report and in the supervisory review of examinations. examinations of these organizations. However, GAO has not fully assessed the effectiveness of the changes for bank and thrift examination and notes that they have been instituted during favorable economic conditions that have contributed to strong bank and thrift profits. Also, several critical tasks remain for the regulatory agencies: ensuring consistency in the supervision and examination policies of multiple regulatory agencies, ensuring staff expertise, and examining increasingly complex banking organizations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Bank and Thrift Examinations: Adoption of Risk-Focused Examination Strategies", "paragraphs": ["Ms. Chairwoman and Members of the Committee: We are pleased to be here today to discuss bank and thrift supervision and examination.", "Supervisory and examination procedures today show evidence of lessons learned from the bank and thrift crises of the 1980s and early 1990s. These procedures are the primary basis used by the federal regulatory agencies to assess the risks that banks and thrifts assume and to take actions that are needed to maintain a safe and sound banking system and protect the deposit insurance funds.", "A combination of regulatory and legislative changes, along with market forces, has expanded the number and scope of activities undertaken by insured depository institutions, particularly the largest ones, and thus the risks that they assume. These expanded activities include offering and/or dealing in a range of nontraditional bank products, such as mutual funds, securities, derivatives, and other off-balance sheet products. The resulting complex institutions represent a major supervisory and regulatory challenge. In keeping with the changes in the banking environment, federal bank and thrift regulators have recently announced that bank examinations will explicitly include an assessment of how effectively banks manage risk and a rating on their sensitivity to risks posed by a variety of market factors.", "Although we have not yet fully assessed the implementation of most of the recent changes to supervisory and examination policy, they appear to address some of our concerns about examinations in the aftermath of bank failures in the 1980s and early 1990s.

A mismatch between the income from fixed rate mortgages and the costs of borrowing funds at market rates in competition with nondepository institutions were among the reasons for large losses that led to the failure of thrifts. Banks suffered losses from defaults on loans concentrated in several industries that suffered economic downturns over the decade, including agriculture, real estate, and developing nation loans.", "One factor we and others cited as contributing to the problems of both thrifts and banks during this period was excessive forbearance by federal regulators. Regulators had wide discretion in choosing the severity and timing of enforcement actions to correct unsafe and unsound practices. They also had a common philosophy of trying to work informally and cooperatively with troubled institutions. In a 1991 report, we concluded that these conditions had resulted in enforcement actions that were neither timely nor forceful enough to (1) correct unsafe and unsound banking practices or (2) prevent or minimize losses to the insurance funds. The regulators themselves have recognized that their supervisory practices failed to adequately control risky practices that led to numerous thrift and bank failures. We made specific recommendations for changes to the supervisory process that would help ensure that institutions failing to operate in a safe and sound manner would be subject to timely and forceful supervisory response, including, if necessary, prompt closure."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Legislation Was Enacted to Address Problems", "paragraphs": ["of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC) and troubles in the thrift industry.

FDICIA contains several safety and soundness provisions based on a simple principle: if a depository institution fails to operate in a safe and sound manner, it should be subject to timely and forceful supervisory response, including, if necessary, prompt closure. Also, FDICIA requires a number of corporate governance and accounting reforms to (1) strengthen corporate governance, (2) improve financial reporting, and (3) aid early identification of safety and soundness problems. Among the corporate governance and accounting reforms, FDICIA establishes generally accepted accounting principles as the standard for all reports to regulators; requires that management and auditors annually report on the financial condition and management of the largest depository institutions, including effectiveness of and compliance with internal controls; and requires that institutions have independent audit committees composed of outside directors.", "In addition, FDICIA contains provisions for improving regulatory supervision. FDICIA mandates annual on-site examinations of insured banks and thrifts. Also, consistent with specific recommendations we made, it requires implementation of a \u201ctrip wire\u201d approach to limit regulatory discretion in key areas, including capital, by mandating specific regulatory responses to safety and soundness problems.

This is because impaired capital levels often do not appear until after a bank has experienced problems in other areas, such as asset quality and management.", "Section 39 allows regulatory action before capital is impaired. However, section 39, as implemented, appears to do little to reduce regulatory discretion. The implementing guidelines and regulations did not (1) establish clear and specific definitions of unsound conditions and practices or (2) link such conditions or practices to specific mandatory regulatory actions.

We recommended that a comprehensive review of internal controls be a part of bank and thrift examinations and that the condition of a bank\u2019s or thrift\u2019s system of internal controls receive explicit consideration in a determination of an institution\u2019s examination rating. Insufficient review of loan quality and loan loss reserves: Effective loan quality assessment is important, because loans generally make up the majority of bank and thrift assets and involve the greatest risk. Determining the adequacy of loan loss reserves is critical because without such a determination, in combination with a proper assessment of loan quality, examiners have no reliable basis to understand an institution\u2019s true financial condition. We recommended that examination policies require a representative sampling of loans and better documentation of loan quality and the development of a methodology to determine the adequacy of loan loss reserves.", "Weaknesses in detecting and ensuring corrective actions related to insider lending: Loans to insiders\u2014such as bank directors, officers, or principals\u2014should pose no greater risk than transactions with other bank customers. Abusive insider activities can be among the most insidious of reasons for the deterioration of the health of a bank. In 1994, we reported that examiners faced numerous impediments to determining the full extent of insider problems at banks and that such problems were not always corrected as a result of examinations. We recommended that bank regulators review insider activities in their next examination of each bank, partly by comparing data provided during the examination with information from other sources. We also recommended that federal bank regulators ensure that all directors understand their responsibility for seeing that effective corrective action is taken. Insufficient assessment of actual and potential risks of bank holding company activities to insured bank subsidiaries: In our reports, we have found that transactions between a bank holding company and its insured bank subsidiary were not always thoroughly reviewed. Such transactions include loans from the bank to other, nonbank subsidiaries; fees charged by the bank holding company to the bank subsidiary; and asset transfers from nonbank subsidiaries to the bank subsidiary. We recommended that the supervisors develop and require mandatory procedures for assessing the actual and potential risks to insured bank subsidiaries of bank holding company activities. as essential, because examiners have broad discretion and must exercise considerable judgment in planning and conducting examinations and in drawing conclusions about bank safety and soundness. Our findings led us to recommend that regulators establish policies to ensure sufficient documentation of the analysis that underlies the examination report, and thorough supervisory review of all examination and inspection procedures Finally, we have noted in past reports that improved coordination among federal and state banking supervisors could result in more efficient and effective use of examination resources.

When evaluating these changes, it is also important to note that they have occurred during favorable economic conditions that have contributed to strong bank and thrift profits.

Examiners were instructed in 1996 to give greater emphasis to the adequacy of an institution\u2019s risk management processes, including its internal controls when evaluating management under the CAMEL system.", "On December 9, 1996, the Federal Financial Institution Examination Council added an \u201cS\u201d to create a new CAMELS rating, with the S representing an institution\u2019s sensitivity to market risk. The S rating component is to represent the result of a combined assessment of both the institution\u2019s level of market risk and its ability to manage market risk.Regulators expect the sophistication of an institution\u2019s risk management system to be commensurate with the complexity of its holdings and activities and appropriate to its specific needs and circumstances.", "I should mention that in regulators\u2019 examinations of U.S. branches of foreign banks, an emphasis on risk management and internal controls began in 1994 with implementation of a rating system known as ROCA (risk management, operational controls, compliance, and asset quality.)", "As I noted earlier, we have recommended that the condition of a bank or thrift\u2019s system of internal controls receive explicit consideration in a determination of the institution\u2019s examination rating. We have also recommended that the regulators develop and require minimum mandatory procedures to assess the actual and potential risks of bank holding company activities to insured bank subsidiaries. Increased attention to internal controls and risk management, if effectively implemented, should help enhance the regulators\u2019 ability to keep pace with a changing banking environment.

Specifically, examination guidance now explicitly calls for reviewing insider activities and ensuring that directors understand their responsibility for effective corrective action. Improvements under way in examination documentation and supervisory review of examination findings: Federal banking regulators have described relevant improvement efforts. For example, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s Framework for Risk-Focused Supervision of Large Complex Institutions, the Federal Reserve has been working to refine its standards for workpapers, especially for examinations of state member banks. Also, the Federal Reserve and FDIC have recently implemented an automated examination process to standardize documentation. Federal Reserve officials said that about 25 U.S. states, to date, have also indicated they will begin using this standardized work process. In addition, OCC issued a new policy in February 1997 describing workpaper requirements for all of its supervisory activities.", "Agreements to coordinate examinations by federal and state banking regulators: The Federal Reserve Board, FDIC, and state banking departments completed a single Nationwide State/Federal Supervisory Agreement in November 1996 covering state-chartered banks that open branches in other states.

Together, these agreements set out, among other things, the goals of supervision, division of responsibilities among the various regulators, and common examination and application processes.

Rather, responsibilities are divided according to the type of charter\u2014thrift or bank, national or state\u2014and whether banks are members of the Federal Reserve System. Some analysts, bank industry representatives, and agency officials credit the current structure with encouraging financial innovations and providing checks and balances to guard against arbitrary oversight decisions or actions. We and others, however, have identified concerns that arise from having four agencies with similar responsibilities. These concerns include possible inconsistent treatment of institutions in examination policies and practices, enforcement actions, and regulatory standards and decisionmaking. In the case of bank holding companies, with the Federal Reserve responsible for the bank holding company and other federal regulators responsible for the banking subsidiaries, divided supervisory responsibility may hinder regulators from obtaining a complete picture of an entire banking organization.", "Although we recognize that only Congress can make the policy judgments in deciding whether and how to restructure the bank oversight system, we have recommended that Congress reduce the number of agencies with primary responsibilities for bank oversight. If the current structure, with multiple agencies, continues, coordinating their activities and ensuring consistency in their regulations and enforcement actions will remain difficult issues.

Previously, the Federal Reserve took steps to enhance examiner training on internal controls by developing an Internal Controls School in 1995 that was designed initially for examiners of U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks and expanded to meet the needs of examiners of U.S. domestic banks.

As one official noted, the small number of banks in difficulty has provided the regulatory agencies with an opportunity to improve their operations. However, the business of banking has been changing at the same time, and banks are taking on new risks. Also, because of the differences in the responsibilities and the examination and enforcement approaches among regulators, such as those for the security activities of depository institutions, a key question is whether improvement will be uniformly adopted by all regulators and consistently implemented. Whether current examination strategies provide an adequate basis for the regulatory agencies to anticipate problems and take appropriate and prompt corrective actions to address those problems, especially during any future economic downturn, is unknown.", "Ms. Chairwoman, this concludes my statement.
