It is an impressive concept that is the product of holistic, non-traditional thinking. The Army describes FCS as one of the most complex weapon acquisition programs ever executed because it involves developing and integrating a family of 18 systems and an information network. Army leadership started the program early as part of its effort to change Army culture and believes that the program risks are manageable. GAO is required by law to review the program annually. In this report, GAO analyzes FCS's acquisition business case and assesses requirements stability, technology maturity, soundness of the acquisition strategy, and reasonableness and affordability of program costs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The FCS entered the development phase in 2003 and has not yet reached the level of knowledge it should have attained in the pre-development stage. The elements of a sound business case--firm requirements, mature technologies, a knowledge-based acquisition strategy, a realistic cost estimate, and sufficient funding--are still not demonstrably present. The Army will continue building basic knowledge in areas such as requirements and technologies for several more years. Requirements stability: The Army has reached agreement on FCS system of systems requirements--about 11,500--that help define how FCS units are expected to work as a whole. But the Army must continue to work out the technical feasibility and expected costs of the requirements for individual FCS systems. These requirements may not be completely stabilized until 2008. Until then, the Army expects the system-level requirements to change and to make trade-offs to offset technical risks and cost. Technology maturity: None of FCS's 49 critical technologies was at a level of maturity recommended by DOD policy at the start of a program. Some technologies may not reach full maturity until after production starts. Not having firm requirements matched with mature technologies at the start of development is a key indicator of program risk. Also, the Army is depending on 52 complementary programs, each of which is essential for FCS to perform as intended. Some of these programs have significant technical challenges; some do not have the funding needed to complete development. Soundness of acquisition strategy for design and production: The current acquisition strategy for FCS is improved over the original strategy but still calls for maturing technologies, designing systems, and preparing for production at the same time. Even if requirements and technologies proceed without incident, FCS design and production process maturity will not be demonstrated until after the production decision is made. Although production representative prototypes will not be available, the Army plans to test all FCS systems before committing to production. If problems are discovered in testing at that stage, they will be very expensive to correct. Reasonableness and affordability of program costs: The estimated cost of the FCS program now stands at $160.7 billion, a 76 percent increase since program start. This is a better estimate than the original, as it embodies a more realistic schedule and scope. Including the total investment for the 52 essential complementary programs, the FCS program cost estimate would reach the $200 billion range. The Army has taken steps it believes will control FCS costs. Yet, the current level of knowledge about FCS is low, which makes it difficult to have a solid basis for cost projections. FCS's long-term affordability depends on the accuracy of cost estimates, an increased level of procurement funding, and the level of competing demands."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Army (Army) is in the midst of transforming itself  into a lighter, more agile, and more capable combat force that will be  better equipped to meet the defense challenges of the future. One of the  centerpieces of the Army\u2019s transformation is the Future Combat System  (FCS), a weapon systems acquisition program that embraces a new  concept of operations, new technologies, and a new information network  of numerous ground and air vehicles, sensors, and munitions. The Army  itself calls this the \u201cgreatest technology and integration challenge the Army  has ever undertaken.\u201d The FCS concept demonstrates the Army\u2019s desire to  be proactive in preparing for the changing scope of modern warfare. When  factoring in other Army programs needed to deliver FCS\u2019s full capability,  the total investment costs are on the order of $200 billion. Spending of this  magnitude has drawn attention in Congress because the nation is facing a  large and growing deficit. Fiscal realities are putting pressure on the Army  and the rest of the Department of Defense (DOD) to take a hard look at  how it is managing its resources for weapon acquisition programs, such as  FCS.", "Given the Army\u2019s challenges to date and the cost and scope of the FCS  program, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2006  requires GAO to report annually on the product development phase of the  FCS\u2019s acquisition. Congressional Committees and GAO agreed that this  report should analyze FCS against the basic elements of an acquisition  business case, namely: (1) firmness of requirements, (2) maturity of  critical technologies, (3) soundness of the acquisition strategy as it relates  to design and production, and (4) reasonableness and affordability of  program costs.", "In conducting our work, we have contacted numerous DOD and Army  offices. We reviewed many documents pertaining to the FCS program,  attended meetings at which DOD and Army officials reviewed program  progress, and we held discussions with key DOD and Army officials on  various aspects of the program. Officials from DOD and the Army have  provided us access to sufficient information to make informed judgments  on the matters in this report. In addition, we drew from our large body of  past work on weapon systems acquisition practices. We reviewed DOD\u2019s  acquisition policy, the experiences of successful and unsuccessful DOD  programs, and the best acquisition practices of leading commercial firms.", "We performed our work from June 2005 to March 2006 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards.

The Army is reorganizing its current forces  into modular brigade combat teams, meaning troops can be deployed on  different rotational cycles as a single team or as a cluster of teams. The  Future Force is designed to transform the Army into a more rapidly  deployable and responsive force and enables the Army to move away from  the large division-centric structure of the past. Each FCS brigade combat  team is expected to be highly survivable and the most lethal brigade-sized  unit the Army has ever fielded. The Army expects FCS-equipped brigade  combat teams to provide significant warfighting capabilities to DOD\u2019s  overall joint military operations. The Army is implementing its  transformation plans at a time when current U.S. ground forces are playing  a critical role in the ongoing conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.", "The FCS family of weapons includes 18 manned and unmanned ground  vehicles, air vehicles, sensors, and munitions that will be linked by an  information network. The systems include    eight new types of manned ground vehicles to replace current tanks,  infantry carriers, and self-propelled howitzers;  four classes of unmanned aerial vehicles;    several unmanned ground vehicles; and    an attack missile.", "At a fundamental level, the FCS concept is to replace mass with superior  information\u2014that is, to see and hit the enemy first rather than to rely on  heavy armor to withstand a hit. This solution attempts to address the  mismatch that has posed a dilemma to the Army for decades. The Army\u2019s  heavy forces had the necessary firepower but required extensive support  and too much time to deploy. Its light forces could deploy rapidly but  lacked firepower. If the Future Force becomes a reality, then the Army  would be better organized, staffed, equipped, and trained for prompt and  sustained land combat. This is expected to translate into a force that is  responsive, technologically advanced, and versatile. These qualities are  intended to ensure the Future Force\u2019s long-term dominance over evolving,  sophisticated threats. The Future Force is to be offensively oriented and  will employ revolutionary concepts of operations, enabled by new  technology. The Army envisions a new way of fighting that depends on  networking the force, which involves linking people, platforms, weapons,  and sensors seamlessly together in a system of systems.", "If successful, the FCS system of systems concept will leverage individual  capabilities of weapons and platforms and will facilitate interoperability  and open system designs. This would be a significant improvement over  the traditional approach of building superior individual weapons that must  be retrofitted and netted together after the fact. This transformation, in  terms of both operations and equipment, is under way with the full  cooperation of the Army warfighter community. In fact, the development  and acquisition of FCS is being accomplished using a uniquely  collaborative relationship between the Army\u2019s developers, the  participating contractors, and the warfighter community.", "The Army has employed a management approach that centers on a lead  systems integrator. Although there is no complete consensus on the  definition of a lead systems integrator, those we are aware of appear to be  prime contractors with increased program management responsibilities.  These responsibilities have included greater involvement in requirements  development, design, and source selection of major system and subsystem  subcontractors. Boeing is the lead systems integrator for the FCS system  development and demonstration phase of acquisition. The FCS lead  systems integrator acts on behalf of the Army to optimize the FCS  capability, maximize competition, ensure interoperability, and maintain  commonality in order to reduce life cycle costs. The Army advised us that  it did not believe it had the resources or flexibility to use its traditional  acquisition process to field a program as complex as FCS under the  aggressive timeline established by the then-Army Chief of Staff. The Army  will maintain oversight and final approval of the lead systems integrator\u2019s  subcontracting and competition plans."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FCS Restructures the Program and Changes Contracting Approach", "paragraphs": ["As a key element of its efforts to transform itself, the Army has recognized  FCS from its outset as the greatest technology and integration challenge it  has ever undertaken. In May 2003, DOD approved the FCS program to  begin the system development and demonstration phase, a milestone that  ideally marks the completion of technology development and the start of  product development. However, FCS\u2019s entry into this phase was  premature given that the program had failed to satisfy basic tenets of DOD  acquisition policy. We have reported that, as FCS started product  development, it did not have mature technologies or adequately defined  requirements.", "Responding to direction from the Army Chief of Staff, the Army  announced in July 2004 its plans to restructure the FCS program. The  Army added four years to develop and mature the manned ground  vehicles, added more demonstrations and experiments, and established an  evaluation unit to demonstrate FCS capabilities. The restructuring  reintroduced four systems that previously had been left unfunded, raising  the total number of FCS-related systems to 18. The restructure also  included plans to spin off mature FCS capabilities as they become  available to current force units. With the restructuring, the FCS program  now plans to achieve initial operational capability in fiscal year 2015 and  full operational capability in fiscal year 2017. FCS low-rate production is  expected to start in fiscal year 2012, and full-rate production in fiscal year  2016. The Army intends to continue FCS procurement through fiscal year  2025, eventually equipping 15 brigade combat teams.", "The restructuring was not the only major modification to the FCS  program. Because of congressional concerns that the Army\u2019s contracting  approach incorporated insufficient safeguards to protect the government\u2019s  interests, the Army is preparing a new contract that is to be completed and  finalized in March 2006 and is based on the Federal Acquisition  Regulation, which governs acquisitions within the federal government. The  new contract will incorporate standard Federal Acquisition Regulation  clauses such as those relating to procurement integrity, Truth in  Negotiations, and Cost Accounting Standards. Previously, the lead systems  integrator had been performing FCS work for the Army under a  contractual instrument called an \u201cother transaction agreement\u201d that was  not subject to the Federal Acquisition Regulation. The other transaction  agreement gave the Army considerable flexibility to negotiate the terms  and conditions for contractors involved in FCS development. The Army\u2019s  purpose for using such an agreement was to encourage innovation and to  use its wide latitude in tailoring business, organizational, and technical  relationships to achieve the program goals. In April 2005, the Army  decided to incorporate into its agreement the procurement integrity, Truth  in Negotiations, and Cost Accounting Standards clauses from the  regulation.", "After the Congress raised questions about the Army using an other  transaction agreement for the development of a program as large and risky  as FCS and about the Army\u2019s choice not to include standard Federal  Acquisition Regulation clauses in the agreement, the Secretary of the Army  directed that the other transaction agreement be converted to a Federal  Acquisition Regulation-based contract. All of the work performed under  the product development phase as of September 2005 will be accounted  for under the prior other transaction agreement, and all work after  September 2005 will be performed under the new contract. The Army  expects the content of the program\u2014its statement of work\u2014will remain  largely the same, and it does not expect the cost, schedule, and  performance of the overall development effort to change materially."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Elements of a Business Case", "paragraphs": ["We have frequently reported on the importance of using a solid,  executable business case before committing resources to a new product  development effort. In the case of DOD, a business case should be based  on DOD acquisition policy and lessons learned from leading commercial  firms and successful DOD programs. The business case in its simplest  form is demonstrated evidence that (1) the warfighter\u2019s needs are valid  and that they can best be met with the chosen concept, and (2) the chosen  concept can be developed and produced within existing resources\u2014that  is, proven technologies, design knowledge, adequate funding, and  adequate time to deliver the product when it is needed. A program should  not go forward into product development unless a sound business case  can be made. If the business case measures up, the organization commits  to the development of the product, including making the financial  investment.", "At the heart of a business case is this knowledge-based approach to  product development that is both a best practice among leading  commercial firms and the approach preferred by DOD in its acquisition  regulations. For a program to deliver a successful product within available  resources, managers should demonstrate high levels of knowledge before  significant commitments are made. In essence, knowledge supplants risk  over time. This building of knowledge can be described as three levels or  knowledge points that should be attained over the course of a program:    First, at program start, the customer\u2019s needs should match the  developer\u2019s available resources\u2014mature technologies, time, and  funding. An indication of this match is the demonstrated maturity of  the technologies needed to meet customer needs. The ability of the  government acquisition workforce to properly manage the effort  should also be an important consideration at program start.", "Second, about midway through development, the product\u2019s design  should be stable and demonstrate that it is capable of meeting  performance requirements. The critical design review is the vehicle for  making this determination and generally signifies the point at which the  program is ready to start building production-representative  prototypes.", "Third, by the time of the production decision, the product must be  shown to be producible within cost, schedule, and quality targets and  have demonstrated its reliability. It is also the point at which the design  must demonstrate that it performs as needed through realistic system- level testing.", "The three knowledge points are related in that a delay in attaining one  delays the points that follow. Thus, if the technologies needed to meet  requirements are not mature, design and production maturity will be  delayed. On the successful commercial and defense programs we have  reviewed, managers were careful to conduct development of technology  separately from and ahead of the development of the product. For this  reason, the first knowledge point is the most important for improving the  chances of developing a weapon system within cost and schedule  estimates. DOD\u2019s acquisition policy has adopted the knowledge-based  approach to acquisitions. DOD policy requires program managers to  provide knowledge about certain aspects of a system at key points in the  acquisition process. Program managers are also required to reduce  integration risk and demonstrate product design prior to the design  readiness review and to reduce manufacturing risk and demonstrate  producibility prior to full-rate production.", "The FCS program is about one-third of the way into its scheduled product  development. At this stage, it should have attained knowledge point one,  with a strategy for attaining knowledge points two and three. Accordingly,  we analyze the FCS business case first as it pertains to firming  requirements and maturing technologies, which indicate progress against  the first knowledge point. We then analyze FCS\u2019s strategy for attaining  design and production maturity. Finally, we analyze the costs and funding  estimates made to execute the FCS business case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Army Has Made Progress but Feasibility and Affordability of System-level Requirements Remain Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["The Army has made significant progress defining FCS\u2019s system of systems  requirements, particularly when taking into account the daunting number  of requirements involved\u2014nearly 11,500\u2014at this level. Yet system-level  requirements are not yet stabilized and will continue to change,  postponing the needed match between requirements and resources. Now,  the Army and its contractors are working to complete the definition of  system-level requirements, and the challenge is in determining if those  requirements are technically feasible and affordable. Army officials say it  is almost certain that some FCS system-level requirements will have to be  modified, reduced, or eliminated; the only uncertainty is by how much. We  have previously reported that unstable requirements can lead to cost,  schedule, and performance shortfalls. Once the Army gains a better  understanding of the technical feasibility and affordability of the system- level requirements, trade-offs between the developer and the warfighter  will have to be made, and the ripple effect of such trade-offs on key  program goals will have to be reassessed."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Army Has Largely Completed the Definition of FCS System of Systems Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Army has completed an FCS operational requirements document, a  mandatory step in the DOD acquisition process. This document outlines  552 requirements intended to meet the warfighter\u2019s needs and discusses  the characteristics needed for the FCS-equipped brigade combat teams to  achieve the Army\u2019s desired tactical concepts and capabilities. FCS is  described in this document as a family of systems comprising advanced,  networked air- and ground-based maneuver, maneuver support, and  sustainment systems. The program has seven key performance  parameters: network-ready, networked battle command, networked  lethality, transportability, sustainability/reliability, training, and  survivability. In simpler terms, the Army has stated that the FCS-equipped  brigade combat teams must be as good as or better than current Army  forces in terms of lethality, responsiveness, sustainability, and  survivability. Since the FCS program started in May 2003, the Army and the  lead systems integrator have been working to translate those warfighter  requirements first into system of systems requirements at the FCS level.  Having this information in hand gives the Army a good understanding of  what FCS brigade combat teams should be capable of, but more detailed  knowledge is needed for each of the 18 individual systems. Now, the Army  and the lead systems integrator are delving much deeper and more  precisely to translate system of systems requirements into more specific  requirements for individual systems within FCS. Figure 2 illustrates how  the requirements laid out in the operational requirements document flow  down to the FCS\u2019s system of systems and later to the individual system  level.", "During the requirements definition process, the Army, its lead systems  integrator, and other contractors provided feedback on the feasibility of  the requirements being proposed. The feedback sometimes resulted in  several rounds of negotiations and trade-offs before requirements could be  finalized. For example, the Army has invested much time and effort in  deciding how best to meet the FCS transportability requirements while  continuing to meet its lethality and survivability requirements. A series of  design concepts were used to examine the possibilities, and the Army and  the lead systems integrator have conducted numerous design trade  studies. Since program start, the Army has made a number of design trade- offs that have been incorporated into the current design concepts. For  example, the current manned ground vehicle design concepts feature a  basic, lightly armored vehicle (each weighing about 19 tons) and  additional armor (bringing the total vehicle weight up to about 24 tons).  This trade-off was intended to achieve an acceptable level of survivability  while maintaining a limited capability for the vehicles to be transported on  the C-130 Hercules air lifter. The Army also decided to accept a higher  weight to achieve the lethality of the 120-mm cannon for the mounted  combat system. Finally, the Army decided to accept a reduction in range  inherent in the lighter weight 38-caliber 155-mm cannon for the non-line- of-sight cannon vehicle.", "In August 2005, the Army and the lead systems integrator conducted the  System of Systems Functional Review, which is a multi-disciplined  technical review used to ensure that a system can proceed into  preliminary design. The review is conducted to ensure that all system of  systems requirements have been defined and are consistent with program  budget, schedule, risk, and other constraints. The Army and the lead  systems integrator demonstrated that they had (1) essentially completed  the definition of the system of systems level requirements, (2) established  the functional baseline for the program, and (3) made an initial allocation  of functional requirements down to the individual FCS system level. As  shown in figure 2 above, at the system of systems level, there are about  11,500 requirements. The Army anticipates that there eventually could be  eight times the number of requirements at the FCS system level, or roughly  90,000 requirements.", "For the System of Systems Functional Review, the Army prepared a  number of performance evaluations, including assessments of the entire  brigade combat team\u2019s capabilities as well as more focused evaluations of  individual FCS design concepts or requirements. The Army is conducting  performance evaluations while continuing to evaluate requirement trade- offs and refine system-level requirements. These evaluations will be  valuable in understanding the impact of individual requirement trade-off  decisions on FCS capabilities as well as the Army\u2019s pledge that FCS would  be as good as or better than the current Army forces in terms of lethality,  survivability, responsiveness and sustainability."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FCS System-Level Requirements Are Not Yet Firm", "paragraphs": ["The Army deserves credit for having decided on so many requirements at  the system of systems level and for beginning the process allocating  functional requirements to the individual system level. However,  according to DOD policy and best practices, requirements should be  firmed up at the beginning of the product development phase. System  requirements\u2014how big, how heavy, how fast, how strong\u2014can each be  expressed in multiple ways. In deciding how best to address those system- level requirements, trade-offs may be necessary. Ideally, solutions go  through a prioritization and refinement process before final decisions can  be agreed upon. But continuing to define and refine system-level  requirements three years after product development began creates a real  challenge for the other elements of the FCS business case.", "Signs of instability in FCS system-level requirements are already evident.  At the System of Systems Functional Review, an initial assessment was  made of the technical feasibility of the functional requirements allocated  to the individual FCS systems. While many are expected to be achievable,  there would be technical risk in the full achievement of some system-level  requirements including    mine detection;    automatic target recognition for weapon terminal guidance;   real-time battle damage assessment;    chemical and radiation detection;     weapon self-loading for some of the unmanned ground vehicles;    manned ground vehicle countermine capabilities;    safe operation of unmanned ground vehicles;    network latency, quality of service, and intrusion detection;  improvised explosive device detection and suppression;  reliability, availability, maintainability, and testing;    unmanned air vehicle size and weight;    hidden target detection; and    sensor data fusion.", "The Army\u2019s System of Systems Functional Review also underscored how  critical the FCS information network is to the achieving of many of FCS\u2019s  requirements. For example, FCS survivability depends on the brigade-wide  availability of network-based situational awareness plus the inherent  survivability of the FCS platforms. There is hardly any aspect of FCS  functionality that is not predicated on the network, and for many key  functions, the network is essential. As we will discuss later in this report,  there is considerable technical uncertainty surrounding several key  aspects of the FCS network.", "In the coming months, FCS teams working on individual systems will  continue to evaluate the technical feasibility of addressing the allocated  requirements within their current design concepts. Program officials also  will be conducting functional reviews at the system level. According to  Army officials, it is almost certain that some of the FCS system-level  requirements will have to be changed; it is only uncertain by how much.  The Army does have the ability to reallocate a requirement from one  system to another. The Army plans to evaluate its progress in defining and  refining FCS system-level requirements at the August 2006 initial  preliminary design review, which signals the start of the systems  engineering process as well as the beginning of preliminary design work.  However, the Army may not have a stabilized set of technically feasible  and affordable system-level requirements until 2008.", "Concurrently, the system-level teams will be evaluating the affordability of  fully developing and producing each of the FCS systems and platforms to  meet the allocated requirements. The Army has stated it will not exceed  the target cost of $20.9 billion for the lead systems integrator\u2019s  development contract and will attempt to produce the FCS systems and  platforms within specific procurement cost targets. Key FCS program  officials have indicated to us that additional system-level requirements  changes will be needed to meet these targets.", "Applying the discipline of affordability is a good step, but it can make the  requirement definition process more difficult. For example, to meet the  weight goals for the manned ground vehicles, the Army expects to use  advanced, light weight materials, such as ceramics, rather than traditional  steel for armor protection. However, these materials are expected to be  much more costly to produce than steel. To meet the individual manned  ground vehicle\u2019s survivability requirements, each vehicle will have to be  equipped for detection avoidance, target acquisition avoidance, hit  avoidance, ballistic protection, and kill avoidance. Further, each manned  ground vehicle would have to carry sensors that can detect, classify,  recognize, identify, and locate enemy combatants. All of these capabilities  will add to the cost of developing and producing the manned ground  vehicles. Finally, the FCS concept depends, among other things, on the  capabilities of the unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned air vehicles  to enhance the survivability of the rest of the brigade combat team.  However, a high number of unmanned ground vehicles and unmanned air  vehicles themselves are expected to be lost to enemy fire. In the end, the  Army may have to either provide additional unmanned ground vehicles  and/or unmanned air vehicles or risk the loss of even more valuable  manned ground vehicles and soldiers. Either option would involve  additional costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cumulative Effects of Individual Requirement Trade-Offs Must Be Measured", "paragraphs": ["Since the start of the program, the Army has already made some  requirements trade-offs. The Army realizes that the ripple effects of  requirements trade-offs on the anticipated FCS capabilities will need to be  thoroughly assessed to determine if the fundamental tenets of the  program\u2014such as being as lethal and survivable as the current Army  force\u2014are still intact. For example, in deciding to maintain a requirement  for the manned ground vehicles to be transportable on C-130 aircraft, the  Army determined that the vehicles could still meet their survivability and  lethality requirements while meeting the size and weight restrictions  needed to be compatible with the C-130 operating limitations. This  solution involves, in part, the use of additional armor that would be put on  the vehicle after it had been flown by a C-130 to its new operating location.  The Army made this decision with the knowledge that the C-130 aircraft's  capability to transport the FCS vehicles would be very limited and that the  solution would require more C-130s to transport vehicles than previously  planned. Also, as we pointed out in our March 2005 testimony, the  development and integration of manned ground vehicle technologies was  made vastly more difficult by the Army's decision to retain the C-130  transportability requirement. As the FCS development effort proceeds, the  Army will have to regularly assess whether the manned ground vehicles  will still be able to meet their lethality, survivability, and other  requirements as well as the assumed operational value of maintaining the  C-130 transportability requirement. Decision makers need to be kept  informed on the status of the program\u2019s basic tenets, such as FCS  capabilities being as good as or better than those of current Army forces.", "As the technical feasibility and affordability of requirements are better  understood, additional FCS requirements trade-offs will have to be made  and their ripple effects identified. For example, if the requirements for  FCS missile and munition terminal guidance are changed due to feasibility  or cost issues, that may not have an impact only on lethality, but also on  overall FCS survivability because the Army maintains that FCS  survivability will be enhanced if it is able to see first and kill first. Also, if  the FCS weapon terminal guidance requirements are changed, the brigade  combat teams may have to carry and use more weapons than expected,  which would have an impact on the team\u2019s sustainability. As another  example, if the FCS countermine requirements are changed, then FCS  manned ground vehicles may be less survivable and mobile. The Army  may have to add additional armor to the manned ground vehicles, directly  affecting their weight and impacting their transportability and  sustainability. Finally, if the reliability, availability, maintainability, and  testing requirements are adjusted, the brigade combat teams may have to  carry more spare parts and use more maintenance personnel than  originally anticipated.", "The Army is aiming to field FCS systems and platforms that meet all of its  minimally acceptable threshold requirements, but according to program  officials, that may not be possible for all requirements. Further, it is  unclear at this point if the resulting set of system-level requirements will  yield an overall FCS capability that will be acceptable to the Army as a  whole and its user representative, the Training and Doctrine Command.  The Training and Doctrine Command has had extensive involvement in the  program to date and would have to approve any major changes in FCS  requirements.

The maturity level of a technology can range  from paper studies (level 1), to prototypes that can be tested in a realistic  environment (level 7), to an actual system that has proven itself in mission  operations (level 9). The definitions of each TRL can be found in appendix  IV. According to DOD acquisition policy, a technology should have been  demonstrated in a relevant environment (TRL 6) or, preferably, in an  operational environment (TRL 7) to be considered mature enough to use  for product development in systems integration. Best practices of leading  commercial firms and successful DOD programs have shown that critical  technologies should be mature to at least a TRL 7 before the start of  product development.", "In the case of the FCS program, the latest independent technology  assessment shows that none of the critical technologies are at TRL 7, and  only 18 of the 49 technologies currently rated have demonstrated TRL 6.

The Army has not been able to  mature the technologies needed to provide radios that both generate  sufficient power as well as meet platform size and weight constraints. In  addition, the radio design is not sufficient to meet security requirements  for operating in an open network environment. These factors have  contributed to significant cost and schedule problems.

The discovery of problems in testing conducted late in  development is a fairly common occurrence on DOD programs, as is the  attendant late cycle churn. Often, tests of a full system, such as launching  a missile or flying an aircraft, become the vehicles for discovering  problems that could have been found out earlier and corrected less  expensively. When significant problems are revealed late in a weapon  system\u2019s development, the reaction\u2014or churn\u2014can take several forms:  extending schedules to increase the investment in more prototypes and  testing, terminating the program, or redesigning and modifying weapons  that have already made it to the field.

It is necessary that a major new investment like FCS  have a compelling, well-thought out concept, but this alone is not  sufficient. FCS began product development prematurely in 2003, and today  is a long way from having the level of knowledge it should have had before  committing resources to a new product development effort. The elements  of a sound business case\u2014firm requirements, mature technologies, a  knowledge-based acquisition strategy, a realistic cost estimate, and  sufficient funding\u2014are not present. FCS has all the indicators for risks  that would be difficult to accept for any single system. They are even more  daunting in the case of FCS not only because of their multiplicity, but  because FCS represents a new concept of operations that is predicated on  technological breakthroughs. Thus, technical problems, which accompany  immaturity, not only pose traditional risks to cost, schedule, and  performance; they pose risks to the new fighting concepts envisioned by  the Army.", "The Army sees the foregoing as risk-averse thinking. The Army does not  see immature technologies as an unacceptable risk, but as a \u201cjust in time\u201d  approach that is necessary to guard against technological obsolescence.  The Army believes FCS technologies will mature predictably when needed  and that they must have much latitude to make trade-offs across systems  in case they do not mature. Similarly, the Army has set cost limitations for  FCS and is prepared to make trade-offs in capability to offset future cost  growth. Also, the Army is confident that advances in modeling and  simulation reduce the reliance on physical testing to demonstrate  performance.", "It is possible that the Army\u2019s strategy for acquiring FCS could succeed as  planned. But counting on it would require suspending credence in the  lessons learned on other programs as well as the best practices of  successful programs. Committing to the strategy also means setting aside  DOD\u2019s acquisition policies\u2014which espouse an evolutionary, knowledge- based approach\u2014for an entire generation of Army acquisitions. The Army  has made important progress on setting FCS system of systems  requirements and making key decisions, such as vehicle weights. But its  progress thus far seems to have done more to confirm risk than to have  refuted it; setting system-level requirements and maturing technologies  have proven difficult and are taking longer than planned.", "In making decisions to commit additional resources to acquiring the  capabilities represented by FCS, DOD must recognize the immaturity of  the program and the amount of discovery that lies ahead. It is not a  certainty that FCS will work and enable the concept of operations the  Army envisions. A full commitment to the Army\u2019s strategy for acquiring  FCS is not yet warranted because the Army has not demonstrated  sufficient knowledge to provide confidence that it can deliver a fully  capable FCS within projected costs and time frames. Based on the Army\u2019s  plans, there should be sufficient progress on system-level requirements  definition and technology development by the time of its preliminary  design review in 2008 to realistically assess whether the program\u2019s goals  are achievable and at what cost. As DOD proceeds with its decisions, it  must preserve its ability to change course on acquiring FCS capabilities to  guard against a situation in which FCS will have to be acquired at any cost.  It must also be able to hold the Army accountable for delivering FCS  within budgeted resources. In this vein, options are available to frame FCS  capabilities around a business case that comports with acquisition policies  and best practices and to minimize risk within the current acquisition  strategy. Alternatives to the current FCS acquisition strategy must also be  kept viable in the event that desired capabilities prove unattainable."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense limit DOD\u2019s commitment to  the FCS product development phase and eventual production until a  sound business case that is consistent with DOD acquisition policy and  best practices can be clearly demonstrated.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense lay the groundwork for  the Army\u2019s development of a sound FCS business case by tasking the  spring 2006 Defense Acquisition Board to do the following:", "Revaluate the FCS business case\u2014including requirements,  technologies, complementary programs, acquisition strategy, cost, and  funding availability\u2014in light of its own acquisition policies.

DOD stated it is committed to the  Army\u2019s transformation and that effort, and in particular the FCS program,  requires a disciplined, yet agile, acquisition construct. DOD added that the  Defense Acquisition Executive has determined that the FCS program is  based on a viable acquisition strategy. DOD stated that it would reevaluate  the FCS acquisition strategy and reassess FCS cost estimates and funding  in the spring 2006 Defense Acquisition Board review. DOD also noted that  a Defense Acquisition Board review would be held for the timeframe  (2008) of the FCS preliminary design review, but refrained from  committing to making it a milestone decision review.", "DOD\u2019s response to our draft report did not specifically address our  findings on the FCS program\u2019s lack of a sound business case. DOD was  also not specific about what criteria or standards for knowledge it would  use in making its assessments, but referred to the incremental markers  contained in the FCS acquisition strategy and system engineering plan. It is  important that these markers reflect standards for knowledge that are  consistent with best practices and DOD policy. Thus far, the FCS program  has been judged by its own markers. As we have pointed out in this report,  these markers have allowed FCS to be judged as acceptable despite its  falling far short of the markers that represent best practices and DOD  acquisition policy. For example, the low state of technology maturity has  not prevented DOD from concluding that the FCS strategy is viable. Using  the program\u2019s markers as a basis for future reviews raises the question of  whether FCS will continue to be held to a lower standard than DOD  policy. Over time, as the program\u2019s markers are adjusted in light of actual  performance and more money is invested, it will become increasingly  difficult for the Army and DOD to conclude that program progress is  anything other than acceptable.", "Regarding a commitment to a milestone review in 2008, we note that, in  recognition of the fact that the FCS was allowed to proceed into Systems  Development and Demonstration prematurely, DOD had directed a full  milestone review update be held in November 2004. However, that review  has not yet occurred and it now appears that it will not occur. Thus, there  is no commitment by DOD to review the FCS business case (including all  elements in addition to the acquisition strategy), culminating in a go/no-go  decision in 2008 based on the preliminary design review. The increased  responsibility of making a declarative decision adds a higher level of  discipline and accountability than a review implies. We maintain our  position that such a decision is warranted.", "It is important to note that Congress will continue to be asked to make  funding commitments in advance of program events. Specifically, the  budget request for fiscal year 2008, which will support the preliminary  design review, will be presented to Congress for approval in January 2007.  Conceivably, the request for the fiscal year 2009 budget, which will be  presented in January 2008, will also precede the preliminary design  review. Congress should safeguard itself against a situation in which  budget decisions could preclude its ability to make adjustments to FCS as  warranted by actual demonstrated performance against the business case.  For example, the status of the FCS business case based on the knowledge  demonstrated in the 2008 preliminary design review should be used to  guide ensuing program activities and funding commitments. Accordingly,  we have raised these issues as matters for congressional consideration.", "We also received technical comments from DOD which have been  addressed in the report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretary of Defense; the  Secretary of the Army; and the Director, Office of Management and  Budget.
