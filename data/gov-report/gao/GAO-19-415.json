The President was not in the White  House at the time; however, this episode highlighted several areas in  which the Secret Service needed to improve its performance. The primary  responsibility of the Secret Service, a component of the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS), is to protect the President, the First Family,  other national-level leaders, and the White House itself. The September  2014 incident followed several other security lapses involving the Secret  Service in recent years, and it prompted the then-Secretary of Homeland  Security to establish the U.S. Secret Service Protective Mission Panel  (PMP), naming four members with expertise in national security,  protective security, and leadership of complex organizations.", "The PMP met with about 50 Secret Service employees, including officials  and agency leadership across all levels of seniority; met with  representatives from a broad array of organizations, including federal  agencies and metropolitan police departments; and reviewed agency  documents. The PMP concluded that the September 2014 incident  occurred in large part because of a \u201ccatastrophic failure in training.\u201d The  PMP issued its final report in December 2014, which contained 19  recommendations that addressed three areas: (1) training and personnel;  (2) technology, perimeter security, and operations; and (3) leadership.

We reviewed  documents to corroborate what Secret Service officials reported to  determine whether and to what extent the stated actions had been taken.  Among other planning and implementation documents, we reviewed the  Secret Service\u2019s strategic plan, human capital strategic plan, training  strategic plan, and resource allocation plans. We also interviewed officials  and received written responses from various offices across the agency,  including the Offices of Protective Operations, Investigations, Training,  Technical Development and Mission Support, Strategic Planning and  Policy, and Human Resources. To further inform our assessment, we  reviewed reports related to recommendations made by the PMP,  including a December 2015 House of Representative\u2019s Committee on  Oversight and Government Reform report on four Secret Service  security incidents; an October 2016 National Academy of Public  Administration report looking at organizational change at the Secret  Service; and a DHS Office of Inspector General report examining Secret  Service\u2019s actions to address the panel\u2019s recommendations. We  compared the progress on each recommendation to what the PMP  described in its December 2014 final report. We also interviewed two of  the four members of the PMP. For each recommendation, we  determined that either implementation of the recommendation was still in  progress or the recommendation was implemented. For  recommendations that we consider implemented as of March 2019, we  recognize that the Secret Service may need to take further actions to  ensure that the new activity or process continues as intended.", "We assessed data on agents\u2019 time expended from fiscal years 2014  through 2018. Specifically, to determine the share of time that special  agents across the agency, including those assigned to the Presidential  Protective Division (PPD) and the Vice Presidential Protective Division  (VPD), spent on investigation and protective assignments, training, and  other duties, we obtained and analyzed data from the Secret Service\u2019s  Monthly Activity Reporting System on agents\u2019 self-reported time in fiscal  years 2014 through 2018. The data describe how many hours each agent  (except for members of the Senior Executive Service) reported  conducting protection assignments, conducting investigations, or taking  part in training, among other things. To determine the share of work hours  that special agents assigned to PPD and VPD spent in training, we  compared training to regular work hours data from the Monthly Activity  Reporting System for each fiscal year 2014 through 2018. We assessed  the reliability of the data from the Monthly Activity Reporting System by  reviewing relevant documentation and interviewing knowledgeable Secret  Service officials. We determined that these data were sufficiently reliable  for our reporting objective.

Over time, its investigative mission has grown to encompass a wide  range of financial and cybercrimes. In addition to investigating financial and electronic crimes, special agents conduct protective intelligence\u2014 investigating threats against protected persons, including the President,  and protected facilities, such as protectee residences. These activities are  conducted through the Office of Investigations, which oversees the  agency\u2019s field office structure. Agents assigned to the field offices also  support protective operations by, for example, providing physical  protection with the assistance of federal, state, and local law enforcement  entities when a protectee travels.

For example, the agency hired a Senior  Executive Director of Communications in 2016 and formed the Office of  Communications and Media Relations in 2018 to manage the agency\u2019s  public affairs efforts and to oversee internal agency communication.  Additionally, each year the Director of the Secret Service issues a  strategic priority memorandum that identifies priority areas for the  upcoming fiscal year budget.", "Further, from fiscal year 2014 through fiscal year 2018, special agents  across the entire agency worked more hours on protection assignments  and fewer hours on investigations. Specifically, in fiscal year 2014, agents  spent 4.3 million hours (54 percent) on protection and 2.8 million hours  (36 percent) on investigations, whereas in fiscal year 2018, agents spent  4.9 million hours (59 percent) on protection and 2.2 million hours (26  percent) on investigations. The number and percentage of hours spent  on protection peaked in fiscal year 2016, but was higher in fiscal year  2018 than in fiscal year 2014. Figure 2 shows the distribution of agent  work hours.", "The Secret Service has identified protection as its priority, and the Secret  Service has identified training as an essential component of protection. In  its December 2014 report, the PMP found that the security incident at the  White House on September 19, 2014, arose from a \u201ccatastrophic failure  of training\u201d. The PMP therefore recommended, and Secret Service  agreed at the time, that special agents assigned to PPD and VPD train for  25 percent of their work time. This was to be accomplished by allowing  agents time to train during the designated training shift, known as the  \u201cfourth shift\u201d.", "However, while training for special agents agencywide increased to 10  percent by 2018\u2014more than triple the amount from fiscal year 2014\u2014 training for those assigned to PPD and VPD did not increase  accordingly. Specifically, special agents assigned to PPD and VPD  reported attending training for about 5.9 percent and 2.9 percent of their  regular work hours in fiscal year 2018, respectively, compared with 3.3  percent and 1.9 percent in fiscal year 2014. (See figure 3.) According to  our analysis of Secret Service self-reported data, in fiscal year 2018,  special agents assigned to PPD and VPD missed achieving the 25- percent training target by 76 and 88 percent each. Figure 3 shows the  share of regular work hours that agents assigned to PPD and VPD spent  in training in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 compared to the annual  target.", "The Secret Service established the 25 percent training target for agents  assigned to PPD and VPD, and senior officials reaffirmed the target in  March 2019. However, according to a senior Office of Protective  Operations official, the fast operational tempo (i.e., heavy workload)  hampered agents\u2019 ability to participate in training. This official told us that  the amount of protection that the Secret Service provides dictates how  often agents are assigned protection assignments during the training  shift. Senior Secret Service officials further added that the number of  protectees and the amount of travel for the current protectees is higher for  the current administration than for prior administrations, which reduces  the time agents have available for training. According to Secret Service  officials, the Secret Service\u2019s ability to meet the PPD and VPD training  targets is dependent on increased staffing levels.", "The Secret Service outlined its plans to increase staffing levels in the  Secret Service FY 2018\u2013FY 2025 Human Capital Strategic Plan, which  was published in May 2017. The plan describes, among other things,  the agency\u2019s human capital strategic goals, the process used to  determine staffing needs, and annual hiring targets. By the end of fiscal  year 2025, the agency plans to employ 9,595 individuals overall, including  4,807 special agents\u2014an increase of 1,193 special agents from the end  of fiscal year 2018. To meet the special agent target, the Secret Service  assumes an average net growth of about 182 special agents per year  between fiscal years 2019 through 2025. However, the Secret Service\u2019s  human capital strategy does not address the immediate need to help PPD  and VPD meet training targets. Even though the special agent staffing  level increased from fiscal years 2014 to 2018 by 332 agents, training  levels for agents assigned to PPD and VPD remained below the 25- percent target at 6 and 3 percent, respectively, in fiscal year 2018.", "Because of the agency\u2019s zero-fail responsibility to protect the President  and Vice President, the PMP concluded that it is imperative that the  Secret Service strive to address training deficits as soon as possible. In  addition, according to leading management practices related to training  and development efforts, adequate planning allows agencies to establish  priorities and determine the best ways to leverage investments to improve  performance. As part of the planning, agencies may need to compare  various training strategies in terms of, among other things, the availability  of resources and risk of unfavorable consequences if training investments  are not made.", "The agency has focused on increasing training as part of its eight-year  human capital strategy, but the Secret Service has not developed a plan  to ensure that it meets near-term protection-related training targets. One  way that the agency could address PPD and VPD training needs in the  short term is to shift agents from investigations to protection assignments.  Because all agents are trained to provide protection and to conduct  investigations, they can be moved between investigations and protection  when dictated by operational circumstances. For example, in fiscal year  2016 agents worked about 548,000 fewer investigative hours in order to  support protection than they did in fiscal year 2015. This shift was made  to accommodate increased protection demand from candidates in the  November 2016 presidential election. See figure 5.", "In fiscal year 2018, agents across the agency spent nearly 2.2 million  hours on investigations. By comparison, agents assigned to PPD and  VPD would have needed an additional 136,000 hours and 66,000 hours  of training, respectively, in fiscal year 2018 to reach the training targets.  Shifting agents from investigations to protection would reduce field  offices\u2019 capacity to complete investigations. However, the agency\u2019s stated  priority is protection, and training was identified by the PMP as a key  component of protection.", "Increasing staffing levels, as planned, over the long term may adequately  support the protective and the investigative priorities at the levels defined  by the agency. However, the Secret Service is relying on hiring goals  alone to achieve its training-related targets, and it may not be able to  achieve its hiring goals because of, among other things, uncertainty about  whether enough funding will be requested and appropriated to expand the  agency at planned levels. For example, an increase of 89 special agents  was requested in the fiscal year 2020 budget submitted to Congress, 88  special agents short of the 177 planned for in the Secret Service FY  2018\u2013FY 2025 Human Capital Strategic Plan. Further, the Secret Service  has not developed a plan specifically for meeting training targets for  agents assigned to PPD and VPD given current and planned staffing  levels.", "While reviewing a draft of this report and after further consideration of the  resources required to achieve the PMP-recommended training targets, in  May 2019 the Secret Service stated that it no longer agrees with the  training target recommended by the PMP and plans to reevaluate it.  Developing and implementing a plan for meeting established training  targets given current and planned staffing levels will help ensure that  protection-related training targets are met in the near term and that  agents assigned to PPD and VPD are prepared to carry out Secret  Service\u2019s priority\u2014protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Secret Service Lacks a Policy with a Documented Process for Collecting Complete and Appropriate Training Data for the Uniformed Division", "paragraphs": ["The PMP recommended, and Secret Service agreed, that Uniformed  Division officers\u2014who provide protection at the White House\u2014train for 10  percent of their work time. However, the Secret Service cannot fully  assess progress towards achieving the 10-percent training target  because it lacks complete and appropriate protection-related training data  for Uniformed Division officers. Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government state that management should design control  activities to achieve objectives and respond to risks, and that  management should implement control activities through policies.", "Appropriate types of control activities include, for example, the accurate  and timely recording of transactions. Internal control standards also state  that management should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objective. Quality information is appropriate, current, complete, accurate,  accessible, and provided on a timely basis.", "According to Secret Service officials, training data for Uniformed Division  officers are collected through various means and systems. For example,  officials stated that they use a database called ePerson to capture certain  types of training, such as firearms and physical training requalification  sessions. In addition, officials report that Secret Service separately uses  DHS\u2019s Performance and Learning Management System (PALMS), which  DHS designed to consolidate existing learning management systems for  each of DHS\u2019s agencies. PALMS collects data on computer-based  training and training provided at the James J. Rowley Training Center  automatically, but requires manual entry for training provided at offsite  locations. According to Secret Service officials, there are a significant  amount of internal on-the-job training instances that do not get recorded.  As a result, training data collected on Uniformed Division training hours  are incomplete.", "Further, we reviewed the training data that the Uniformed Division  provided to us and identified a number of data quality issues affecting the  data\u2019s completeness and appropriateness. For example, certain training  was identified by location only or lacked descriptions to clearly link the  training to the skills Uniformed Division officers require while working at  the White House. Additionally, Secret Service counted training unrelated  to protection, such as training on electronic travel vouchers and  retirement planning, towards achievement of the 10-percent protection- training target. This occurred because the Secret Service lacks a policy  with a documented process identifying how to capture Uniformed Division  training information and the type of training to be captured.", "According to Uniformed Division management, the Secret Service  initiated a process in 2017 to enhance the collection and compilation of  Uniformed Division training information. Specifically, each Uniformed  Division branch training coordinator is to send a list of completed training  to Uniformed Division management every 2 weeks. That training  information, along with information captured in other systems such as  PALMS, is then to be manually compiled by a Uniformed Division staff  person at Secret Service\u2019s headquarters. However, the Secret Service  has not consistently employed the new process since initiating it in 2017.  For example, according to Secret Service officials, the individual  responsible for compiling the data was absent from the position for 3  months, and they did not know whether the data for that period were  compiled at that time. As personnel\u2014such as the branch training  coordinators or the individual responsible for compiling the data\u2014change  positions, it is important that the Secret Service have a policy with a  documented process to ensure that data collection continues over time  and given staff changes. Further, the process does not include  information on how or whether to capture internal on-the-job training  instances, or instruction on the type of training to be captured to  demonstrate that the training is protection-related training. Developing  and implementing a policy with a documented process to collect complete  and appropriate Uniformed Division officer training data would better  position Secret Service to assess Uniform Division officer training data  and make informed decisions about whether and how training needs and  the 10-percent training are being met."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Protecting the White House, the President, and the Vice President,  among others, is a zero-fail responsibility.
