The ability of officers to enforce the law, protect the public, and guard their own safety is very difficult in an environment in which violent crime is commonplace and firearms are frequently used for illegal purposes. For the agents of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (ATF), suspected illegal firearms activities are the leading cause for their initiating enforcement actions.", "Over the past several years, ATF has come under public criticism and congressional scrutiny primarily as a result of its operation at the Branch Davidians\u2019 compound in Waco, TX, and citizen accusations that ATF agents used excessive force in carrying out their enforcement responsibilities. The February 1993 operation at the Branch Davidians\u2019 compound was initiated to serve an arrest warrant on David Koresh, the Davidians\u2019 leader, and to execute a search warrant on the compound. When Koresh refused to accept the warrants, ATF tried to forcibly enter the compound using a tactic known as dynamic entry but simultaneously was met with gunfire from the Branch Davidians.

Among its missions, ATF is to work directly and in cooperation with others to (1) suppress and prevent crime and violence through enforcement, regulation, and community outreach and (2) support and assist federal, state, local, and international law enforcement.", "To accomplish its criminal enforcement responsibilities, ATF has 24 field divisions, headed by special agents-in-charge (SAC), located throughout the United States. As of September 1995, ATF had a total of 1,944 special agents of which 1,777 were assigned to its field divisions. ATF\u2019s special agents are to initiate criminal investigations when notified of suspected illegal activities by such sources as informants; undercover operatives; and referrals from ATF inspectors and other federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Figure 1.1 is an ATF organization chart, as of January 1996, that depicts the principal units discussed in this report.", "As table 1.1 shows, the vast majority of ATF\u2019s enforcement activities have been directed at suspects who are believed to be engaged in illegal firearms activities. Suspicion of illegal firearms activities is the principal reason that initiates ATF firearms investigations.", "On the basis of its investigations, ATF apprehends individuals that it suspects of criminal violations. As can be seen from table 1.2, most of the individuals ATF arrested were suspected of violating firearms laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Use of Force and Deadly Force?", "paragraphs": ["According to IACP, use of force has been construed to include a wide range of techniques used to compel compliance. Such techniques range from verbal persuasion\u2014the lowest force level\u2014to deadly force\u2014the most severe force level\u2014and everything in between, including physical force, stun guns, tear gas, batons, and other nonlethal equipment. The variety of coercive options available to agents in a confrontational setting is often referred to as the \u201cforce continuum.\u201d", "According to Treasury policy on the use of force, the primary consideration in its use is the timely and effective application of the appropriate level of force required to establish and maintain lawful control. ATF training materials note that the use of force by law enforcement officers in the performance of their duties has been traditionally limited to four categories. Under these categories, use of force is allowed if necessary to \u2022 overcome resistance to the officer\u2019s lawful commands, \u2022 effect an arrest or detain a suspect, \u2022 maintain custody and prevent escape, or \u2022 protect the officer or other persons.", "Furthermore, the training materials note that in determining how much force may be or should be used, the officer should consider such factors as the \u2022 nature of the offense for which the suspect is being arrested, e.g., felony or \u2022 number of participants on each side; \u2022 size, age, and condition of participants; \u2022 record and/or reputation of the suspect for violence; \u2022 use of alcohol or drugs by the suspect; \u2022 suspect\u2019s mental or psychiatric history; \u2022 presence of innocent bystanders; and \u2022 availability of less violent or nonlethal weapons.", "In October 1995, Treasury and the Department of Justice adopted use of deadly force guidelines that are uniform with the exception of certain agency mission-specific provisions. For example, while warning shots generally are not permitted under the Treasury and Justice policies, the U.S. Secret Service may use warning shots in exercising its protective responsibilities, the U.S. Customs Service may use warning shots on the open waters, and Justice agencies may use warning shots under certain circumstances within the prison context.", "In addressing the subject of nondeadly force, the Treasury and Justice uniform policies recognize that if force other than deadly force reasonably appears to be sufficient to accomplish an arrest or otherwise accomplish the law enforcement purpose, deadly force is not necessary. In commenting on the policy, both Departments committed to take all reasonable steps to prevent the need to use deadly force.", "Both Departments define deadly force as the use of any force that is likely to cause death or serious physical injury. Therefore, any firearms discharge that is intended to disable a suspect is considered to be deadly force. However, the use of other weapons, including those considered nonlethal, could be construed as a law enforcement officer\u2019s having used deadly force, depending on the manner in which the weapon was used. For example, hitting a suspect in the head with a baton is considered to be the use of deadly force."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In August 1995, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government, House Committee on Appropriations, asked us to (1) identify and describe ATF\u2019s policies for the use of deadly force; (2) determine how ATF conveys its policies to its agents; (3) determine the reasons for and the extent to which ATF uses dynamic entry and the equipment ATF uses to accomplish these entries; and (4) determine whether ATF has complied with its procedures for investigating shooting and alleged excessive use-of-force incidents. While we determined whether ATF complied with procedures for investigating shooting and alleged excessive use-of-force incidents on the basis of a review of case file documents, we did not evaluate the quality and adequacy of ATF\u2019s investigations. In addition, except for a limited check discussed later, we did not verify whether all shooting and alleged excessive force incidents were reported or whether all reported allegations of excessive force were investigated.", "The Chairman also asked us to compare how ATF addresses the above issues with the way that Justice\u2019s Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) address them.

We also interviewed the divisions\u2019 Firearms Instructor Coordinators concerning firearms training and use-of-force training and reviewed their records documenting use-of-force discussions at prior quarters\u2019 training sessions. At the firearms qualification sessions, we also judgmentally selected and spoke with some attending ATF agents to determine whether use-of-force discussions were a regular part of tactical operation planning and operation briefings. Also, in these divisions, we interviewed Assistant Special Agents-in-Charge responsible for the SRT, SRT leaders, and group supervisors to determine whether use-of-force discussions were a part of tactical operation planning and operation briefings.", "Finally, we compared FLETC and ATF training materials with relevant Treasury/ATF use-of-force and deadly force policies to determine if training materials complied with the policies.", "While our review analyzed whether the agencies\u2019 training reflected applicable use-of-force policies, we did not assess the effectiveness of the agencies\u2019 training.

Because (1) SRTs are to be deployed to conduct ATF\u2019s higher risk search and arrest warrants and SRTs have access to all of the equipment available to ATF agents as well as additional specialized equipment and (2) ATF maintains more thorough and readily available data on SRT operations, including tactics and equipment used, than it does on its other enforcement groups, we focused our review and analysis of ATF\u2019s use of dynamic entry and related equipment to operations involving SRT deployments.

We also obtained an ATF statistical compilation of fiscal years 1993 and 1994 SRT activation data, which showed the number of activations, the reason for deployments, deployments that resulted in force being used (e.g., shootings), and whether special equipment was used.

In addition, at the Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles divisions, we obtained listings of the SRT equipment and vehicles as well as certain firearms, breaching tools, and other tactical equipment available for dynamic entries. Although we observed the SRT equipment maintained in Baltimore, we did not obtain an equipment listing because at the time of our visit the SRT had been recently merged into the Washington Division\u2019s SRT. We discussed the use and sources of this equipment with the Tactical Operations Officers, the SRT team leaders, and several agents in each of the three division offices we visited.

Because ATF does not maintain a separate category for use of excessive force, we judgmentally selected these categories following consultations with ATF officials and a review of misconduct incident categories.

These rules can generally be grouped into three categories: (1) the common-law rule, (2) a modified common-law approach, and (3) the Model Penal Code approach.", "Many states followed something similar to the English common-law rule on the use of deadly force, which existed at the time of this country\u2019s founding. Generally, deadly force could be used by a law enforcement officer if necessary to arrest a felony suspect. Because the type of felony involved is not taken into account, this rule is generally referred to as the \u201cfleeing felon\u201d rule. An officer could use deadly force when he reasonably believed that he was justified in arresting an individual for a felony as long as the officer also reasonably believed that such force was necessary to protect himself or prevent escape. To a great extent, the rationale behind the fleeing felon rule was based on the fact that common-law felonieswere punishable by death, and the use of deadly force was seen as merely accelerating the penal process, albeit without providing a trial. For example, the 1982 Tennessee statute, which was found unconstitutional in a landmark Supreme Court decision discussed later, was based on the fleeing felon rule. The decision provided, in part, that \u201cf, after notice of the intention to arrest the defendant, he either flees or forcibly resists, the officer may use all the necessary means to effect the arrest.\u201d", "\u201c\u2019Forcible felony\u2019 means treason, murder, voluntary manslaughter, aggravated criminal sexual assault, criminal sexual assault, robbery, burglary, arson, kidnapping, aggravated battery and any other felony which involves the use or threat of physical force or violence against any individual.\u201d", "Legislatures in other states abandoned the common-law rule for some form of the Model Penal Code approach, which imposes several qualifications on the use of deadly force. The Model Penal Code, as formulated by the American Law Institute in 1962, generally permits the use of deadly force only when the crime for which the arrest is made involves conduct including use or threatened use of deadly force or when there is a substantial risk that the person to be arrested will cause death or serious bodily harm if his apprehension is delayed. More specifically, under the Model Penal Code approach, the use of deadly force is not justified unless (1) the arrest is for a felony, (2) the actor effecting the arrest is a peace officer or is assisting a peace officer, (3) the actor believes such force creates no substantial risk of injury to innocent persons, and (4) the actor believes that the felony included the use or threatened use of deadly force or there is a substantial risk that the suspect will cause death or serious bodily harm if apprehension is delayed.", "The Supreme Court noted, in 1985, that while there was not a constant or overwhelming trend away from the common-law rule, a long-term movement has been away from the emphasis that deadly force may be used against any fleeing felon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Two Supreme Court Cases Have Provided Some Guidance on the Use of Deadly Force", "paragraphs": ["In the 1985 Tennessee v.

Garner, after being told to halt, tried to climb over a fence at night in the backyard of a house he was suspected of burglarizing. With the aid of a flashlight, the officer was able to see Garner\u2019s face and hands. Even though the officer saw no sign of a weapon, he shot Garner in order to prevent his escape.

According to these officials, the primary purpose for using dynamic entry is to ensure the safety of law enforcement personnel as well as suspects and other individuals during a high-risk operation. In addition, dynamic entries may be a preferred tactic when the possibility exists that evidence may be destroyed.", "Furthermore, these officials as well as other law enforcement officials agree that two characteristics of dynamic entry are speed and surprise. Various law enforcement articles as well as ATF, DEA, and FBI officials assert that law enforcement studies show reaction time to be slower than action time\u2014it takes longer for individuals to respond to a threat than to make a threat. Thus, through the use of dynamic entries in certain high-risk situations, law enforcement agents hope to act so quickly that the suspects do not have time to respond or, at a minimum, give agents the advantage by forcing suspects to react to agent actions rather than the reverse. While dynamic entries may require a forcible entry, such as breaking down a door, dynamic entries can also be accomplished through open or unlocked doors.", "Dynamic entry is only one of several tactical techniques ATF agents can use to execute search and arrest warrants or conduct other enforcement operations. Additional techniques include \u2022 \u201cstealth\u201d or \u201cstatic\u201d entries, which involve slow, methodical entry and movement in a premise during which each area or room is cleared of danger before proceeding (e.g., when a suspect opens the door in response to the knock and announcement, agents may arrest or detain the suspect and then slowly clear the remainder of the premise of danger before proceeding with a search); \u2022 containment call-outs, which are situations where agents surround a location and, from covered positions, contact the suspect and order the person to exit the premise; \u2022 ruses, such as when agents create a ploy to draw the person out of their premise before making an entry or arresting them; and \u2022 arresting or detaining the suspect away from the location (e.g., vehicle stops) before making an entry or, in the case of an arrest, to avoid having to make an entry.", "Whether an entry is required after using certain tactics, such as containment call-outs or ruses, would depend on the purpose of the operation. If a search warrant needs to be executed, even after arresting or detaining the suspect outside of the premise, an entry may still need to be made. According to ATF agents and our review of SRT deployment reports for fiscal year 1995, agents often conducted a stealth or static entry, rather than a dynamic entry, after detaining or arresting the primary suspect. According to ATF, DEA, and FBI officials, flexibility in tactical operations is important. Thus, agents may use a combination of these tactics or change tactics during an operation, as necessary. For example, ATF training materials and officials stressed that even after a decision is made to use a dynamic entry, a situation can emerge in the middle of an operation that dictates a change in tactics. Accordingly, during one SRT deployment in fiscal year 1995, agents planned to conduct a dynamic entry to execute arrest and search warrants. However, after the SRT\u2019s arrival at the primary suspect\u2019s home, the suspect was located in the backyard and detained before the SRT entered the premise. The agents then used a stealth entry to execute the search warrant. (App. III provides detailed examples of actual SRT operations in which these various tactics were used.)", "According to ATF, DEA, and FBI officials, the decision regarding whether to use dynamic entry or another technique is dictated by the unique circumstances presented in each operation, with safety as the primary objective. ATF, DEA, and FBI officials agreed that factors, such as the suspect\u2019s criminal history and violent tendencies, the location of the premise, and the amount of fortification expected, are to be considered when determining whether dynamic entry or another tactic should be used.", "In 1994, ATF developed and began requiring an Operational Risk Assessment form to be completed by agents when planning an operation.This document is designed to identify critical elements that can affect high-risk tactical operations. The assessment is divided into four categories, including the type of enforcement activity, the suspect\u2019s criminal history, the weapons possessed by the suspect, and the suspect\u2019s location. According to ATF agents, factors, such as the suspect\u2019s violent tendencies, the location of the premise, and the amount of fortification expected, also are considered. The factors developed in the assessment are assigned point values and are totaled to determine the amount of risk believed to be present in the operation. Depending on the amount of risk present, a decision is made whether to use the SRT to accomplish the operation. Above a certain point total, deployment of the SRT is highly recommended. Below that point total, deployment is to be considered but is optional.", "The information gathered for the risk assessment represents critical intelligence information needed by ATF agents to develop an operational plan (discussed below). According to one SRT leader, one specific factor, if present, would not dictate the use of a particular tactic. Instead, he said agents consider the totality of the factors in a situation when developing the operational plan. For example, because a person is expected to be armed and has a history of violence, does not result in the SRT employing the same tactic in each case. Other factors also present are considered in conjunction with what is known about the suspect\u2014possibly leading agents to chose different tactics in each case. Thus, according to the SRT leader, agents must consider all factors and determine the most appropriate tactic for each operation. For example, agents have to consider whether a prolonged containment call-out could result in needed evidence being destroyed; whether the surrounding neighborhood would have to be evacuated; or, if the location is in certain high-crime neighborhoods, whether a call-out would create a more dangerous situation (e.g., sniping or a riot).", "In January 1995, ATF began requiring agents to complete a standard written planning document for enforcement operations called an operational plan. According to ATF documents, ATF instituted this change due to the increase in violence ATF agents encountered during the execution of search and arrest warrants and undercover operations. An operational plan is required before executing any search or arrest warrants or conducting certain undercover operations. The plan is to specify the tactics and personnel to be used during the operation. According to ATF policy, the agent(s) responsible for the planning portion of the operation prepares the plan, and the group supervisor or Resident Agent-in-Charge (RAC) reviews and approves it. According to division officials, in operations involving the SRT, the SRT team leader and/or other SRT members are to develop the plan, which is then to be reviewed and approved by the assistant SAC responsible for supervising the SRT. Copies of the approved plans are to be sent to the SAC of the division.", "Since the decision to use a dynamic entry or other technique requires consideration of the unique factors present in each situation, ATF has not had any specific policies regarding the use of dynamic entry. However, as a result of Treasury\u2019s review of the Waco operation and the views of tactical operations experts and ATF\u2019s own personnel, ATF decided in October 1995 to implement lessons learned from Waco. One change ATF decided to make was that dynamic entry would only be planned after all other options had been considered. Given the choice, it was decided that the first tactical option to be considered during operational planning would be a ruse\u2014luring the suspect out. It was believed that luring the suspect out would reduce the risks to the public and agents and ensure a safe, peaceful resolution to the situation.", "Regardless of whether dynamic entry or another technique is used, ATF agents are required to follow Treasury\u2019s use-of-force policy as discussed in chapter 2. Also, ATF agents generally are required by law to knock and announce their identity and purpose before executing search and arrest warrants. Courts, nevertheless, have permitted unannounced entries in certain exigent circumstances. Several agents stated that knocking and announcing also helps to protect their safety\u2014through identifying themselves and their purpose they sometimes can prevent a situation in which the suspect might react without knowing that they are law enforcement officers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ATF Agents and SRTs Are to Be Trained in Dynamic Entry and Other Tactics", "paragraphs": ["ATF training is to emphasize that no one tactic is an absolute and that a number of factors, beyond the agents\u2019 control, will influence whether a dynamic entry or other technique is best. During New Agent Training, ATF agents are to be taught to differentiate between situations that require a dynamic or stealth/static entry. Agents are to be taught to consider various factors\u2014such as the characteristics of the suspect, location, and weapons expected\u2014when determining the best tactics to employ during an operation. Agents are to participate in simulation exercises during which they are required to determine and use the appropriate tactics to gain control of situations. ATF course materials emphasize resolving these exercises by using tactics involving speed, surprise, and, if necessary, violence without employing deadly force. During our visit to the ATF National Academy, we were able to confirm through observation that a class of new agents were trained on dynamic entries through practical exercises.", "Agents assigned to SRTs are to receive additional training in tactics, including dynamic entries, during their 2 weeks of SRT basic training at Fort McClellan. Among the more than 20 course topics to be presented are tactical shooting, hostage situations, vehicle assaults, felony vehicle stops, and tactics. Over half of the instruction time allotted during this training is to cover tactics that include team entry and movement techniques during high-risk operations. However, according to an October 1995 ATF report, the basic SRT course curriculum has been revised to include instruction on some of the techniques needed to conduct containment call-out operations. This change was initiated by ATF, on the basis of lessons learned from Waco, to address situations in which there was no evidence in the suspect\u2019s premise that could be easily destroyed. The new basic SRT training also is to emphasize that dynamic entries are to be planned only after all other tactical options have been considered.", "SRTs also are to continue to train on these skills at regularly scheduled in-service sessions. SRTs are required to receive a minimum of 8 hours training each month, or 24 hours each quarter, in addition to the quarterly firearms training to be received by all ATF agents. This continuing training must be provided by qualified sources, which includes other law enforcement agencies.", "We reviewed SRT quarterly in-service training records for fiscal year 1995 and determined that all 24 SRTs conducted training on entry techniques, such as dynamic and/or stealth/static entries, including practical exercises frequently using simunitions or live fire rounds. However, we did not confirm whether all SRT members attended all training sessions. Our review also showed that most of the training was conducted by ATF instructors. The most common non-ATF source of training was state and local law enforcement agencies. For example, we observed the Washington Division\u2019s SRT training for the fourth quarter of 1995. Two days of this training was conducted by representatives of the Los Angeles County Sheriff\u2019s Department\u2019s Special Enforcement Branch\u2014the SWAT team\u2014and primarily consisted of instruction and practical exercises on stealth entry techniques. In 10 instances, Department of Defense or National Guard units provided some training to SRTs but generally not regarding entry tactics. ATF forward observers received most of the training provided by Department of Defense or National Guard units, covering subjects such as winter survival and surveillance techniques.

According to ATF reports of its firearms enforcement investigations from fiscal years 1990 to 1995, 46 percent of the suspects ATF arrested had previous felony convictions, 24 percent had a history of violence, and 18 percent were armed at the time of their arrests.", "According to one SRT leader, ATF encounters basically three types of suspects, those (1) who do not attempt, or even consider, doing anything other than following agents\u2019 instructions; (2) who will attempt to flee or provoke an incident if they are given an opportunity or perceive any weaknesses on the part of the agents; and (3) who are willing to do whatever it takes not to be taken into custody.

Under the revised procedures, ATF\u2019s OIis responsible for investigating reported shooting incidents. Before the revision, ATF\u2019s Office of Enforcement (OE) was responsible for investigating shooting incidents. According to an OI official, the transfer of responsibility was part of an effort to make the investigative process independent of the enforcement process. As a result of the overall reorganization, OI reports directly to the ATF Director. The revisions also include changes in the reporting requirements and procedures and in the procedures for reviewing shooting incident reports. Appendix IV contains a detailed description of ATF\u2019s procedures for reporting, investigating, and reviewing shooting incidents.", "As shown in figure 5.1, once a shooting incident occurs, the ATF agents involved in or present at the incident are required to immediately notify their supervisors. The incident is then to be reported through the chain of command to OE and OI, followed by a written notification within 12 hours of occurrence. Agents are not required to report shooting incidents related to authorized training and recreational shooting. According to the procedures, OI is to determine whether to conduct an investigation of any incident involving the discharge of a firearm within the criteria established by ATF. For example, the intentional discharge of a firearm by an agent is to be investigated. However, shootings of canines or other animals, while required to be reported, are not normally investigated. If an investigation of a shooting incident is required, OI is to assign it to a shooting incident review team (SIRT).", "An SIRT is to investigate the shooting incident according to the process described in figure 5.2. The investigation is to include, among other things, the determination of facts and the analysis of the events and circumstances relating to the incident. The SIRT is then to issue a Shooting Incident Report (SIR) that is to include, among other things, background on the incident, information on suspects\u2019 actions, and exhibits. The report is to be submitted to the OI Assistant Director. On the basis of the incident\u2019s nature and seriousness, the Assistant Director is to submit copies of the report to all members of the Shooting Incident Review Board (SIRB). The SIRB is composed of the following ATF officials: (1) the OI Assistant Director; (2) the Deputy Associate Director for Criminal Enforcement Programs; (3) the two Deputy Associate Directors for Criminal Enforcement Field Operations in the West and East Regions, respectively; (4) the Associate Chief Counsel for Litigation, Office of the Chief Counsel (OCC); (5) the Assistant Director for Training and Professional Development; and (6) the Chief of the Special Operations Division.", "According to the OI Assistant Director (and current Chairman), the SIRB meets at the Chairman\u2019s request, generally within 2 to 3 weeks after a SIR(s) has been submitted, to review the report(s) and determine whether the shooting(s) was justified. The SIRB may accordingly recommend, among other things, changes to training and operational policies. Cognizant ATF Directorate heads are responsible for implementing the recommendations and are to respond in writing within 30 days describing the actions taken. If the SIRB finds the shooting to be not justified, and potential misconduct by ATF agents, it is to forward the matter to ATF\u2019s Professional Review Board (PRB). As discussed below, PRB is to review incidents of alleged agent misconduct, including the alleged use of excessive force.", "ATF\u2019s procedures are consistent with guidelines and/or standards recommended by IACP, PCIE, and the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies.

These guidelines also recommend the preparation of a written report about the incident and the notification of supervisors. In addition, IACP guidelines recommend that shooting incidents be investigated and that the resulting investigative reports be reviewed to determine whether changes in training or other policies are needed. Consistent with these guidelines, ATF procedures require agents to immediately report shootings to their supervisors and to follow up with a written report. In addition, the procedures require that shooting incidents be investigated and\u2014depending on the nature of the incident\u2014the resulting reports be reviewed by the SIRB to determine if changes in policies are warranted.", "PCIE standards recommend that investigators be qualified, exhibit professional proficiency, and exercise due professional care by following an investigative plan and relevant procedures. In addition, the standards recommend, among other things, the establishment of a management information system. Consistent with these standards, according to OI officials, (1) ATF investigators are special agents who have been trained\u2014both collectively and individually\u2014in the investigation of shooting and other use-of-force incidents, (2) ATF investigators use an investigative plan in the form of an action checklist, and (3) OI maintains investigative files and tracks investigations in a computer database.", "Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies standards, like IACP\u2019s guidelines, recommend that shooting incidents be reported at least verbally by law enforcement officers within a specified period of time and to be followed by a written report as soon as practical thereafter. The Commission standards also recommend that law enforcement agencies review the incident reports. ATF\u2019s procedures for reporting and reviewing shooting incidents, discussed earlier, are consistent with these standards.

These guidelines and standards also recommend that a thorough investigation is to involve, among other things, interviewing witnesses, gathering and preserving evidence, preparing a written report, and maintaining an investigative file. According to the IACP guidelines, the purpose of an investigation is to determine (1) the propriety of the use of force and (2) whether the use of force was in accordance with  policy. Our review of ATF\u2019s shooting incident procedures and investigative files showed that investigations were performed by OI, a Directorate that is independent of OE, which is the Directorate most likely to be involved in shooting incidents. The procedures require that the investigation be completed within 30 days of the incident. They also require that an investigation is to, among other things, include interviewing participants and witnesses, and gathering evidence.

The shooting incident investigative files generally contained a record of review by the designated unit. Specifically, 34 shooting incident files contained this information. One shooting investigation review was pending at the time of our review and one shooting investigation was submitted to ATF\u2019s then Office of Internal Affairs (the predecessor to OI) without a formal review.

The agents were returning fire after being fired upon by the suspect. The suspect was under investigation for armed drug trafficking. The investigation and subsequent review determined that the agents acted within the scope of their duties because they were protecting themselves from hostile fire. In a 1991 incident, an ATF agent exchanged fire with a suspect during an undercover \u201cbuy/bust\u201d operation. The suspect\u2014classified as a high-risk \u201cshooter,\u201d or someone likely to resist arrest\u2014resisted arrest. The suspect was the target of a large-scale undercover operation by federal law enforcement agencies as a major cocaine dealer and convicted felon. The ATF investigation and subsequent review determined that the shooting was justified because the agents were defending themselves during a high-risk operation. In a 1992 SRT-related incident, two ATF agents shot and killed a suspect who was shooting at other agents and police officers. The incident occurred during the execution of an arrest warrant issued by a state. The execution of the warrant was a joint ATF/local police department operation.

In a 1994 incident, three ATF agents engaged in an undercover \u201cbuy/bust\u201d operation exchanged fire with several suspects. The suspects were targets of a gang-related investigation involving narcotics and weapons trafficking. During the course of the operation, one of the suspects attempted to rob one of the agents of his \u201cbuy\u201d money. At that point, the agent announced himself as a law enforcement officer, at which time the suspect shot and wounded the agent. The agent and two other agents returned fire.

Four investigations found some type of misconduct by ATF agents. Two investigations were ongoing at the time of our review. One investigation was closed without further action because OI determined that there was no need for adjudication. Specifically, the allegation dated from 1984 and could not be investigated because of the lack of witnesses and evidence. The following are examples of allegations that ATF\u2019s investigations could not substantiate.", "In a 1990 incident, a complainant alleged that an ATF agent assaulted him during an arrest for possession of an unregistered firearm. The complainant was admitted to a hospital as a result of the incident. However, ATF\u2019s investigation of the incident determined that, according to a medical examination, there were no bruises, and that the complainant was actually admitted for a heart condition. While in the hospital, the complainant told a deputy U.S. Marshal that he had actually lied about the assault and did so in an attempt to stay out of prison by being admitted to a hospital. Accordingly, the investigation and subsequent review determined that the allegations were unsubstantiated. The agent was cleared of the allegations. In a 1992 incident in which agents were eventually cleared, a complainant alleged that two ATF agents beat him on the face and scraped his arm during the execution of a search warrant. The investigation and subsequent review determined that the allegation was unsubstantiated. Specifically, a medical examination of the complainant showed that the injuries were self-inflicted, which was a fact that the agents had observed and reported. Subsequent to the medical examination\u2019s results, the complainant dropped the allegations against the agents. The agents received letters of clearance. In a 1994 incident, a complainant alleged that ATF agents damaged a lathe\u2014a device used to refinish firearms\u2014and firearms while returning them. The items had been seized as evidence for a court case. The investigation determined that the moving company hired by ATF to return the items had damaged the lathe and had twice offered to replace it at no charge.

The incident occurred during the search of suspected gang members in front of a grocery store. According to the agents, the suspects were making threatening gestures at their unmarked government vehicle. During the search, a struggle ensued during which a suspect was shoved by an agent against a store window, which was broken as a result. The store owner reported the incident to a local law enforcement agency, which then reported it to the ATF SAC. In a second incident, in 1990, an investigation determined that during an SRT-related operation involving the undercover purchase of firearms, an ATF agent engaged in a loud and offensive confrontation with a confidential informant who was part of the operation. The agent apparently became upset because narcotics were found in the informant\u2019s vehicle. As a result of the incident, the agent seized the narcotics but never turned them over to any law enforcement agency. The agent later claimed that he flushed the narcotics down a toilet. The agent was suspended for 5 days for conduct \u201cunbecoming to an agent\u201d and for failing to properly handle suspected narcotics. In a third incident, in 1993, the complainant alleged that an ATF agent verbally and physically abused him, aggravating a pre-existing injury. The incident occurred during the serving of a federal search warrant. An ATF investigation and subsequent review determined that the allegations of physical abuse were unsubstantiated. However, the agent received a written reprimand for unprofessional conduct and for initiating a confrontation with the complainant that could have become more violent. In a fourth incident, in 1994, a suspect\u2019s girlfriend filed a complaint alleging an ATF agent struck her boyfriend\u2014a parole violator\u2014with a firearm while arresting him. The agent claimed that the suspect struck his head on the pavement during a brief struggle.

Through these sources, eight incidents were identified. We then (1) cross-checked the alleged incidents we identified against ATF\u2019s (a) investigative records to determine if ATF investigated these incidents and (b) litigation records to determine if any complainants filed civil lawsuits against ATF related to these incidents, and (2) discussed these incidents with cognizant officials.", "Our cross-check of ATF\u2019s investigative and litigation records determined that three of the incidents\u2014one shooting and two excessive force allegations\u2014were investigated by ATF.

ATF officials told us that they were not aware of this incident because, for example, a complaint may not have been filed. Moreover, no lawsuit had been filed against ATF at the time of our review. \u2022 A 1991 incident of alleged excessive force reported in newspaper accounts and by the American Civil Liberties Union was not investigated by ATF after its preliminary inquiry found that another federal law enforcement agency\u2019s personnel\u2014not ATF\u2019s\u2014may have been involved in the alleged incident.

SIRB concluded that factors such as wearing gloves and using the off/weak hand may have contributed to the accidental discharges. In a memorandum to the Associate Director for Enforcement, SIRB recommended that agents be trained in using firearms carried in their weak, or off, hands while also using a body bunker and be requalified for firearm use while wearing gloves. In response to these recommendations, both the Associate Director for Enforcement and the ATF Director issued separate memorandums to cognizant officials, such as SACs and the Chief of ATF\u2019s National Academy, informing them of the need to improve body bunker and firearms training.
