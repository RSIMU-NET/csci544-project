In 2005, GAO reported that processing times for arms export cases had increased despite State efforts to streamline its process. GAO was asked to (1) describe recent trends in the processing of arms export cases and (2) identify factors that have contributed to these trends. To conduct its work, GAO obtained and analyzed State arms export case data for fiscal year 2003 through April 30, 2007; reviewed relevant laws, regulations, and guidelines, as well as DDTC funding and staffing information; and interviewed State and Department of Defense officials and selected arms exporters."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Three key trends indicate that DDTC's arms export licensing process is under stress. First, the number of arms export cases processed by DDTC increased 20 percent between fiscal years 2003 and 2006. Most of this increase was for licenses for permanent export. Second, during the same period, median processing times almost doubled. Third, the number of open arms export cases increased 50 percent from about 5,000 in October 2002 to about 7,500 in April 2007, with a high of more than 10,000 cases in September 2006. At the beginning of fiscal year 2007, DDTC launched a campaign to reduce the growing number of open cases. Through extraordinary measures--such as canceling staff training, meetings, and industry outreach, and pulling available staff from other duties to process cases--DDTC was able to cut the number of open cases by 40 percent in 3 months. However, such measures are not sustainable in the long term, do not address underlying inefficiencies and problems, and may have negative unintended consequences for the mission. While some blips in the trends can be attributed to onetime events or efforts--such as DDTC's campaign to reduce open cases--procedural inefficiencies, electronic processing system shortcomings, and human capital challenges underlie the overall trends. For example, GAO's analysis shows that DDTC is taking increasingly longer to refer cases to other agencies or State bureaus for additional review--from 7 days in fiscal year 2003 to 20 days during the first 7 months of fiscal year 2007. In addition, implementation of DDTC's electronic system for submitting applications has been problematic, and electronic processing has not been the promised panacea for improving processing times.

However, the U.S. defense industry and some foreign  government purchasers have expressed concern that the U.S. export  control process is unnecessarily burdensome because of the time needed  to complete these deliberations. To facilitate defense cooperation, State  announced in 2000 several efforts to reduce arms export processing times,  and began the development of a new automated system for submitting and  reviewing cases.

Funding for other DDTC activities and operations comes from two main  sources: (1) appropriated funds that State then allocates to DDTC through  the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, and (2) registration fees, which  DDTC is authorized to retain to help fund certain activities related to  licensing, enforcement, and compliance.", "Exporters submit arms export cases via paper or electronically through D- Trade, DDTC\u2019s Web-based electronic processing system. Cases include  permanent arms export licenses, temporary arms exports or imports,  agreements between U.S. industry and foreign entities to provide technical  assistance or manufacturing capability, requests for amendments to  existing licenses or agreements, and requests to determine commodity  jurisdiction. Cases vary in terms of complexity and time to process. For  example, agreements generally take longer than other cases because they  are complex, require substantial work by licensing officers, and often  require interagency review.", "Once cases are received, DDTC assigns them to one of five teams, based  on commodity categories: firearms, aircraft, missile and spacecraft,  military electronics, and military vehicles and naval vessels. Team leaders,  in turn, assign cases to a licensing officer, who conducts an initial review  to determine whether the case needs a referral to an agency, such as  DOD\u2019s DTSA, and/or another State bureau for additional review\u2014or  whether the case can be reviewed and analyzed internally. Either way, the  licensing officer conducts the final review and determines the final action.  Final action on cases can only be taken by licensing officers with  designated signature authority, which DDTC officials stated takes an  average of 18 months of training and experience to obtain. Prior to  approving cases that involve exports meeting statutory dollar thresholds  and involving selected countries, State must notify Congress.

DDTC  officials attributed this growth to several possible factors, including  increased globalization of the defense industry and an overall increase in  arms exports. In addition, our analysis of the cases processed by DDTC  shows that permanent export licenses constituted about two-thirds of all  cases, thereby accounting for the major part of DDTC\u2019s caseload activity.  For these cases, the greatest increase occurred in aircraft and related  components among the various types of controlled commodities. Our  analysis also showed a high concentration of cases by country of  destination\u2014almost half consisted of seven countries, with 25 percent  involving Japan and the United Kingdom. In contrast, we found cases are  not concentrated by major defense arms exporting companies. In fiscal  year 2006, only 21 percent of cases processed involved the top 10 arms  exporting firms.

Between  fiscal years 2003 and 2006, median processing times nearly doubled, from  14 days to 26 days. Some types of cases take longer to process than others,  in part because of their complexity. For example, in fiscal year 2006,  technical assistance agreements took a median of 94 days to process.  However, these agreements made up less than 9 percent of the cases  processed for that year, and therefore may not be a significant driver of  overall increased processing times. Permanent exports, which constituted  the majority of cases, took a median of 25 days to process in fiscal year  2006.", "For nonreferred cases, which made up about two-thirds of all cases,  DDTC\u2019s in-house processing times increased significantly. For example,  between fiscal years 2003 and 2006, median processing times for  nonreferred cases increased from 8 to 19 days. For the first 7 months of  fiscal year 2007, the median processing time was 17 days.

Our analysis shows that DDTC has taken increasingly longer to  refer cases. As shown in table 1, the median days from when the case was  received to outside referral increased from 7 days in fiscal year 2003 to 20  days during the first 7 months of fiscal year 2007. In contrast, the median  number of days cases spent outside of DDTC for referral has decreased  over the same period from 31 to 18 days.", "DDTC has not established procedures to promptly screen most cases to  identify those that need outside referral.

In making the decision to refer cases, the team considers such factors as  the existence of precedent cases, the level of technology, and the  circumstances of the transaction. According to DTSA officials, this  process allows them to expedite certain cases and to focus efforts on more  complicated cases involving commodities or capabilities not previously  exported or presenting special concerns. For referred cases, DTSA  officials told us the daily screening process allows them to make the  referral in less than 2 days on average.

For  example, in fiscal year 2006, median processing time for permanent export  cases submitted through D-Trade was 23 days versus 25 for paper  submissions. Although 77 percent of cases are now received electronically  through D-Trade, its implementation has been problematic and electronic  processing has not been the promised panacea for improving processing  times.", "According to DDTC officials, poorly defined system requirements and a  rush to production led to technical glitches and performance problems.  For example, in January 2007, DDTC released a new version of D-Trade,  but because of software problems, cases received could not be processed.  As a result, the new version was shut down after 3 days, requiring DDTC to  revert to the previous version. The 1,300 cases received during the 3-day  period had to be resubmitted by exporters, resulting in some rework and  an increase in the number of open cases.", "DDTC has relied on an information technology solution without  reengineering the underlying processes or without developing tools to  facilitate the licensing officer\u2019s job. In 2001, we reported information  systems that simply use technology to do the same work, the same way,  but only faster typically fail or reach only a fraction of their potential.  While defense industry officials told us that D-Trade simplifies the process  for submitting cases and receiving final authorizations, the system lacks  tools to aid licensing officers to process cases more efficiently. For  example, the system has limited capabilities to reference precedent cases  that would allow licensing officers to leverage work previously done on  similar cases.

According to these officials, in the summer of 2006,  about one-half of licensing officers had less than 1 year of experience, and  many did not have the signature authority needed to take final action on  cases. For example, early in 2007, one team had three licensing officers  but only the team leader had the authority to approve or deny cases.  Although the staff could perform research, the team leader had to review  all cases before final action could be taken.", "Staffing instabilities have also been affected by fluctuating levels of  military officers detailed to DDTC from DOD, who are generally assigned  to review agreements. The Foreign Relations Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2003 states the Secretary of Defense should ensure that 10 military  officers are continuously detailed to DDTC. However, the number of  officers DOD detailed to DDTC has fluctuated over recent years. In fiscal  year 2006, the number of military officers detailed to DDTC ranged from 3  to 7.
