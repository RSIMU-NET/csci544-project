Also, a World Bank report stated that total ransoms declined by 2012. Officials participating in counterpiracy activities from the Departments of Defense and State, among others, as well as shipping industry officials and international partners, attribute the decline to a combination of prevention, disruption, and prosecution activities. However, officials cautioned that this progress is tenuous, and discontinuing these efforts could allow piracy to resurge. Despite changing conditions, U.S. agencies have not systematically assessed the costs and benefits of their counterpiracy efforts. Agency officials stated that their decisions and actions are guided by discussions rather than formal assessments. GAO has previously noted that assessments of risk and effectiveness in an interagency environment can strengthen strategies and resource usage. As such, GAO's prior recommendations remain valid and could help U.S. agencies identify the most cost effective mix of efforts and prioritize activities as they respond to changing conditions and fiscal pressures while avoiding a resurgence in piracy.", "Off the west coast of Africa, piracy and maritime crime has been a persistent problem in the Gulf of Guinea, as shown in the figure below. Although the United States has interagency and international efforts underway with African states to strengthen maritime security, it has not assessed its efforts or the need for a collective plan to address the evolving problem in the region. The U.S. role in addressing piracy in the Gulf of Guinea has focused on prevention, disruption, and prosecution, through training and assistance to African coastal states. However, according to U.S. agencies working in the region, the National Security Council Staff (NSCS) has not directed them to collectively assess their efforts to address piracy and maritime crime.

In general, pirates hijack tankers and  their crew only for the time it takes to offload the oil.", "Vessel traffic: The nature of how vessels travel through the regions  also differs. Sea traffic off the Horn of Africa is characterized by large,  high-speed cargo vessels transiting through the Gulf of Aden and  Indian Ocean. Piracy in this region generally involves pirates pursuing  and boarding moving vessels. In contrast, in the Gulf of Guinea,  commercial vessels generally are smaller and operate closer to shore,  slowing down to make port calls and stopping at off-shore facilities in  territorial waters or in the exclusive economic zones of coastal states.  The slow speeds and stationary positions make these vessels  vulnerable to piracy and maritime crime.", "Jurisdiction and response: U.S. efforts to combat piracy off the Horn  of Africa and maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea evolved in response  to the particular characteristics of piracy and maritime crime in each  region and the extent to which the United States has jurisdiction and  coastal states have the capability to respond. For example, the UN  authorized international militaries and organizations to enter Somali  territorial waters and economic zones to conduct counterpiracy  operations and patrols as though they were international waters.

Examples of these ship protection measures  include providing additional lookouts during watch periods, enhancing the  ship\u2019s physical barrier, and establishing a safe point or secure citadel on  the ship to ensure the safety of the crew and vessel during a pirate  boarding.

The Action Plan was developed  to identify and implement measures to suppress pirate activity off the  Horn of Africa. Its intent was to respond to the growing threat and be  mutually supportive of longer-term initiatives aimed at establishing  governance, rule of law, security, and economic development in Somalia.  In September 2010, we reviewed the Action Plan, which implements the  National Strategy for Maritime Security and the Policy for the  Repression of Piracy and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea as  applied to piracy off the Horn of Africa. At that time, we found that the  Action Plan had not been revised to reflect adapted piracy tactics and did  not designate which agencies should lead or carry out most activities.  Additionally, we found that the National Security Council Staff (NSCS) did  not fully include characteristics of a strategic approach in the Action Plan,  such as measures to evaluate the effectiveness of U.S. resources applied  to counterpiracy, the identification of roles and responsibilities, or the cost  of U.S. activities relative to the benefits they achieved.", "As a result, in September 2010 we recommended that the NSCS, in  collaboration with the Secretaries of Defense, State, Homeland Security,  Transportation, and the Treasury, as well as the Attorney General: (1)  reassess and revise the Action Plan to better address evolving conditions  off the Horn of Africa and their effect on priorities and plans; (2) identify  measures of effectiveness to use in evaluating U.S. counterpiracy efforts;  (3) direct the Counter-Piracy Steering Group to identify the costs of U.S.  counterpiracy efforts including operational, support, and personnel costs;  and assess the benefits, and effectiveness of U.S. counterpiracy  activities; and (4) clarify agency roles and responsibilities and develop  joint guidance, information-sharing mechanisms, and other means to  operate across agency boundaries for implementing key efforts such as  strategic communication, disrupting pirate revenue, and facilitating   Since we issued our report in 2010, conditions have  prosecution. continued to change off the Horn of Africa in many ways since the Action  Plan was developed in 2008.

In September 2010, we recommended that the NSCS  update the Action Plan because piracy was increasing and pirate tactics were  changing. Since that time, conditions have continued to evolve off the Horn of  Africa. Industry has made frequent use of embarked armed security teams. An  internationally-recognized Somali federal government was established in August  2012 and responsibility for strategic communication was transferred to it. Piracy  declined sharply in 2012 and 2013. EU NAVFOR and NATO counterpiracy  operations off the Horn of Africa are set to expire by the end of 2016. State officials  recognize that an updated Action Plan is needed and have provided input to the  NSCS, but as of March 2014 they had not received guidance from the NSCS  regarding any changes to counterpiracy plans or efforts. In commenting on a draft of  this report, an NSCS official stated that a global action plan is being developed, with  a separate annex focusing on the Horn of Africa and was expected to be issued in  the summer of 2014.", "Measures not established to assess counter piracy efforts. In September 2010, we  recommended that the NSCS include measures of effectiveness in the Action Plan  to provide direction for counterpiracy activities and information that could be used in  strategic and resource-based decisions. During the course of this review, State  officials told us the key measures are the number of hostages and ships hijacked,  but they have not established formal measures and their decisions are generally  guided by discussions rather than formal assessments. However, this information  does not provide insight into which efforts are having the greatest effect in  suppressing piracy.", "U.S. counterpiracy costs and benefits not fully tracked. In September 2010, we  reported that the United States is not collecting information to determine the most  cost-effective mix of counterpiracy activities. During the course of this review, we  obtained information from agencies identifying some costs related to their  counterpiracy efforts. For example, the costs of counterpiracy efforts incurred by  DOD peaked in 2011 at approximately $275 million but have declined to  approximately $70 million in 2013. State tracks funds used to operate its  counterpiracy and maritime security functions, as well as foreign assistance  provided to African countries. However, most agencies do not systematically track  the costs of counterpiracy efforts or activities because these efforts and activities  typically fall under a broader maritime security category. Further, the Counter-Piracy  Steering Group has not identified the benefits of the various counterpiracy activities  relative to their costs and resources.", "Agency roles and responsibilities defined for some tasks. In September 2010, we  reported that agencies had made less progress in implementing action items in the  Action Plan that involved multiple agencies than those that were the responsibility of  one specific agency. Since that time, U.S. agencies have defined roles and  responsibilities for applying the Maritime Operational Threat Response (MOTR)  process to piracy incidents involving U.S. interests. DOJ officials stated that the  NSCS has also identified roles and responsibilities for transporting pirate suspects  for prosecution. However, the NSCS has not established roles and responsibilities  across all activities outlined in the Action Plan.", "Plan contains operational coordination requirements to ensure quick and decisive action to counter  maritime threats.", "In commenting on a draft of this report, an NSCS official stated that  the Action Plan is being updated through a global action plan, with a  separate annex focusing on the Horn of Africa, but did not indicate  whether the plan would include all of the elements in our  recommendations. We continue to believe our recommendations have  merit and should be implemented. While conditions affecting piracy  have continued to evolve in the Horn of Africa since 2010, the 2008  Action Plan continues to guide U.S. efforts. Officials from each of the  six agencies engaged in counterpiracy activities noted that current  efforts are suppressing piracy off the Horn of Africa, but the results  are tenuous and piracy could resurge without addressing its root  causes. The Action Plan was developed at a time when U.S. policy  focused on addressing problems in the absence of a functioning  government in Somalia and without involving a U.S. presence in the  country. With U.S. agencies and industry both having limited  resources available for counterpiracy activities, we continue to believe  that implementing our recommendations would be of value in  understanding the costs and benefits and measuring the effectiveness  of U.S. counterpiracy efforts. DOD, Coast Guard, DOJ, and State  officials, as well as shipping industry officials, noted that the  suppression of piracy has been based on a combination of  government and industry counterpiracy activities, particularly the use  of armed security teams on private vessels and the presence of naval  patrols. However, U.S. agencies do not assess how industry practices  and government resources could potentially offset each other\u2019s roles  and associated costs.

According to this data, incidents in 2013 included 11 vessel hijackings  and 32 kidnappings. According to officials from AFRICOM, ONI, State,  and the IMO, this recent rise in piracy and maritime crime in the Gulf of  Guinea is part of a long-standing, persistent problem in the region. For  example, according to DOD officials, the Gulf of Guinea was the most  active region in the world for piracy in 2007, prior to the rise in pirate  activity off the Horn of Africa. According to the IMB, the number of vessel- reported incidents in the Gulf of Guinea from 2007 through 2009 is similar  to that of 2011 through 2013.

For example,  according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, while Nigeria  has the second largest amount of proven crude oil reserves in Africa, as  of December 2013, exploration activity there was at its lowest levels in a  decade as a result of rising security problems related to oil theft, onshore  pipeline sabotage, and piracy and maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea,  as well as other investment and government uncertainties.", "Moreover, incident data since 2010 shows that piracy is moving farther off  shore, prompting concerns that these trends may continue. According to  officials from AFRICOM, ONI, and State, and according to IMB data as  shown in figure 2 of this report, Gulf of Guinea piracy and maritime crime  prior to 2011 have generally occurred in the coastal areas near Lagos or  off the Niger Delta. However, recent attacks have taken place farther  away from the waters off Nigeria, demonstrating a broader reach of  pirates, as well as increasing the number of coastal states involved. For  example, since 2011, several tanker hijackings were reported farther west  than previously observed, off Togo and Cote d\u2019Ivoire, according to ONI  officials. Further, a July 2013 tanker hijacking off the coast of Gabon, and  a similar incident off Angola in January 2014 represent, as of March 2014,  the southernmost occurrences in which vessels were hijacked and sailed  to Nigeria to offload the stolen oil cargo. According to AFRICOM officials,  the ability to conduct such hijackings, which involve difficult maneuvering  of large vessels across swaths of open water while conducting oil  bunkering operations, illustrates that these maritime criminals may be  increasingly capable of complex and long-range operations.", "In the context of this report and data reported by ONI and IMB, kidnappings refer to  those that have occurred, or were reported to have occurred. According to ONI and  AFRICOM officials, such incidents would include scenarios in which oil industry personnel  or others were kidnapped from offshore supply vessels or platforms and held for ransom,  such as the case of the two U.S. oil industry personnel taken from the C-Retriever in  October 2013 off the coast of Nigeria. However, according to AFRICOM and Naval  Forces\u2013Africa officials, kidnappings conducted against the oil industry, including those  perpetrated by Nigerian militants over the last decade, also include onshore kidnappings,  or kidnappings within the inland waters and river ways of the Niger Delta.

All U.S. officials we spoke with agreed that while the establishment of  the Contact Group for the Horn of Africa was helpful in the absence of  a functioning Somali government, in the case of the Gulf of Guinea,  solutions must emerge from the region itself, and the role of the  international community is to support and promote African-led  initiatives. For example, the U.S., through DOD and State, has  supported and facilitated the efforts of the two relevant African  economic communities\u2014the Economic Community of West African  States (ECOWAS), and the Economic Community of Central African  States (ECCAS)\u2014to develop and lead efforts to prevent and suppress  piracy.

DOD and State officials emphasized that U.S. efforts  are then developed in consideration of the particular contexts of each  region. In the case of Somalia, the surge and intensity of the rising piracy  problem, the specific nature of the crime, and the absence of a  functioning government presented a crisis that warranted collective  international action, as well as a U.S. plan to guide its contribution to this  response. Alternatively, State, DOD, and Coast Guard officials we spoke  with explained that because the context of maritime crime in the Gulf of  Guinea, and thereby the U.S. efforts there, encompass a broader set of  geopolitical issues and maritime crimes, creating a piracy-focused plan  similar to the Action Plan in the Horn of Africa may not be appropriate.", "While there is not a whole-of-government plan to guide maritime security  efforts in the Gulf of Guinea, DOD, State, Coast Guard, and others  continue to expand and coordinate their maritime security activities there,  which range from individual boarding team trainings to broad judicial  sector reform.

We  discussed data-collection methods, processes for data entry, and the  steps taken to ensure the reliability of the data with both IMB and ONI  officials. We collected information from both IMB and ONI on their  processes for quality control, data verification, and how potential errors  are identified and corrected. We also discussed variation between IMB  and ONI data with officials from ONI and other Department of Defense  (DOD) organizations, the Department of State (State), and IMB, who  attributed differences in categorization of incidents, validation of sources,  and geographic scope to the variation. Officials stated that while values  between ONI and IMB data may differ, IMB is a generally accepted data  source for tracking global piracy incidents and suitably reflects general   We determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the  historical trends.purposes of describing the context, trends, and scope of pirate attacks off  the Horn of Africa in this report. In addition, we met with U.S. agency  officials, international partners, and representatives from insurance,  shipping, and private security industry associations to discuss their  involvement in counterpiracy activities such as developing best practices  for protecting ships from pirate attack, working with the international  Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, and participating in  naval patrols off the Horn of Africa. We met with officials from shipping  industry associations that represent owners and operators from over 80  percent of the world\u2019s merchant fleet and provide a unified industry voice  in the creation of industry policy and strategy; insurance industry  associations whose members cover approximately 90 percent of the  world\u2019s ocean-going tonnage; and a private security industry association  that has over 180 members across 35 countries. While the statements of  these industry officials cannot be generalized to the entire industries they  represent, their perspectives provide valuable insight since each is  actively involved in international collaborative efforts to combat piracy. To  determine the extent to which the U.S. has assessed its counterpiracy  actions as outlined in the 2008 Countering Piracy off the Horn of Africa:  Partnership and Action Plan (Action Plan), we reviewed the Action Plan,  the 2005 National Strategy for Maritime Security, the 2007 Policy for the  Repression of Piracy and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea, relevant  U.S. policies and laws, and United Nations Security Council resolutions.  We also reviewed program documents including briefings and meeting  summaries and interviewed officials from DOD, State, and the  Departments of Homeland Security (DHS), Justice (DOJ), Transportation  (DOT), and the Treasury, including components such as U.S. Naval  Forces \u2013 Central Command, the U.S. Coast Guard, and the Federal  Bureau of Investigation (FBI), to discuss implementation of the Action Plan and the status of our 2010 recommendations to improve the plan.We selected these departments and agencies because the Action Plan  states they shall contribute to, coordinate, and undertake initiatives in  accordance with the plan.", "To identify trends in piracy and maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea we  analyzed IMB data on actual and attempted piracy incidents from 2007  through 2013, and ONI data from 2010 through 2013. As with the IMB  and ONI data pertaining to the Horn of Africa, we collected information on  the quality control, verification, and safeguards from error and discussed  the reliability of the data with officials from IMB, ONI, and State officials  involved in maritime security initiatives in the Gulf of Guinea and  determined the data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Because ONI data on the Gulf of Guinea is unavailable prior to  2010 we chose to present the IMB data from 2007 through 2013  alongside the ONI data to show trends over a broader period. In addition  to data, we reviewed publicly available reports and documents regarding  maritime security and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea from the United Nations  Office on Drugs and Crime, the EU, and other multilateral and  nongovernmental organizations. To evaluate U.S. efforts to address  piracy and maritime crime in the Gulf of Guinea, as well as the extent to  which the U.S. has assessed the need for a strategic approach for the  region, we reviewed relevant U.S. and international policies and laws,  such as the 2005 National Strategy for Maritime Security, 2007 Policy for  the Repression of Piracy and other Criminal Acts of Violence at Sea, the  2008 Action Plan, the 2012 Strategy toward Sub-Saharan Africa, and  United Nations Security Council resolutions pertaining to the Gulf of  Guinea. We also compared agency efforts with U.S. policy priorities and  requirements for conducting assessments outlined in the 2011 Strategy to  Combat Transnational Organized Crime and the 2013 National Maritime  Domain Awareness Plan, documents that guide U.S. maritime security  efforts, including in the Gulf of Guinea."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Department of Defense", "paragraphs": ["Office of the General Counsel; Office of the Undersecretary of  Defense for Policy, Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Counter-Narcotics and Global Threats; and the Joint Staff  J5 Strategic Plans and Policy Directorate", "Department of the Navy, as well as the Naval Criminal Investigative  Service, and the Office of Naval Intelligence", "U.S. Africa Command (Germany) and its components U.S. Naval  Forces \u2013 Africa and Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa", "U.S. Central Command and its component U.S. Naval Forces \u2013  Central Command (Bahrain)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of State", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Coast Guard offices, including the National Defense Strategy  Division, Maritime Security (Counterterrorism) Division, Office of  International Affairs and Foreign Policy; Office of Commercial Vessel  Compliance; Office of Budget and Programs; and the Intelligence  Coordination Center", "U.S. Coast Guard representatives at other agencies, including U.S.", "Africa Command (Germany) and Patrol Forces Southwest Asia  (Bahrain)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Justice", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of Transportation", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Department of the Treasury", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Government and Multilateral Organizations include:", "paragraphs": ["European Union Naval Forces (United Kingdom)", "Combined Maritime Forces (Bahrain)", "Shared Awareness and Deconfliction Meeting (observed in Bahrain)", "North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the NATO Shipping  International Maritime Organization (United Kingdom)", "Centre (United Kingdom)", "United Kingdom Foreign & Commonwealth Office (United Kingdom)"], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Industry Partners and Nongovernmental Organizations include:", "paragraphs": ["Baltic and International Maritime Council (BIMCO)", "Center for Strategic and International Studies", "Chamber of Shipping of America", "Lloyd\u2019s Market Association", "Maersk Line, Limited", "Oceans Beyond Piracy", "Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF)", "Royal Institute of International Affairs (Chatham House)", "Security Association for the Maritime Industry (SAMI)", "Society of International Gas Tanker and Terminal Operators Limited  International Association of Dry Cargo Shipowners (INTERCARGO)  International Association of Independent Tanker Owners  (INTERTANKO)  International Chamber of Shipping  International Group of P&I Clubs  International Maritime Bureau  International Transport Workers\u2019 Federation (ITF)  Japanese Shipowners\u2019 Association  (SIGTTO)", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2013 to June 2014 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
