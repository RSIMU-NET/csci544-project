Nonprime mortgage originations increased dramatically from 2000 through 2006, rising from about 12 percent ($125 billion) of all mortgage originations to about 34 percent ($1 trillion). The nonprime market contracted sharply in mid-2007, partly in response to increasing defaults and foreclosures for these loans. This report (1) provides information on the performance of nonprime loans through December 31, 2009; (2) examines how loan and borrower characteristics and economic conditions influenced the likelihood of default (including foreclosure) of nonprime loans; and (3) describes the features and limitations of primary sources of data on nonprime loan performance and borrower characteristics, and discusses federal government efforts to improve the availability or use of such data. To do this work, GAO analyzed a proprietary database of securitized nonprime loans and Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, and reviewed information on mortgage data sources maintained by private firms and the federal government."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of active nonprime loans originated from 2000 through 2007 that were seriously delinquent (90 or more days late or in the foreclosure process) increased from 1.1 million at the end of 2008 to 1.4 million at the end of 2009. Serious delinquency rates were higher for certain adjustable-rate products common in the subprime and Alt-A market segments than they were for fixed-rate products. The number of nonprime loans that were 90 or more days late grew throughout 2009, accounting for most of the overall growth in the number of serious delinquencies. By comparison, the number of active loans in the foreclosure process grew in the first half of the year, and then began to decline somewhat. Additionally, 475,000 nonprime mortgages completed the foreclosure process during 2009. The persistently weak performance of nonprime loans suggests that problems in the nonprime market will not be resolved quickly, and underscores the importance of federal efforts to assist distressed borrowers and prevent a recurrence of the aggressive lending practices that helped precipitate the foreclosure crisis. In addition to performance differences between mortgage products, GAO found across product types that house price changes, loan amount, the ratio of the amount of the loan to the value of the home, and borrower credit score were among the variables that influenced the likelihood of default on nonprime loans originated from 2004 through 2006. In addition, loans that lacked full documentation of borrower income and assets were associated with increased default probabilities, and the influence of borrowers' reported income varied with the level of documentation. GAO found that borrower race and ethnicity were associated with the probability of default, particularly for loans used to purchase rather than to refinance a home. However, these associations should be interpreted with caution because GAO lacks data on factors that may influence default rates and that may also be associated with race and ethnicity, such as borrower wealth and first-time homebuyer status. Existing sources of data on nonprime mortgages contain a range of information to support different uses. While these data sources offer some similar elements, they vary in their coverage of loan, property, and borrower attributes. The data sources generally lack information on certain attributes that could help inform policy decisions or regulatory efforts to mitigate risk. For example, first-time homebuyers are not identified in any of the data sources, limiting the ability of analysts to compare the marginal effect of prior homeownership experience on default probabilities. In addition, most of the data sources do not cover the entire nonprime mortgage market. Ongoing federal efforts have the potential to provide data that may not have some of the constraints of the existing sources. For example, officials from the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and Freddie Mac are collaborating on a pilot project to develop a publicly available National Mortgage Database, which would compile data on a representative sample of outstanding mortgages and provide more comprehensive data than are currently available."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes no recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The surge in mortgage foreclosures that began in late 2006 and continues  today was initially driven by deterioration in the performance of nonprime  (subprime and Alt-A) loans.

Furthermore, questions have been raised about whether timely access to  more comprehensive information on the nonprime mortgage market could  have helped federal banking regulators anticipate the foreclosure crisis or  respond to it more quickly and effectively.", "To inform congressional oversight and decision making about efforts to  address problems in the mortgage market, you requested that we examine  the evolution and condition of the nonprime market segment. In prior  reports, we discussed certain characteristics of nonprime loans and  borrowers; the performance of nonprime mortgages as of March 31, 2009,  and June 30, 2009; the extent of negative equity among nonprime  borrowers in selected metropolitan areas and nationwide as of June 30,  2009; and the proportion of nonprime borrowers with negative equity and  seriously delinquent loans, by state, from 2006 through 2009. This report  (1) provides information on the performance of nonprime loans through  December 31, 2009; (2) examines how loan and borrower characteristics  and economic conditions influenced the likelihood of default and  foreclosure of nonprime loans; and (3) describes the features and  limitations of primary sources of data on nonprime loan performance and  borrower characteristics, and discusses federal government efforts to  improve the availability or use of such data.

The CoreLogic LP database contains loan-level data on a large  majority of nonagency securitized mortgages in subprime and Alt-A pools.", "For the purposes of our analysis, we defined a subprime loan as a loan in a  subprime pool and an Alt-A loan as a loan in an Alt-A pool. We focused  our analysis on first-lien purchase and refinance mortgages for one- to  four-family residential units. For the nonprime market as a whole, and for  the subprime and Alt-A market segments, we calculated the number and  percentage of nonprime mortgages that were in different performance  categories\u2014for example, current (up to date on payments); delinquent   (30 to 89 days behind); in default (90 or more days behind); in the  foreclosure process; or having completed the foreclosure process\u2014at the  end of each quarter from December 31, 2008, through December 31, 2009,  the most recent quarterly data that we could analyze within the time frame  of our review. We classified mortgages in default or in the foreclosure  process as \u201cseriously delinquent.\u201d We also examined mortgage  performance as of December 31, 2009, by loan cohort; product type; and  geographic areas, including Census divisions, states, and congressional  districts. These latter analyses are reported in detail in the electronic  supplement to this report.", "To analyze the influence of loan and borrower characteristics and  economic conditions on the performance of nonprime loans, we  developed a statistical model to estimate the relationship between relevant  variables and the probability of loan default or foreclosure within 24  months after the borrower\u2019s first payment. We define a loan as being in  default or foreclosure if it was delinquent by at least 90 days, in the  foreclosure process (including loans identified as in real-estate-owned  status), paid off after being 90-days delinquent or in foreclosure, or already  terminated with evidence of a loss. We analyzed nonprime loans originated  from 2004 to 2006, using records from the CoreLogic LP database that we  matched to records in the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA)  database compiled by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination  Council (FFIEC) from information reported by lenders. Combining the  information in these two data sources yielded a data set with loan-level  information on loan characteristics (mortgage type and key mortgage  terms); loan performance (payment status at particular times); and certain  borrower characteristics (such as borrower race, ethnicity, reported  income, and credit score). In addition, we used the Federal Housing  Finance Agency\u2019s (FHFA) house price indexes (HPI) for metropolitan  areas to incorporate data on house price appreciation. We also used  employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and Census  tract-level data from the 2000 Census to control for various economic  conditions and neighborhood characteristics. Appendix I contains  additional information on the methodology for this statistical model.", "To identify sources of data on nonprime loans and borrowers, we  reviewed research literature on mortgage markets and interviewed  knowledgeable private sector and federal agency officials. For data  sources that are national in scope, provide loan-level information on  nonprime loans, and are widely available for free or a fee, we reviewed  database documentation and related research and interviewed agency and  company officials to determine the scope and features of each data source.  We also collected and reviewed similar documentation for data on loans  insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s (HUD)  Federal Housing Administration (FHA) because borrowers served by FHA  earlier in the decade had some similar characteristics to subprime  borrowers. We also used our review of documentation and research and  interviews to identify limitations in data availability and federal  government efforts to address them or to improve the use of such data.", "We tested the reliability of the data used in this report by reviewing  documentation on the process that the data providers use to collect and  ensure the reliability and integrity of their data, and by conducting  reasonableness checks on data elements to identify any missing,  erroneous, or outlying data.

Specific types of ARMs are  prevalent in each market segment. \u201cShort-term hybrid ARMs\u201d accounted  for 70 percent of subprime mortgage originations from 2000 through 2007  (see fig. 1). These loans have a fixed interest rate for an initial period (2 or  3 years) but then \u201creset\u201d to an adjustable rate for the remaining term of the  loan. In the Alt-A segment, \u201cpayment-option ARMs\u201d are a common  adjustable-rate product, accounting for 17 percent of Alt-A mortgage  originations from 2000 through 2007. For an initial period of typically   5 years, or until the loan balance reaches a specified cap, this product  provides the borrower with multiple payment options each month,  including minimum payments that are lower than what would be needed  to cover any of the principal or all of the accrued interest. After the initial  period, payments are \u201crecast\u201d to include an amount that will fully amortize  the outstanding balance over the remaining loan term.", "Several payment categories describe the performance of mortgages,  including nonprime mortgages:    Current: The borrower is meeting scheduled payments.", "Delinquent: The borrower is 30 to 89 days behind in scheduled payments.", "Default: The borrower is 90 days or more delinquent. At this point,  foreclosure proceedings against the borrower become a strong possibility.", "In the foreclosure process: The borrower has been delinquent for more  than 90 days, and the lender has elected to foreclose in what is often a  lengthy process. The loan is considered active during the foreclosure  process.", "Completed the foreclosure process: The borrower\u2019s loan terminates and  foreclosure proceedings end with one of several possible outcomes. For  example, the borrower may sell the property or the lender may repossess  the home.", "Prepaid: The borrower has paid off the entire loan balance before it is  due. Prepayment often occurs as a result of the borrower selling the home  or refinancing into a new mortgage.", "In this report, we describe mortgages in default or in the foreclosure  process as \u201cseriously delinquent.\u201d", "As we have stated in previous reports, a combination of falling house  prices, aggressive lending practices, and weak economic conditions have  contributed to the increase in troubled mortgages. For example, in 2009,  we noted that falling house prices had left a substantial proportion of  nonprime borrowers in a negative equity position\u2014that is, their mortgage  balances exceeded the current value of their homes\u2014limiting their ability  to sell or refinance their homes in the event they could not stay current on  their mortgage payments. Additionally, we reported that an easing of  underwriting standards and wider use of certain loan features associated  with poorer loan performance contributed to increases in mortgage  delinquencies and foreclosures. These features included mortgages with  higher loan-to-value (LTV) ratios (the amount of the loan divided by the  value of the home at loan origination), adjustable interest rates, limited or  no documentation of borrower income or assets, and deferred payment of  principal or interest. Also, in some cases, mortgage originators engaged in  questionable sales practices that resulted in loans with onerous terms and  conditions that made repayment more difficult for some borrowers.  Furthermore, rising unemployment has contributed to mortgage defaults  and foreclosures because job loss directly affects a borrower\u2019s ability to  make mortgage payments.", "The foreclosure crisis has imposed significant costs on borrowers,  neighborhoods, and taxpayers. For example, vacant and foreclosed  properties have contributed to neighborhood blight and reduced property  values in many communities. Additionally, foreclosures affecting minority  populations and the high incidence of subprime lending to members of  these groups have heightened concerns that these groups have received  disparate treatment in mortgage lending. In light of these costs and  concerns, Congress and federal agencies have taken a number of steps to  address and prevent a recurrence of ongoing problems in the mortgage  market. These efforts include programs to modify or refinance the loans of  distressed borrowers and legislation to strengthen mortgage-lending  standards and prevent mortgage originators from steering borrowers into  high-risk or high-cost mortgages."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Nonprime Loan Performance Deteriorated through the End of 2009 and Varied by Market Segment, Product Type, Cohort Year, and Location", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Worsening Performance of Nonprime Loans Was Reflected in Increases in Serious Delinquencies", "paragraphs": ["As of December 31, 2009, 63 percent of the 14.50 million nonprime loans  originated from 2000 through 2007 (the last year in which substantial  numbers of nonprime mortgages were made) was no longer active.

As we stated in a previous report, serious delinquency  rates were higher for certain adjustable-rate products common in the  subprime and Alt-A market segments than they were for fixed-rate  products or the market as a whole. Although many nonprime borrowers  with adjustable-rate loans fell behind on their mortgages before their  payments increased, the higher serious delinquency rates for these  products may partly reflect the difficulties some borrowers had in making  their payments when their interest rates reset to higher levels or when  their monthly payments recast to fully amortizing amounts. In the  subprime market segment, the serious delinquency rate for short-term  hybrid ARMs was 48 percent at the end of 2009, compared with 21 percent  for fixed-rate mortgages and 36 percent for all active subprime loans (see  fig. 5).

In addition, borrowers who purchased homes but came to  owe more than the properties were worth, had incentives to stop making  mortgage payments to minimize their financial losses.

With that in mind, we found that for purchase and  refinance loans of all product types, lower rates of employment growth  were associated with somewhat higher estimated default probabilities. For  example, for short-term hybrid ARM purchase loans, moving from a 4  percent employment growth rate over 24 months to a zero percent  employment growth rate was associated with about a 1 percentage point  increase in estimated default probabilities.

A similar pattern held across  product types, with a larger effect for purchase loans than refinance loans.", "CLTV ratio: For each product type and loan purpose, we estimated the  default probability assuming a CLTV ratio close to the 25th percentile for  that product and purpose and compared this with the estimated default  probability assuming a CLTV ratio close to the 75th percentile for that  product and purpose. For short-term hybrid ARMs used for home  purchases, moving from a CLTV ratio between 80 and 90 percent to a  CLTV ratio of 100 percent or more was associated with a 10 percentage  point increase in estimated default probability, all else being equal (see  fig. 9). For short-term hybrid ARMs used for refinancing, moving from a  CLTV ratio of less than 80 percent to a CLTV ratio of 90 percent was  associated with a 7 percentage point increase in estimated default  probability. For the other product types, the effects of increasing the CLTV  ratio were smaller for both purchase and refinance loans.", "Borrower credit score: For each product type and loan purpose, we  estimated the default probability assuming a borrower credit score near  the 75th percentile for that product and purpose and compared this with  the estimated default probability assuming a loan amount near the 25th  percentile for that product and purpose. For short-term hybrid ARMs used  for home purchases, moving from the higher credit score to the lower one  was associated with a 10 percentage point increase in estimated default  probability, all else being equal (see fig. 9). For the other product types  (whether for home purchase or refinancing), the effects were smaller.", "We also found that the difference between the loan\u2019s initial interest rate  and the relevant interest rate index (interest rate spread) had a significant  influence on estimated default probabilities, which is generally consistent  with other economic research showing a positive relationship between  higher interest rates and default probabilities for nonprime mortgages.  Across product types and loan purposes, the interest rate spread had a  statistically significant influence on estimated default probabilities. For  example, for short-term hybrid ARMs, moving from a spread of 3.0 percent  (near the 25th percentile for that product) to a spread of 4.5 percent (near  the 75th percentile) was associated with about a 4 percentage point  increase in default probability for purchase and refinance loans, all other  things being equal.", "We also estimated the effect of the debt-service-to-income (DTI) ratio at  origination and found that for all product types, this variable did not have  a strong influence on the probability of default within 24 months. This  relatively weak association, based on the DTI ratio at origination, could  differ from the impact of changes to the DTI ratio after origination due, in  part, to changes in borrower income or indebtedness. For example, a  mortgage that is affordable to the borrower at origination may become  less so if the borrower experiences a decline in income or takes on  additional nonmortgage debt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Level of Income Documentation Influenced Default Probabilities, and Associations between Income and Defaults Varied by Product Type, Loan Purpose, and Documentation Level", "paragraphs": ["Loans originated with limited documentation of borrowers\u2019 income or  assets became prevalent in the nonprime mortgage market, particularly in  the Alt-A market segment. We found that documentation of borrower  income and assets influenced the probability of default of nonprime loans  originated from 2004 through 2006. For purchase and refinance loans of all  product types, limited documentation of income and assets was associated  with a 1 to 3 percentage point increase in the estimated probability of  default, all other things being equal. Our results are generally consistent  with prior research showing an association between a lack of  documentation and higher default probabilities.", "Because our data indicated that borrowers with full documentation loans  had different reported risk characteristics (e.g., credit score, CLTV ratio,  and reported income) than borrowers with limited documentation loans,  we more closely explored the relationship between documentation level  and default for short-term hybrid ARMs (the most common nonprime  product) taking these differences into account. On average, short-term  hybrid ARM purchase loans with limited documentation went to  borrowers with higher credit scores, higher reported incomes, and  somewhat lower CLTV ratios, compared with borrowers who had full  documentation loans. To account for these differences, we estimated  default probabilities separately for borrowers with full and limited  documentation loans, using the mean credit score, reported income, and  CLTV ratio values specific to each group. Using this method, the expected  default probability for the limited documentation group was 3 percentage  points lower than for the full documentation group, reflecting their better  reported risk characteristics. However, in reality, borrowers with limited  documentation loans had a 5 percentage point higher default rate than  borrowers with full documentation loans. The differences between the  estimated and actual default probabilities for these borrowers suggest that  the reported risk characteristics\u2014particularly income\u2014may be misstated,  or that other unobserved factors may be associated with the use of the  limited documentation feature. For example, mortgage originators or  borrowers may have used the limited documentation feature in some cases  to overstate the financial resources of borrowers and qualify them for  larger, potentially unaffordable loans. In addition, borrowers who used the  feature could have experienced decreases in their income after loan  origination, thereby making it more difficult for them to stay current on  their payments.", "We also found that the influence of borrowers\u2019 reported income varied by  product type and loan purpose and, in some cases, depended on whether  the loan had full documentation. For example, for short-term hybrid ARMs  used for home purchases and refinancing, moving from $60,000 to  $100,000 in reported income was associated with an 1 percentage point  decrease in the estimated default probability for loans with full  documentation, all else being equal (see fig. 10). However, for loans with  limited documentation, the same change in reported income was  associated with a slight increase (0.2 percentage points) in estimated  default probability for purchase loans and a small decrease  (0.5 percentage points) for refinance loans. For fixed-rate mortgages used  for purchase and refinancing, moving from $60,000 to $100,000 in reported  income was associated with small decreases in estimated default  probabilities for both full and limited documentation loans, although the  decreases were slightly smaller for loans with limited documentation. For  longer-term ARMs, moving from the lower to the higher income level  generally did not affect the estimated default probabilities for purchase or  refinance loans, regardless of the level of documentation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Associations between Race and Ethnicity and the Likelihood of Default Varied by Product Type and Loan Purpose, but Other Unobserved Variables May Help to Explain these Associations", "paragraphs": ["Some researchers and market observers have noted that the foreclosure  crisis has hit minority borrowers particularly hard. We found that, for  certain product types and loan purposes, reported race and ethnicity were  associated with the probability of default for nonprime mortgages. Not  controlling for other variables, black or African-American borrowers had  higher 24-month default rates across product types than white borrowers,  especially for purchase loans. For example, for short-term hybrid ARMs,  black or African-American borrowers had about a 12 percentage point  higher default rate than white borrowers for purchase loans and about a  2 percentage point higher default rate for refinance loans (see fig. 11).  Additionally, Hispanic or Latino borrowers (of all races) generally had  higher default rates than (non-Hispanic) white borrowers. For example,  Hispanic or Latino borrowers had about an 8 percentage point higher  default rate than white borrowers for short-term hybrid ARM purchase  loans and about a 2 percentage point higher default rate for refinance  loans. For fixed-rate refinance loans, however, Hispanic borrowers had  essentially the same default rate as white borrowers.", "Various factors may help to explain some of the observed differences in  the default rates between racial and ethnic groups. Across product types,  black or African-American borrowers had lower average credit scores and  reported incomes than white and Hispanic or Latino borrowers. Also,  black or African-American borrowers generally were more likely than  white borrowers to have CLTV ratios of 90 percent or more. For short- term hybrid ARMs and longer-term ARMs, black or African-American and  Hispanic or Latino borrowers were less likely to have loans that originated  in 2004, when house price appreciation was still strong in many parts of  the country. In addition, Hispanic or Latino borrowers had a higher  incidence of limited documentation loans and were concentrated in  California, where house price declines in a number of areas were  particularly severe.", "Controlling for these variations, we found that the differences in estimated  default probabilities by racial and ethnic group were still significant but  considerably smaller than the actual observed differences (i.e., the  differences without the statistical controls in place). Taking short-term  hybrid ARMs used for home purchases as an example, when we estimated  default probabilities by racial and ethnic group holding the other variables  in our model to the mean values for each group, we found that the  estimated default probability for black or African-American borrowers  was about 7 percentage points higher than for white borrowers, compared  with the observed 12 percentage point difference that we have previously  discussed (see fig. 12). Using the same assumptions, the corresponding  default probability for Hispanic or Latino borrowers was about  4 percentage points higher than for white borrowers. For short-term  hybrid ARMs used for refinancing, black or African-American borrowers  had only about a 1 percentage point higher estimated default probability  than white borrowers, while Hispanic or Latino borrowers had about the  d about the  same estimated default probability as white borrowers.  same estimated default probability as white borrowers.", "Inferences drawn from these statistical results should be viewed with  caution because we lack data for variables that may help to explain the  remaining differences in estimated default probabilities between  borrowers of different racial and ethnic groups. Unobserved factors that  may influence the likelihood of default may also be associated with race  and ethnicity. For example:    First-time homebuyer: We could not determine which nonprime  borrowers were first-time homebuyers, but other evidence suggests that  members of minority groups are disproportionately first-time  homebuyers. To the extent that black or African-American and Hispanic  or Latino borrowers with purchase loans were disproportionately first- time homebuyers, their higher estimated default probabilities may partly  reflect limited experience with the risks and costs of homeownership. As  shown in figure 12, we found that the differences in estimated default rates  between racial and ethnic groups were much smaller for nonprime  refinance loans\u2014which, by definition, exclude first-time homebuyers\u2014 than they were for purchase loans.", "Employment status: We did not have data on the employment status of  nonprime borrowers, but unemployment rates are generally higher for  black or African-American and Hispanic or Latino workers than for white  workers.  The higher estimated default probabilities that we found for  black or African-American and Hispanic or Latino borrowers may reflect  that nonprime borrowers from minority groups were disproportionately  affected by unemployment in recent years.", "Wealth: Although we obtained data on reported income by matching  CoreLogic LP and HMDA records, we did not have information on  nonprime borrowers\u2019 savings or other assets, which may affect their ability  to keep up with their mortgage payments if faced with job loss or other  unexpected changes in income or expenses. However, according to the  Survey of Consumer Finances, nonwhite and Hispanic families generally  are less likely to save or hold financial assets than non-Hispanic white  families. Furthermore, the median value of assets for nonwhite and  Hispanic families having financial assets is dramatically less than for non- Hispanic white families.", "Origination channel or lender steering to higher-cost or riskier loans:  We did not have data on whether the nonprime loans were originated by  mortgage brokers (intermediaries between borrowers and lenders) or  directly by a lender\u2019s retail branch, or how the loans were marketed to the  borrowers. Some evidence suggests that broker-originated loans were  associated with higher default rates and that, at least in some markets,  minority families were more likely to access the mortgage market through  brokers rather than through retail lenders. In addition, some researchers  and market observers have raised concerns that some nonprime loan  originators used questionable marketing tactics in lower-income and  minority neighborhoods. Such practices may have led borrowers to take  out higher-cost or riskier loans than necessary, which may have increased  their probability of default."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Available Nonprime Mortgage Data Sources Provide Useful Information but Have Constraints That May Be Addressed, in Part, by Ongoing Efforts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Several Private and Public Sector Data Sources Cover Nonprime Loans", "paragraphs": ["Mortgage market participants, financial regulators, investors, and public  policy analysts use mortgage data for a variety of purposes.

For example, in a 2009 report, we  used loan-level mortgage data to assess the implications of proposed  mortgage reform legislation on consumer protections and on the  availability of mortgage credit. Existing sources of data on nonprime  mortgages contain a range of information to support these different uses.  Loan-level data with broad national coverage of the nonprime market  segment are available from several sources: four mortgage databases  (three maintained by private firms and one by the federal government) and  two major credit reporting agencies.

Accordingly, the HMDA  data provide relatively detailed information about mortgage borrowers but  no information about the performance of the loans.

First, the data sources generally  lack information on certain attributes that could help inform policy  decisions or regulatory efforts to mitigate risk, including the following:    Loan attributes: Although three of the five nonprime data sources provide  information on the initial interest rates of the mortgages (and, in some  cases, how those interest rates can change over the life of the loan), they  do not provide information on other mortgage costs, such as points and  fees paid at loan closing. For example, one study that found no evidence  of adverse pricing of subprime loans by race, ethnicity, or gender noted  that an important caveat to the analysis was the lack of data on points and  fees. Consequently, data users have limited ability to evaluate the  influence of loan costs on default probabilities or to examine fair lending  concerns regarding loan pricing. In addition, while the CoreLogic LP LLS  and LPS Loan Level Data databases indicate whether a mortgage was  originated by a broker or directly by a lender\u2019s retail branch, the other data  sources do not. As we have previously noted, some research has suggested  associations between origination channel and mortgage performance.", "Borrower attributes: A number of borrower characteristics that may be  associated with default risk generally does not appear in the nonprime  data sources we reviewed. For example, first-time homebuyers are not  directly identified in any of the nonprime data sources, limiting the ability  of analysts to compare the marginal effect of prior homeownership  experience on default probabilities. (By comparison, SFDW identifies first- time homebuyers with FHA-insured mortgages and contains data on loan  performance.) In addition, none of the nonprime data sources contain  information on borrower wealth (savings and other assets), a factor that  could affect a borrower\u2019s ability to continue making mortgage payments in  times of economic stress. With the exception of the credit reporting  agencies, the data sources also do not always directly provide information  on the amount of borrowers\u2019 other mortgage debt (second liens), which  may constrain accurate assessment of the relationship between home  equity and default. Similarly, data on nonmortgage credit obligations are  unavailable, except from the credit reporting agencies, which may limit  researchers\u2019 understanding of how borrowers\u2019 total debt burden affects  the mortgages they obtain and their ability to meet mortgage obligations.  Also, the data sources lack information on borrower life events that may  influence the probability of mortgage default, such as job loss or divorce.", "A second type of constraint is that analysts may not be able to generalize  their results to the entire nonprime market because certain data sources  do not cover all segments of the market and some mortgage originators,  securitizers, or servicers do not contribute information. For example, the  CoreLogic LP ABS database contains information on a large majority of  nonprime mortgages that were securitized but not those that lenders hold  in their portfolios. As we have previously noted, researchers have found  that nonprime mortgages that were not securitized may have less risky  characteristics than those that were securitized. Private sector databases  that contain information on both securitized and nonsecuritized mortgages  (CoreLogic LP LLS and LPS Loan Level Data) cover the majority of the  market but do not provide complete market coverage because not all  servicers contribute information to the databases. Similarly, because  mortgage originators located outside of metropolitan areas are not  required to report their loan information, the HMDA data do not capture  many mortgages made in rural areas. By contrast, the credit reporting  agencies have broader market coverage but lack data on key mortgage  attributes, such as loan type and purpose.", "The third constraint we identified is that the existing nonprime data  sources cannot readily be combined to create a single database with a  more comprehensive set of variables. Merging data sources enables  researchers to more thoroughly analyze lending patterns and factors  influencing loan performance. However, due to competition and privacy  concerns, the selected data sources either elect not to provide or are  restricted from providing certain key fields that could be used to merge  databases, such as the property address. For example, to match loan  records in the CoreLogic LP ABS database and HMDA data, we relied in  part on loan origination date fields that are not publicly released due to  privacy concerns. Even with the origination date fields, we could not  match all of the CoreLogic LP records to HMDA records.", "Finally, a user of existing data sources may have the ability to track some  specific loans over time but may not easily track a specific borrower or  property.

For example, lower  down payments, lower borrower credit scores, and limited documentation  of borrowers\u2019 income and assets have been cited as increasing the risk of  default. Economic conditions, such as house price changes, have also been  associated with default risk.", "Since minority borrowers have accounted for a larger share of the  nonprime mortgage market than the mortgage market as a whole,  associations between race and ethnicity and nonprime mortgage  performance also are of interest. However, data limitations have  complicated efforts to analyze the demographic characteristics of  nonprime borrowers, such as race, ethnicity, and income. Existing data  sets either provide detailed information about nonprime loans but limited  information about the borrowers (e.g., CoreLogic LoanPerformance  (CoreLogic LP) data) or provide more extensive information about  borrowers but not about loan performance over time (e.g., Home Mortgage  Disclosure Act (HMDA) data). To include information on the demographic  characteristics of nonprime borrowers in our model, we matched records  in the CoreLogic LP data to HMDA records. For securitized first-lien  nonprime loans originated from 2004 through 2006, we achieved a match  rate of approximately 73 percent, representing about 6.9 million records.

Based on each associated property\u2019s state and Census tract, we also  incorporated employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)  and data from the 2000 Census to control for various economic conditions  and neighborhood characteristics. For each loan, we determined the  performance status 24 months after the month of the first payment. We  defined a loan as being in default if it was delinquent by at least 90 days, in  the foreclosure process (including loans identified as in real-estate-owned  status), paid off after being 90-days delinquent or in foreclosure, or already  terminated with evidence of a loss.", "We separately analyzed the three most prevalent types of nonprime loans:  short-term hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) (ARMs with initial 2-  or 3-year fixed-rate periods followed by frequent interest rate  adjustments); fixed-rate mortgages; and other longer-term ARMs (ARMs  with initial 5-, 7-, or 10-year fixed-rate periods). For each product type, we  estimated default probabilities for purchase money loans separately from  loans for refinance, and for each product type and loan purpose, we  examined separately loans made to owner-occupants and investors. Our  primary reason for examining performance by product type, loan purpose,  and occupancy status is that borrower incentives and motivations may  vary for loans with different characteristics and purposes. For example,  because of their early, frequent, and upward interest rate adjustments,  short-term hybrid ARMs provide a stronger incentive for a borrower to  exit earlier from a mortgage as compared with fixed-rate mortgages or  longer-term ARMs. Also, an investor may not react the same way as an  owner-occupant may react when facing similar economic circumstances.", "We estimated separate default models for each mortgage product type,  although the general underlying structure of the models was similar. We  used a logistic regression model to explain the probability of loan default,  based on the observed pattern of actual defaults and the values of  variables representing loan attributes, borrower characteristics, and  economic conditions (see table 1). Some variables describe conditions at  the time of mortgage origination, such as the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, the  borrower\u2019s credit score, and the borrower\u2019s reported income. Other  factors influencing loan performance vary over time in ways that can be  observed, or at least approximated. For example, greater house price  appreciation (HPA) contributes to greater housing equity, thus reducing  the probability that a borrower, if facing financial distress, views  defaulting on a loan as a better option than prepaying. More generally,  greater house price appreciation creates equity that may induce a  borrower to prepay, which eliminates any default risk that would remain if  the loan were active. Some potentially significant determinants of  mortgage default, such as job loss or illness, are not available for inclusion  in our model. In addition, we lack data on certain factors\u2014such as  borrower wealth and first-time homebuyer status\u2014that could be  especially relevant to explaining actual loan performance.", "Tables 2 through 4 provide information on the number of loans and mean  values for each of the product types for which we estimated default  probabilities. Short-term hybrid ARMs were the most prevalent type of  mortgage, and purchase loans were more prevalent than refinance loans,  except among fixed-rate mortgages. Default rates were highest for short- term hybrid ARMs and generally higher for purchase loans than for  refinance loans, except for fixed-rate and longer-term ARM loans to  investors.", "The results of our analysis are presented in tables 5 through 8. We ran 12  regressions: separate owner-occupant and investor regressions for  purchase and refinance loans of three product types (short-term hybrid  ARMs, fixed-rate mortgages, and longer-term ARMs). For short-term  hybrid ARMs, the most prevalent product type, we present the results for  purchase and refinance loans to owner-occupants (table 5) and investors  (table 6). For the other product types, we present the results for purchase  and refinance loans to owner-occupants only (tables 7 and 8); the results  for investors were substantively similar. We present coefficient estimates  as well as a transformation of the coefficients into a form that can be  interpreted as the marginal effect of each variable on the estimated  probability of default. This marginal effect is the calculation of the change  in the estimated probability of default that would result if a variable\u2019s  standard deviation were added to that variable\u2019s mean value, while all  other variables are held at their mean values. This permits a comparison of  the impact of different variables within and across product types. In  general, HPA, loan amount, CLTV ratio, and FICO score had substantial  marginal effects across different product types and loan purposes.  Specifically, lower HPA, higher loan amount, higher CLTV ratio, and lower  FICO scores were associated with higher likelihoods of default. The  observed effects for DTI ratio were smaller. Documentation of borrower  income and assets and a loan\u2019s interest rate spread over the applicable  Treasury rate had substantial marginal effects.

The CoreLogic LP database provides extensive information  about the characteristics and performance of securitized nonprime  mortgages. However, it contains relatively little information about  borrowers, providing only credit scores and debt-service-to-income ratios.  In contrast, HMDA data contain limited information about loan  characteristics and nothing about performance, but they do provide  information on borrowers\u2019 race, ethnicity, and reported income. HMDA  data are estimated to capture about 80 percent of the mortgages funded  each year and cover all major market segments, including nonprime loans.  HMDA data, therefore, should capture most of the loans in the CoreLogic  LP database.", "While the CoreLogic LP and HMDA data emphasize different kinds of loan  and borrower information, they do have some information in common.  These common data items\u2014including loan amount, loan purpose, loan  origination date, property location, and loan originator\u2014allow the two  data sets to be matched on a loan-by-loan basis. Using the methodology  that we developed in previous work, we matched records from the  CoreLogic LP database for loans that were originated from 2004 through  2006 to HMDA data files for those same years. We focused on loan  originations from this period because there were large numbers of  nonprime originations in those years.", "The CoreLogic LP data set that we used for the matching process  contained records for 9,292,684 loans.

As with the CoreLogic LP data, we focused  on first-lien purchase and refinance loans. The HMDA data set excluded  loans for properties other than one- to four-family residential units.  Because the CoreLogic LP database contained only conventional loans in  private label securitizations, we also excluded from the HMDA data set  loans that involved government programs\u2014such as mortgages guaranteed  by the Federal Housing Administration or the Department of Veterans  Affairs\u2014and conventional loans that were indicated as sold to Fannie  Mae, Freddie Mac, Ginnie Mae, or Farmer Mac."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Steps Taken to Make the Data Sets Compatible", "paragraphs": ["Matching the loan records from the two data sources required us to make  the common data items compatible. We were able to use a straightforward  process for the loan amount and purpose that required only rounding the  CoreLogic LP loan amount to the nearest $1,000 and aggregating the three  CoreLogic LP refinance categories into one category. However, the  process was more complicated for origination date and property location.  We determined that the name of the loan originator was not particularly  useful for making initial matches of loan records because this information  was missing for a substantial percentage of the CoreLogic LP records.  However, the originator\u2019s name was useful in assessing the quality of the  matches that we made using other data elements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Loan Origination Dates", "paragraphs": ["About 15 percent of the loans in our CoreLogic LP data set had an  origination date that was the 1st day of a month.

To facilitate record  matching on the basis of property location, we related the Census tract  information in the HMDA data to a corresponding ZIP code or ZIP codes in  the CoreLogic LP data, using 2000 Census files and ZIP code boundary  files from Pitney Bowes Business Insight. Using mapping software, we  overlaid Census tract boundaries on ZIP code boundaries to determine the  proportion of each Census tract\u2019s area that fell within a given ZIP code  area. For each Census tract, we kept all ZIP codes that accounted for at  least 5 percent of that tract\u2019s area. About 60 percent of the Census tracts  were associated with only one ZIP code (meeting the 5 percent threshold),  and almost all Census tracts (97.5 percent) included no more than four ZIP  codes. When a Census tract was associated with only one ZIP code, all  HMDA records in that Census tract were candidates to match CoreLogic  LP records in that ZIP code. All HMDA records in tracts with more than  one ZIP code were candidates to match CoreLogic LP records in those ZIP  codes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Matching Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We matched loan records in the CoreLogic LP and HMDA data sets as  follows. First, for each loan origination year (2004, 2005, and 2006), we  made initial matches by identifying CoreLogic LP and HMDA loans with  the same property location, origination month, loan amount, and loan  purpose. After finding all possible HMDA matches for each CoreLogic LP  record, we classified these initial matches as either one-to-one matches  (CoreLogic LP records with one corresponding HMDA record), one-to- many matches (CoreLogic LP records with more than one corresponding  HMDA record), or nonmatches (CoreLogic LP records with no  corresponding HMDA record). One-to-one matches accounted for about 55  percent of the loans in our CoreLogic LP data set, one-to-many matches  accounted for about 25 percent, and nonmatches accounted for about 15  percent. Our match rates were highest for 2004 originations, about 85  percent, and lowest for 2006 originations, about 82 percent.", "The quality of the matches was particularly important because we were  examining statistical relationships between borrower characteristics and  loan performance. To provide reasonable assurance that the matches were  robust, we performed three types of quality checks on our initial one-to- one and one-to-many matches. First, we used information about the loan  originator\u2014information that was included in both the CoreLogic LP and  HMDA data. The HMDA data clearly identified loan originators\u2014referred  to as \u201cHMDA respondents\u201d\u2014using a series of codes that corresponded to a  list of standardized originator names. However, in more than 40 percent of  the CoreLogic LP records in our data set, the originator name was marked  as not available. In other cases, the originator was listed by a generic term,  such as \u201cconduit,\u201d or was an entity that appeared to be involved in the  securitization process but was not necessarily the originator. Originators  that were listed were often referred to in a number of ways\u2014for example,  \u201cTaylor Bean,\u201d \u201cTaylor Bean Whitaker,\u201d \u201cTaylor, Bean & Whitaker,\u201d  \u201cTaylorBean,\u201d \u201cTBW,\u201d and \u201cTBW Mortgage Corp.\u201d all referred to the HMDA  respondent \u201cTaylor, Bean & Whitaker.\u201d For CoreLogic LP loans with  originator information, we standardized the originator names in the  CoreLogic LP data, and we used these same originator names for the  HMDA data. We compared the standardized originator names in matched  records and if the standardized names matched, we classified the match as  a robust match, and deleted any other HMDA records that might have  matched to that CoreLogic LP record.", "Second, for CoreLogic LP loans with no originator name, we examined the  relationship between the HMDA loan originator and the issuer of the  securities associated with the loan. Many institutions, such as  Countrywide and Ameriquest, originated and securitized large numbers of  nonprime loans. While some of these institutions identified themselves as  the originator of a loan, others typically did not make the originator  information available. In these cases, if the CoreLogic LP securitizer  matched the HMDA originator, we classified an initial match as a robust  match. If the issuer did not originate substantial numbers of nonprime  loans, or also relied on other originators to provide loans for its  securitizations, we developed criteria to check for evidence of business  relationships between the issuer and various originating institutions. This  check had two components. First, if within the CoreLogic LP data set we  identified an originator-issuer combination, we defined that combination  as a business relationship. Second, we considered combinations of  originators from the HMDA data and issuers from the CoreLogic LP data.  For an originator-issuer combination to be a business relationship, a  combination had to appear at least 250 times in our set of initial one-to-one  matches, or meet one of two additional criteria. Specifically, if the  combination appeared at least 100 times, the originator must have made 10  percent of the issuer\u2019s securitized loans, or if the combination appeared at  least 50 times, the issuer had to have securitized 33 percent of the loans  made by the originator. We classified initial matches for which such  business relationships existed as robust matches.", "Additionally, if none of these tests resulted in a robust match, we  examined the loan origination day in the CoreLogic LP and HMDA data  sets. If the days matched exactly, we classified an initial match as a robust  match. Finally, for some one-to-many matches that shared originator,  issuer, or business relationship characteristics, we examined the  CoreLogic LP and HMDA characterizations of whether the borrower was  an owner-occupant. In some cases, we were able to classify an initial  match as a robust match if CoreLogic LP and HMDA owner-occupant  characteristics matched. Overall, we produced high-quality matches for  about 73 percent of the records in our CoreLogic LP data set, including  about 75 percent of the loans originated in 2004, about 73 percent of the  loans originated in 2005, and about 72 percent of the loans originated in  2006 (see table 9).", "A potential concern with constructing a data set using a matching process  is that records that do not match may differ systematically from records  that do match, thereby making it difficult to make inferences from the  matched data. However, we believe that the CoreLogic LP records that we  were unable to match to HMDA records were similar in important respects  to CoreLogic LP records that we could match. For example, loans in  subprime pools represented 61.5 percent of the overall CoreLogic LP  sample, and 62.3 percent of matched loans. Purchase loans represented  44.8 percent of the overall CoreLogic LP data set, and 46.0 percent of  matched loans. In terms of geography, state shares of unmatched and  matched loans were similar. Loans in California represented 23.1 percent  of the full CoreLogic LP data set and 22.5 percent of matched records.  Furthermore, nonprime borrowers with matched and unmatched records  had similar FICO scores. For example, subprime borrowers with matched  records had median FICO scores of 617, 620, and 617 for loans originated  in 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively; the corresponding scores for  subprime borrowers with unmatched records were 617, 617, and 615.  Likewise, Alt-A borrowers with matched records had median FICO scores  of 708, 709, and 703 for 2004, 2005, and 2006, respectively; the  corresponding scores for Alt-A borrowers with unmatched records were  706, 707, and 702. In addition, as shown in table 10, for each loan  origination year and mortgage product type, median initial interest rates  were identical or similar for borrowers with matched and unmatched  records."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Steve Westley (Assistant  Director), William Bates, Jan Bauer, Stephen Brown, Julianne Dieterich,  DuEwa Kamara, John McGrail, John Mingus, Marc Molino, Bob Pollard,  and Jennifer Schwartz made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
