CMS implemented a mandated national RAC program, which began in March 2009. GAO was asked to examine specific issues that arose during the demonstration project and CMS's efforts to address them in the national RAC program. This report examines the extent to which CMS (1) developed a process and took corrective actions to address vulnerabilities identified by the RACs that led to improper payments, (2) resolved coordination issues between the RACs and the Medicare claims administration contractors, and (3) established methods to oversee RAC claim review accuracy and provider service during the national program. GAO reviewed CMS documents and interviewed officials from CMS and contractors and provider groups affected by the demonstration project."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["CMS did not establish an adequate process in the 3-year demonstration project or in planning for the national program to address RAC-identified vulnerabilities that led to improper payments, such as paying duplicate claims for the same service. CMS stated that one purpose of the demonstration project was to obtain information to help prevent improper payments. However, CMS has not yet implemented corrective actions for 60 percent of the most significant RAC-identified vulnerabilities that led to improper payments, a situation that left 35 of 58 unaddressed. These were vulnerabilities for which RACs identified over $1 million in improper payments for medical services or $500,000 for durable medical equipment. CMS developed a spreadsheet, which listed the most significant improper payment vulnerabilities that were identified by the RACs during the demonstration project. However, the agency did not develop a plan to take corrective action or implement sufficient monitoring, oversight, and control activities to ensure these significant vulnerabilities were addressed. Thus, CMS did not address significant vulnerabilities representing $231 million in overpayments identified by the RACs during the demonstration project. For the RAC national program, CMS developed a process to compile identified vulnerabilities and recommend actions to prevent improper payments. However, this corrective action process lacks certain essential procedures and staff with the authority to ensure that these vulnerabilities are resolved promptly and adequately to prevent further improper payments. Based on lessons learned during the demonstration project, CMS took multiple steps in the national program to resolve coordination issues between the RACs and Medicare claims administration contractors. During the demonstration project, CMS learned that having regular communication with the claims administration contractors on improper payment vulnerabilities that the RACs were identifying was important. CMS also learned that the data warehouse used to store claims information for the RACs needed more capacity and utility, that manual claims adjustment by claims administration contractors to recoup improper payments was burdensome, and that sharing paper copies of medical records between RACs and claims administration contractors when claims denials were appealed was difficult to manage. As a result, CMS took steps to resolve these coordination issues in the national program, such as enhancing the existing data warehouse and automating the claims-adjustment process. CMS took steps to improve oversight of the accuracy of RACs' claims reviews and the quality of their service to providers for the national program. CMS added processes to review the accuracy of RAC determinations, including independent reviews by another CMS contractor. CMS also established requirements to address provider concerns about service, such as having the RACs establish Web sites that will allow providers to track the status of a claim being reviewed. In addition, CMS established performance metrics that the agency will use to monitor RAC accuracy and service to providers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For almost 20 years, we have designated Medicare, which provides health  insurance for those aged 65 and older and certain disabled persons, as a  high risk program due to the its size and complexity, as well as its  susceptibility to mismanagement and improper payments. Improper  payments may be due to errors, such as the inadvertent submission of  duplicate claims for the same service, or misconduct, such as fraud and  abuse. In 2009, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  estimated that approximately $24.1 billion, or 7.8 percent of Medicare fee- for-service (FFS) payments for claims from April 2008 through March  2009 were improper. Because billions of dollars are paid in error each  year, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)\u2014the HHS  agency that administers the Medicare program\u2014conducts a number of  activities to reduce improper payments. CMS\u2019s efforts include pre- payment reviews to prevent improper payments before claims are paid, as  well as post-payment reviews of claims potentially paid in error. CMS uses  Medicare claims administration contractors to perform these and other  Medicare FFS functions, which include reviewing and paying claims in  accordance with Medicare policy, and conducting provider outreach and  education on correct billing practices.", "The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) directed CMS to conduct a project to demonstrate how  effective the use of recovery audit contractors (RACs) would be in  identifying underpayments and overpayments, and recouping  overpayments in the Medicare program. Recovery audits involve post- payment review of supporting documents and other information to  identify overpayments and underpayments. The MMA directed CMS to  establish a RAC demonstration in at least two states from among the ones  with the highest per-capita Medicare utilization rates and to use at least  three RACs. The MMA also authorized CMS to pay the RACs on a  contingency basis, which differs from how the agency pays its other  contractors. For Medicare, the RAC demonstration project was designed  to be an addition to existing claims review processes conducted by various  contractors that CMS uses to administer the program.", "The demonstration project required the RACs to review claims previously  paid by Medicare claims administration contractors to identify payment  errors, such as whether a provider billed the correct number of units for a  particular drug or service. Once a RAC identified an improper payment, it  informed the provider of the error and its amount. The Medicare claims  administration contractor then adjusted the claim to the proper amount  and collected the overpayment or reimbursed the underpayment. During  the demonstration project, CMS paid RACs contingency fees on  overpayments collected and underpayments refunded.", "In the CMS RAC Status Document FY 2006: Status on the Use of Recovery  Audit Contractors (RACs) in the Medicare Program, the agency reported  its intention to use information from RAC reviews to identify issues at risk  for improper payments. Similarly, the agency\u2019s 2008 evaluation of the  demonstration project provided information on the service-specific errors  or vulnerabilities, which resulted in RAC-identified improper  overpayments and underpayments. CMS or its Medicare claims  administration contractors could then address the vulnerabilities most  likely to result in payment errors in order to reduce improper payments.  Once a RAC identified a vulnerability, it was the responsibility of CMS or  the Medicare claims administration contractors to take corrective action.  Corrective action involves identifying the causes for each type of  vulnerability and addressing them, in order to reduce future improper  payments.", "In the 2006 status document on the demonstration project, CMS also  reported that the demonstration RACs identified $303.5 million in  improper payments. However, this amount did not include the final  results of any provider appeals filed after or pending at that time. CMS  concluded that \u201cpreliminary results indicate that the use of recovery  auditors is a viable and useful tool for ensuring accurate payments\u201d and  that RACs would be a \u201cvalue-added adjunct\u201d to the agency\u2019s programs.  Subsequently, in December 2006 the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of  2006 required CMS to implement a national recovery audit contractor  program by January 1, 2010.", "Providers reported problems during the RAC demonstration project, and  expressed concerns about the implementation of a national program  before these issues were resolved. For example, providers stated that the  contingency fee payment structure created an incentive for RACs to be  aggressive in determining that paid claims were improper. In addition,  providers faulted CMS for not holding the RACs accountable for the  accuracy of their decisions, noting that RAC determinations resulted in  thousands of provider appeals to Medicare claims administration  contractors. These appeals and adjustments to claims produced additional  workload and coordination challenges for the Medicare claims  administration contractors adjudicating appeals and RACs. Association  and hospital representatives further noted the RACs sometimes requested  duplicate medical records as part of their reviews, thus increasing  providers\u2019 administrative burden. In a June 2008 report evaluating the   3-year RAC demonstration project, CMS reported its intent to make a  number of changes to the RAC national program to address these  concerns and streamline operations.", "You asked us to examine how CMS used information on RAC-identified  improper payments to address the underlying vulnerabilities that led to  them. You also asked us to examine particular issues regarding contractor  coordination and RAC accuracy and service that arose during the RAC  demonstration project and CMS\u2019s efforts to address them in the RAC  national program. This report examines the extent to which CMS   (1) developed an adequate process and took corrective action to address  RAC-identified vulnerabilities that led to improper payments; (2) built  upon lessons learned from the demonstration project to resolve  coordination issues between the RACs and the Medicare claims  administration contractors for the national program; and (3) established  methods to oversee the accuracy of RACs\u2019 claims-review determinations  and the quality of RAC service to providers during the national program.  This report focused on implementation of the recovery audit provisions of  the MMA and the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 and not certain  other statues and guidance relevant to recovery auditing.", "To determine the extent to which CMS developed an adequate process and  took corrective action to help prevent future improper payments due to  vulnerabilities identified during the RAC demonstration project, we used  the criteria outlined in our Standards for Internal Control in the Federal  Government. We applied these standards to assess whether the policies  and procedures CMS instituted to monitor the RAC program reasonably  ensured that the findings from RAC reviews were evaluated, assigned to  the appropriate components within CMS or its Medicare claims  administration contractors to implement corrective actions, and resolved  promptly in accordance with these internal control standards. We also  used criteria from our Internal Control Management and Evaluation Tool  to assess whether CMS\u2019s actions to establish an effective internal control  environment for the RAC program included the appropriate assignment of  authority, accountability, and responsibility to meet the agency\u2019s goals and  objectives. We reviewed the agency\u2019s Improper Payment Prevention Plan  (IPPP), an internal agency spreadsheet that was designed to list the most  significant improper payments identified during the RAC demonstration  project that generally resulted in overpayments of at least $1 million. We  evaluated the IPPP against CMS\u2019s essential steps of a corrective action  process namely: (1) data analysis of the errors including those associated  with improper payments; (2) determination of the specific programmatic  causes; (3) identification of corrective actions to be implemented based on  data and program analysis; (4) development of an implementation  schedule for each corrective action, including major tasks, personnel  responsible, and a timeline for each action, and implementation of the  corrective actions; and (5) evaluation of the effectiveness of the corrective  actions through monitoring. We also interviewed CMS officials to  determine the actions taken to assure that the information in the IPPP was  accurate. Agency officials said they did not verify the dollar amounts  reported by the RACs. However, they referred us to the agency\u2019s final  evaluation report for the most accurate analysis of the amounts recovered  by the RACs as of the end of the demonstration project. Therefore, to  quantify the relative dollar amounts of improper payments associated with  specific RAC-identified vulnerabilities in the IPPP, we developed a  crosswalk between the vulnerabilities listed on the IPPP and the dollar  amounts presented in CMS\u2019s June 2008 evaluation of the RAC  demonstration project. Agency officials agreed that this approach  provided an accurate representation of the overpayment amounts at the  end of the demonstration project for the most significant vulnerabilities  identified by the RACs that led to improper payments. We determined  these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes because the data  represented the best available information on the RAC-identified  vulnerabilities and their financial impact at that time. We also interviewed  relevant officials from CMS, two Medicare claims administration  contractors that participated in the demonstration project, and the  demonstration RACs to obtain information about the demonstration RACs\u2019  processes and findings.", "To determine whether CMS addressed coordination issues between RACs  and the Medicare claims administration contractors, we reviewed the  statements of work for the RACs and MACs that detail CMS\u2019s expectations  for these contractors. We also examined the performance metrics for the  RACs, as well as performance metrics CMS uses to assess coordination  between Medicare claims administration contractors and other Medicare  FFS contractors. We assessed these elements against the Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government. We also interviewed CMS  officials and staff from the same two Medicare claims administration  contractors that participated in the RAC demonstration project about the  quality of communication among contractors involved with the RAC  program.", "To determine the extent of CMS\u2019s oversight of RAC accuracy and quality of  service to providers, we analyzed documentation from CMS, including the  RAC statement of work. In addition, we listened to two Special Open Door  Forums audio conferences hosted by CMS on the RAC program, as well as  a national RAC summit sponsored by associations of health care  professionals to learn about provider experiences during the  demonstration project and concerns about the national program. We also  conducted interviews with CMS officials, RAC staff, and representatives  from the American Hospital Association and state hospital organizations in  the demonstration states of California, Florida, and New York; the  American Medical Association; the Medical Group Management  Association; and the American Health Care Association, to obtain further  information about the oversight of RAC accuracy and quality of service.", "We requested comments on a draft of this report from CMS. We received  written comments on March 3, 2010 and have summarized them in the  agency comment section of this report. We also provided statements of  facts from our draft report to the two Medicare claims administration  contractors and seven provider associations we interviewed and requested  their comments that we incorporated as appropriate. We conducted this  performance audit from March 2009 to March 2010 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives.

Since the  program\u2019s inception in 1965, Medicare claims administration contractors,  then known as fiscal intermediaries and carriers, have conducted its  claims administration activities. In addition, CMS also uses other  contractors to conduct Medicare functions, such as to investigate  instances of potential fraud and develop cases for referral to law  enforcement and to answer beneficiary inquiries through the   1-800-Medicare help line.", "At present, CMS is in the midst of the largest transition of its claims  administration contracts since the program was established. The MMA  required CMS to use competitive procedures to select new entities called  Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) to conduct claims  administration activities that had been conducted by fiscal intermediaries  and carriers. Through February 2005, CMS contracted with approximately  51 fiscal intermediaries and carriers that processed and paid claims,  conducted automated pre-payment and limited post-payment review of  claims, handled the first level of provider appeals of denied claims,  enrolled providers in Medicare, and audited providers\u2019 cost reports. To  address improper billing, these Medicare claims administration  contractors also performed trend analysis of provider billing patterns,  developed strategies to address improper billing through systems edits or  provider education and claims review, helped implement CMS-issued  national coverage determinations (NCD), and developed local coverage  determinations (LCD). By the end of the transition from fiscal  intermediaries and carriers to MACs, CMS will have transferred all of these  tasks to 15 MACs that will handle Part A claims and Part B claims with the  exception of durable medical equipment (DME) claims, which will be  processed by four specialized DME MACs. As of September 2009, CMS  made an initial award decision on all the MAC contracts and has  implemented 13. Because the transition is not completed, the current  Medicare contracting environment includes fiscal intermediaries, carriers,  and MACs, any one of which we refer to as Medicare claims administration  contractors for this report.", "Claims Review in Medicare  Medicare claims administration contractors review Medicare claims both  before and after payment using similar automated and complex processes.  CMS\u2019s use of recovery auditing in the RAC demonstration project  augmented existing Medicare claims administration contractor pre- and  post-payment claims review efforts. While Medicare claims administration  contractors have the authority to review claims they initially paid, this is  only one of the many functions they perform. Further, because the  Medicare claims administration contractors receive more than 1.2 billion  claims per year (the equivalent of 4.5 million claims per work day), it is  impractical, according to CMS, for these contractors to manually review  more than a small fraction of claims\u2014either before or after payment.  Recovery audit contractors, in contrast, focus exclusively on post-payment  claims review.", "Medicare claims administration contractors and the RACs generally use  the same processes to review claims:    Automated reviews use systems edits to check claims for evidence of  improper coding or other mistakes. Medicare claims administration  contractors may use automated reviews before payment to deny claims, or  to flag claims that require additional non-automated review before  payment. RACs use automated reviews after payment to analyze paid  claims and identify those that were or could have been paid improperly.", "Complex reviews rely on licensed medical professionals to manually  examine a claim and any related documentation, including paper files, to  determine whether the service was covered and was reasonable and  necessary.

In July 2007, CMS expanded the demonstration project to three additional  states\u2014Arizona, Massachusetts, and South Carolina. The demonstration  project ended in March 2008.", "CMS initially provided the RACs with 4 years of claims data in their  jurisdictions, followed by an additional 3 months of claims each quarter  for the rest of the demonstration project. CMS gave the demonstration  RACs a total of 1.2 billion claims that they could review. To prevent the  RACs from auditing those claims that previously underwent complex  review by a Medicare claims administration contractor or other  contractor, CMS established a data warehouse that contained  information on which claims were unavailable for RAC review.", "During the demonstration project, the RACs were required to use  automated and complex review processes using the same Medicare  policies and regulations as CMS\u2019s Medicare claims administration  contractors to identify improper payments. The RACs used their own  software to analyze paid claims and identify those that were or could have  been paid improperly. For example, claims indicating duplicate payments  could be identified by automated analysis alone. In other cases, the RACs  identified claims likely to contain errors and conducted complex reviews.  (See fig. 1 for a depiction of the claims review process.) In these cases, the  RACs requested that providers submit the associated medical records for  review. If the RAC found an improper payment, it notified the provider and  the Medicare claims administration contractor responsible for recouping  the overpayments or repaying an underpayments. Providers could appeal  RAC determinations through the established Medicare appeals process,  which included a first-level review conducted by the Medicare claims  administration contractors.", "Two years into the demonstration project, CMS initiated a series of  vulnerability calls, conference calls between the RACs and the Medicare  claims administration contractors. These calls enabled the RACs to  provide information about the vulnerabilities they identified that resulted  in improper payments and to highlight situations where corrective action  might be needed. Although a CMS official told us it was not required, the  Medicare claims administration contractors could consider RAC-identified  vulnerabilities when developing their strategies to reduce improper  payments. If a Medicare claims administration contractor determined that  a RAC-identified vulnerability was widespread in its region, it could  choose to take several corrective actions. A Medicare claims  administration contractor could: (1) conduct provider outreach and  education, (2) develop or revise local coverage determinations to clarify  what services were reasonable and necessary in that jurisdiction, and   (3) initiate additional service-specific prepayment edits in its local claims  processing system. In addition, CMS could initiate a nationwide corrective  action, such as implementing a national system edit, reissue instructions  for coding a claim, or develop a national coverage determination. CMS  also could provide outreach and education on critical issues to providers  directly through its Special Open Door Forums teleconferences, and  presentations at national meetings.", "In its June 2008 evaluation report, CMS stated that the demonstration  project corrected $1.02 billion in improper payments from the three claim  RACs\u2014$980.0 million in overpayments and $37.8 million in  underpayments\u2014as of March 27, 2008, and returned $693.6 million to the  Medicare Trust Funds. Eighty-five percent of the overpayments collected  were for services detailed on inpatient hospital claims. Common types of  improper payments were for claims determined to be: coded incorrectly,  lacking sufficient documentation, or medically unnecessary. However,  the RACs collected the majority of these improper payments in the last  quarter of the demonstration project, and many provider appeals had not  been decided or even filed by the end of the demonstration project. The  final outcome of the appeals process, which can take more than two years,  could decrease the savings attributed to the demonstration project.

CMS did  not begin to evaluate the most significant vulnerabilities that resulted in  improper payments until almost 2 years after the program began. Agency  officials told us they did not anticipate that the RACs would identify such a  high volume of improper payments and did not have systems in place to  collect data at the beginning of the demonstration project. CMS\u2019s fiscal  year 2006 status report on the RAC demonstration project stated that CMS  would draft a proposed RAC Corrective Action Plan to prevent future  improper payments by January 2007. However, CMS did not create the  IPPP\u2014the spreadsheet to track significant vulnerabilities identified during  the demonstration project\u2014until November 2008, 8 months after the  demonstration project ended.", "CMS lacked a process to determine appropriate responses to RAC  findings. CMS did not assign responsibility for taking corrective action on  the vulnerabilities listed in the IPPP to either the agency itself, its  Medicare claims administration contractors, or a combination of both.  According to CMS officials, the agency only takes corrective action for  vulnerabilities with national implications, and leaves it up to the Medicare  claims administration contractors to decide whether to take action for  vulnerabilities with local implications. However, the IPPP did not specify  what type of action was required on the part of CMS or the Medicare  claims administration contractors. For example, for inpatient services that  did not meet the stated inpatient care criteria, the IPPP neither specified  what type of corrective action would be needed to prevent future  improper payments nor whether CMS or its Medicare claims  administration contractors were responsible for taking action.  Accordingly, neither Medicare claims administration contractors nor CMS  have taken corrective action to address payment errors related to this  inpatient service vulnerability. Similarly, we reviewed the instructions  CMS provided to the Medicare claims administration contractors during  the demonstration project and found that CMS did not provide specific  guidance to the Medicare claims administration contractors for  incorporating RAC findings into local corrective action plans. Instead,  CMS allowed its Medicare claims administration contractors to  independently determine when to take action and what actions, if any,  were needed to address RAC findings. The lack of documented assigned  responsibilities\u2014as prescribed in our internal control standards\u2014 impeded CMS\u2019s efforts to promptly resolve the vulnerabilities identified by  the RACs during the demonstration project.", "CMS lacked a process to implement corrective actions promptly.  The IPPP, which was not created until 8 months after the end of the  demonstration project, lacked a time frame based on established criteria  for when CMS or its Medicare claims administration contractors should  take action. CMS officials told us that although they conducted some  informal follow-up, neither the agency nor its Medicare claims  administration contractors have implemented any corrective actions to  address RAC findings since the fall of 2008. CMS officials noted that the  agency does not plan to take any further action until the appeals from the  demonstration project are finalized. Because CMS has not developed a  time frame for taking action based on established criteria and is currently  unable to track all pending first-level appeals of RAC determinations, it is  uncertain when or if the agency would take any further action on the  remaining vulnerabilities. Although educating providers promptly on how  to correct billing errors reduces the risk of improper payments, provider  associations also told us they and their members had not received training  on the majority of the vulnerabilities identified by the RACs during the  demonstration project. For example, one national provider association  said that it was not aware of any educational efforts related to the RAC  program findings on vulnerabilities either during or after the  demonstration project. Another noted that in addition to provider  education, systems edits should be used when possible to prevent the  initial improper payments.", "CMS continues to lack an adequate process for implementing  corrective actions during the RAC national program. Although CMS  has made public statements that preventing future improper payments is  the RAC program\u2019s mission, the agency has yet to assign responsibility to  personnel for implementing corrective actions to address RAC-identified  vulnerabilities or to develop steps to assess the effectiveness of corrective  actions taken.", "While CMS\u2019s Office of Financial Management (OFM) established a  corrective action team for the RAC national program that will compile,  review, and categorize RAC-identified vulnerabilities and discuss  corrective action recommendations, the team does not have the  organizational authority to implement the corrective actions necessary to  reduce future improper payments. Rather, the team can only forward the  issues and their recommendations to other leadership groups comprised  of senior officials from different components within CMS that have the  authority to take corrective actions. For example, if the decision is made  to address a vulnerability by developing a NCD, the responsibility to  prioritize the development of NCDs and expertise to develop them is not  within OFM, but rather within the Office of Clinical Standards and Quality.  The different components can choose whether to address the identified  vulnerabilities that could lead to improper payments.", "Further, CMS\u2019s corrective action process does not include steps to assess  the effectiveness of any actions taken to reduce improper payments on  RAC-identified vulnerabilities.

Of these 35 vulnerabilities, CMS did not list  a reason on the IPPP for 28 of them (48 percent). CMS officials told us that  they were unable to develop specific corrective actions on the other seven  (12 percent) because they either lacked adequate information to address  the problem or decided it was not cost-effective to do so. CMS officials  told us the agency was unable to develop corrective actions for 7  vulnerabilities because the agency did not provide sufficient guidance to  the RACs on how to categorize these vulnerabilities. As a result, the RACs  combined several billing codes into single categories, which presented a  challenge for identifying corrective actions, according to CMS officials.  For example, RACs denied millions of dollars in inpatient hospital claims  not meeting the requirements for inpatient admission. However, CMS  officials told us they were unable to develop corrective actions on this and  six other vulnerabilities because they either lacked adequate information  on specific services involved or decided it was not cost effective to  address each specific billing code. Further, the agency reported that it did  not have sufficient time to analyze the information on one of these types of  vulnerabilities prior to the end of the demonstration project.", "CMS noted several actions it took to improve the quality of its information  on improper payment vulnerabilities that might be identified through the  national RAC program. According to CMS officials, the agency has  enhanced the data warehouse to provide additional information by  establishing 20 to 30 different types of categories for use in the national  program. In addition, CMS officials said they will not rely on each RAC to  report its findings; instead, the agency will use the information from the  data warehouse for data analysis and reports.", "CMS officials told us they had no plans to take further action on RAC- identified improper payment vulnerabilities that have appeals outstanding  from the demonstration project until the results from these appeals are  known. According to the agency, information from these appeals may help  the agency determine what corrective actions are appropriate.", "CMS and Medicare claims administration contractors reported that the  following factors also hindered their progress in implementing corrective  actions:    Competing priorities in implementing system edits\u2014According to  CMS officials, national systems edits to address RAC findings competed  with other computer system changes, such as Medicare fee schedule  updates. National edits require collaboration among various CMS  components and senior executives to determine the viability of each edit  and its priority level and can take up to 7 months to be implemented. The  decision to implement system edits at the local level is usually up to the  local Medicare claims administration contractor. A Medicare claims  administration contractor can decide not to implement a local edit if it  does not consider that particular vulnerability a priority in its strategy to  reduce improper payments or if it anticipates that the edit would result in  a high level of appeals. CMS officials also told us that the availability of  resources, including staff hours, played a role in prioritizing the  implementation of national and local edits. Due to the limited resources  available and the agency\u2019s competing priorities, RAC-related system edits  from the three state demonstration project were not a high priority  according to CMS.", "Significant workload increase in processing claim readjustments  and appeals\u2014CMS officials and one of the Medicare claims  administration contractors\u2019 staff we interviewed told us that the increase  in workload from claim adjustments and appeals from RAC findings  during the demonstration project strained the Medicare claims  administration contractors\u2019 capacity to institute corrective actions.  Medicare claims administration contractors made adjustments for claims  in which the RACs had identified either overpayments or underpayments.", "However, during the demonstration project, the Medicare claims  administration contractors processed hundreds of thousands of RAC claim  adjustments\u2014some manually\u2014which created significant additional  workload. In addition, both of the Medicare claims administration  contractors that we interviewed that worked with the RACs during the  demonstration project reported significant increases in appeals workload  due to RAC activities, especially Part A appeals. One Medicare claims  administration contractor stated that in fiscal year 2008, 99 percent of its  Part A appeal workload arose from RAC claims, while another claims  administration contractor reported having twice as many Part A appeals as  it did prior to the demonstration project.", "Transition of Medicare claims administration functions to MACs\u2014 The transfer of claims administration responsibilities to MACs further  contributed to CMS\u2019s inability to implement corrective actions. CMS  consolidated numerous fiscal intermediary and carrier jurisdictions into  the new MAC jurisdictions. The MACs are responsible for consolidating  the different coverage policies and systems edits they inherited from the  previous contractors into one consistent set of edits and coverage policies  for the new jurisdictions. As a result, CMS told us that some Medicare  claims administration contractors did not act upon RAC-identified  vulnerabilities that led to improper payments during the demonstration  project. Further, CMS officials said that in part they did not implement  corrective actions due to the lack of continuity when some of the  Medicare claims administration contractors were not awarded MAC  contracts, which prevented the agency from continuing discussions with  contractor staff familiar with the RAC program.", "Our prior work has shown that CMS has allowed known vulnerabilities  that contribute to or result in improper payments to remain unresolved for  years. In fact, the RACs focused on some specific types of claims because  both we and the HHS Office of the Inspector General identified them in the  past. Moreover, CMS officials and one of the RACs noted that many of  these vulnerabilities were known to CMS before the demonstration project  due to medical record reviews and the agency\u2019s error reports. In its 2006- 2009 Strategic Action Plan, CMS reported that it planned to effectively  oversee its providers and aggressively deliver provider education and  outreach and that this oversight would include ways to prevent  overpayments and improper payments. In addition, CMS reported that it  was also expanding the use of electronic data to more efficiently detect  improper payments and program vulnerabilities. However, we have  reported recently that continuing weaknesses in CMS\u2019s process still exist,  and therefore Medicare continues to be at risk for improper payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Is Taking Action to Resolve RAC and Medicare Claims Administration Contractor Coordination Issues", "paragraphs": ["CMS used lessons learned from the RAC demonstration project to take  actions to resolve RAC and Medicare claims administration contractor  coordination issues for the RAC national program.

Once  the RACs identify errors, Medicare claims administration contractors are  responsible for re-processing the claims to repay underpayments or  recoup overpayments, conducting the first level review for RAC-related  appeals, and informing and training providers about lessons learned  through the RAC reviews, according to CMS officials. (See fig. 5 which  illustrates this interdependence of RACs and MACs.)", "CMS is taking multiple steps to resolve RAC and Medicare claims  administration contractor coordination issues in the national program  based on lessons learned during the demonstration project, such as  continuing the RAC and Medicare claims administration contractors  vulnerability calls, enhancing the existing data warehouse, automating the  claims-adjustment process, and developing a system for electronic  documentation sharing when RAC determinations are appealed.", "CMS is continuing regular RAC and Medicare claims administration  contractor vulnerability calls. The vulnerability calls, which began   2 years after the start of the demonstration project, were considered  valuable according to agency officials. CMS officials said that they plan to  hold weekly calls during the national program, to share RAC-identified  vulnerabilities that may result in improper payments with Medicare claims  administration contractors. According to CMS, these calls can inform  Medicare claims administration contractors about ways to reduce payment  errors, for example, by implementing appropriate local system edits or  educating providers. CMS noted that conducting these calls during the  demonstration project provided information about how best to implement  corrective actions that would prevent future improper payments. For  example, upon learning about some RAC-identified inpatient hospital  errors, CMS consulted coding experts about how to resolve these errors  and whether it was necessary to conduct an educational session on the  issue. According to a CMS official, the vulnerability calls are expected to  serve as the main mechanism of communication between the RACs and  the Medicare claims administration contractors about vulnerabilities and  are expected to provide a means to share RAC findings with various other  components of CMS.", "CMS is enhancing the data warehouse. For the national program, CMS  is redesigning, enhancing, and maintaining the data warehouse created  during the demonstration project to house data on RAC activity and  prevent RACs from auditing claims under investigation or previously  reviewed by other contractors. RACs and one of the Medicare claims  administration contractors reported issues with the data warehouse  during the demonstration project, including difficulty uploading data in the  correct format, slow processing time, and a lack of information on  collection activities. According to CMS, it has already made significant  changes to the data warehouse. For example, it enhanced the system to  accommodate increased user demand, added capability to generate  reports for CMS to track RAC activity, and improved processes for data  uploads and downloads. CMS also plans to incorporate appeals data into  the data warehouse.", "CMS is automating the claims-adjustment process. According to  CMS, the agency is automating the claims-adjustment process to address  Medicare claims administration contractors\u2019 workload issues. During the  demonstration project, the Medicare claims administration contractors\u2019  workload related to claims adjustment increased significantly, due to the  high volume of claims RACs identified that required adjustment and the  time-consuming process necessary for the contractors to adjust them.  CMS officials stated that the amount of time and effort required of the  Medicare claims administration contractors to re-process RAC-related  claims was the most significant coordination problem. The agency  automated the Part A claims adjustment process and is working to  automate the process for adjusting Part B claims by April 2010. CMS  officials stated that the changes eliminate the need for costly and time- consuming manual intervention by the Medicare claims administration  contractors, ensure that overpayment recovery or underpayment  reimbursement occurs promptly, and ultimately minimize the burden on  the Medicare claims administration contractors. However, one Medicare  claims administration contractor informed us that the Part A claims  adjustment process failed to adjust its claims.", "CMS is developing an electronic documentation sharing system.  According to CMS officials, the agency addressed an administrative  burden by developing the e-RAC initiative, an electronic system that RACs,  CMS, and Medicare claims administration contractors will use to share  medical records. CMS officials stated that during the demonstration  project, RACs transferred paper copies of medical records to Medicare  claims administration contractors for appeals deliberations. According to  Medicare claims administration contractors, the volume of appeals made it  difficult to manage all of the paper medical records. A CMS official told  us the agency expects the first phase of the e-RAC initiative to be  operational in March 2010, which would allow the RACs to store imaged  files of medical records and make them accessible to CMS and certain  contractors that review, but do not process, claims. CMS expects this  system to enable the agency to create basic reports and improve oversight  of RAC activities. CMS\u2019s goal is to expand the e-RAC initiative to one or  more Medicare claims administration contractors by the end of calendar  year 2010.", "CMS established a \u201cblack-out period\u201d for claims review. To ensure  that the RAC national program does not interfere with the ongoing  transition of fiscal intermediaries and carriers to MACs, CMS reported  establishing a black out period of three months before and after each  transition when the new MACs will focus on other claims processing  activities and not work with the RACs in their jurisdictions. Claims  processed during this period will be available for RAC review after the  black-out period has ended.

Providers raised concerns that CMS did  not sufficiently oversee the RACs during the demonstration project to  ensure the vulnerabilities pursued by RACs were valid and that RACs  made accurate improper payment determinations. According to provider  associations, this led to numerous appeals of inaccurate RAC  determinations that were expensive and burdensome for providers. For  the national program, CMS will continue a process the agency established  during the end of the demonstration project to help ensure that RACs  pursue valid vulnerabilities. Prior to pursuing a wide-scale review of any  vulnerability, the RAC must submit it to CMS for the agency\u2019s approval. As  part of the submission process, the RAC must provide a description of the  vulnerability; a reference to the rule, regulation, or policy the RAC intends  to evaluate claims against; and a small sample of claims (up to 10) that the  RAC already reviewed and the findings for those claims. For example,  CMS approved one RAC\u2019s request to identify overpayments associated  with providers billing for more than one blood transfusion in a hospital  outpatient setting for a Medicare beneficiary in a day\u2014which Medicare  policy does not allow.", "According to CMS officials, the level of review that each proposed  vulnerability will receive will depend on its complexity. CMS officials in  OFM have authority to allow the RACs to pursue clear-cut vulnerabilities  that can lead to improper payments, such as duplicate payments for the  same service. For more complex vulnerabilities, including all medical  necessity determinations, the agency established a New Issue Review  Board, comprised of officials from four CMS components, which will  decide whether the RAC can go forward with its proposed review. The  board is responsible for ensuring that each RAC\u2019s claims reviews conform  to Medicare\u2019s coverage or payment policies and that the language the RAC  proposes to use in its determination letters is appropriate and clear. CMS  also contracted with a validation contractor (VC) with experience in  claims review to independently examine how the RAC plans to select  claims for each vulnerability and to determine whether the RAC plans to  use the correct review strategy\u2014(automated or complex)\u2014in reviewing  claims. In addition, the VC also is expected to reexamine the small sample  of claims submitted by RACs with each proposed vulnerability to assess  the accuracy of these RAC determinations.", "In addition to the oversight process for proposed vulnerabilities, CMS also  established a process for ongoing oversight of RAC accuracy of the  improper payments identified. Each month CMS\u2019s VC is expected to  independently examine 100 randomly selected claims that had been  reviewed by each RAC. For each claim in the sample, the VC is expected  to report whether it agrees or disagrees with the RAC\u2019s determination and  evaluate whether the language used by the RAC to communicate the  determination to the provider was clear and accurate. CMS officials told  us that the agency plans to publish an annual accuracy score for each RAC  in the agency\u2019s annual report on the RAC program and will take the scores  into consideration when determining whether to renew each RAC\u2019s  contract. CMS officials also told us that they may prohibit a RAC with a  low score on a particular issue from reviewing additional claims on that  issue. This process could help address provider concerns that CMS might  not become aware of inaccurate RAC determinations unless providers  filed significant numbers of appeals.", "In addition to these oversight processes, CMS added requirements  regarding the medical expertise of RAC staff to help address accuracy  concerns. Providers stated that RACs did not have the necessary medical  expertise to make their determinations during the demonstration project,  because they were not required to have a physician medical director on  staff or coding experts conducting the claims reviews. To address this  concern, for the national program, CMS required each RAC to have at least  one physician on staff as a medical director to provide clinical expertise  and judgment to understand Medicare policy, provide guidance in  questionable claims review situations, recommend when corrective  actions are needed to address the RAC-identified vulnerabilities that result  in improper payments, and brief and direct personnel on the correct  application of policy during claims review. CMS also required RACs to  hire registered nurses or therapists to conduct medical necessity  determinations and coding experts to conduct other types of reviews.", "Providers also reported that CMS\u2019s decision to allow the demonstration  RACs to retain contingency fees for determinations overturned at the  second through the fifth level of appeal led RACs to make questionable  determinations to increase their fees. CMS chose this methodology, in  part, to encourage companies to participate in the demonstration project.

CMS also reported in its evaluation report on the  RAC demonstration project that providers wanting to track the status of  their medical record submissions often had to make frequent phone calls  to RAC call centers and read a list of case numbers.", "CMS required each RAC by January 1, 2010, to develop a tool on its Web  site that will allow providers to track the status of a claim. This tool should  include information on whether a medical record request is outstanding,  whether the RAC received the requested medical records, whether the  RAC\u2019s review is underway or complete, and whether the case is closed. As  of January 4, 2010, according to a CMS official, providers could track the  status of their requested claims on two of the four RAC Web sites.

Although the RAC  demonstration project led to the successful recoupment and refunding of  past improper payments, CMS did not focus sufficient attention on  addressing the root causes of the vulnerabilities that caused them. Neither  the IPPP developed during the demonstration project nor the current plan  for the national program provide for sufficient monitoring and control  activities to ensure that corrective actions are taken to help meet the  overall goal of reducing improper payments in the Medicare program.  Because the RAC national program team does not have the organizational  authority within the agency to implement the corrective actions needed to  address the vulnerabilities that lead to improper payments, CMS must  develop criteria by which it prioritizes the activities of its various  components and contractors to develop adequate measures to reduce  future improper payments.
