By moving to an automated system, OPM intends to improve the program's efficiency and effectiveness. In January 2008, GAO recommended that the agency address risks to successful system deployment. Nevertheless, OPM deployed a limited initial version of the modernized system in February 2008. After unsuccessful efforts to address system quality issues, OPM suspended system operation, terminated a major contract, and began restructuring the modernization effort, also referred to as RetireEZ. For this study, GAO was asked to (1) assess the status of OPM's efforts to plan and implement the RetireEZ program and (2) evaluate the effectiveness of the agency's management of the modernization initiative. To do this, GAO reviewed OPM program documentation and interviewed agency and contractor officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["OPM remains far from achieving the modernized capabilities it had planned. Specifically, the agency has partially implemented two of eight planned capabilities: (1) an integrated database of retirement information accessible to OPM and agency retirement processing personnel and (2) enhanced customer service capabilities that support customer needs and provide self-service tools. However, the remaining six capabilities have yet to be implemented because they depended on deliverables that were to be provided by a contract that is now terminated. Examples of these missing capabilities include: (1) automated submission of retirement information through interfaces with federal agencies and (2) Web-accessible self-service retirement information for active and retired federal employees. Further, OPM has not yet developed a complete plan that describes how the program is to proceed without the system that was to be provided under the terminated contract. Although agency documents describe program implementation activities, they do not include a definition of the program, its scope, lines of responsibility and authority, management processes, and a schedule. Also, modernization program documentation does not describe results-oriented performance goals and measures. Until the agency completes and uses a plan that includes all of the above elements to guide its efforts, it will not be properly positioned to move forward with its restructured retirement modernization initiative. Further, OPM has significant weaknesses in five key management areas that are vital for effective development and implementation of its modernization program: cost estimating, earned value management (a recognized means for measuring program progress), requirements management, testing, and oversight. For example, the agency has not developed a cost estimating plan or established a performance measurement baseline--prerequisites for effective cost estimating and earned value management. Further, although OPM is revising its previously developed system requirements, it has not established processes and plans to guide this work or addressed test activities even though developing processes and plans, as well as planning test activities early in the life cycle, are recognized best practices for effective requirements development and testing. Finally, although OPM's Executive Steering Committee and Investment Review Board have recently become more active regarding RetireEZ, these bodies did not exercise effective oversight in the past, which has allowed the aforementioned management weaknesses to persist and OPM has not established guidance regarding how these entities are to intervene when corrective actions are needed. Until OPM addresses these weaknesses, many of which GAO and others made recommendations to correct, the agency's retirement modernization initiative remains at risk of failure. Institutionalizing effective management is critical not only for the success of this initiative, but also for that of other modernization efforts within the agency."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the past two decades, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has  been attempting to modernize the paper-intensive processes and  antiquated systems it uses to support the retirement of federal employees,  in part because the current process does not provide prompt and complete  benefit payments upon retirement.

We also visited OPM\u2019s  retirement operations facilities in Washington, D.C., and Boyers,  Pennsylvania. To evaluate the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s management of  the modernization initiative, we reviewed OPM\u2019s cost estimation, earned  value management (EVM), requirements management, test management  activities, and oversight.

In this regard, one of the agency\u2019s major human  resources tasks is to manage and administer the retirement program for  federal employees. According to the agency, the program serves federal  employees by providing (1) retirement compensation and (2) tools and  options for retirement planning. OPM\u2019s Center for Retirement and  Insurance Services administers the two defined benefit retirement plans  that provide retirement, disability, and survivor benefits to federal  employees. The first plan, the Civil Service Retirement System (CSRS),  provides retirement benefits for most federal employees hired before 1984.  The second plan, the Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS),  covers most employees hired in or after 1984 and provides benefits that  include Social Security and a defined contribution system.", "According to OPM, there are approximately 2.9 million active federal  employees and nearly 2.5 million retired federal employees. The agency\u2019s  March 2008 analysis of federal employment retirement data estimates that  nearly 1 million active federal employees will be eligible to retire and  almost 600,000 will most likely retire by 2016. Figure 1 summarizes the  estimated number of employees eligible and likely to retire."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Federal Employee Retirement Application Processing", "paragraphs": ["OPM and employing agencies\u2019 human resources and payroll offices are  responsible for processing federal employees\u2019 retirement applications. The  process begins when an employee submits a paper retirement application  to his or her employer\u2019s human resources office and is completed when  the individual begins receiving regular monthly benefit payments (as  illustrated in fig. 2).", "Once an employee submits an application, the employing agency\u2019s human  resources office provides retirement counseling services to the employee  and augments the retirement application with additional paperwork, such  as a separation form that finalizes the date the employee will retire. Then  the agency provides the retirement package to the employee\u2019s payroll  office. After the employee separates for retirement, the payroll office is  responsible for reviewing the documents for correct signatures and  information, making sure that all required forms have been submitted, and  adding any additional paperwork that will be necessary for processing the  retirement package. Once the payroll office has finalized the paperwork,  the retirement package is mailed to OPM to continue the retirement  process. Payroll offices are expected to submit the package to OPM within  30 days of the retiree\u2019s separation date.", "Upon receipt of the retirement package, OPM calculates an interim  payment based on information provided by the employing agency. The  interim payments are partial payments that typically provide retirees with  80 percent of the total monthly benefit they will eventually receive. OPM  then starts the process of analyzing the retirement application and  associated paperwork to determine the total monthly benefit amount to  which the retiree is entitled. This process includes collecting additional  information from the employing agency\u2019s human resources and payroll  offices or from the retiree to ensure that all necessary data are available  before calculating benefits. After OPM completes its review and authorizes  payment, the retiree begins receiving 100 percent of the monthly  retirement benefit payments. OPM then stores the paper retirement folder  at the Retirement Operations Center in Boyers, Pennsylvania.", "According to the agency\u2019s 2008 performance report, the average  processing time from the date OPM receives the initial application to the  time the retiree receives a full payment is 42 days. According to the Deputy  Associate Director for the Center of Retirement and Insurance Services,  about 200 employees are directly involved in processing the approximately  100,000 retirement applications OPM receives annually. This processing  includes functions such as determining retirement eligibility, inputting  data into benefit calculators, and providing customer service. The agency  uses over 500 different procedures, laws, and regulations, which are  documented on the agency\u2019s internal Web site, to process retirement  applications. For example, the site contains memorandums that outline  new procedures for handling special retirement applications, such as  those for disability or court orders. Further, OPM\u2019s retirement processing  involves the use of over 80 information systems that have approximately  400 interfaces with other internal and external systems. For instance, 26  internal systems interface with the Department of the Treasury to provide,  among other things, information regarding the total amount of benefit  payments to which an employee is entitled.", "OPM has stated that the federal employee retirement process currently  does not provide prompt and complete benefit payments upon retirement,  and that customer service expectations for more timely payments are  increasing. The agency also reports that a greater workload is expected  due to an anticipated increase in the number of retirement applications  over the next decade, yet current retirement processing operations are at  full capacity. Further, the agency has identified several factors that limit  its ability to process retirement benefits in an efficient and timely manner.  Specifically, it noted that    current processes are paper-based and manually intensive, resulting in a  higher number of errors and delays in providing benefit payments;  the high costs, limited capabilities, and other problems with the existing  information systems and processes pose increasing risks to the accuracy  of benefit payments;    current manual capabilities restrict customer service;  federal employees have limited access to their retirement records, making  planning for retirement difficult; and    attracting qualified personnel to operate and maintain the antiquated  retirement systems, which have about 3 million lines of custom  programming, is challenging."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Has a Long History of Retirement Modernization Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["In the late 1980s, OPM recognized the need to automate and modernize its  retirement processing and began retirement modernization initiatives that  have continuously called for automating its antiquated paper-based  processes. The agency\u2019s previously established program management  plans included the objectives of having timely and accurate retirement  benefit payments and more efficient and flexible processes. For example,  the agency\u2019s plans call for processing retirement applications and  providing retirees 100 percent of their monthly benefit payments the day it  is due versus providing interim monthly payments. Its initial  modernization vision called for providing prompt and complete benefit  payments by developing an integrated system and automated processes.  However, the agency has faced significant and long-standing challenges in  doing so.", "In early 1987, OPM began a program called the FERS Automated  Processing System (FAPS). However, after 8 years of planning, the agency  decided it needed to reevaluate the program, and the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) requested that an independent board  conduct a review to identify critical issues impeding progress and  recommend ways to address the issues. The review identified various  management weaknesses, including the lack of an established strategic  plan, cost estimation methodologies, and baseline; improperly defined and  ineffectively managed requirements; and no clear accountability for  decision making and oversight. Accordingly, the board suggested areas  for improvement and recommended terminating the program if immediate  action was not taken. In mid-1996, OPM terminated the program.", "In 1997, OPM began planning a second modernization initiative, called the  Retirement Systems Modernization (RSM) program. The agency originally  intended to structure the program as an acquisition of commercially  available hardware and software that would be modified in-house to meet  its needs. From 1997 to 2001, OPM developed plans and analyses and  began developing business and security requirements for the program.  However, in June 2001, it decided to change the direction of the retirement  modernization initiative.", "In late 2001, retaining the name RSM, the agency embarked upon its third  initiative to modernize the retirement process and examined the  possibility of privately sourced technologies and tools. To this end, OPM  issued a request for information to obtain private sourcing options and  determined that contracting was a viable alternative that would be cost  efficient, less risky, and more likely to be completed on time and on  budget. In 2006, the agency awarded three contracts for: (1) a  commercially available, defined benefits technology solution (DBTS) to  automate retirement processing; (2) services to convert paper records to  electronic files; and (3) consulting services to support the redesign of its  retirement operations. The contract for DBTS was awarded to Hewitt  Associates, and the additional contracts to support the technology were  awarded to Accenture Ltd. and Northrop Grumman Corporation, as  reflected in table 1.", "OPM produced a December 2007 program management plan that, among  other things, described capabilities the agency expected to implement as  outcomes of retirement modernization. Among these capabilities, the  agency expected to implement retirement benefit modeling and planning  tools for active federal employees, a standardized retirement benefit  calculation system, and a consolidated system to support all aspects of  retirement processing.", "In February 2008, OPM renamed the program RetireEZ and deployed a  limited initial version of DBTS. As the foundation of the modernization  initiative, DBTS was to be a comprehensive technology solution that  would provide capabilities to substantially automate retirement  processing. This technology was to be provided by the contractor for a  period of 10 years and was intended to provide, among other things, an  integrated database with calculation functionality for retirement  processing. In addition to calculating retirement benefit amounts, DBTS  was intended to provide active and retired federal employees with self- service, Internet-based tools for accessing accounts, updating retirement  records, submitting transactions, monitoring the status of claims, and  forecasting retirement income. The technology was also expected to  enhance customer service by providing OPM and agency personnel with  the capability to access retirement information online. Further, the  technology was expected to be integrated with OPM and federal agency  electronic retirement records and processes. When fully implemented, the  modernized program was expected to serve OPM retirement processing  personnel, federal agency human resources and payroll offices, active  federal employees, retirees, and the beneficiaries of retirees.", "According to the agency, in late February 2008, the DBTS was deployed  with limited functionality to 26,000 federal employees serviced by the  General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA) payroll offices. In April 2008,  OPM reported that 13 of the 37 retirement applications received from  GSA\u2019s payroll office had been processed through DBTS with manual  intervention and provided the retirees 100 percent of their monthly  benefits within 30 days from their retirement date. However, a month later,  the agency determined that DBTS had not worked as expected and  suspended system operation. In October 2008, after 5 months of  attempting to address system quality issues, the agency terminated the  contract.", "In November 2008, OPM began restructuring the program and reported  that its efforts to modernize retirement processing would continue.

In  response, between 2005 and 2007, the agency initiated steps toward  establishing management processes for retirement modernization and  demonstrated the completion of activities with respect to each of our nine  recommendations.", "However, in January 2008, we reported that the agency still needed to  improve its management of the program to ensure a successful outcome  for its modernization efforts. Specifically, we reported that initial test  results had not provided assurance that DBTS would perform as intended,  the testing schedule increased the risk that the agency would not have  sufficient resources or time to ensure that all system components were  tested before deployment, and trends in identifying and resolving system  defects had indicated a growing backlog of problems to be resolved prior  to deployment. Further, we reported that although the agency had  established a risk management process, it had not reliably estimated the  program costs, and its progress reporting was questionable because it did  not reflect the actual state of the program. We recommended that the  Director of OPM address these deficiencies by conducting effective system  tests and resolving urgent and high priority system defects prior to system  deployment, in addition to improving program cost estimation and  progress reporting.", "In response to our report, OPM stated that it concurred with our  recommendations and was taking steps to address them.

The agency intends to complete this requirements  development effort in April 2009. However, the requirements will not be  derived from OPM\u2019s concept of operations because the agency is revising  the concept of operations expected to be completed by April 2009, to  reflect the program restructuring.

Despite  meeting regularly and being provided with information that indicated  problems with the retirement modernization, the board did not ensure that  the investment was on track, nor did it determine appropriate actions for  course correction when needed. For example, from January 2007 to  August 2008 the board met and was presented with reports that described  problems the retirement modernization program was facing, such as the  lack of an integrated master schedule and earned value data that did not  reflect the \u201creality or current status\u201d of the program.

Further, OPM\u2019s  retirement modernization program restructuring does not yet include  definitions of results-oriented goals and measures against which program  performance can be objectively and quantitatively assessed.", "In addition, OPM has not overcome managerial shortcomings in key areas  of program management, including areas that we have previously  reported. Specifically, the agency is not yet positioned to develop a  reliable program cost estimate or perform reliable EVM, both of which are  critical to effective program planning and oversight. Nor has OPM  overcome weaknesses in its management of system testing and defects,  two activities that proved problematic as the agency was preparing to  deploy the RetireEZ system that subsequently was terminated. Adding to  these long-standing concerns are weaknesses in OPM\u2019s process to  effectively develop and manage requirements for whatever system or  service it intends to acquire or develop. Finally, these weaknesses have  been allowed to persist by entities within the agency that were ineffective  in overseeing the retirement modernization program.", "As a consequence, the agency is faced with significant challenges on two  fronts: defining and transitioning to its restructured program, and  addressing new and previously identified managerial weaknesses. Until  OPM addresses these weaknesses, many of which were previously  identified by GAO and others, the agency\u2019s retirement modernization  initiative remains at risk of failure.
