GAO was asked to examine how much time airports spend completing runways, what challenges airports and other stakeholders experience during this process, and what airports and other stakeholders have done to address challenges related to runway projects. GAO analyzed the results of surveys from 30 airports on 32 runway projects and visited 5 airports in order to interview numerous runway project stakeholders. The Department of Transportation agreed with GAO's characterization of the challenges associated with building runways and some of the initiatives taken to address these challenges. They did express some concerns related to GAO's analysis of the time airports spent or estimated spending in developing runways, and suggested that GAO acknowledge additional FAA efforts to improve the runway process. We believe that our approach was a reasonable assessment of the amount of time taken to build runways; however, we clarified our discussion about the length of time. We also added information regarding initiatives undertaken by FAA."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The amount of time airports spend planning and building their runways can vary because of numerous factors. In light of this variation, for the 32 runway projects we analyzed, we used median rather than average time. The median time was about 10 years for runways that had been completed and was estimated to be about 14 years for those not completed. Most airports and stakeholders we visited and surveyed said they faced a variety of challenges that had delayed their runway projects. While the level of challenges that airports faced varied in part depending on the proximity of the airport to a major city and the amount of community opposition to the runway, some common themes emerged, including challenges related to the following: reaching stakeholder agreement on purpose and need for the runway; completing the environmental review process; reaching agreement on noise mitigation and other issues; and designing and constructing the runway. Although there may be no single solution to the challenges involved in developing runways, the federal government and airport authorities have undertaken a number of initiatives in this area. Recently, the President issued an Executive Order that is directed at streamlining the environmental review of transportation infrastructure projects, including runways. In addition, two federal legislative initiatives designed to streamline the runway process were considered in the 107th Congress. In addition, FAA has undertaken a number of initiatives directed at streamlining parts of the process. Airports have also undertaken initiatives in this area, including involving stakeholders such as community groups early in the process, and reaching early agreement on how best to mitigate noise and other runway impacts. These initiatives may be a step in the right direction, but it is too early to assess their impact on the runway process."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Although the events of September 11, 2001, diverted the aviation industry\u2019s  attention from airport flight capacity to security issues, aviation experts  believe that addressing capacity issues must be brought back to the  forefront to prevent costly flight delays and their negative effect on the U.S.  economy. According to a recent report on the impact on civil aviation, the  flight congestion and delay problems that were experienced in 2000 had a  significant effect on the entire U.S. economy and were felt not only in the  commercial aviation industry but also in the tourism and related supplier  industries. The report found that in 2000, commercial aviation delays  resulted in over $9 billion in negative economic effects on the entire U.S.  economy and cost commercial airlines over $3 billion. In addition, the  report stated that if there were no new investments in airport construction  (including new runways) or in the air traffic system beyond 2000, delays  could potentially cost the U.S. economy $13.5 billion in 2007 and $17.2  billion in 2012.", "Building runways can involve years of planning, an extensive  environmental review phase, and the design and construction of the actual  runway. Airport authorities who want to build a runway must also  coordinate with numerous stakeholders, including airlines, federal and  state officials, and community groups. In addition, they may face legal  challenges from opponents of the runway that can take years to resolve.  Nonetheless, according to FAA, despite these challenges, building new  runways is widely regarded as the most effective way to increase capacity  in the national airspace system and is critical to the entire U.S. economy.  This report provides information on the process for building runways,  taking into consideration the needs of the system and the concerns of the  various stakeholders. Specifically, as agreed with your offices, we address  the following questions: 1. How much time do airports spend building their runway projects, and  what challenges do airports and other stakeholders experience during  this process? 2. What have airports and other stakeholders done or proposed to do to  address the challenges they experienced in building runways?", "To determine the amount of time that airports spent to complete runway  projects, along with challenges that airports and other stakeholders faced  during this process and initiatives to address these challenges, we surveyed  30 airports that had built or planned to build a total of 32 runways between  1991 and 2010. Based on survey responses, we selected 5 airports that were  diverse in size, location, and challenges at which we conducted in-depth  site visits in order to understand the perspectives of numerous  stakeholders. At these locations, we interviewed airport, airline, federal  and state, and community officials about their experiences. We also visited  the Lester B. Pearson International Airport in Toronto, Canada, to gain a  perspective on the Canadian runway development process. A more detailed  explanation of the scope and methodology can be found in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The decision to build runways has traditionally elicited strong and often  emotional reactions among stakeholders, both negative and positive.  Generally, these reactions are directed at the decision to build a runway\u2014 usually in response to the perceived environmental or economic impacts  that the proposed project will have on the surrounding communities. Often,  opponents to a runway project base their opposition on the belief that the  negative impact of the runway on their quality of life will outweigh the  projected benefits of the project. At other times, opponents contend that  alternatives such as high-speed rail, regional airports, or demand  management are better alternatives to resolving delay issues than building  new runways. In contrast, proponents of new runway projects generally  contend that building new runways can increase the level of service and  reduce delay at the airport, can result in a positive economic impact to the  region served by the airport, and in some cases can reduce noise pollution  by distributing flights over a larger geographical area.", "Airports that plan to build runways must comply with what can become a  complex process involving three general phases that often overlap:  planning, environmental review, and design and construction. In addition,  airports can be involved in legal actions that can occur in any or all of the  three phases.", "The first phase in the runway development process is planning. According  to FAA guidance, airports should begin planning for a new runway when  the airport has reached 60 to 75 percent of total annual flight capacity.  During the planning phase, airport authorities and local officials begin by  identifying the type of development needed at a specific airport and the  proposed project\u2019s estimated cost and benefits, in both political and  economic terms. Some of the planning tasks include establishing the  purpose and need for the runway (for example, assessing the capability of  current facilities, reviewing and refining aviation demand forecasts, and  evaluating options to accommodate forecast demands), coordinating land  use issues with community planning boards, and preparing capacity  enhancement plans, master plans, airspace reviews, cost benefit analyses,  and airport layout plans. Further, most airports consider numerous  alternatives for increasing capacity or reducing delay before deciding on a  project to pursue. During this phase, airports will begin addressing how to  fund the proposed project.", "The environmental review phase, which often overlaps with planning, is the  second phase in the runway development process. This phase typically  begins with a determination by FAA of the extent to which a proposed  project will affect the quality of the environment. To make this  determination, FAA examines the proposed project and its possible  environmental impacts on air and water quality, on noise, and on historical  lands. FAA will make one of three determinations. If the agency determines  that the scope of the project is such that it will not directly affect the  environment, it will issue a categorical exclusion. If FAA determines that a  project will have a measurable effect on the environment, but that its  impact will not exceed guidelines established in the agency\u2019s  Environmental Handbook, it will issue a Finding of No Significant Impact  (FONSI). After issuance of a FONSI, runway projects can begin applying  for necessary permits, such as those that may be required under the Clean  Air Act or the Clean Water Act. Where potentially significant impacts are  obvious, FAA will proceed directly to the preparation of an environmental  impact statement (EIS) rather than start with the airport sponsors\u2019  environmental assessment.", "If FAA determines that a proposed project will have significant  environmental effects, it will issue a notice of intent to prepare an EIS. An  EIS includes an analysis of the potential environmental effects of a  proposed project and how to mitigate significant impacts. Council on  Environmental Quality (CEQ) regulations do not require that all impacts be  mitigated; agencies are required to disclose impacts that will not be  mitigated, and the reason. After the draft EIS is completed, FAA provides it  to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), which publishes a notice of  its availability in the Federal Register, where it is made available for review  and comment to federal, state, and local agencies and the public for at least  45 days. Public hearings, if necessary, usually occur during the review and  comment period. At the end of the public comment period, FAA responds  to comments received on the draft and prepares the final EIS. Once FAA  approves the final EIS, the document is printed, distributed, and once again  filed with EPA. EPA subsequently publishes notice of the availability of the  final EIS in the Federal Register. According to CEQ regulations, FAA can  not issue a Record of Decision (ROD) for at least 30 days after the  publication of the final EIS. Once the final EIS has been issued, it takes FAA  an average of about 3 months to issue a ROD. The ROD, which is the final  step of the environmental review process, summarizes the administrative  record of the agency\u2019s proposals, alternatives, analysis, findings/  determinations, decisions, actions, and mitigation measures that were  made a condition of approval of the EIS. If, however, FAA finds that the  revised draft differs significantly from the initial draft, the agency may  issue a supplemental draft EIS and release this document for further review  and comment. In addition, other factors that may lead to a supplemental  EIS include a change in the proposed action, a change in the agency\u2019s  decision, or new reasonable alternatives not previously evaluated. A  supplemental draft EIS can occur anywhere in the environmental process.", "In addition to the requirements above, airport sponsors may be required to  obtain environmental permits/approvals from other state, local, and federal  agencies before they can begin construction of the proposed project. These  permits/approvals cover various federal and state requirements related to  wetlands, water and air quality, coastal zone management, and endangered  species, among others. These requirements arise from various regulations,  including the federal Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. For example, the  Army Corp of Engineers requires permits when proposed projects have an  impact on wetlands under the Clean Water Act. State and local agencies  may also be responsible for requiring permits dealing with air and water  quality. Similar to the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process,  the permitting process may include a public review and comment period.  Project opponents may initiate litigation once the final EIS has been  approved and the FAA has issued a favorable ROD. However, a lawsuit can  be filed at any time during the planning, environmental, and design and  construction phases.", "Following the completion of the permit process, project sponsors generally  begin the final phase of the runway development process\u2014the design and  construction phase. This phase includes a myriad of tasks, such as project  engineering, financing, contracting, land acquisition, site preparation, and  actual project construction. This phase also includes construction tasks  related to mitigating noise, wetland, and other environmental impacts.  According to FAA, it is common for airport sponsors to begin runway  design while the environmental process is underway in the interest of  saving time by undertaking these actions concurrently. Once construction  of the runway has been completed, FAA certifies the runway for operation  and commissions it for service. Figure 1 illustrates the main steps involved  in the runway development process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Airports Have Spent Many Years Building Runways and Have Faced a Variety of Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The amount of time that airports spend planning and building their  runways can vary because of a number of factors. For example, although it  is relatively straightforward to determine the beginning and ending of the  environmental and the design and construction phases of the process,  there is no consensus about what constitutes the beginning of the planning  phase. Consequently, the length of time and the number of activities  considered by some airports to be part of the planning phase vary. Airports  also described a variety of challenges that they said delayed their projects.  Many of these challenges related to reaching stakeholder agreement,  completing the environmental review phase, mitigating the impact of noise,  or designing and constructing the actual runway."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Completed Runways Took a Median of 10 Years to Build, and Unfinished Runways May Take Even Longer", "paragraphs": ["As shown in figure 2, airports we surveyed reported spending a wide range  of time in completing runway projects. In general, airports reported  spending less time on completed projects than they estimate they will  spend on those projects not yet completed; for example, airports reported  that about half of the completed runways took 10 years or less but  estimated that almost all the projects that were not yet completed (16 out  of 17) would take 10 years or more. According to the airports with  uncompleted projects, a number of factors contributed to the time spent,  such as community opposition and difficulties in dealing with  environmental requirements.", "Figure 3 shows that the median time spent on completed runway projects  was about 10 years, while the median time airports estimated they would  spend on runway projects not yet completed was about 14 years. Similarly,  the median time spent on the planning and environmental phases for  airports that had completed these phases was significantly shorter than the  median time airports estimated would be spent on those phases for  projects that they had not yet completed. This may have been because the  three projects in the planning phase and the five projects in the  environmental phase were experiencing challenges that the airports  believed would delay the completion of the respective phases. Moreover,  the median time spent on the environmental phase of projects that had  completed their environmental requirements under a FONSI was about 2.7  years, while the median time spent on the environmental phase of projects  that had completed their environmental requirements with an EIS was  about 3.7 years. This difference is likely attributable to the greater number  of requirements that accompany an EIS as compared with a FONSI.", "In May 2001, the Department of Transportation issued a report to the  Congress on an environmental review of airport improvement projects that  reported results similar to our analysis. As a part of its analysis, FAA  measured the average time that elapsed between the start of planning and  the start of construction for 10 airports that received approval for a new  runway between 1996 and 2000. FAA found that the average time from thestart of planning until the start of construction was about 10 years. The  report also stated that the average time to complete an EIS for a new  runway was 3.25 years from the beginning of the EIS process to the  issuance of the Record of Decision\u2014or about one-third of the 10-year time.  According to FAA, there can be a considerable lag from the inception of the  runway process until the runway is completed and in operation. FAA added  that these delays occur as part of the process that airports sometimes go  through in seeking to achieve consensus and the political will to move  forward while contending with local public and political opposition to  runway development. According to FAA, numerous examples can be found  where runway development has been delayed 5, 10, or more years while  plans are revised, discarded, or shelved until political and/or economic  factors can be satisfied. FAA stated that these actions make it difficult to  determine how long it takes to build a runway."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Themes Emerged among the Challenges That Airports Described", "paragraphs": ["Most airports that we surveyed and visited described significant factors  that delayed their runway projects. In many cases, the challenges they  described were interrelated. For example, several airports said they faced  significant community opposition, which affected their ability to reach  stakeholder agreement and to complete the environmental review phase.  Although many of the airports we surveyed experienced similar types of  challenges, some airports, such as those in Boston, Atlanta, and Seattle,  faced a heightened level of challenges because of their locations in urban  areas with a large number of residences very close by. Some of the specific  challenges identified by airports and other stakeholders we visited include  the following: Reaching stakeholder agreement. Reaching consensus on the purpose  and need for a runway was described by several airports as being  particularly challenging. In order to reach this consensus, airports  generally must meet numerous times with stakeholders who may have  differing opinions about the runway project or uses of land surrounding the  airport. For example, airport officials in Los Angeles and Boston described  challenges related to working with community interest groups and local  metropolitan planning organizations that opposed the runway projects and  advocated using means other than building a new runway to address  capacity issues, such as developing regional airports, building new airports,  or pursuing alternative transportation modes like high-speed rail.", "Some airports described challenges related to reaching agreement with  stakeholders other than community groups. For example, stakeholders in  Seattle said that reaching agreement was challenging on issues such as  where the runway should be located or the coordination of sometimes  inconsistent land use plans among various planning groups. Officials at  Boston\u2019s Logan Airport said they could not reach agreement with FAA, a  key stakeholder on all runway projects, regarding what was needed to  satisfy the environmental review process. Specifically, Logan Airport  officials disagreed with FAA\u2019s decision to extend its environmental process  by requiring a supplemental EIS because they believed that environmental  issues had been settled during the initial analysis. They believed that FAA\u2019s  decision to require the supplemental draft stemmed from significant public  and political pressure from those opposed to the project.", "Completing the environmental review phase. Of the 30 airports we  surveyed, 13 stated that one of their most significant challenges in planning  and building their runways was complying with environmental  requirements. Under the current process, airports must comply with over  40 federal laws, executive orders, and regulations that often overlap with  the environmental requirements mandated by some states. For example,  federal law requires the governor of each state to certify that federally  funded runways conform to local air quality standards, a requirement  known as the Governor\u2019s certification. In addition, the Clean Air Act  requires FAA to determine whether emissions from each airport project  conform to its state\u2019s plan for implementing national air quality standards.  According to officials from the American Association of Airport Executives  and Airports Council International, many state air quality plans contain  unrealistically low airport emissions budgets, and few realistically  anticipate reasonable airport growth. They believe that coordinating  airport development activity with the state air quality plans causes a major  source of delay and risk to airport projects. The officials also noted that the  Governor\u2019s Certificate requirement duplicates requirements found in the  Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act.", "Moreover, several airports, including those in Boston, Atlanta, Houston,  and Minneapolis-St. Paul, commented that obtaining the permits necessary  to complete the environmental review was a challenge that delayed their  projects, because permitting agencies often took much longer than  expected. Boston Logan officials stated that they experienced delays  because the permitting agencies did not agree on the order in which the  permits should be issued. For example, the coastal zone management  agency was unwilling to issue its permit until FAA issued the ROD;  however, FAA was unwilling to issue the ROD until the coastal permit was  issued. According to FAA officials, the agency was able to obtain a  satisfactory assurance from the state permitting agency that allowed FAA  to move forward with the issuance of the ROD. As a result, according to  FAA officials, they were able to avoid a significant delay.", "Mitigating the impact of noise and other issues. As we reported in  October 2000, mitigating the potential impact of aircraft noise on the  surrounding community continues to be a significant challenge for airports  that are building new runways. One of the reasons is that community  concerns with aircraft noise are generally already high around many  airports, and adding new runways adds to the already heightened concern.  Another reason, according to some stakeholders, why mitigating noise is  particularly challenging for several of the airports is because they do not  participate in FAA\u2019s voluntary Part 150 Noise Compatibility Program, which  provides funding to airports to help mitigate the impact of noise on the  communities. Several other airports also told us that their noise problems  are the result of incompatible land uses (existing or planned) around the  airports.", "In addition to mitigating the impact of noise on the surrounding  community, officials at Sea-Tac Airport said that they were equally  challenged to mitigate the impact of the project on wetlands, particularly  because two key stakeholders had conflicting views on how this should be  done. According to Sea-Tac officials, the state of Washington has a strong  preference that mitigation measures for wetland and stream impacts be  located in the same water basin where the impacts occur. However,  because of concerns about attracting wildlife, and the danger to aircraft of  bird strikes, FAA strongly advises that airports avoid locating wetlands  within 10,000 feet of runways.", "Design and construction of the runway. Several airports commented  that they also faced some challenges during the design and construction  phase of their runways. For example, Dallas-Fort Worth officials stated that  adverse weather conditions created construction problems for them, as the  region\u2019s high temperatures made it difficult to ensure that concrete poured  for the runway would cure properly. Airport officials at Sea-Tac also  described challenges related to the design and construction phase. For  example, before Sea-Tac can build its runway it has to import 17 million  cubic yards of dirt to the airport to extend a plateau for a foundation. Thus,  the airport authority has to find suitable, nonpolluted fill dirt to use for the  foundation. Once the dirt is located, it must be transported to the airport  over an indirect route using trucks that the airport is required to clean  before they leave the airport. Finally, the airport authority is to use  extensive mitigation measures to ensure that moving the dirt will not  adversely affect the surrounding communities and wetlands.", "Appendixes II through VI provide a detailed description of how various  challenges have affected runway projects at the Boston, Dallas, Memphis,  Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Seattle airports, according to airport authorities  and other stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "A Number of Initiatives Are Underway to Address Challenges Related to Building Runways", "paragraphs": ["While there may be no single solution to all the challenges associated with  planning and building runways, the federal government and airports have  undertaken a number of initiatives to address the challenges related to  such issues as duplicative environmental requirements, stakeholder  differences, and noise mitigation.

In an August 2000 report to the Congress on aviation and the  environment, we suggested that Congress may wish to consider eliminating  the state air quality certification requirements in airport legislation  becauseit is duplicative of protections offered under the Clean Air Act.  FAA officials stated that they agreed with our suggestion and believed that  a parallel situation exists with respect to state water quality certification,  which is largely duplicative of protections under the Clean Water Act.

With respect to  planning, FAA prepared an internal Memorandum of Agreement in  September 2002 to standardize the procedures for establishing  multidisciplinary teams to participate in major airport planning studies.  The agency has plans to update its guidance on airport master plans and to  upgrade an airspace and ground capacity simulation model in fiscal year  2003, and to update its guidance on airport terminal planning and design by  the end of fiscal year 2004. With respect to streamlining the environmental  review process, FAA began implementing several initiatives in January  2001 that are designed to produce measurable improvements. FAA began  establishing multidisciplinary EIS teams for new EISs at large hub primary  airports, reallocating staff resources and seeking airport reimbursable  agreements to support environmental work, and increasing the use of  consultants to assist FAA with coordination and administration of EISs.", "To increase coordination and assign accountability for runway  development tasks to key stakeholders, FAA began another initiative in  August 2001 as a part of its Operational Evolution Plan\u2014a 10-year plan to  expand and modernize the nation\u2019s airport system. FAA developed detailed  plans called Runway Template Action Plans to provide a standard set of  tasks that must be considered when developing new runways. FAA has  completed Runway Template Action Plans for 12 airports that are expected  to complete new runways by 2008. According to FAA officials, the agency  has met the deadlines for its commitments at all of the airports, and no  runway completion date has changed as a result of FAA actions since the  program began.", "While the Executive Order and the proposed legislation were designed to  address challenges some of the airports experienced, it is too early to  assess their impact; the Executive Order was only recently signed, and the  legislation did not pass in the 107th session of Congress.

These  actions included proactive approaches to working with stakeholders to  plan for and mitigate various impacts of the runway projects on  neighboring communities. For example, the Louisville airport used an  unusual approach to deal with the needs of neighboring homeowners who  would be required to move in order to be outside the noise parameter levels  posed by the new runway. After reaching agreement on the market value  that the airport would pay for each home, the airport offered these  residents a choice: residents either could move to a new home of equal  value in a new community development being built by the airport, or they  could participate in the traditional relocation program, where the airport  purchases the home and the family relocates to a home and location of its  choosing. Airport officials stated that this approach worked well for both  the airport and the displaced residents. According to airport officials, the  residents benefited because those who wished to stay together as a  community (which was the preference of many) were able to do so, and the  airport saved approximately $17,000 per home on those homes built in the  new community development.", "A Washington State Department of Transportation official stated that  minimizing controversy over the uses of land needed for expanding runway  capacity could be important in avoiding lengthy project delays. The  department developed an Airport Land Use Compatibility Program,  implementing a 1996 amendment of the Washington State Growth  Management Act\u2014the state\u2019s land-use planning law. The law requires cities  and counties to identify, site, and protect essential public facilities  (including airports) from incompatible land use, such as encroaching  development. In other words, when developing local land-use plans, cities  and counties must ensure that their plans do not adversely affect these  facilities. As part of the land-use compatibility program, certain state  transportation officials provide consultations, including mediation,  between airport sponsors and community representatives (often municipal  or county planning staff) to balance the state\u2019s dual interest of promoting  aviation and ensuring the health, safety, and welfare of its residents. The  approach to facilitating airports\u2019 future expansion includes several steps,  including the development of planning-based solutions and the integration  of those solutions into a legally enforceable document, such as a  comprehensive development plan\u2014rather than the Airport Master Plan,  which is not binding on land-use authority\u2014in order to increase the  probability that the solutions will succeed.", "In Minneapolis, the airport attempted to build consensus throughout the  project by considering mitigation agreements that were more liberal than  those required by FAA. For example, the airport has been pursuing a liberal  noise-mitigation strategy in order to better address community concerns  about noise impacts. The airport chose to keep residential blocks together  for noise-mitigation measures, whether or not the entire block fell within  the same noise contour. In other words, if one residence in a block lay  within the 65-decibel Day Night Average Sound Level (DNL) noise contour,  every residence on the block received similar mediation measures.  Another challenge for which the airport had to develop a solution was  mitigating the noise impacts on a National Wildlife Refuge located within  the flight path of the new runway. The refuge contains an educational  center and is a popular location for bird watching. The refuge contended  that the usefulness of the center and bird watching activities would be  severely impacted by noise from the runway. The airport and the refuge  were ultimately able to negotiate an agreement whereby the airport  authority would pay the organization $26 million for the right to conduct  flight operations over the refuge.", "In Dallas-Fort Worth, the airport chose to implement a four-stage approach  to mitigating the noise impacts of the runway project: 1) direct land  acquisition for properties located in the runway protection zone, 2) direct  land acquisition of certain properties for noise mitigation, 3) sound  proofing structures for noise mitigation, and 4) acquisition of aviation  easements. Airport officials noted that the first three stages of the  mitigation plan are standard among most runway projects and, in the case  of acquiring properties in the runway protection zone, required of all  airports. However, with respect to aviation easements, the airport  undertook an approach that it considered to be extraordinary at the time.  The airport offered residents 25 percent of the fair market value of their  property to acquire easements for noise impacts. The easements are  attached to the property deed, affecting the current property owner and all  future owners of that property.", "Overall, the airports that described these initiatives believed they had a  positive impact on their runway projects. Other airports described similar  initiatives that they believed were helpful in facilitating the completion of  the various phases of their projects.

The survey population included  30 airports, 16 of which had built their airports between 1991 and 2000, and  14 of which had planned to build new runways by 2010. The survey,  conducted in February 2002, provided data on the amount of time that 30  airports spent in planning and building 32 runway projects; on key factors  that accelerated or delayed the projects; and on initiatives that airports  have taken to address the challenges they faced during the process.", "Based on our analysis of the survey responses, we judgmentally selected  five airports at which to conduct site visits, to develop a more in-depth  understanding of the experiences and challenges they faced. We  subsequently visited Boston Logan, Dallas-Fort Worth, Memphis Shelby  County, Minneapolis-St. Paul, and Seattle-Tacoma Airports, where we  interviewed the airport authority, FAA, hub airlines, state agencies,  metropolitan planning organizations, and local community and  environmental groups about their experiences with the runway projects. In  addition, we also interviewed officials from Lester B. Pearson International  Airport in Toronto, Canada, and Transport Canada to gain an understanding  of the Canadian runway development process.", "We also compared our analysis with FAA\u2019s May 2001 report. While the  results of the two studies are similar, there are some methodological  differences between the two studies. First, our measurement begins at the  start of planning and ends with the completion of the runway. In contrast,  FAA\u2019s measurement begins with planning but ends with the beginning of  the design and construction phase. Second, GAO\u2019s analysis is based on the  median time, which minimizes the impact of runways that take a very long  or a very short time to complete; FAA\u2019s estimate, however, is based on the  average time, which does not account for the impact of outliers. Based on  our survey responses, when considering the average time, we found that  airports that had completed their projects took 12.25 years and airports  that had not yet completed their projects estimated that their projects  would take about 16 years. Third, our survey allowed the airports to  determine the beginning and end of each of the process phases, whereas  FAA selected specific events for analysis. For example, FAA\u2019s analysis  based the end of the environmental review phase on the issuance of the  ROD. Certain airports responding to GAO\u2019s survey included federal and  state permits as part of the environmental process. FAA\u2019s May 2001 report  found that federal and state permits can take 6 to 12 months or more to  complete after the ROD. Finally, each of the two analyses examined a  different universe of airports. FAA analyzed data on 10 airports that had  projects approved between 1996 and 2000. GAO analyzed data on over 30  runway projects that were completed, or expected to be completed,  between 1991 and 2010.

According to FAA, airport, state, and airline officials,  Logan plays a critical role in the New England economy, and it serves as the  region\u2019s long-haul and international gateway airport. According to  Massport officials, in 2000, the airport handled 27.4 million passengers and  contributed about $6.6 billion to the regional economy, supporting about  100,000 jobs. It was North America\u2019s nineteenth-busiest in terms of  passenger traffic. Logan is consistently ranked as one of the nation\u2019s most  delayed airports. In 2000, Logan was the sixth-most delayed airport overall  and second-most delayed for arrivals. Logan is served by all the major U.S.  carriers. The top carriers are U.S. Airways, American, and Delta, with  roughly equal shares of passenger traffic. The airport is primarily an origin  and destination point, with about 90 percent of the passengers beginning or  ending their trips at Logan.", "In good weather, Logan generally operates on a north-south, three-runway  configuration with a capacity of about 120 flight operations per hour.  However, during adverse weather conditions (such as northwest or  southeast winds in excess of 10 knots per hour, which occur about one- third of the year), the airport can be reduced to as few as 60 to 90  operations per hour on an east-west, one- or two-runway operation.  Massport believes that its proposed 5,000-foot, unidirectional runway will  avoid the significant reduction in efficiency during adverse weather  conditions and help mitigate weather-related delays. Massport views the  runway as a capacity-neutral airfield enhancement, which means that the  proposed runway will decrease delays without increasing the airport\u2019s top  capacity of about 120 flights per hour. The Massachusetts Executive Office  of Environmental Affairs administers the Massachusetts Environmental  Policy Act, the state\u2019s environmental protection act. In its Final  Environmental Impact Report certificate, the Secretary, Massachusetts  Executive Office of  Environmental Affairs, stated that the central  environmental question is not whether the project is accommodating or  generating demand per se, but rather whether Massport is operating the  airport in a manner that avoids, minimizes, or mitigates environmental  impacts in light of its obligations under MEPA. An official from the  environmental office stated that the project might increase airfield  capacity, but that an airport capacity determination was beyond the scope  of its review.

Further, because of the  injunction, Massport decided not to actively pursue the project until the  project was reinstituted in 1995, based on an FAA Capacity Enhancement  Study. Logan is an example of an airport that has spent a long time in the  process, and it has gone through several iterations of the EIS review  process.", "We interviewed officials at Massport, who were the main sponsors of the  new, sixth runway at Logan.

According to FAA, Massachusetts  Executive Office of Environmental Affairs, American Eagle Airlines, the  High Technology Council, and Massport officials themselves, the public  appears to distrust Massport.

However, according to both FAA and Massport, this effort  was suspended for about 18 months between 1996 and 1998, when the  entire runway project stalled because of a change in Massport leadership  and priorities. In 1998, according to Massport officials, the airport  attempted to pick up the environmental review process where it had been  suspended. Community groups complained that they had not been part of  the recent process and appealed to FAA that the Draft EIS was no longer  accurate, complete, or up-to-date.

Massport, the Massachusetts High Technology Council, and American  Eagle Airlines all believe that FAA\u2019s decision was unreasonable. Massport  officials contended that the project had already undergone 5 years of public  process, that continuation was unlikely to help achieve local consensus,  and that they believed it had not.  FAA officials, however, believe that it did  result in a better, more informative EIS document.", "Individuals, communities, action groups, and business groups submitted  comments  during public information meetings and hearings and in  response to the Draft EIS and Final EIR documents that were extensive.  For example, about 800 people attended the two April 2001 public hearings  for the Supplemental Draft EIS document and about 850 comment letters  were received during the 75-day comment period.", "The Supplemental Draft EIS took about 1 year to complete, and it delayed  the filing of the Final EIS by about 1.5 years, according to Massport. During  this time, in another attempt to develop agreement among stakeholders,  FAA chaired a city and commonwealth Task Force to request further  comments to the Draft EIS for incorporation into the Supplemental Draft  EIS. Although this group met, analyzed, and discussed many runway issues,  not all stakeholders were pleased with its outcome. For example,  Communities Against Runway Expansion stated that the products of the  panel\u2019s work, the Supplemental Draft EIS and the Final Environmental  Impact Review, were inaccurate and inconclusive, and they justified the  runway without proposing a viable alternative.", "In late June 2002, FAA issued the Final EIS for public comment, as required  by the NEPA process. FAA received approximately 100 comment letters  raising 42 main issues, ranging from general opposition to a concern about  the adequacy of technical analyses. FAA said that it responded to the  comments as required and issued its final approval, the ROD, in August  2002. In both the Final EIS and the ROD, FAA included a restriction (which  Massport officials said was unprecedented) that the proposed runway be  used only when winds create conditions in which the usefulness of other  current runways is limited. FAA considers this wind restriction a  mitigation measure, as it would ensure that the runway was not used to  increase capacity during good weather. Many stakeholders\u2014including  proponents and opponents\u2014view this restriction as a compromise  designed to achieve consensus, but others, such as community groups,  maintain that the wind restriction does not go far enough to mitigate the  environmental effects of this project. Communities Against Runway  Expansion continued to contest FAA\u2019s approval in the press and in federal  court and, through an urgent message on its Web page, urged others to  respond to the Final EIS. Moreover, Massport and Massachusetts Executive  Office of Environmental Affairs officials said that, by issuing the ROD with  wind restrictions, FAA could reactivate the state environmental review  process because the approved project differs significantly from what  Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs approved in  2001. Subsequently, the Executive Office of Environmental Affairs chose  not to reexamine the environmental document because it did not believe  that the wind restriction significantly changed the environmental impacts  of the runway.", "FAA, Massport, and American Eagle Airlines said that, during the length of  time spent attempting to get all of the environmental approvals needed,  some assumptions made early on in the process have been called into  question. For example, concerns have been raised that traffic forecasts  may not materialize, that the increasing use of Regional Jets may change  the equipment mix more than planned, and that the 5,000 foot runway may  not be long enough to be as useful as hoped. They believe that these issues  played a part in triggering FAA\u2019s Supplemental Draft EIS process. However,  a Massachusetts Executive Office of Environmental Affairs official stated  that it is not possible to \u201cfreeze\u201d the process to figure out all the answers  before making a decision. According to many stakeholders, the  environmental review process is a continuous cycle in which comments  require additional study, which leads to revisions, which lead to more  comments, which lead to additional study. They contend that the circuitous  nature of the process is the primary source of delay. The Massachusetts  environmental permit process has important time triggers that allow for the  process to come to an end.

FAA officials said  that they understood that the Corps had only six staff members to review  about 1,000 water quality permits, and according to state aviation  department officials, the Corps had a significant backlog in processing  permit applications.", "Additionally, an official from the state Department of Ecology said that the  Sea-Tac runway project had been a significant drain on resources at the  agency. The agency has had difficulty finding sufficient resources to  complete environmental reviews and must redirect personnel from other  functions. The official said that, because of the shortage of state funds,  applicants wanting reviews to proceed quickly will have to bear the burden  of funding water quality reviews. Sea-Tac officials noted that additional  staff resources are needed in regulatory agencies in order to process  environmental permits in a timely manner and, aside from adding federal  funding, funding could be provided by project proponents. The airport  acknowledged that agencies were reluctant to accept funding because of a  concern with potential conflicts of interest. The airport suggested that  Congress could make guidelines under which the agencies could remain  impartial. The purpose of allowing such funding would not be to curry  favor but to work efficiently with the federal government to get runways  built. They asserted that these staff would work exclusively under FAA\u2019s  supervision and would be under no obligation to the airport.

According to Sea-Tac  officials, in order to bring the new runway site up to the elevation of its  other two runways, a 17\u2013million cubic yard landfill and embankment is  being built. The embankment will require three retaining walls to reduce  impacts on a nearby creek and wetlands and to accommodate safety areas  at the ends of the runway. The walls are mechanically stabilized, using  concrete panels and layers of galvanized reinforced strips that bind to and  reinforce the embankment material in a coherent way. According to the  Port, this type of wall is highly earthquake resistant, and it has been used  successfully elsewhere in the United States. In April 2002, Sea-Tac Airport  officials said that the communities surrounding the airport were concerned  that the wall will collapse or will be unable to withstand an earthquake.  However, according to airport officials, the airport used the services of  consulting engineers, geotechnical consultants, and earthquake engineers  from companies and the University of Washington, and sought advice from  a technical review board in developing the wall design to ensure that it is  safe.

The airport  authority is a private, not-for-profit corporation. Its 15-member Board of  Directors is composed of nominees from the City of Toronto, the Province  of Ontario, the Government of Canada, and four regional municipalities.

Prior to the development of the EIS, the airport authority begins the  process with scoping. The scoping process is a public process. According  to airport officials, every project goes through environmental screening  (equivalent to an Environmental Assessment) as a part of the planning  process. When the Pearson project went through the screening process, the  airport authority was responsible for conducting environmental screening.  However, current legislation requires that the screening results be available  to the public.", "The Minister of Transport and the Minister of the Environment  cooperatively choose an Environmental Review Panel consisting of  government officials and knowledgeable local residents (that is,  academics.)

Canadian  airports are also subject to site-specific constraints attributable primarily  to the northern climate.", "Because of the northern climate, airport operations in Toronto require  extensive ice removal in the winter months, resulting in the use of a large  quantity of Glycol that can cause an environmental impact on surrounding  wetlands. The airport straddles both the Etobicoke and Mimico Creek  watersheds, covering 1,640 hectares of land. Most of the airport, including  runways, cargo areas, Terminal Three, Terminal One aprons, and infield  areas, drains to Etobicoke Creek. According to the Toronto and Region  Conservation Authority, although runoff contamination from these sources  is a concern, significant progress has recently been made to mitigate the  airport's impact on water quality through the expanded use of wastewater  and storm water recovery and containment systems. Airport officials cited  their wastewater treatment facility as contributing greatly to allaying the  concerns of residents over ground and surface water contamination, and  they stated that the airport has never exceeded contaminant limits.", "The Council of Concerned Residents, a coalition of three residents\u2019  associations near the airport, opposed the expansion of the airport  fundamentally on the premise that the projects would increase the noise  impacts on their communities.
