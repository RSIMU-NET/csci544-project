Phased retirement is one option that can be used to encourage older workers to stay in the workforce. GAO was asked to look at phased retirement programs in the United States and other countries. In June 2017, GAO issued a report (GAO-17-536) that looked at phased retirement in the United States, where formal phased retirement programs are as yet uncommon. This report looks at phased retirement in other countries.", "Specifically, GAO examined (1) the extent to which phased retirement exists in other countries with aging populations, (2) the key aspects of phased retirement programs in selected countries, and (3) the experiences of other countries in providing phased retirement and how their experiences can inform policies in the United States.", "GAO analyzed relevant data, reviewed academic research, and conducted interviews to identify countries with phased retirement, and selected four countries with national policies permitting phased retirement programs with broad coverage for case studies.

These countries also have arrangements that allow workers to reduce their working hours as they transition into retirement, referred to as \u201cphased retirement.\u201d Phased retirement arrangements encourage older workers who might otherwise retire immediately to continue working, which could help alleviate pressures on national pension systems as well as address labor shortages of skilled workers. The17 countries had established phased retirement programs in different ways: at the national level via broad policy that sets a framework for employers; at the industry or sector level; or by single employers, often through the collective bargaining process.", "GAO's four case study countries\u2014Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom (UK)\u2014were described as employing various strategies at the national level to encourage phased retirement, and specific programs differed with respect to design specifics and sources of supplemental income for participants. Canada and the U.K. were described as having national policies that make it easier for workers to reduce their hours and receive a portion of their pension benefits from employer-sponsored pension plans while continuing to accrue pension benefits in the same plan. Experts described two national programs available to employers and workers in Germany, with one program using tax preferences. Experts also said Sweden implemented a policy in 2010 that allows partial retirement and access to partial pension benefits to encourage workers to stay in the labor force longer.", "Even with unique considerations in the United States, other countries' experiences with phased retirement could inform U.S. efforts. Some employer-specific conditions, such as employers offering employee-directed retirement plans and not being covered by collective bargaining are more common in the United States, but the case study countries included examples of designs for phased retirement programs in such settings. Certain programs allow access to employer-sponsored or national pension benefits while working part-time. For example, experts said the U.K. allows workers to draw a portion of their account based pension tax-free, and one U.K. employer GAO spoke to also allows concurrent contributions to those plans. In addition, experts said that certain program design elements help determine the success of some programs. Such elements could inform the United States experience. For instance, U.S. employers told us that while offering phased retirement to specific groups of workers may be challenging because of employment discrimination laws, a union representative in Germany noted that they reached an agreement where employers may set restrictions or caps on participation, such as 3 percent of the workforce, to manage the number of workers in the program. Employers in the U.S. could explore whether using a similar approach, taking into consideration any legal concerns or other practical challenges, could help them to control the number of workers participating in phased retirement programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making recommendations in this report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The aging of the labor force has resulted in many policies designed to  keep older workers in the work force longer.

In June 2017, we issued a report  that examined phased retirement programs in the U.S., and this report  examines phased retirement programs in other countries. The  experiences in other countries regarding phased retirement could provide  useful information to the United States where formal phased retirement  programs are not yet common.", "Our 2017 report on phased retirement in the U.S. found that although  phased retirement programs are uncommon, the programs that do exist  provide flexibility for workers and employers.

Then we used United  Nations population data to identify countries with an aging population\u2014 those with a high percentage of people aged 50 and over\u2014which further  narrowed our list to 44 countries. Next, to determine whether these  countries have phased retirement arrangements, we conducted literature  searches and reviews of relevant research published in the last 10 years;  reviewed data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and  Development (OECD); and consulted with subject matter experts. This  approach resulted in 17 countries with some form of phased or gradual  retirement options for older workers. From these 17 countries, we  selected 4 countries for case studies\u2014Canada, Germany, Sweden, and  the United Kingdom (U.K.)\u2014that have national policies with relatively  broad coverage to encourage phased retirement. To understand the  characteristics of the phased retirement programs in the case study  countries and whether experiences with the programs could inform efforts  in the U.S., we conducted interviews with government officials,  employers, employer associations, unions, and other experts.

The option to transition into  retirement through phased retirement encourages older workers who  might otherwise retire immediately to continue working. Delayed  retirement may help alleviate pressures on national pension systems and  address labor shortages and shortages of skilled workers. Phased  retirement programs exist in both the public and private sectors and are  used by employers that cover workers through both defined benefit (DB)  and defined contribution (DC) retirement plans. The programs sometimes  include a partial draw-down of pension benefits for workers while they  continue to work and may include a knowledge-transfer component.  Phased retirement programs are often called \u201cflexible,\u201d \u201cpartial,\u201d or  \u201cgradual\u201d retirement programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Sources of Retirement Income", "paragraphs": ["Similar to the United States, the retirement systems in other developed  countries consist of three main pillars: a national pension, similar to the  U.S. Social Security program; workplace employer-sponsored pensions  or retirement savings plans; and individual savings. Retirement plans  can be broadly classified as DB or DC. A DB plan promises a stream of  payments at retirement for the life of the participant, based on a formula  that typically takes into account the employee\u2019s salary, years of service,  and age at retirement. A DC plan, such as a 401(k) plan in the U.S.,  allows individuals to accumulate tax-advantaged retirement savings in an  individual account based on employee and/or employer contributions, and  the investment returns (gains and losses) earned on the account. With  DC plans certain risks and responsibilities shift from the plan sponsor  (employer) to the plan participant (employee). For example, workers with  a DC plan often must decide how much to contribute, how to invest those  contributions, and how to spend down the savings in retirement. For DB  plans, many of those decisions reside with the employer. Some  retirement plans combine features of both DB and DC plans, often  referred to as hybrid plans.", "National pensions: According to literature we reviewed, many countries  have created retirement plans for their citizens and residents to provide  income when they retire. These plans are typically earnings-based and  require employer and employee contributions over a number of years,  with pension benefits not accessible before a certain age. National  pensions are generally DB plans, similar to the U.S. Social Security  program.", "Employer-sponsored pensions or retirement savings plans:  Employer-based pensions or retirement savings plans are set up by  employers to help ensure their workers have income during retirement.  Employer-sponsored plans often require both the employer and employee  to contribute money to a fund during employment so that the employee  may receive benefits upon retirement. Employer-sponsored pensions  typically refer to DB plans that promise a source of lifetime income at  retirement, whereas retirement savings plans are typically DC plans, with  retirement benefits that accrue based on contributions and the  performance of the investments in the employees\u2019 individual accounts.  Over the past several decades, there has been a significant shift in  private sector employer-based retirement plans from traditional DB plans  to DC plans. In the U.S. this shift has been to 401(k)s as the primary  employer-sponsored retirement plans.", "Individual savings: Individuals can augment their retirement income  from the national pension and employer-sponsored plans with their own  savings, which would include any home equity, investments, personal  retirement savings accounts like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRA)  used in the United States, and other non-retirement savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Population Aging and Economic Productivity", "paragraphs": ["Population aging, primarily due to declining fertility rates and increasing  life expectancy, has raised concerns about the sustainability and  adequacy of pensions, especially as many workers continue to exit the  labor force before the statutory or full retirement age. Research indicates  that while certain countries are aging more rapidly than others, population  aging will affect most OECD countries, including the United States, over  the coming decades. For example, the share of the population aged 65  and older is projected to increase significantly by 2030 (see fig. 1).", "According to a 2017 OECD report, since 1970, the average life  expectancy at age 60 in OECD countries has risen from 18 years to 23.4  years and, by 2050, it is forecast to increase to 27.9 years. At that time,  the average person is expected to live to nearly 90 years old. The  increased life expectancy means that workers are spending more years in  retirement. In many instances, the aging population is placing additional  pressure on public pension systems and has raised concerns about the  solvency of national pension systems and the long-term adequacy of  benefits. In response, countries have used strategies, including  increasing the statutory retirement age of their national pension systems,  to reduce that pressure. However, many workers continue to leave the  workforce prior to reaching the statutory retirement age, according to  OECD data.", "To address this development, retaining older workers in the labor market  has been an objective in many countries. Some researchers have  suggested that, in the U.S., economic productivity could decline as baby  boomers age and leave the labor force, thus reducing the rate of  economic growth. For example, a 2016 study found that a 10 percent  increase in the percentage of the population age 60 and older decreases  the growth rate of per capita gross domestic product (per capita GDP) by  5.5 percent. According to this study, two-thirds of the reduction is due to  slower growth in the labor productivity of workers of all ages while one- third is due to slower labor force growth, suggesting that annual GDP  growth in the U.S. could slow by 1.2 percentage points per year this  decade, entirely for demographic reasons. Phased retirement has the  potential to provide options that would be beneficial both to older workers  and the overall economy by extending labor force participation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "We Identified 17 Countries with Aging Populations That Have Phased Retirement Options for Older Workers", "paragraphs": ["Among the 44 countries that met our initial criteria as having a national  pension system similar to Social Security and an aging population, we  identified 17 with some kind of phased retirement program. Based on a  review of relevant research, studies, and interviews, we determined that  phased retirement programs in these countries were established in  several ways: (1) through national policies including legislative actions  and specific programs that encourage phased retirement; (2) at the  industry or sector-level through collective bargaining agreements that  cover specific occupations or sectors; and (3) by individual employers.  Table 1 shows the three types of phased retirement arrangements found  in the 17 countries we identified.", "Based on our research, we determined that a national policy on phased  retirement may provide a voluntary framework within which employers  may participate rather than a requirement that they offer such programs.  For example, Canadian officials reported Canada changed regulations  that require employers who provide defined benefit pension plans and  also offer phased retirement to allow participating workers to receive  some partial pension benefits while continuing to accrue pension credits.  However, according to the Canadian government, it is ultimately up to  individual employers to make phased retirement available for their  employees.", "In many countries, collective bargaining played a key role in the formation  of phased retirement programs, particularly at the industry or sector level.  Half of the 17 countries have \u201csectoral\u201d phased or partial retirement  arrangements established through collective bargaining agreements that  cover a large number of workers from specific industrial sectors or  occupations, such as local government workers in Sweden or metal and  chemical sector workers in Germany. Such sectoral programs can include  public and private employers that provide a program or policy that applies  to their workers only. Sometimes, companies with sectoral programs have  the flexibility to set their own program requirements, within the broad  guidelines of arrangements established through collective bargaining  agreements.", "Phased retirement programs can also be established by individual  employers. Employers offering phased retirement are generally larger  companies in the private sector with their own pension plans. Our  research found examples of phased retirement programs offered by  individual employers both within and outside of collective bargaining  agreements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Countries\u2019 National Policies Were Generally Designed to Encourage Phased Retirement, and Individual Program Design Aspects Vary", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Selected Countries Employ Various Strategies to Encourage Phased Retirement", "paragraphs": ["The national policies implemented in our four case study countries\u2014 Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the U.K.\u2014currently, are mainly  designed to encourage older workers to remain in the labor force and  continue to earn and contribute to their pensions, and often, share their  institutional knowledge with younger workers, according to the officials,  experts, and employers we interviewed. For example, according to  Canadian government officials, Canada, to retain older workers and meet  the financial needs of those workers, amended its income tax regulations  in 2007 to allow phased retirement under certain DB pension plans.  Additionally, government officials in the U.K. reported that in 2014, the  U.K.\u2019s national flexible work policy was expanded to cover older workers  who wanted to phase into retirement. They said that this was done, in  part, to keep older workers\u2014aged 50 and over\u2014in the labor force.  However, the reasons for instituting phased retirement have shifted over  time. Based on our research and interviews with foreign officials and  other experts, we found that, in some cases, phased retirement was  initially used as an incentive for older workers to retire early so employers  could hire unemployed younger workers. For example, officials reported  that in 1996 at a time of double-digit unemployment (around 10 percent),  Germany instituted a national part-time work program, the  Altersteilzeitgesetz (ATZ), to encourage older workers to retire. Officials  said this phased retirement program originally sought to get older workers  out of the labor force and encourage employers to hire unemployed  workers and trainees. Today, in response to an aging population,  Germany is using phased retirement to encourage older workers to  remain in the workforce and ensure knowledge and skills transfer,  according to officials we interviewed. In addition, our research found that  Sweden offered a national phased retirement program or a \u201cpartial  pension\u201d scheme from 1976 to 2001, mainly as an option to allow workers  to gradually withdraw from work 5 years before the statutory retirement  age. According to our research, this program was implemented, in part, to  make it the transition from work to retirement more flexible. Swedish  officials stated that the country abolished the program in 2001, mainly due  to excessive costs, and implemented a new policy in 2010 that permits  partial retirement and access to partial pension to encourage workers to  stay in the labor force longer.", "The four case study countries employed various efforts at the national  level to encourage phased retirement options that seek to keep older  workers in the labor force. From our interviews with government officials,  unions, and other experts, we found that all four countries have national  policies to help facilitate phased retirement. Examples include national  programs that companies and sectors can offer to workers\u2014such as the  national program in Germany or the program in Sweden that ended in  2001\u2014as well as implementing policies that seek to incentivize both  employers and employees to offer and participate in phased retirement  programs.", "As shown in table 2, the four countries reported having made efforts at  the national level to encourage phased retirement, including implementing  national policies and programs that involve public subsidies, tax  incentives, or changing pension rules to allow individuals to receive partial  pension benefits while continuing to accrue benefits in the same pension  plan. For additional information on the national efforts made by case  study countries, see appendix II."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Individual Programs in Case Study Countries Have Similar Aspects, but Vary in Design and Sources of Supplemental Income to Workers", "paragraphs": ["Employers in our case study countries have implemented various phased  retirement programs that reflect the employers\u2019 goals for offering phased  retirement and the preferences of participating employees. Based on our  interviews with officials, employers, and representatives from employer  associations and unions in the four selected countries, we found that the  programs offered by employers in those countries had similarities and  differences in how the programs were established, designed,  implemented, and funded.", "Role of collective bargaining. Based on our research and interviews  with experts, we found that most of the phased retirement programs we  reviewed in the four case study countries were established as part of  collective bargaining agreements between employers and union- represented workers. This was often the case for sectoral programs in  either the public or private sectors and for those covering specific  occupations. The programs often covered a large number of workers. For  example, in Sweden, representatives of an organization for public  employers with approximately 1.2 million employees (23 percent of the  Swedish workforce) told us that 90 percent of the workers in Sweden  were covered by collective agreements, and that they have negotiated  collective agreements that included phased retirement for many of their  members. In Canada, one expert reported that phased retirement was  most common in fields that are highly unionized, because Canadian  unions wanted to increase flexibility for members to gradually decrease  work, but also receive a pension payment. For example, the expert said  that universities were at the forefront of phased retirement implementation  and they are highly unionized.", "While most of the programs we reviewed were based on collective  bargaining agreements, we identified a few companies that initiated  phased retirement for their workers outside of the collective bargaining  process, when the employer determined a need for such a program. For  example, one private sector employer in the financial industry we  interviewed in the U.K. told us that offering phased retirement options  addressed employees\u2019 need for flexibility. This employer commented that  if employees are happy, they will stay with the company longer and  continue to provide customers with superior service. As another example,  a large German employer in the transportation industry offers a phased  retirement program for managers who are not covered by a collective  bargaining agreement.", "Defined benefit and defined contribution plans available. Many  phased retirement programs we reviewed involve DB pension plans that  provide a fixed stream of payments at retirement for the life of the  participant. However, we also found some employers that were moving  from such plans to DC or hybrid pension plans, and phased retirement is  permitted under those plans as well. For example, a private sector  employer in the U.K. that sponsors both DB and DC retirement plans, told  us that workers in both types can participate in phased retirement and  can draw from their employer-sponsored retirement accounts at age 55,  although the drawdown rules are different for each type of retirement  plan. As another example, the UK\u2019s National Health Service workers are  currently covered by two retirement plans, according to pension plan  administrators we interviewed. Specifically, a pure DB plan initiated in  2008 is being phased out and replaced by a DB hybrid plan introduced in  2015. Both plans offer flexible retirement options, plan administrators  said.", "Health care coverage. Each of the four countries we reviewed provided  universal health care coverage. The broad availability of health care in  these countries, allows workers to reduce their work hours or  responsibilities without concern for losing health coverage, while not  increasing employer costs. This also made it easier for employers in our  case study countries to retain phasing part time workers and potentially  hire another worker without the additional cost of providing health care to  two workers.", "Program limits. Other similarities found in the phased retirement  programs that we reviewed in the four case study countries, include 1)  having a maximum age up to which a worker can partially retire\u2014 sometimes phased retirement can only be taken previous to the statutory  retirement age as set by the country\u2019s national pension system\u2014and 2)  limiting phased retirement to specific groups of employees. As examples,  one employer in Germany told us that it offers phased retirement only to  employees working in \u201chardship\u201d positions, such as those who work night  or rotating shifts, while some employers in Sweden offer phased  retirement to workers in particularly skilled occupations where workers  cannot be easily replaced, such as certain health professionals, according  to representatives from an employer association.", "Program terms and conditions. Based on our review of program  documents and interviews with program administrators, we found that the  phased retirement programs we reviewed in the four countries, regardless  of type, had basic requirements, such as age of participation, years of  service, eligible positions, period of phasing work, and time requirements;  however, the specific terms differed from program to program. For  example, a sectoral phased retirement program in Sweden allowed  workers to apply for phased retirement at age 60, and draw down 50, 80,  or 90 percent of their earned employer-sponsored retirement account  while phasing. A public sector employee program in the U.K. provided a  phased retirement option at age 55, and workers could draw down from  20 to 80 percent of their employer-sponsored pension while reducing their  work hours. In contrast, a program in Germany only allowed workers  aged 56 and older, with 20 years of service, and who had rigorous work  schedules (i.e., night shifts or rotating shifts) to apply for phased  retirement. Other aspects, such as the categories of workers eligible to  participate, also differ. For example, one higher education employer in  Canada only allows faculty and librarians to participate in phased  retirement, while another employer in the U.K. allows all employees to  apply for phased retirement.", "Sources of income. Workers participating in phased retirement typically  forego some amount of wages as a result of reduced working hours or  reduced responsibilities, similar to the wage reduction in full retirement. In  the programs we reviewed in our four countries, workers are able to offset  foregone wages, at least partially, from multiple sources. According to  program administrators and employers we interviewed, these sources  include the national pension; employer-sponsored retirement accounts;  an employer-provided benefit designated for this purpose; personal  savings; or some combination of these sources. For example, German  experts told us that, in Germany, workers participating in the national ATZ  program can reduce their work hours by 50 percent. Experts told us that  employers are required to pay a minimum of 70 percent of full-time wages  for phasing employees and pay contributions toward the employee\u2019s  pension as though the employee were working 90 percent. Among the  employers we interviewed that continue to offer the national ATZ  program, the 20 percent topped-off amount was reported as generally  financed by the employer. In the U.K., employees participating in a  private-sector employer\u2019s phased retirement programs make up for the  foregone wages by withdrawing funds from their own employer- sponsored retirement plan.", "In Canada, one employer offers a lump-sum allowance to employees  between 60 and 64 years of age who wished to reduce their hours as part  of phased retirement. Participating employees are paid a salary  proportional to their reduced hours and can use the lump-sum benefit to  supplement their income, but may not exceed their full-time salary. This  lump-sum is funded solely by the employer. During the phased retirement  period, employees can continue to contribute to their employer-sponsored  retirement account as if working full time, and need not withdraw from  their pension. In Sweden, one public sector phased retirement  arrangement is financed by employers as part of collective bargaining  agreements. This program allows workers to work 80 percent of a full- time job and receive 90 percent of a full-time salary. The employers  continue to contribute to the employer-sponsored pension as if  employees were working full-time. Workers in Sweden can also  supplement any reduced income with national pension benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Even with Unique Considerations for the United States, the Experiences of Other Countries with Phased Retirement Could Inform U.S. Efforts Differences in Institutional and Employer-Specific Factors May Affect How U.S. Efforts to Provide Phased Retirement Can Be Informed by Other Countries\u2019 Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Institutional and employer-specific factors in other countries, which shape  the design of phased retirement programs, typically differ from the  institutional environment experienced by many U.S. private sector  employers, although they may be similar to those common in U.S. public  sector employment. Some of these institutional factors include the extent  to which employers and workers are supported by universal health  insurance, whether the programs are structured around employer- sponsored traditional DB plans\u2014particularly for workers who have  worked at their firm long enough to qualify for phased retirement\u2014and  whether programs are the result of collective bargaining agreements. In  many of the selected countries we reviewed, phased retirement programs  designed to extend labor force participation are fairly recent. While the  rate of employment among older workers in the case study countries and  the U.S. increased in recent years, data has not been collected in the  case study countries to gauge the effects of phased retirement and  participation is low. Experiences of the case study countries suggest that,  in implementing such programs at the employer or national level, phased  retirement programs may be more effective if carefully designed based on  the employer\u2019s specific industry or production characteristics, and with  data collected and analyzed to pinpoint the most successful strategies.", "A Unique Consideration for U.S.  Companies Wishing to Offer Phased  Retirement: Importance of Employer- Sponsored Benefits  Unlike our case study countries, most U.S.  workers get their health insurance through  their employer, which can be a costly benefit  to provide. Employers with 50 or more  employees must provide coverage or pay a  fee; however, the requirement does not apply  to those working less than 30 hours per  week, on average. In June 2017, we found  that employers offering phased retirement  programs must decide if they will include  participants in their health care coverage and  that all eight of the employers with phased  retirement programs with whom we spoke  had extended their employer-sponsored  insurance to program participants.  In addition, the benefit payments provided  under U.S. Social Security may not be as  high as the national retirement benefits in  some of our case study countries and many  U.S. workers rely on employer-based  retirement benefits and personal savings for a  secure retirement. Strategies such as  allowing continued contributions during  phased retirement and supplementing  phased retirement income through partial  retirement payouts or other sources may be  helpful for worker satisfaction in phased  retirement programs. more common in the U.S. than in most of our case study countries. (see  sidebar) However, we found examples of phased retirement programs  offered to workers covered under DC pension plans that are not  collectively bargained in our case study countries. Some of the employers  with DC pensions that we learned about were transitioning from traditional  DB plans to DC plans. In these instances, newer workers are usually  enrolled in the DC plan and, because the shift is recent, many of the  workers covered under DC plans may not be old enough or have  sufficient years of service to qualify for phased retirement, where such  characteristics are criteria for participation. For example, a privately-run  transportation company in Germany reported offering phased retirement  programs that reduce working hours by about 20 percent, to workers who  meet certain criteria. Workers hired after 1995 and workers from the  former East Germany are covered under a DC plan and may qualify for  the phased retirement program. These examples indicate that private  sector employers in the U.S., where workers are increasingly covered by  DC plans rather than DB plans and generally not covered by collective  bargaining agreements, may also be able to implement and benefit from  phased retirement programs.", "Most of the programs we reviewed are relatively recent and have reported  small numbers of participants. Although OECD\u2019s data show that  employment of 55- to 64-year-olds increased between 2006 and 2016 in  Germany, Sweden, and the U.K., it is not clear what role phased  retirement has played in that growth. (see fig. 2) Governments,  employers, and unions have not systematically collected data to  understand the effect of the program on choices older workers make  regarding when to retire or the effects of phased retirement on employers,  workers, or national workforce participation. Some employers we spoke  with provided information on the number of workers who had used or  were currently using the programs, but there is not enough data to draw  conclusions, possibly because the programs are relatively new.", "As previously mentioned, the goal for some phased retirement programs  has shifted and although employers and national governments now have  greater incentives to retain older workers, the design of some phased  retirement programs may encourage workers to use the program to leave  the workforce earlier than they might in its absence. For example, experts  at a high-skill employer in Canada said that they believed that the  program may have incentivized older workers to reduce their hours when  in the absence of the program they may have worked full time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competing Needs of Employers, Workers, and Countries Mean That Benefits for Some May Be Challenges for Others", "paragraphs": ["Employers, workers, and countries may have competing needs and goals  in phased retirement programs, which must be considered in designing  programs. Specifically, these groups may differ in their preferences in the  areas of who may participate, the primary goals for the program, and how  the program will be financed. In previous work, we found that some U.S.  employers are reluctant to offer phased retirement programs because  they believe there is not sufficient interest among employees and that  employers in industries with technical and professional workforces were  more likely to provide formal and informal phased retirement programs.  Challenges identified by the programs in our case study countries can  provide helpful insights into areas of concern in designing phased  retirement programs in the U.S.", "A Unique Consideration for U.S.  Companies Wishing to Offer Phased  Retirement: Nondiscrimination Laws  In June 2017, we found that U.S. industries  with skilled workers or with labor shortages  also have motivation to offer phased  retirement programs, in part because their  workers are hard to replace. However, U.S.  companies must comply with laws intended to  protect workers from discrimination. Experts  and employers said programs that target  highly skilled workers, who are often highly  paid, could violate nondiscrimination rules,  which generally prohibit qualified pension  plans from favoring highly compensated  employees. One study we reviewed for that  work noted that regulatory complexities and  ambiguities involving federal tax and age  discrimination laws impact an organization\u2019s  ability to offer a phased retirement program.", "Program scope: Certain experts noted that, particularly in the context of  collective bargaining, workers typically want phased retirement programs  to be broadly available; in contrast, certain employers may want narrowly  scoped programs that are targeted to certain high-skilled or scarce  workers. Phased retirement is also used by certain employers to target  key employees with rare or sought after knowledge, skills, and experience  and provide opportunities for knowledge transfer prior to retirement.  Representatives from two German companies with high-tech or high- skilled workforces noted that phased retirement was important to retain  workers with experience and knowledge.", "Employers also reported setting criteria that limit the program to  individuals with a specific length of service with the employer, with  physically difficult jobs, or with challenging schedules, which may help  employers to target the program to certain workers. We reported in June  2017, that U.S. employers noted that targeting specific workers might  pose a challenge because of laws that prohibit special treatment of  selected workers for certain U.S. pension plans. (see sidebar) The  differences in the desired scope of phased retirement programs could  potentially be resolved. For example, some experts we interviewed  reported that employers may have caps which limit participation, such as  limiting participation to a specific percentage of employees who are age  eligible. A union representative in Germany noted that employers there  may set restrictions or caps on participation, such as 3 percent of the  workforce, or an employer may effectively cap the extent of participation  by restricting the program to a budgeted amount of funds. Employers in  the U.S. could explore whether using a similar approach regarding the  scope of a phased retirement program, taking into consideration any legal  concerns or other practical challenges, could help them to control the  number of workers participating in phased retirement programs.", "Knowledge sharing/succession planning: A representative at a  German employer noted that the employer has integrated a knowledge  sharing component to its program so that workers are able to train  younger workers and share their expertise. Retaining older workers may  have an added benefit\u2014according to a U.K. public plan administrator,  their phased retirement program also brought more age diversity to the  workforce.", "One expert said that phased retirement has the additional benefit of  helping with succession planning since management has more  information about the retirement decisions of those participating in the  program. An official from a Canadian university stated that the university\u2019s  phased retirement program, which includes a specified timeframe of 3  years, helps with planning because they know exactly when the worker  will leave their job and can begin the sometimes lengthy process of  recruiting replacement faculty. In our previous report, we noted that five of  the nine employers we interviewed said that knowing when workers will  retire allows employers to plan for the future.", "Work life balance/program complexity. Union representatives in our  case study countries described several benefits that phased retirement  provides to workers. For example, one said that phased retirement  provides more choice for workers, another noted that phased retirement  allows workers to continue to work at reduced hours until they reach the  statutory age to receive a national pension, and a third mentioned that  such programs reduce the burden for workers who cannot or do not want  to work full time. Similarly, other experts we interviewed said that phased  retirement\u2019s part time work schedule provides workers the opportunity to  continue working when they might otherwise retire. The experts each  cited specific reasons workers might retire, including health concerns, the  physical demands of their work, or the responsibility of caring for a loved  one. U.K government officials stated that phased retirement for older  workers in their country originated from a 2002 policy to facilitate flexible  work for caregivers of dependent adults and young and disabled children.  According to the U.K.\u2019s government website, flexible work can be part  time, job sharing, annualized hours, or telework, among others. It also  states, that employers can decline a request for flexible employment if  they can demonstrate that granting such a request can have a detrimental  effect on the firm, but, according to a 2013 U.K. government survey, 97  percent of employers offer some kind of flexible work.", "Experts in several of our case study countries noted that the rate of  participation in phased retirement programs is low, which each attributed  to different factors, including that workers may have insufficient  knowledge or understanding of the programs; employers may have  restrictions on program participation, such as eligibility requirements or  caps on participation; or there may be insufficient interest or incentives for  workers. For example, a German academic noted that his country\u2019s  Teilrente program, which combines partial national pension benefits and  reduced work hours for workers age 63 and older, is confusing and has  not been well-marketed, leading to low uptake. In our previous report,  we noted that according to 2014 Health and Retirement Study data, an  estimated 29 percent of 61- to 66-year-olds in the U.S. plan to reduce  their work hours: however only an estimated 11 percent actually did  gradually reduce their hours.", "Extending labor force participation: Countries may want to encourage  older workers to delay retirement to increase labor force participation,  broadly or in certain sectors, especially in times of low unemployment. In  the past, phased retirement in some nations had been used as a tool to  downsize workforces and encourage workers to retire early. However, the  rising costs of national pensions and an aging workforce have now  encouraged nations to view phased retirement as a tool or mechanism to  extend labor force participation. Indeed, according to the European  Commission, increased labor force participation of older workers is a goal  of the Eurozone. According to an academic expert we interviewed,  increasing the use of phased retirement is not a specific strategy to  achieve that goal, some countries are now using such programs to help  achieve it. For example, a Swedish official commented that the availability  of phased retirement can help older workers stay in the workforce longer.  In addition, an association of employers in Germany stated that raising  the age of eligibility for national pension benefits and eliminating  incentives for early retirement was likely to induce older workers to work  longer. Delayed retirement also gives workers longer working lives and  earning potential, which may help make pension systems sustainable. A  German academic noted that continued work keeps older individuals out  of poverty and increasing retiree income could reduce their reliance on  national \u201csafety net\u201d benefits. He said that retired people are interested in  Germany\u2019s program allowing work after retirement age because they may  have insufficient savings and \u201cmini jobs\u201d provide opportunities for earning  more.", "Certain sectors of national economies may particularly benefit from  extending workers\u2019 time in the workforce. For example, an expert at a  U.K. consulting firm noted that, due to Britain\u2019s expected departure from  European Union membership the country may face labor shortages in  certain sectors, such as health care and hospitality, because of the loss of  foreign workers. He also suggested that flexible work arrangements may  help to avoid potential shortages by retaining older workers who are  citizens in those sectors. We also found, in our previous report, that  phased retirement could also benefit the U.S. economy in helping to  extend participation in the workforce.", "A Unique Consideration for U.S.  Companies Wishing to Offer Phased  Retirement: In-service Distributions and  ERISA Requirements Related to Plan  Design  We previously reported that defined benefit  (DB) plans may provide in-service  distributions, which would allow phased  retirement participants to draw a portion of  their retirement benefit during their  participation in phased retirement, to workers  aged 62 and older. Defined contribution (DC)  plan participants generally may not receive  distributions from a DC plan until they reach  age 59 \u00bd and distributions before that age  may be subject to an additional tax. Our  previous work also found that in-service  distributions may be important to supplement  salaries for participants in phased retirement.  An expert we spoke to stated that the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of  1974 (ERISA) requirements pertaining to plan  design reduce plan flexibility since changes to  plan structure to allow for phased retirement  have to be honored even if the economy  changes and employers want to shed rather  than retain older workers. He stated that this  requirement reduces the appeal of phased  retirement for employers sponsoring DB  plans.", "Program design. Experts in certain case study countries reported that  employers must design their programs carefully to ensure that they meet  sometimes complex statutory requirements and to ensure that workers  are eligible for and benefit from phased retirement. However, some also  mentioned that designing a program that incentivizes continued work and  avoids penalties for workers can be a challenge. For example, an expert  we interviewed stated that, in Germany, early retirees can receive their  full pension benefit after 45 years of work, but they are subject to salary  caps until they reach the full retirement age, which may be a disincentive  to combining continued work with a pension draw down. Conversely,  there is an incentive for continued work in Germany without claiming a  pension since, should the worker continue to work, contribute to the  public pension, and delay claiming, their benefit increases by 0.5 percent  for each additional month worked.  In our previous report, U.S.  employers also cited concerns in designing programs to meet statutory  requirements. (See sidebar).", "According to a Eurofound report, the flexibility of phased retirement can  come with administrative costs, particularly if frequent changes are  allowed. For example, a Canadian employer noted that managing a  workforce of part-time employees was a challenge because it was  unfamiliar. They also said that, in some circumstances, their program  allowed participants to renege on their retirement date and that it was  administratively cumbersome. We also reported in our previous work that  employers using phased retirement in the U.S. had experienced  administrative concerns that included challenges with part-time  workforces.", "Potential costs of phased retirement programs. Several of the experts  we spoke with said that making programs sufficiently financially beneficial  to encourage worker participation can be costly. In addition, some  employers reported that, where available, tax incentives, government  subsidies, or financing salary supplements directly from the workers\u2019 retirement benefits were used, which may have helped to minimize their  costs in providing the programs. In contrast, some government experts  from the case study countries noted in interviews that certain government  supports had been cut, suggesting that those governments prefer  employers to finance more of the benefit. Other experts we spoke to  explained that some employers in our case study countries paid for most  of the cost of the programs themselves, although, some employers also  benefit from tax incentives. For example, according to experts, the current  provisions of the German ATZ program\u2019s required that employers provide  salary supplements of at least 20 percent of full-time wages above the  pay for partial (50 percent) employment. According to an OECD report,  initially, the supplement was paid through government subsidies to  employers but now, if employers wish to retain the program, they must  pay the salary supplement themselves, adding additional costs to  employers. German government officials noted that the salary  supplement paid during phased retirement is tax-advantaged. Such  incentives might also encourage employers in the U.S. to offer phased  retirement programs.", "Potential reductions in future benefits: Some experts noted that  certain phased retirement programs allow workers to reduce their hours  without a proportional reduction in wages or benefits when they enter full  retirement. It may also provide more options in how to draw down  benefits. However, some programs we reviewed also include pay that is  less than what is received during full employment and may involve  reduced benefits after retirement, which is a factor for workers  considering participation. For example, German experts explained that  ATZ requires a salary supplement of at least 20 percent of salary,  effectively resulting in workers receiving 70 percent of their wage for 50  percent of hours worked. In our previous report, we noted that according  to 2014 HRS data, an estimated 22 percent of U.S. workers aged 61- to  66-years surveyed would be interested in reducing their hours even if it  meant their pay would be reduced proportionally. We also found in our  previous report that low savings and concerns about eligibility for health  benefits may create barriers that affect workers\u2019 ability or interest in  participating in phased retirement programs.", "Even when they receive employer-provided subsidies, as in Germany,  workers\u2019 salaries in phased retirement programs are less than under what  is earned for full-time work. A recent OECD report noted that removing  obstacles, such as limits on earnings while working and receiving pension  payouts and limits on the accumulation of benefits, is important to make  combining work and pensions more attractive. A Canadian employer  had similar concerns and noted that workers may be reluctant to reduce  their hours without having some way to supplement their income, for  example through a partial draw down on their retirement savings or  private or public pension.", "In some cases, workers may work and draw a benefit from their national  or employer-sponsored pension plan. Some experts reported that certain  programs allow workers to continue to contribute to their pension plans or  earn pension credits. Union representatives in the U.K. and Germany  noted the importance of workers remaining in the labor force longer for  the purpose of increasing their income after full retirement. For example,  according to a U.K. government website, the U.K. has no mandatory  retirement age for the national pension system and allows individuals who  have reached the retirement age to work and draw a benefit. According  to a U.K. government website, if a worker continues to work after the full  retirement age and delays their claim for the national pension benefit,  their weekly payments could be larger when they do choose to retire and  take their benefit. Experts at a privately run German transportation  company noted that workers earn 100 percent of their pension credits  during the period that they are participating in the company\u2019s phased  retirement program. In addition, the U.K. allows workers to draw a portion  of their plan benefits\u2014with 25 percent being tax-free\u2014and one U.K.  employer we spoke to allows continued contributions to those plans.", "Participants may also see reductions in their retirement benefits after full  retirement. Workers with DC plans may reduce their retirement savings  through early withdrawals during phased retirement. Similarly, depending  on program design, workers may have limitations on their contributions to  their employer-sponsored DB plan or public pension during phased  retirement; yielding lower pension benefits at retirement. An OECD report  notes that national pension payments made during participation in phased  retirement programs and any change in the age at which a worker retires,  such as retiring prior to or after the full retirement age, should result in  pension adjustments that are actuarially neutral\u2014in other words, workers  taking early pension payments will have reduced benefits for the duration  of their retirement while those who delay payment receive increased  benefits.

Social Security Programs throughout the World  contains comprehensive data on the social security programs in different  countries around the world, including the statutory retirement age, early  retirement age, and GDP per capita. We used the Social Security  Administration\u2019s publication to gather a list of 179 countries that have  some kind of social security program. For these countries, we used  United Nations population data to find the proportion of the population  aged 50 and over, where available. We then limited our research to those  countries whose proportion of population aged 50 and over is more than  one standard deviation above the average.

We focused on OECD and  European Union countries because they are advanced economies that  are most similar to that of the United States. In addition, we conducted  literature searches and reviews to identify countries with phased  retirement programs aimed at extending working lives of older workers as  well as to assist with knowledge transfer from older workers to younger  workers. The literature searches comprised of terms related to phased  retirement, such as gradual retirement; partial retirement; labor force  participation of older workers; and transitional retirement. We limited our  searches to literature released during the 10-year period from 2007 to  2017. Additionally, we spoke with subject matter experts to gain their  perspective on which countries offer phased retirement programs or have  a policy aimed at extending working lives of older workers. We identified  these experts through our review of relevant literature and expert  referrals. In total, we identified 17 countries with some form of phased or  gradual retirement options for older workers. We examined these 17  countries to identify the types of phased retirement programs within each  country. For example, we researched whether the country had (1)  national phased retirement policies or programs (2) sectoral programs  established through collective bargaining agreements that cover specific  industries, occupations, or sectors; and (3) individual employer programs.", "To obtain a more complete understanding of key aspects, and the  benefits and challenges of phased retirement programs in selected  countries, as well as potential lessons learned for the U.S., we reviewed  the group of aging countries with relevant programs identified in the first  objective, to select a sample of four countries for case studies. These  countries are Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the United Kingdom  (U.K.).

We also considered the various countries\u2019 economic and social  frameworks and whether they are similar to that of the U.S. Specifically,  we selected Canada, Germany, Sweden, and the U.K. because they had  national phased retirement policies, which may include a national  program such as in Germany and Sweden, and a wide variety of phased  retirement programs in both the private and public sectors.
