From August 1993 to March 1997, SBA\u2019s workforce was cut by about 15 percent.  The regional office structure, a layer of management between SBA headquarters and district offices, was a prime target of this reduction.  In addition, new administrators were appointed at the agency in 1993, 1994, and 1997, which brought about further changes in SBA\u2019s executive offices, and following the change in control of Congress in 1995, SBA provided noncompetitive, career appointments to some displaced congressional staff members under the Ramspeck Act then in effect.", "Because of the changes that were occurring, the reorganization and downsizing in particular, the 1990s have been turbulent times for SBA employees.

Most of the regional offices were located in the same buildings as the district offices.  These officials explained that this shifting usually occurred when the regional office Staff Assistant was temporarily out of the office; that is, when sick or on vacation.  In one case, however, a district office employee obtained a temporary promotion to the position of Public Affairs Specialist and was assigned to the colocated regional office.  According to SBA\u2019s HR officials, this was only a temporary measure because SBA wanted whoever would fill the then-vacant Regional Administrator position to participate in selecting the permanent Public Affairs Specialist."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appointments of Individuals From Outside SBA to District Director Positions and the Setting of Their Starting Salaries", "paragraphs": ["Unlike Regional Administrator positions, which are held by political appointees, SBA\u2019s District Director positions are filled through career appointments.

Forty of these appointments went to SBA employees.  For six appointments, SBA hired individuals from outside the agency to fill the positions.  In two of these cases, the individuals\u2019 application materials made reference to elected officials, thus introducing the possibility of political favoritism in the hiring process. However, SBA officials denied the use of favoritism.  On the basis of available evidence, SBA appeared to have properly followed federal regulations in hiring all six individuals.  However, we did note a problem with how SBA set the starting salary in one case.", "The six outside individuals were hired to fill District Director positions in Washington, D.C.; Cleveland, OH; Puerto Rico; Denver, CO; New Orleans, LA; and Sacramento, CA.  They were not all hired at the same time--two were hired in 1994, one was hired in 1996, another was hired in 1997, and two were hired in 1998.  Four were either employed by the federal government when they applied for the SBA position or had been federal employees some time earlier.", "We examined the steps SBA took in the appointment process and determined that SBA appeared to follow all relevant federal laws and regulations in making the appointments.  SBA used a competitive examination process to hire each appointee.  Under this process, SBA publicized the vacancy announcements for all six positions.  SBA compiled lists of best-qualified applicants from among those who applied, and SBA management selected those hired (the appointees) from among the applicants who were on the best-qualified lists.  The competitive examination process, it should be noted, does not preclude persons who have political experience and support from applying and being selected for open career positions.", "During our review, we became aware of possible political overtones in two cases, the Denver District Director position and the New Orleans District Director position.  There were allegations that the individual appointed to the Denver position obtained the appointment through her political connections.  She had worked for a governor of Colorado and, at the time of her appointment to the District Director position, the governor chaired the Democratic National Committee.  According to an SBA memorandum, a panel of six officials interviewed her along with two other best-qualified applicants, and each interviewer found her to be the top candidate.  One of the panel members, the Assistant Administrator for Human Resources, told us that there was no pressure on the panel to recommend this individual for selection.", "The application material submitted by the individual appointed to the New Orleans position cited the names of members of Congress and local politicians as references and contained letters of recommendation from local politicians.  SBA HR officials said that except for the names in the application material, they were unaware of any political connections the individual had within the administration, and they were under no pressure of any kind to recommend this individual for selection.", "In neither of these cases did we find evidence of political favoritism and improper hiring.  However, the question of whether such political favoritism or support has an impact on the selection of an individual from among other applicants is extremely difficult to determine and requires that the intent and motivation of the selecting official be known.", "Appendix III provides more information on each of the six cases.

However, provisions exist for making an appointment above the minimum step.  For example, a new employee\u2019s salary can be set above the minimum step when the employee possesses superior qualifications or the agency has a special need for the employee\u2019s services. The C.F.R. refers to an appointment under these circumstances as a \u201csuperior qualifications appointment.\u201d  However, the regulations also state that in determining whether a candidate should receive a superior qualifications appointment and, if so, at what level the employee\u2019s pay should be set, the agency must consider the possibility of authorizing a recruitment bonus.  The regulations also state that each agency that makes superior qualifications appointments must establish documentation and record-keeping procedures sufficient to allow reconstruction of the action taken in each case.  According to the regulations, documentation must include the superior qualifications of the individual or the special need of the agency that justified use of the superior qualifications authority; the factors considered in determining the individual\u2019s existing pay; and the reasons for authorizing an advanced rate instead of, or in addition to, a recruitment bonus.", "An appointee who has previously worked for the federal government is also eligible to receive a salary that is above the minimum step of the pay grade.

Another case involved an SES appointment for which there is greater latitude in setting pay.

We obtained a copy of the draft procedures, which said that SBA would offer a recruitment bonus or a superior qualifications appointment only in those rare situations where, after extensive recruitment, SBA determined that an incentive was necessary to attract qualified applicants or to compete with nonfederal employers.  The draft SOP also stated that SBA would always consider using a recruitment bonus before considering a superior qualifications appointment because a one-time payment was more economical than a higher salary that is paid every year.  The draft SOP also states that information supporting the action is to remain on file for 3 years.

Because all of the positions were excepted service positions being filled under the Chief Counsel for Advocacy\u2019s special hiring authority, it was not necessary for SBA to publicly advertise the positions or to follow the other appointment procedures that apply when positions in the competitive service are filled.  Because the individuals in all nine cases received excepted service, term appointments, they effectively served at the pleasure of the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.

In each case, on the basis of available evidence, it appeared that SBA followed appropriate salary-setting procedures.  In 141 (45 percent) of 310 appointments we reviewed, SBA set the salaries at levels higher than the minimum step of the pay grades.

In each of those cases, based on available evidence, it appeared that SBA set the starting salaries appropriately.", "In 43 cases the advanced pay rates were authorized by regulations on the basis of highest previous pay rates.  In 1 of those 43 cases, discussed later, SBA set the starting salary incorrectly.", "In 28 cases the advanced pay rates were made on the basis of superior qualifications.  In 11 of the 28 cases, however, SBA was unable to provide the documentation required by regulations to allow reconstruction of the action taken in each case.

As stated earlier, SBA reported to us in its agency comments on a draft of this report that it had decided as a matter of policy not to offer recruitment bonuses.  In a followup conversation with an SBA HR official we were told that this was an unwritten policy.  The official believed the policy decision was made sometime after October 1990 but didn\u2019t remember the precise date.  Also, no substantial rationale for the decision was offered beyond that regulations require a recruitment bonus plan be established before paying a recruitment bonus and SBA did not have such a plan.  One of the benefits of a recruitment bonus compared to an advanced salary is that the former is a one time expense and in the long term should be less expensive than a permanent advanced salary rate.  During our review SBA revisited the issue of recruitment bonuses and developed a draft SOP covering recruitment bonuses, as well as salary-setting procedures, and documentation requirements.", "One of the 43 cases in which the advanced salaries were set on the basis of highest previous pay rates involved a former employee of SBA.  In that instance, SBA officials--during our review--determined that the salary had been set incorrectly.  This appointee had previously worked for SBA, resigned to accept a position with another federal organization, rejoined SBA, then resigned again.  According to SBA officials, when the appointee rejoined SBA, HR staff apparently based her new SBA salary on her highest previous federal salary as reported in her application rather than on her highest previous salary as reported in her official salary transcript.  The salary she reported in her application was $18,000 higher than the salary reported in the transcript.  SBA determined that using her higher reported salary caused HR staff to set her SBA salary at a higher level than they would otherwise have done, resulting in an overpayment of approximately $6,000 for the affected period.", "In a memorandum to SBA\u2019s Chief Financial Officer, the Assistant Administrator for Human Resources requested, and obtained, a waiver of the erroneous overpayment.  According to SBA\u2019s HR officials, they believed the salary-setting error was their fault and not the appointee\u2019s fault.", "In addition to examining the procedures used in initial pay settings, we also examined the procedures that SBA used in later providing periodic salary increases to the 310 political and Ramspeck Act appointees. According to federal pay rules, GS pay grade employees are eligible for pay step increases based on their satisfactory work performance and their amount of time in the pay grade.  These rules also permit step increases, regardless of time in grade, in recognition of quality performance.  On the basis of the records we reviewed that pertained to salary increases, SBA appeared to have followed applicable federal laws and regulations in providing salary increases in 309 of the 310 cases.

In accordance with principles of appropriation law, the receiving agency should generally reimburse the loaning agency for the salary and expenses of the detailed employee.", "This rule was enunciated in a 1985 decision by the Comptroller General of the United States.  He concluded that except under limited circumstances, nonreimbursable details (1) violate the law that appropriations must be spent only for the purposes for which they are appropriated and (2) unlawfully augment the appropriations of the receiving agency. Specifically, the Comptroller General held that nonreimbursable details are improper except where the detail (1) involves a matter related to the loaning agency\u2019s appropriations or (2) will have a negligible impact on the loaning agency\u2019s appropriations.

Officials from the finance center have since told us that SBA has received reimbursement for the services of six of the seven employees and in its comments on a draft of this report, SBA said it has collected all but a small amount in the seventh case.  The amounts of reimbursement SBA received were based on limited or incomplete information on each detail, did not always include amounts for employee benefits, and therefore were likely different from the amounts that should have been reimbursed.", "Although we found documentation indicating when details began, we noted that no systematic process existed to record the actual ending dates of the details.  For example, in one case involving a nonreimbursable detail, SBA determined the actual duration of the detail on the basis of a handwritten notation in which an unknown source wrote the ending date of the detail in the bottom margin of a document evidencing the detail. Actual ending dates of details are important because although the interagency agreements contain the planned beginning and ending dates, the actual detail may be of a longer or shorter duration.", "During our review SBA officials said that a special project would be undertaken to examine how the reimbursable process should work, what appropriate paperwork requirements are needed, and what controls will be needed to ensure that interagency details are properly controlled in the future.  In commenting on a draft of this report, SBA said that the not-to- exceed date is clearly stated in the documentation of the detail and that there is no requirement to document details that end on their not-to- exceed date.  SBA said that it documents extensions of details and the termination date of details that end early, although it recognized that it failed to do so in one of the cases we reviewed.  SBA said that it is revising its procedures to ensure program managers know extensions and terminations of interagency details are to be documented on a Notification of Personnel Action (SF-50) and that the new procedure will ensure that SBA\u2019s personnel/payroll system provides automated \u201cticklers\u201d to help eliminate the possibility of any funds from reimbursable details not being collected.", "SBA\u2019s comments are unclear as to whether the new requirement to document terminations on a SF-50 will apply to all details or just to those that are extended or end early.

The legislative history of the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 1997 does not elaborate on the mandate to upgrade the Assistant Administrator position to the SES level.  Neither the statute nor its legislative history set a time frame for upgrading the position.  The position was filled with a noncareer SES appointee on April 5, 1999.", "During our review, we asked SBA officials to explain why the position had not been upgraded earlier, especially considering that during fiscal year 1998--when the act was passed--SBA had established and filled at least nine other SES positions, including two noncareer (political) positions.  SBA officials we interviewed told us that the Assistant Administrator position was already filled with a Schedule C, GS-15 political appointee, and other critical need positions existed and had to be filled.", "According to an SBA document, the position of Assistant Administrator for SBA\u2019s Office of Women\u2019s Business Ownership had previously existed as an SES position; however, after the position became vacant in 1993, it was not refilled at the SES level.  In 1994 the Clinton administration--as part of its early efforts to reduce the size of the federal government--directed that the total allocation of SES positions in the executive branch departments and agencies be reduced by 10 percent.", "According to SBA\u2019s HR officials, in SBA\u2019s case, the directive resulted in OPM reducing SBA\u2019s total SES position allocation from 60 to 55, and the position of Assistant Administrator for Women\u2019s Business Ownership was 1 of the positions that SBA downgraded as a result of the reduced SES allocation.  According to SBA officials, during fiscal year 1998, SBA\u2019s total SES allocation remained at 55, of which 10 could be filled by noncareer (political) SES appointments.", "SBA\u2019s HR officials told us that in April 1998 SBA management officials began reevaluating the agency\u2019s SES needs.  This exercise resulted in a June 18, 1998, letter from the SBA Administrator to the Director, OPM, requesting an increase in SBA\u2019s SES allocation from 55 to 60.  The SBA Administrator made a case for establishing five new SES positions, including an upgraded position of Assistant Administrator for Women\u2019s Business Ownership.  By letter dated October 29, 1998, OPM\u2019s Director responded to SBA\u2019s request by increasing SBA\u2019s allocation from 55 to 58. One of the three new allocations OPM provided was specifically for the position of Assistant Administrator for Women\u2019s Business Ownership. However, at the end of December 1998, the appointment had not been made.  According to SBA officials, all noncareer (political) SES appointments are controlled by the White House; and, although OPM had approved the position as part of the increased SES allocation, SBA officials were awaiting clearance by the White House before requesting OPM\u2019s approval of the individual expected to receive the appointment.

Regional Advocates are not political appointees and, according to SBA, have a mission that is significantly different than that of political appointees.  Nevertheless, Regional Advocates share many of the characteristics of political appointees.  For example, like political appointees, Regional Advocates can be hired noncompetitively.  Also like political appointees, Regional Advocates serve at the pleasure of the head of their agencies--in this case, the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.  One additional factor that would further demonstrate the similarity of Regional Advocates and political appointees is that according to (1) the Chief Counsel for Advocacy, (2) a former Regional Advocate, and (3) a current Regional Advocate, new Regional Advocate appointees are frequently cleared though the White House personnel office before being appointed. The Chief Counsel for Advocacy said, however, that this is done more as a courtesy to the White House than because it is a requirement to obtain the White House\u2019s concurrence on the appointment.", "The Office of Advocacy has 1 Regional Advocate stationed in each of the 10 cities in which SBA has a regional office.  These 10 Regional Advocates report directly to the Chief Counsel and the Deputy Chief Counsel for Advocacy.

The Deputy Chief Counsel told us that this is an important notion because to successfully mitigate issues affecting small businesses, the Office of Advocacy has to work effectively with administrations and Congress.  On the other hand, she said that Regional Advocates, when they are in Washington, D.C., are encouraged to attend political appointee meetings at the White House or at other locations in order to gain and maintain a broad awareness of the administration\u2019s initiatives in many areas, including small business.", "Several times a year the Regional Advocates, individually and collectively, visit Office of Advocacy headquarters in Washington, D.C., to discuss small business concerns.  While in Washington, according to the Deputy Chief Counsel for Advocacy, they may attend political appointee meetings.  This official said that such meetings are often sponsored by SBA officials, and attendees include only SBA political appointees and other key SBA officials.  But, on occasion, wider scope political appointee meetings are sponsored by the White House and are attended by political appointees from numerous executive branch departments and agencies, including SBA.  According to the Deputy Chief Counsel for Advocacy, although Regional Advocates are encouraged by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy to attend such meetings, their attendance is nevertheless voluntary.", "By examining copies of Regional Advocates\u2019 travel authorizations and travel vouchers for fiscal year 1997 and for part of fiscal year 1998, we identified eight Regional Advocates who had visited the White House on the same date.  We confirmed their visit with the White House Office.  We were able to contact six of these Advocates, some of whom no longer work for SBA.  They each confirmed that on that date they attended a political appointee meeting at the White House.  The meeting, they said, was for executive branch political appointees who were stationed outside of Washington, D.C.", "According to these six Regional Advocates, the White House meeting was primarily an opportunity to receive briefings from high-level administration officials--including the President and the Vice President--on the administration\u2019s initiatives.  One former Regional Advocate told us that this meeting also served as a morale booster to the political appointees who attended.  The six current or former Regional Advocates we contacted told us that they had not received instructions of any kind from officials who attended the White House meeting and did not believe their independence in carrying out their duties was affected by attending the meeting.", "Each of the six Advocates pointed out, however, that they had ties to either the Clinton administration or to the Democratic party before they received their Regional Advocate appointments.  For example, several of them told us that they had worked on either the Clinton-Gore 1992 presidential campaign or the 1996 reelection campaign.  Another told us she had worked with the Democratic party in Colorado during 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Significant personnel changes have occurred at SBA since the early 1990s, some of which resulted from the considerable reorganization and downsizing that SBA experienced.  Regional offices were reorganized and drastically downsized, with most regional employees transferring to other SBA offices or retiring.  During the period, SBA hired outsiders for 6 of the 46 District Director positions it filled and did so following applicable federal hiring procedures.  With the exception of one case, SBA also followed applicable federal laws and regulations when setting the starting salaries.  The Office of Advocacy used informal processes for identifying and selecting persons to fill Regional and Assistant Advocate positions, which was in keeping with its special hiring authority.  In other SBA executive offices, the number of positions and political appointees increased somewhat from 2 years earlier.  There was also one position change--upgrading (and filling) the position of head of the Office of Women\u2019s Business Ownership to the SES level--that Congress said should occur but SBA had not done until over a year later.  In fiscal year 1997, at least six Regional Advocates attended a political appointee meeting at the White Office, which was in keeping with an Office of Advocacy\u2019s policy of encouraging attendance at political meetings.", "Over the greater part of the 1990s, SBA hired 310 political and Ramspeck Act employees, and, as far as we can tell, SBA HR staff usually followed applicable laws and regulations in setting their salaries and later in providing them periodic salary increases.  However, the documentation necessary to support certain pay settings could not always be found. According to SBA, it had not considered providing recruitment bonuses on a case by case basis because it had made a policy decision not to offer such bonuses.  This reason, however, was not documented as required for those cases where employees received advanced salary levels.  SBA has recognized that its HR staff need further guidance on pay setting and recruitment bonuses and has drafted a new set of procedures to provide that guidance.", "SBA participates in interagency details of employees but did not have adequate procedures to (1) accurately identify when it should bill agencies for the reimbursable details of SBA employees and (2) monitor the actual length of details.

Such procedures should ensure that the specifics of each detail are appropriately documented and monitored and that in the case of cost-reimbursable details, all costs are accounted for and promptly reimbursed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["By letter dated April 1, 1999, the SBA Administrator\u2019s designee--the Assistant Administrator for Human Resources--commented on a draft of this report.  Although the Assistant Administrator did not address our two recommendations directly, she noted actions that SBA had taken or was taking that were associated with those recommendations.  In connection with the recommendation that SBA finalize and issue standard operating procedures for considering recruitment bonuses, setting salaries, and documenting starting salaries that are above the minimum step of a grade, the Assistant Administrator said SBA had finalized a policy document establishing procedures for, and requiring consideration of, recruitment bonuses, which it expected to publish during this spring (1999).  We believe this new policy as well as the guidance SBA is developing on pay setting should, if effectively implemented, meet the intent of our recommendation.", "In connection with our recommendation that SBA identify and establish appropriate procedures for better controlling interagency details, the Assistant Administrator said SBA was revising its detail procedures to ensure program managers know that extensions and terminations of interagency details must now be documented by a formal Notification of Personnel Action (SF-50).  This new procedure, she said, will insure that SBA\u2019s personnel/payroll system provides automated ticklers and the combination of these actions should eliminate the possibility of any funds from reimbursable details not being collected.  It is unclear from SBA\u2019s comments whether this new procedure is to apply to all details or to only those details that are extended or terminate early.  If the former, then we believe such a procedure, if effectively implemented, should meet the intent of our recommendation.  If the latter, then we believe the potential will still exist for overlooking collections.", "Although the Assistant Administrator said SBA was taking these actions, she also said SBA found the draft \u201cmisleading.\u201d  Most of her letter addresses that statement, conveying SBA\u2019s problems with the draft or providing additional information.  Apparently, SBA officials considered certain conclusions that we drew from the facts to be overstated and certain facts that we presented to be incorrect.  For example, the Assistant Administrator cited our conclusion that SBA \u201cusually\u201d followed appropriate laws and regulations in setting the salaries and later in providing salary increases for 310 political and Ramspeck Act employees. The Assistant Administrator indicated that the term \u201cusually\u201d was misleading because elsewhere in the report we said SBA appeared to have followed applicable laws and regulations in providing salary increases in 309 of the 310 cases.  Information was not available to make a determination in the remaining case.", "Regarding this example, we recognize that for 309 of the 310 appointments we conclude that SBA appeared to have appropriately provided salary increases.  However, we also report a number of cases in which SBA could not provide documentation allowing a determination as to whether SBA followed appropriate procedures when setting advanced salaries at the time the employees were hired.  Since receiving our draft report for comment, SBA sent further information to us on specific cases.  The cases were of employees for whom SBA had been unable to provide documentation to support an advanced pay setting.  In the draft report, these cases numbered 31 of the political and Ramspeck Act appointments that we reviewed in which the starting salaries were set above the minimum step of the grade.  SBA has since found and provided us with the information justifying the advanced pay setting for several of these cases and we modified the report as appropriate.  We now report that justifying documentation was not available for 12 cases.  Because our overall conclusion encompasses both the initial salary setting and the periodic salary increases, we believe our characterization that SBA usually followed applicable laws and regulations is both fair and accurate.", "Regarding recruitment bonuses, the Assistant Administrator said that SBA had at one time considered recruitment bonuses, but had decided as a matter of policy not to offer any.  Consequently, SBA had not developed a recruitment bonus plan, as required by regulations.  Without such a plan, the Assistant Administrator said recruitment bonuses could not be offered. As indicated earlier, SBA has since decided to initiate a recruitment bonus policy.", "SBA\u2019s policy decision and rationale for not using recruitment bonuses were never mentioned by SBA officials during the course of our work. Had the policy decision and rationale been mentioned, we would have included those facts in the draft report.  On the basis of SBA\u2019s comments, we have reflected that information in this report.  The important point, in our opinion, is that recruitment bonuses can be an effective and cost efficient alternative to advanced pay setting, and we commend SBA for revisiting the issue at our suggestion.", "SBA\u2019s written comments and our further responses to them are in appendix VI.", "As agreed with the Committee, unless you publicly announce the report\u2019s contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days after the date of this letter.

In addressing the first part of this objective--the status of regional office employees--we identified all employees assigned to an SBA regional, district, or branch office as of September 2, 1993, (which was prior to the reorganizing and downsizing efforts), and as of April 1997 (which was after the regional offices had been downsized.)  We obtained this data from SBA\u2019s Office of Human Resources (HR) database.  We then entered each employee\u2019s name, and the office to which he or she was assigned as of those dates, into a database that we developed specifically for this purpose.  Using our database, we sorted the information alphabetically by employee name and manually searched for name matches.  In cases where (1) there was a name match; and (2) that employee had been assigned to a regional office as of September 2, 1993, we were able to determine that employee\u2019s employment status as of April 1997.  In cases where (1) there was no name match; and (2) that employee had been assigned to a regional office as of September 2, 1993, we took additional steps to determine the employee\u2019s status.  In those cases, we provided each name to SBA\u2019s HR officials and asked that information on the status of each be determined.  HR officials provided us with documents from their database on each of those employees for whom a record existed.  The documents showed that the employees resigned, retired, died, or were otherwise separated from the agency during the period September 2, 1993, through April 1997.  In some cases employees\u2019 records were no longer in the database, and their status could not be determined.", "In addressing the second part of this objective--the shifting of personnel-- we determined that SBA officials do not usually document the temporary shifting of employees from one office to another.  So, in order to obtain information on such shifting, we interviewed cognizant HR officials.  These officials, on our behalf, also canvassed appropriate regional and district office staff for specific instances in which personnel were shifted to the regional offices and provided that information to us.  In some cases we discussed specific instances of personnel shifts directly with district office officials.", "Our second objective was to determine whether SBA followed applicable policies and procedures when appointing--and setting the starting salaries of--individuals hired during the period January 1, 1993, through December 31, 1998, from outside of SBA for the position of District Director, and the procedures SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy used in hiring Regional Advocates and Assistant Advocates during calendar year 1998.  In addressing the first part of this objective--the procedures used to hire District Directors from outside SBA and to set their salaries--we asked HR officials to identify all District Director changes that occurred between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 1998.  We then focused upon six cases in which the District Director positions were filled by outside hires.  We identified the starting salaries set by SBA in each of the six cases and, using previous employment and salary information contained in the individual\u2019s application materials, referenced that information to the applicable federal laws and regulations regarding salary setting to determine if SBA complied with the laws and regulations.  We also determined where the other individuals who were appointed to District Director positions since January 1, 1993, had come from; and we focused upon two cases involving individuals who had held non-District Director SBA positions before being appointed as District Directors.  For each of the eight cases, we reviewed available information, including available competitive examination process case files.  In some cases the appointments were made over 2 years before our review began, and SBA did not have a complete case file on the examination and appointment process. We examined available records and compared the examination and appointment procedures used to the competitive examination and appointment requirements contained in the Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) and contained in SBA\u2019s merit staffing plan.", "In addressing the second part of the objective--the procedures used by SBA\u2019s Office of Advocacy to hire Regional Advocates and Assistant Advocates during 1998--we first obtained a copy of, and reviewed, the federal statute that provides unique hiring authority to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy.  We then interviewed the Deputy Chief Counsel for Advocacy and obtained information on nine employees hired during calendar year 1998.  We examined information contained in each of their official personnel folders (OPFs), including the appointment authorities that were cited and the period of their appointments.  Because the Chief Counsel for Advocacy has special hiring authority that is exempt from competitive examination procedures, case files and other documentation that is required under competitive examination procedures did not exist in these cases.  As a result, we had to rely principally upon interviews with the Chief and Deputy Chief Counsels for Advocacy in determining the recruiting and hiring processes that were used in these cases.", "Our third objective was to determine if SBA followed applicable federal laws and regulations to set the salaries of, and provide salary increases to, political appointees and former congressional (Ramspeck Act) employees hired between October 1, 1991, and September 30, 1998.  We first identified those employees by obtaining an accession list from HR officials of political appointees and former congressional employees hired under the Ramspeck Act since October 1, 1991.  We then obtained the OPF of each of those employees and reviewed standard forms 50B (SF-50s) that were filed in the OPFs.  SF-50s contained salary setting and salary increase information on each employee and are supposed to be a permanent part of an employee\u2019s OPF.  We examined the salaries that SBA set for those employees and the salary increases SBA provided to them for compliance with the regulations governing salary setting and salary increases contained in the C.F.R. and in SBA\u2019s policies.  Because OPFs are to be maintained by the agencies for which the employees work, we obtained OPFs from (1) SBA\u2019s HR officials in cases in which the employee was still working for SBA at the time of our review, (2) HR officials of other agencies in cases where the employees had transferred from SBA to another agency, and (3) officials of the National Archives and Records Administration\u2019s National Personnel Records Center in cases in which the employees were no longer working for the government and their OPFs had been archived.  In some cases, we were unable to locate and obtain OPFs of former SBA employees.  In those cases we relied instead on personnel records contained in SBA\u2019s personnel database.", "Our fourth objective was to determine whether SBA adequately controlled the interagency detailing of its employees during fiscal years 1992 through 1998.  We obtained information from SBA\u2019s HR officials that identified the SBA employees who were detailed to other agencies and the agencies to which they were detailed during that time period.  (SBA officials also provided us with information on other agency employees who were detailed to SBA.)  We searched federal regulations, Comptroller General decisions, and the Federal Personnel Manual (now no longer in use) to ascertain what governmentwide guidance was available to SBA on the matter of interagency details.  We also obtained from SBA\u2019s HR officials agency personnel guidance regarding the detailing of employees and the interagency agreements that were used to effect and set the terms of the details.  We examined the OPFs of those SBA employees who were detailed and searched for relevant documentation supporting the details. Using all available documented information, as well as information obtained from interviews of officials from SBA\u2019s Office of Human Resources, we compared the circumstances of each detail to the criteria for details included within SBA\u2019s personnel guidance.  Using available documented information, as well as information obtained from interviews with officials from SBA\u2019s Office of the Chief Financial Officer, we examined (1) the status of recovering costs associated with the reimbursable interagency details and (2) the length of time each detail was to last and actually lasted.", "Our fifth objective was to determine what positions were newly created or abolished between March 1996 and March 1998 in SBA\u2019s Office of the Administrator, Office of the Deputy Administrator, Office of the Chief of Staff, Office of the Chief Operating Officer, and Office of the Associate Administrator for Field Operations and what were the sources of appointees to the newly created positions and the status of those employees in the abolished positions.  We first determined the staffing changes that had occurred in each of those offices by comparing the organizational section of SBA\u2019s telephone books for 1996 and 1998.  Those organizational sections identified specific employees of each of those offices by name and title.  For those positions that were newly established since 1996, we obtained position descriptions from SBA\u2019s HR officials.  We then interviewed SBA\u2019s HR and Chief of Staff officials to discuss establishing and making appointments to those new positions.  We also discussed with them the circumstances related to positions being abolished.  We examined information contained in the official personnel folders or examined relevant personnel information otherwise available and maintained by SBA\u2019s Office of Human Resources to determine the status of those employees whose positions were abolished.", "Our sixth objective was to determine the status of SBA\u2019s response to a December 1997 congressional mandate to establish a Senior Executive Service (SES) position within SBA\u2019s Office of Women\u2019s Business Ownership.  We first researched the law mandating that the position be established.  We then obtained information from SBA\u2019s HR officials on all executive level positions that had been established and filled during the fiscal year the legislative mandate became effective.  We interviewed cognizant SBA officials and obtained their explanation, as well as relevant documents, as to the status of the establishment and filling of the mandated position.  We compared this information to information we obtained from SBA on how it established and filled other Senior Executive Service positions during the period after the congressional mandate but prior to compliance with the mandate.", "Finally, our seventh objective was to determine whether SBA Regional Advocates attended a White House-sponsored political appointee meeting during fiscal year 1997.  Our first step in determining which Regional Advocates attended the White House-sponsored meeting was to obtain their travel vouchers and review them for evidence that they traveled to the White House.  We then contacted White House officials and confirmed that the Regional Advocates had visited the White House on the date the meeting occurred.  We prepared a summary schedule of each instance we found and then contacted six former or current Regional Advocates by telephone to discuss the circumstances of their visits to the White House. We also interviewed the Chief and Deputy Chief Counsels for Advocacy and obtained their perspectives on why the Regional Advocates may have attended the White House-sponsored meeting.", "In addressing our seven objectives, we relied extensively upon personnel records provided to us by SBA\u2019s HR officials.  Some of the information contained in those records dated back to before October 1991.  A significant portion of the records came from SBA\u2019s personnel records database.  This database is contained on computers maintained by the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Finance Center (NFC) in New Orleans, LA.

SBA said that we were incorrect in including Schedule A excepted service appointees, appointees whose pay rates were administratively determined, and limited term SES appointees in our definition of political appointees.  We recognize that Schedule A appointees, appointees whose pay rates are administratively determined, and limited term SES appointees are not traditionally recognized as political appointees. However, such appointments share certain characteristics with traditionally recognized political appointees, such as Schedule C appointees and noncareer SES appointees.  Among other things, such appointments can be made noncompetitively as are traditional political appointments, and the appointees serve at the pleasure of the agency head as do traditional political appointees.  Because of this sharing of characteristics, we included Schedule A appointees, administratively determined pay rate appointees, and limited term SES appointees in our definition of political appointee. Although SBA is correct that Schedule A appointees can include students and the disabled as well as attorneys, the Schedule A appointees included in this report were all attorneys. 2.  SBA said that a statement we attribute to a SBA official that she was unaware of any agency that uses recruitment bonuses was incorrect.  The official believes she told us that she did not have any information on the effectiveness of recruitment bonuses in any other agencies.  We understood from an interview two of our staff held with the official that she was unaware of the use of recruitment bonuses by other agencies. Nevertheless, we have modified the language in the report.  Elsewhere in its comments SBA pointed out that it has developed a policy for the use of recruitment bonuses, and we commend SBA for that effort. 3.  While commenting on a draft of this report, SBA found and provided missing documentation for the advanced salary setting for an employee hired as a district director.  We reviewed the documentation now supplied by SBA and have changed that case in this report.  Now, documented justification of the salary setting was provided for all six outside hired District Director appointments that we reviewed. 4.  We believe it would be inappropriate to delete the words \u201cappeared to\u201d because our work was based only on the evidence that was available. Further, we do not believe the wording detracts from giving SBA credit for the subject personnel actions. 5.  SBA\u2019s comment pertains to our conclusions.  It objected to our phrasing of a sentence that says that SBA usually followed appropriate laws and regulations in setting the salaries of political appointees.  Elsewhere on the same page we made the statement that with the exception of one case, SBA followed applicable federal laws and regulations when setting the starting salaries.  SBA believes the qualifying use of the term \u201cusually\u201d is inappropriate because only one case was cited as an exception.  The two statements that SBA referred to were in the conclusion section of our draft report, and we believe \u201cusually\u201d is an appropriate characterization.  The statements refer to two different groups of employees.  For one group, we were referring to the pay setting of six district director appointees.  For the second group, we were referring to the advanced pay setting of 141 political appointees.", "In our draft report, we said that SBA could not provide documentation justifying the advanced pay setting for 1 of 6 district directors and for 31 of the political appointees.  While commenting of the draft, SBA found and provided missing documentation for the 1 district director and for several of the 31 political appointees.  We have changed the report accordingly. However, supporting documentation is still missing for the advanced pay rates for 11 political appointees, and we believe our characterization that SBA usually followed appropriate federal laws and regulations is accurate."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "General Government Division", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of General Counsel", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Related GAO Products", "paragraphs": ["Personnel Practices: Career Appointments of Former Political and Congressional Employees (GAO/GGD-97-165, Sept. 2, 1997).", "Personnel Practices: Improper Personnel Actions on Selected CPSC Appointments (GAO/GGD-97-131, June 27, 1997).", "Federal Recruiting and Hiring: Authority for Higher Starting Pay Useful but Guidance Needs Improvement (GAO/GGD-91-22, Sept. 10, 1991).", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
