NMB does not have an office of inspector general to provide  independent audit and investigative oversight.", "According to NMB, its overall mission is to provide for the independence  of air and rail carriers and employees in matters of self-organization,  avoid interruption to commerce conducted through the operation of those  carriers, and administer statutory adjustment boards as well as develop  complementary strategies to resolve disputes. To fulfill its mission, NMB  has three program areas:", "Representation: Unions are selected for the purposes of collective bargaining through secret-ballot elections conducted by NMB. If there is a question concerning representation of a specific craft or class,NMB is charged with resolving the representation dispute through its Office of Legal Affairs, and has the sole jurisdiction to decide these disputes.", "Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution: The RLA provides mediation to help resolve disputes that can occur between management and labor during collective bargaining negotiations.When rail or air carriers and unions cannot reach agreement on the terms of a new or revised collective bargaining agreement\u2014such as working conditions or rates of pay\u2014either party can apply for NMB\u2019s mediation services to resolve their differences or NMB may impose mediation if it finds that resolving the dispute is in the public\u2019s interest. NMB also offers grievance mediation to parties as an alternative way to resolve disputes filed for grievance arbitration.", "Arbitration: The RLA also offers grievance arbitration to help resolve disagreements between carriers and unions over how to interpret and apply provisions of existing collective bargaining agreements. For example, employees may file grievances if they believe they were wrongfully fired or disciplined in violation of the agreement. If the carrier and the employee cannot resolve the grievance, the RLA permits either of these parties to refer the dispute to arbitration before an adjustment board. The adjustment board consists of a carrier  representative, a union representative, and a neutral arbitrator  provided by NMB. In this capacity, the arbitrator is called upon to  break a tie. NMB does not directly provide arbitration services, but  rather maintains a list of registered arbitrators from which the parties  can select someone to review and decide their case. In the airline  industry, the parties pay the costs of arbitration. In the railroad  industry, however, consistent with the requirements of the RLA, NMB  pays the fee and travel expenses of the arbitrator."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NMB Has Made Progress, but Has Not Yet Fully Implemented GAO\u2019s 2013 Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["NMB has made some progress in implementing each of the seven  recommendations we made in December 2013."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Developing a Strategic Planning Process", "paragraphs": ["In our December 2013 report, we found that NMB lacked a formal  strategic planning process and officials confirmed that they did not have a  systematic mechanism for involving congressional and other stakeholders  in this process.

In fiscal year 2014, NMB developed and published a strategic plan  covering fiscal years 2014 through 2019, which we determined was  largely consistent with OMB guidance on implementing the GPRA  Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA). NMB officials told us they used a  strategic planning process soliciting input from staff in NMB program  areas as well as from external stakeholders and Congress. Five of the  seven external stakeholder groups that we interviewed said they  commented on a draft of the strategic plan or discussed aspects of it  during regular meetings with the agency, and all reported being satisfied  with their overall communication with NMB.", "However, the agency has not developed a written policy or set of  procedures outlining its strategic planning process. Federal internal  control standards call for agencies to document the policies and  procedures necessary to achieve their objectives, including strategic  planning. Specifically, agencies should (1) establish policies and  procedures to ensure that management directives are carried out and (2)  appropriately document transactions and other significant events, and  ensure that those records are properly managed, maintained, and  available for examination. Further, through these policies and procedures,  agency management can define responsibilities, assign key roles, and  delegate authority.", "Meeting these requirements may be particularly important for NMB. NMB  officials said there was little need for preparing written documentation of  the strategic planning process, such as a standard operating procedure,  because it was simple and would be easy to replicate in the future.  Officials also said, because the agency is small, with 51 full-time  positions, its staff frequently communicate informally, limiting the need for  written procedures. However, three of NMB\u2019s five senior managers,  including the Chief of Staff and General Counsel, are eligible to retire, as  are many other employees, increasing the risk of the agency losing  institutional knowledge should they do so.

Without meeting this federal guidance, we concluded that the  agency was not positioned to track and publicly report progress or results  in its program areas.", "In this review, we found that NMB has developed new performance goals.  However, of the 19 goals in its fiscal year 2016 performance plan, one  goal specified a target, another specified a timeframe; but none followed  all elements of OMB guidance for implementing GPRAMA. Several  NMB officials told us that it is difficult for the agency to design  performance goals because some outcomes are out of its control, such  as how long it takes parties to reach agreement through mediation. Many  federal agencies also set measurable performance goals for outcomes  that include external factors outside of their direct control. Our prior work  has shown that there are a number of strategies that federal agencies can  use to reduce the influence of external factors on agencies\u2019 measures.

NMB also fully transitioned its financial systems to  third-party service providers. Specifically, NMB relies on other agencies\u2019  systems, such as the Department of the Interior, for payroll, personnel,  and human resources services, and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s  Bureau of the Fiscal Service for a full range of accounting services,  including hosting its financial management system.", "In addition, NMB has begun to take steps to improve its information  security program. Specifically, NMB developed a policy for managing  agency information, documents, and records. The agency has also  drafted procedures for its new enterprise network that include provisions  for access and identity control, configuration management, planning,  contingency monitoring, and audits. Further, it has developed a procedure  for handling cyber incidents. Finally, it has an agreement in place with the  Bureau of the Fiscal Service to, among other things, conduct a security  assessment of its enterprise network.", "However, NMB has not fully implemented most key information security  and privacy practices. (For additional details, see appendix II.) For  example, the agency does not have policies and procedures in place for  its information security program, including those for the oversight of third- party providers\u2014entities that provide or manage information systems that  support NMB operations. In addition, NMB has not conducted the  required assessments of its third-party providers to ensure their systems  are in compliance with the Federal Information Security Modernization Act  (FISMA) of 2014. FISMA requires federal agencies to develop,  document, and implement an agency-wide information security program  to protect the information and information systems that support the  operations and assets of the agency, including those provided or  managed by another agency, contractor, or other source.", "Moreover, NMB has not assessed whether its third-party providers\u2019  systems were in compliance with the Privacy Act of 1974 and E- Government Act of 2002, which describe, among other things, agency  responsibilities with regard to protecting personally identifiable  information.", "NMB officials said the agency is taking steps to address its remaining  information security and privacy issues.

In  addition, NMB reached out to OMB in September 2015, and NMB officials  said they have tried reaching out to the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) to ensure NMB is doing what is required to meet annual FISMA  reporting requirements. NMB officials said they have been receiving  information on FISMA from OMB, but not from DHS.", "Further, NMB officials said they are working on drafting information  security program and privacy policies and procedures.

An NMB official  said part of the reason the agency is not collecting complete data on  grievance types is because it does not have access to all cases. NMB  reviews all grievances filed for arbitration by either a railroad or union and  then forwards them to one of three types of adjustment boards\u2014the  National Railroad Adjustment Board (NRAB), a Public Law Board, or a  Special Board of Adjustment. NMB is able to track information on the  type of grievances filed for arbitration by the Public Law Boards and  Special Boards of Adjustment because NMB requires parties to code their  grievance type when they file their request for these boards. Parties  filing grievances with NRAB, however, are not required by NMB to code  their grievance type, an NMB official said, because NRAB is an  independent organization that sets its own procedures and NMB cannot  require that grievance codes be included in requests for arbitration filed  with NRAB. However, NMB may be able to obtain that information  because NRAB officials told us they track information on grievance type  and are willing to share this information with NMB.", "Even with data on types of grievances filed for all cases, it is not clear the  extent to which NMB would analyze them to address the arbitration  backlog. One program official said that NMB does not have a systematic  way to identify cases that may be good candidates for some type of  alternative to arbitration, such as grievance mediation, because staff  cannot easily access case information in a way that makes it readily  available for analysis. Analysis of these cases continues to be largely a  manual process that takes significant staff resources, he said. According  to an NMB information technologist, in the past, the agency has primarily  relied on staff to sort and analyze these data. However, the agency\u2019s new  arbitration case management system, which it upgraded in November  2015, should be able to produce by spring 2016 standard electronic data  reports that would facilitate this analysis.

Its Office of Administration is at an  organizational level comparable to other key mission offices, such as the  Office of Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution and the Office of  Arbitration. An NMB official told us that the agency also involves internal  stakeholders in acquisition decisions, including determining procurement  needs, reviewing existing contracts before automatically renewing them,  and justifying purchase requests. In addition, the agency entered into the  interagency agreement with the Fiscal Service in response to changes in  its workforce (i.e., the retirement of its contracting officer). Further, to  ensure NMB has a procurement workforce adequate to support the  organization\u2019s needs, two staff are being trained as contracting officers  because not having a contracting officer is a risk to the agency, the NMB  official said.

NMB now has access to electronic data on purchase requests  from the procurement and financial management systems administered  by Fiscal Service. Fiscal Service also provides NMB with monthly billing  reconciliations and weekly updates on the status of its contracts. A NMB  official said that the information received from Fiscal Service has helped  the agency analyze and adjust its spending and, as a result, NMB has  eliminated contracts for items it no longer needs, such as storage space,  copiers, and periodical subscriptions.", "However, NMB is not following an element of a third key practice\u2014to  have policies and processes in place consistent with internal control  standards and best practice. NMB has not developed written internal  policies and processes that reflect its new interagency agreement  procurement environment. The NMB procurement official said the agency  does not have current policies and processes because some of the  previous policies and procedures were lost in the transition which  occurred when the previous contracting officer retired.

We continue to believe, however, that NMB must retain ultimate  control and responsibility for all its programs and data, regardless of  which agencies are to perform the services. For example, with regard to  our findings related to information security, NMB commented that it will  develop standard operating procedures for reviewing audits conducted by  its third-party providers, but that it does not have the resources to conduct  its own audits of those contracted agencies. Under FISMA, however,  NMB is responsible for developing, documenting, and implementing a  security program to protect its information systems and data, including  those managed by another agency, contractor, or other source. We  believe that developing procedures for reviewing audits conducted by  third-party providers will be a positive step toward ensuring that NMB is  conducting this required oversight.", "NMB agreed with our recommendation to develop and implement policies  and processes to reflect the agency\u2019s current procurement environment  and indicated it is taking steps to do so. NMB also commented that  because it does not manage all of its own procurements, its policies and  processes would be largely subordinate to those of the Fiscal Service.  However, because NMB\u2019s interagency agreement with the Fiscal Service  for performance of certain procurement functions does not absolve NMB  of its responsibility to develop policies and processes as called for by  internal control standards and best practice, NMB must develop its own  set of complementary policies and processes to ensure the agency meets  its needs through efficient, effective, and accountable procurement  functions.", "In terms of its response to audits, NMB commented that all program audit  findings have been addressed and that there are no outstanding issues  related to any audits. While we recognized in the report that NMB  resolved a long-standing, significant deficiency in its fiscal year 2015  financial statement audit, we disagree that all audit issues have been  resolved. NMB needs to develop policies and procedures to address  findings from all audits, not solely those reported in the financial  statement audit report.", "NMB also commented that some of our concerns appeared to be related  to the agency\u2019s failure to sufficiently document its processes and that this  was not necessarily an indication of noncompliance with any particular  requirement.
