The Biggert-Waters Flood Insurance Reform Act of 2012 mandates GAO to review the three largest contractors used in administering NFIP. In prior reports, GAO found problems with FEMA's oversight of contractors responsible for performing key NFIP functions. This report examines (1) FEMA's progress in updating its process for monitoring NFIP contractors since GAO's prior reports, and (2) the extent to which FEMA followed its monitoring process for the largest NFIP contractors. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed FEMA data on funds obligated to contractors from fiscal years 2008 through to 2012, reviewed information from FEMA on contract management policies and procedures, and assessed data covering fiscal years 2011 to 2013 on the implementation of these policies and procedures as they pertained to the three largest contractors. GAO also interviewed FEMA contracting staff and contractors."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has made progress in improving its processes for monitoring NFIP contracts since GAO last reported on these issues in 2008 and 2011. For example, GAO recommended in 2011 that FEMA complete the development and implementation of its revised acquisition process to be consistent with a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) directive. FEMA updated its contract management guidance and revised its handbook for contracting officer's representatives to be consistent with DHS directives. The updated handbook also contained many of the elements identified in a federal guide to best practices for contract administration. Furthermore, the FEMA division that manages the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) developed a contract management reference guide that followed FEMA's handbook and federal best practices guidance.", "With some exceptions, FEMA largely followed its contract monitoring procedures for the three largest NFIP contractors GAO reviewed. For example, FEMA ensured that relevant staff overseeing selected contracts received appropriate training. Also, FEMA periodically compared and analyzed actual performance data against goals for each of the three contracts through operating reports, which would allow management to review the status of deliverables and milestones and be aware of inaccuracies or exceptions that could indicate internal control problems. However, FEMA did not develop a quality assurance surveillance plan for one of the contractors--a best practice and a key requirement identified in regulations and guidance. In 2010 and 2011, FEMA identified persistent issues with the contractor's deliverables, including quality and timeliness, and faced challenges in resolving those issues, which might have been avoidable if a quality assurance surveillance plan had been developed and used. FEMA officials stated that they are considering options to ensure that the plans are in place for future contracts, but did not provide specifics on those options or when they plan to implement them. Without detailed quality assurance surveillance plans, the expectations of the agency and the contractor can be misaligned during performance evaluations. Separately, for two of the contracts FEMA staff did not enter performance evaluations in the Contractor Performance Assessment Reporting System (CPARS), a database DHS uses to record assessments of performance of government contractors. Federal and DHS regulations and FEMA contract management guidance require entry of contract performance information in CPARS within certain time frames. By not reporting such information, FEMA disadvantaged the contractors and the government by not providing data that could be used in evaluating the contractors for future contract awards. For instance, receiving a positive CPARS assessment can enhance a contractor's reputation when bidding on future contracts, and as such, the assessments provide an incentive for the contractor to perform as expected. FEMA officials have acknowledged the issue. By determining the extent to which performance evaluations have not been entered into CPARS for its contracts, identifying the reasons why, and addressing those reasons, as needed, FEMA can help ensure that its--and other agencies'--contracting decisions and management draw on complete, relevant, and timely performance information."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve monitoring and reporting of contractor performance, we are recommending that FEMA (1) determine the extent to which quality assurance surveillance plans and CPARS assessments have not been prepared, (2) identify the reasons why, and (3) take steps, as needed, to address those reasons.

The Federal  Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) within the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) administers NFIP. The program seeks to  minimize the impact of flood-related property losses by making flood  insurance available and encouraging its purchase by those who need  flood insurance protection. During fiscal year 2013, FEMA collected about  $3.7 billion in premiums for about $1.3 trillion in coverage.", "In earlier reports, we and the DHS Office of Inspector General found a  number of operational challenges that hindered FEMA\u2019s ability to  effectively administer NFIP, including problems with FEMA\u2019s oversight of  contractors responsible for performing key NFIP functions. For example,  after spending roughly 7 years and $40 million, in 2009 FEMA cancelled a  major contract to modernize its systems for collecting data on claims and  tracking the status of policies and claims because of multiple weaknesses  in acquisition management, such as conflicts of interest and inadequate  contract performance management.

Additionally, we  compared FEMA\u2019s process for monitoring NFIP contractors with relevant  legislation, internal control standards, contract management best  practices, and related reports from the GAO and the DHS Office of  Inspector General about NFIP. We assessed the extent to which FEMA  followed its monitoring procedures for three NFIP contracts\u2014the Bureau  and Statistical Agent (BSA) contract and two flood mapping contracts. To  determine the largest contractors, we used data provided by the FEMA  Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO). We identified the 10  largest contractors for NFIP based on the amount of funds obligated to  NFIP contractors over the previous 5 fiscal years (from 2008 through  2012). We verified the reliability of the data by comparing them with data  for the same contractors over the same time period in the DHS Service  Contract Inventories database and the Federal Procurement Data  System. We determined that the contracting cost data provided by OCPO  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. To narrow the number of  contractors selected for review, we determined whether they had an  active NFIP contract during the course of our review. Additionally, we  selected contractors responsible for administering different NFIP  functions, such as flood mapping and insurance management. Together,  the three largest contracts we selected represented approximately 45  percent of the overall active contracting dollars obligated during the 5- year period from 2008 through 2012. To assess how FEMA followed its  monitoring procedures, we collected data across three key areas: training  and ethics requirements for contracting officer\u2019s representatives (COR);  performance measures; and ongoing monitoring and reporting. We  assessed FEMA\u2019s monitoring using agency procedures and contract  management best practices, including Standards for Internal Control in  the Federal Government, the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s Office  of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) Guide to Best Practices for  Contract Administration, and guidance from FEMA and its Risk Insurance  and Risk Analysis divisions. For each of the selected contracts, we  reviewed the statements of work, monthly contractor monitoring reports,  and discrepancy reports. Finally, we collected available data from FEMA  covering 2011 to 2013 and conducted interviews with representatives  from FEMA on their contract management procedures. We also consulted  with representatives of the DHS Office of Inspector General and  interviewed the contractors we selected for further insight on how well  FEMA followed monitoring policies and procedures.

Risk Analysis is  responsible for flood mapping activities and develops flood mapping  policy and guidance. FIMA established its 5-year Risk Mapping  Assessment and Planning (Risk MAP) program in 2009 to, among other  things, improve the quality of flood data used for mapping and enhance  public acceptance of flood maps. FIMA maintains and updates data  through Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and risk assessments.  FIRMs include statistical information such as data for river flow, storm  tides, hydrologic/hydraulic analyses, and rainfall and topographic surveys.  Risk Analysis staff in the 10 regional offices manage development of flood  maps for their geographic areas. Headquarters and regional staff monitor  and report flood hazard mapping progress based on program  management data provided by FIMA\u2019s three national Production and  Technical Services (PTS) contractors and other flood mapping partners.  The PTS contractors are private engineering firms working under contract  to FIMA and are each responsible for a regional portfolio of flood study  projects. The Risk MAP contract is a cost-plus-award-fee (CPAF)  contract.

The BSA  contractor liaises between the government and independent property and  casualty insurance companies that issue federally guaranteed NFIP  policies. Among the services the BSA contractor provides are financial  and statistical reporting based upon data submissions from the WYO  companies, development of forms and information related to NFIP, and  various data analyses. The current BSA contract went into effect in  January 2008 and expired in December 2013. The BSA contract is cost- plus-fixed-fee (CPFF).

In May 2011,  FEMA published its own directive on the review of contracts that was  consistent with the departmental directive. FEMA also updated guidance  in October 2011 that explains its acquisition process. The updated  guidance was intended as a tool for program offices to use when initiating  an acquisition. In particular, the guidance states that the program office is  responsible for developing the acquisition plan that includes a description  of requirements. If the program office decides not to define how the  contractor is to accomplish the desired results of the contract, it can  develop a performance work statement that defines the required results in  measurable, mission-related terms absent details about how to do the  work. The guidance requires that the performance work statement be  accompanied by a performance requirements summary that documents  the services and performance standards expected and a quality  assurance surveillance plan that defines the agency\u2019s plan for ensuring  that the contractor has performed in accordance with the performance  standards. The guidance includes a template for the performance work  statement and an intranet link to a quality assurance surveillance plan  template.", "In addition, FEMA published a revised version of its COR Handbook in  March 2012 in response to a DHS directive. According to FEMA, the  handbook is intended to provide practical guidance for CORs as they  perform their daily contract administration duties. The handbook  incorporates best practices in contract management as described in the  OFPP guide. For example, the handbook incorporates language that  encourages CORs to develop a contract administration plan along with a  quality assurance surveillance plan\u2014both OFPP best practices. Contract  administration plans are intended to provide a broad overview of the  contract, including areas of risk and concern. Quality assurance plans are  meant to be used to evaluate the quality and timeliness of the products  and services produced by the contractor, and include performance  standards, the methods of assessment, and an assessment schedule.", "Along with policy development, FEMA has adopted an intranet-based  system to centralize and electronically store NFIP contracting-related  documents, including monitoring reports. In 2008, we recommended that  FEMA implement a process to better ensure that CORs submit monitoring  reports on time, systematically review these reports, and retain the  reports in a quality assurance file. Several FEMA divisions use this  intranet-based system. In part to address our 2008 report, FEMA staff in  Risk Insurance involved in contract administration began using the  system in November 2010.

We previously found that DHS was  transitioning to using CPARS to comply with this requirement. The  primary purpose of CPARS is to better ensure that current, complete, and  accurate information on contractor performance is available for use in  procurement source selections. The CPARS guidance states that each  assessment must include detailed and complete statements about the  contractor\u2019s performance and be based on objective data (or measurable,  subjective data when objective data are not available) supported by  program and contract/task order management data. Such performance  assessment can significantly reduce the risk to the government on future  awards.

For example, the  regulations state that assessments should clearly, objectively, and  completely describe the contractor\u2019s performance in the narrative  statement, in sufficient detail to justify the rating. Furthermore, the  narratives should include a level of detail and documentation that  provides evidence and establishes a basis for the assigned rating, an  explanation of how problems were resolved, and the extent to which  solutions were effective.

Contract monitoring best practices that we  identified recommend that agencies conduct ongoing monitoring by  maintaining contract files, fully document modifications, develop contract  administration plans, develop quality assurance surveillance plans,  consistently implement deficiency guidance, and conduct annual  performance assessments (see app.I).", "For each of the three contracts we reviewed, we examined (1) the  completeness of the quality assurance files maintained by the CORs, (2)  documentation of modifications made to the contracts, and (3) deficiency  reports issued related to the contracts since 2011. We found that overall  FEMA maintained the appropriate files for the three contracts.  Specifically, we found that the files contained proper documentation on  the modifications made to the contracts. The BSA contract had few  modifications and included changes such as the assignment of new  contracting officers, the revision of the performance work statement, and  extension of the terms of the contract. The two mapping contracts have  regional subcontracts, which are set up through task orders. The mapping  contracts had multiple modifications and task orders, with varying  degrees of complexity. For example, a contract was modified to allow a  contractor to adopt new mapping technology, and another contract was  modified to adjust reporting deadlines.", "FEMA actively used deficiency reports to identify and resolve  performance problems for the three contracts we reviewed. For example,  in 2011, FEMA issued deficiency reports for each of the three contracts.  The purpose of deficiency reports is to record when a contractor does not  meet a performance objective. FEMA filed one deficiency report for the  BSA contract in 2011 and documented the contractor\u2019s corrective action  to resolve the issue. FEMA also issued three deficiency reports in 2011  for the mapping contracts we reviewed. One contractor received two  deficiency reports and provided corrective action plans that FEMA  accepted. The other contractor received one deficiency report and  provided a corrective action plan. We found that FEMA followed the  respective divisions\u2019 deficiency report guidance and resolved the  performance problems. FEMA officials stated that they have not issued  any deficiency reports related to these contracts since 2011."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Quality Assurance Surveillance Plan Was Not Developed for One of the Contracts Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["Although FEMA has generally improved its ongoing monitoring of  contractors, the agency did not develop a quality assurance surveillance  plan for one of the contracts. FEMA developed surveillance plans for the  two mapping contracts we reviewed, but agency officials did not develop  one for the BSA contract. As discussed earlier, quality assurance  surveillance plans are required for performance-based contracts  according to regulation, agency guidance, and best practices. According  to these sources, the plan should be prepared in conjunction with the  statement of work and should include, among other things, the  performance standards, the methods of assessment, an assessment  schedule, a description of corrective actions to be taken if required  performance standards are not met, and incentives to be applied. FEMA  officials stated that they relied on a brief reference to quality assurance in  the BSA contract and other guides rather than develop a detailed  surveillance plan. Specifically, the current BSA contract mentions a  \u201cGovernment Quality Assurance Plan\u201d and includes a performance  requirements summary with general performance metrics. The contract,  however, does not specify how often deliverables would be monitored  and evaluated. Risk Insurance division officials also stated that they used  the general Contracts Management Reference Guide as the quality  assurance plan for the BSA contract. However, the Contracts  Management Reference Guide was intended to provide an overview of  the COR\u2019s responsibilities and activities, and does not discuss the  method of assessment the COR will undertake, how often it with be done,  or actions the COR will take if performance is not met. The guide itself  calls for the development of a quality assurance surveillance plan.", "In contrast, our 2008 report found that FEMA had a quality assurance  surveillance plan for a past BSA contract. Further, FEMA developed a  detailed quality assurance surveillance plan for the two mapping  contracts. For example, the quality assurance surveillance plan for the  mapping contracts outlined management roles and responsibilities,  quality standards, and the process for ensuring quality control. Quality  assurance surveillance plans that focus on the quality, quantity, and  timeliness of performance outputs would likely avoid challenges  monitoring the contractor\u2019s performance. Additionally, without detailed  quality assurance surveillance plans, the expectations of the COR and  contractor can be misaligned during performance assessments. For  example, in 2010 and 2011, FEMA identified persistent issues with the  BSA contractor\u2019s deliverables, including quality and timeliness, and faced  challenges in resolving those issues, which may have been avoidable if a  quality assurance surveillance plan had been developed and used.", "FEMA officials acknowledged the need to develop quality assurance  surveillance plans. They also stated that various actions are under  consideration that may help ensure that quality assurance surveillance  plans are in place for future contracts. However, FEMA officials did not  provide specifics about these actions or provide a date for when they  would determine which actions, if any, to implement. Until FEMA  develops specific actions and implements them, it is unclear as to  whether FEMA has effective internal controls in place to ensure that  quality assurance surveillance plans are developed for future FEMA  contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance Assessments Not Reported for Two of the Contracts Reviewed", "paragraphs": ["FEMA did not report performance assessments in CPARS for two of the  three contracts we reviewed. While FEMA filed CPARS reports for the  BSA contract for 2011 and 2012, the agency did not file any for the two  mapping contracts. As discussed earlier in the report, DHS uses CPARS  reports to assess and report performance on previous contracts, and  applicable regulations and contract management guidance require entry  of contract performance assessments in CPARS. The Risk MAP  contracts we reviewed were multiyear contracts active in fiscal years  2011, 2012, and 2013. Per the guidance in FEMA\u2019s COR Handbook, the  CORs should have reported performance assessments at the end of the  contract period in 2011 and 2012, at least 120 days prior to exercising the  next option. Agency officials acknowledged that the CORs were  supposed to report such information, but had not done so. FEMA staff  responsible for the mapping contracts stated that CPARS assessments  were a low priority at that time. FEMA staff responsible for the mapping  contracts have acknowledged the importance of CPARS and stated that  completing past CPARS assessments is now a higher priority.", "As discussed earlier, internal control standards require that management  emphasize to program managers their responsibility for internal controls  and ongoing monitoring. Not submitting CPARS assessments is  disadvantageous to both the contractor and the government. Receiving a  positive CPARS assessment can enhance a contractor\u2019s reputation when  bidding on future contracts, and as such, the assessments provide an  incentive for the contractor to perform as expected. For example, FEMA  officials stated that for the BSA contract, the contractor\u2019s performance  improved after receiving a low rating in CPARS in 2011. Furthermore, not  submitting assessments reduces the information available to other  acquisition professionals in government when determining contractor  selection.

FEMA has made progress in developing contract management guidance  that addresses weaknesses identified in our past reports and that is  consistent with best practices in contract management. However, the  inconsistent application of the guidance that we identified in our review of  the three largest contracts indicated that continued attention to internal  controls is warranted. Specifically, FEMA did not develop a quality  assurance surveillance plan for the current BSA contract, which is critical  to assessing the quality and timeliness of the products and services  produced by the contractor. Regulations and agency guidance direct that  such plans be used. FEMA officials stated that they are considering  various options to ensure that the plans are in place for future contracts.  However, without detailed surveillance plans, the expectations of the  COR and contractor can be misaligned during performance evaluations  and may not focus on the quality, quantity, and timeliness of performance  outputs. Moreover, by taking actions to determine the extent to which  quality assurance surveillance plans have not been prepared and the  reasons why, FEMA would be better positioned to take action, as needed,  to address these reasons and help improve contract management, which  we have identified as a high-risk area.", "In addition, the CORs for the Risk MAP contracts we reviewed have not  entered ratings for the contractors into CPARS, the contractor  assessment reporting database used by DHS that feeds into a  government-wide contractor past performance database. CPARS data  are key to informing federal contracting decisions and applicable  regulations and agency guidance requires the use of CPARS to assess  contractor performance. Not submitting CPARS assessments  disadvantages contractors and the federal government because it  reduces the information available to federal acquisition staff when  determining contractor selection.

Additionally, we compared FEMA\u2019s process for monitoring NFIP  contractors with relevant legislation, Standards for Internal Control in the  Federal Government, contract management best practices, and related  reports on NFIP from GAO and Office of the Inspector General at DHS.  We assessed the extent to which FEMA followed its monitoring  procedures for three large NFIP contracts\u2014the Bureau and Statistical  Agent (BSA) contract and two flood mapping contracts. Using data  provided by the FEMA Office of the Chief Procurement Officer, we  identified the 10 largest contractors for NFIP based on the amount of  funds obligated to NFIP contractors over the previous 5 fiscal years (from  2008 through 2012). We verified the accuracy of the data by comparing  them with data in the DHS Service Contract Inventories database and the  Federal Procurement Data System. We determined that the contracting  cost data provided by Office of the Chief Procurement Officer were  sufficiency reliable for our purposes. To narrow the number of contractors  selected for review, we determined whether they had an active NFIP  contract during the course of our review. Additionally, we selected  contractors responsible for administering different NFIP functions, such  as flood mapping and insurance management. As shown in table 2, the  dollars obligated to the three contractors we selected represented  approximately 45 percent ($405 million out of a total of $909 million) of  the overall active contracting dollars obligated during the 5-year period  from fiscal years 2008 through 2012.", "To assess the extent to which FEMA followed best practices and  procedures for contract management, we compared FEMA\u2019s contract  management practices to criteria outlined in the following sources:", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government;", "A Guide to Best Practices for Contract Administration;", "FEMA, Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative Handbook;", "FEMA Risk Insurance Division, Contracts Management Reference", "FEMA Risk Insurance Division, Discrepancy Report Procedures; and", "FEMA Risk Analysis Division, Risk MAP Award Fee Plan.", "We grouped key contract management processes into three key areas  using the sources listed above: training and ethics requirements for  contracting officer\u2019s representative (COR), performance measures, and  ongoing monitoring and reporting.
