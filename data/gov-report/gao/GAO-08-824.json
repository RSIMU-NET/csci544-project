To qualify for the LIS, beneficiaries must be enrolled in a Part D plan and their assets and income must be less than the thresholds established by the law. Part D is administered by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), and the Social Security Administration (SSA) administers the eligibility determination for the LIS. The MMA directed GAO to compare the utilization of and access to Part D prescription drugs among beneficiaries who received the LIS with those who were denied it because of the amount of their assets. This report focuses on beneficiaries' access to prescription drugs by examining (1) the importance of assets and income in LIS denials in 2006 and 2007, and (2) state and manufacturer programs providing access to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. To do this, GAO analyzed data from SSA, reviewed information on state and drug manufacturer pharmaceutical programs, and interviewed officials from SSA, CMS, state programs, advocacy organizations, and pharmaceutical manufacturer programs."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In 2006 and 2007, assets and income were both important factors in LIS denials, but income was of greater importance. In 2006, 4.5 million beneficiaries applied for the LIS and more than half were denied the subsidy. About half of LIS denials in 2006 were based solely or in part on applicants' assets exceeding program thresholds, and in 2007, about 30 percent of LIS denials were for this reason. By contrast, 66.2 percent of denials were due at least in part to income in 2006 and 81.2 percent in 2007. Because some applicants in both years were denied the LIS by an initial screen that only asked about assets and were not required to give information on income, it is impossible to know the number of these applicants who would also have been denied the LIS because of their income. Among those who provided detailed information about their assets, applicants denied the LIS often exceeded the asset threshold by a relatively small amount, and in both years more than one-quarter of these applicants exceeded the threshold by less than $5,000. Some states and drug manufacturers offer programs that assist low-income Medicare beneficiaries in obtaining prescription drugs, but the availability of these programs and the assistance they offer are uneven. Twenty-three states offer State Pharmaceutical Assistance Programs (SPAP), which can supplement Part D benefits. These SPAPs differ in the type and extent of assistance they offer, but they generally cover some of the beneficiaries' out-of-pocket prescription drug costs. Prescription drug manufacturers' Patient Assistance Programs (PAP) also assist low-income individuals in obtaining prescription drugs. However, not all PAPs are open to Part D beneficiaries, and the drugs provided are limited to those of the sponsoring manufacturers. CMS concurred with our report. SSA expressed appreciation that we used its analysis of applicants denied the LIS in 2006 and 2007 as the foundation for our analysis of the impact of the assets test on LIS applicants."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of  2003 (MMA) created a voluntary outpatient prescription drug insurance  program, known as Medicare Part D, that provides prescription drug  coverage for over 25 million beneficiaries\u2014seniors and individuals with  disabilities\u2014enrolled in the program. Under this program, which began in  January 2006, Medicare beneficiaries can enroll in prescription drug plans  run by private companies that contract with the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency in the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) that administers the Medicare program. The   Part D program shares the cost of these drug plans with enrollees.", "To help further defray the costs of prescription drugs for beneficiaries  with limited financial means, the MMA included a provision for a low- income subsidy (LIS). Through the LIS, Medicare assists these  beneficiaries with their out-of-pocket prescription drug expenses, with the  amount of assistance depending on beneficiaries\u2019 income and assets. To  qualify for the LIS, applicants must meet two conditions: (1) their income  and assets must be less than the thresholds established by the MMA; and  (2) they must be enrolled in a Part D plan. (For 2008, the income  threshold for the LIS is $15,600 for individuals and $21,000 for couples; the  asset threshold is $11,990 for individuals and $23,970 for couples.) The  Social Security Administration (SSA) administers the LIS eligibility- determination process, notifying CMS whether an individual applicant has  been approved for the LIS or denied it. In addition to the Part D LIS, some  state and drug manufacturer programs provide prescription drug  assistance to Medicare beneficiaries with low incomes.", "Prior to the enactment of the MMA, there was considerable discussion  among policymakers about the appropriateness of using an asset test (in  addition to an income test) to determine eligibility for the LIS. Some  contended that an income test alone was sufficient to identify those who  needed the LIS and that an asset test would prevent seniors who needed  assistance from qualifying for it. Following these discussions, the MMA  directed us to compare the utilization of and access to Part D drugs among  beneficiaries who received the LIS with those denied it because of the  amount of their assets. We will address this mandate in two reports. This  report focuses on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 access to prescription drugs by  examining: (1) the importance of assets and income in LIS denials in 2006  and 2007; and (2) state and drug manufacturer programs providing access  to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. We will issue a second  report comparing the prescription drug utilization of those who received  the LIS with those who were denied it because of their assets.", "Our analysis is limited to LIS applicants; individuals deemed eligible for  the LIS\u2014dual eligibles and supplemental security income (SSI)  recipients\u2014are not within our scope because they do not have to apply for  it. To examine the impact of the asset test on LIS applicants, we reviewed  SSA documentation and examined SSA\u2019s analyses of applicants who were  denied the LIS. We did not independently examine SSA\u2019s data, but SSA  checked applicant information against its own and other federal  databases. We therefore determined that these data are sufficiently  reliable for our purposes.", "To examine potential access to other sources of assistance with  prescription drug costs, we reviewed literature on state programs and the  requirements of these programs. We also examined CMS information on  programs established by states and pharmaceutical manufacturers to  assist individuals in obtaining drugs. We interviewed state program  officials and representatives of pharmaceutical manufacturer programs.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 through July 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Under Part D, both the beneficiary and the plan  pay a portion of the cost of covered prescription drugs. In general,  beneficiaries are responsible for paying monthly premiums, an annual  deductible, and copayments. For 2008, under the standard benefit,  beneficiaries pay a deductible of $275 as well as 25 percent of the cost of  their prescription drugs up to the initial coverage limit of $2,510 (which  includes expenditures by both the plan and the beneficiary).  Beneficiaries then enter the coverage gap (also called the doughnut hole)  where they pay the entire cost of their prescription drugs. The annual  catastrophic threshold is $5,726.25. At this point, the beneficiary\u2019s \u201ctrue  out-of-pocket\u201d (TrOOP) payment has amounted to $4,050 with the  remainder ($1,676.25) paid by the plan. After reaching the annual  catastrophic threshold, the beneficiary is responsible for only modest cost  sharing: the higher of 5 percent of the prescription drug\u2019s cost or $2.25 for  a generic drug and $5.60 for a brand name drug.

Those beneficiaries who are not deemed must apply  for the LIS and show that their assets and income are below specified  limits. As of January 2008, CMS data showed that 9.38 million beneficiaries  were receiving the LIS, of whom 7.85 million had been deemed and   1.53 million had applied for the subsidy. CMS estimated that there were   2.6 million beneficiaries who were eligible for the LIS but not receiving it.", "The amount of assistance provided to LIS recipients is also determined by  their income and assets. All LIS recipients are entitled to a premium  subsidy that is based on their income. For recipients of the LIS who had  to apply for it, the premium subsidy is 100 percent for individuals or  couples whose income is less than 135 percent of the federal poverty level  (FPL). It varies by income for such recipients whose income is less than  150 percent of the FPL but greater than or equal to 135 percent of the  FPL. LIS recipients eligible for a full premium subsidy pay no premium if  they enroll in a Part D plan offering basic prescription drug coverage with  a premium less than or equal to the benchmark premium for their area.  They also can choose to enroll in a plan with a premium higher than the  benchmark premium and pay the difference between the two. Similarly,  LIS recipients entitled to a partial premium subsidy pay the difference  between their plan\u2019s premium and the percentage of the plan\u2019s premium  subsidy amount determined by their income level.

Those with incomes less than 135 percent of  the FPL and assets less than $7,790 in 2008 for individuals, or $12,440 for  couples, pay no deductible. They pay a flat amount for each prescription  until their spending reaches the annual catastrophic threshold, after which  they pay nothing. Other LIS recipients pay a deductible not exceeding $56.  They pay 15 percent coinsurance for each prescription or the plan\u2019s  copayment, whichever is less, until their spending reaches the annual  catastrophic threshold.

If applicants check \u201cYES,\u201d they are denied the LIS; if they  check \u201cNO or NOT SURE,\u201d they are asked a series of detailed questions  about their assets and income. The questions about assets cover: (1) bank  accounts (checking, savings, and certificates of deposit); (2) stocks,  bonds, savings bonds, mutual funds, Individual Retirement Accounts, and  other investments; (3) any other cash; (4) life insurance policies with a  total face value greater than $1,500; and (5) real estate other than the  applicant\u2019s home. Applicants are also asked if they plan to use any of their  assets for funeral expenses and, if they answer yes, $1,500 of their assets  are disregarded ($3,000 for couples). The detailed questions about income  cover: (1) Social Security benefits; (2) railroad retirement; (3) veterans\u2019  benefits; (4) other pensions and annuities; (5) other income including  alimony, net rental income, and workers\u2019 compensation; and (6) assistance  with household expenses from anyone (for example, from a relative or  friend).
