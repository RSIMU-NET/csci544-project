GAO also found that EPA has allowed the states great flexibility in implementing enhanced I&M programs by: (1) providing I&M system models; (2) establishing credits for test-only networks, for states that require that only certified mechanics perform repairs, and for less costly testing systems; (3) relaxing performance standards for states that can still meet their overall targets for reducing emissions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To reduce and control air pollution, the Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish national air quality standards and prescribes deadlines for states and localities to attain these standards. The act requires states to develop strategies for attaining or maintaining the standards and to set forth their strategies in documents known as state implementation plans. These plans explain in detail how, and by how much, states or localities will reduce or control emissions from both mobile and stationary sources. EPA reviews and approves these plans by calculating the estimated emission reductions that the planned actions should achieve and comparing these estimates with the overall reductions needed.", "Because motor vehicles contribute substantially to air pollution, EPA, in November 1992, issued a rule requiring 83 of the more seriously polluted areas in 23 states to implement more stringent programs\u2014called enhanced inspection and maintenance (I&M) programs\u2014for testing and reducing vehicles\u2019 emissions. This rule established credits for the reductions in emissions anticipated from implementing the various elements of an I&M program. It also allowed states to vary these elements, including the type of testing network to be used in periodically testing vehicles\u2019 emissions, provided the overall reductions anticipated from implementing a state\u2019s I&M program would be at least as great as the reductions achievable from implementing EPA\u2019s model, or benchmark, program.", "Testing networks, which consist of authorized facilities throughout an area, may be test-only (inspectors are prohibited from making any repairs), test-and-repair (inspectors/mechanics are allowed to make repairs), or hybrid (using both types of facilities). However, EPA\u2019s data, collected before November 1992, indicated that test-and-repair networks were less effective in controlling emissions than test-only networks. Consequently, EPA\u2019s rule provided that the number of credits assigned to test-and-repair networks would be decreased by 50 percent, while test-only networks would receive full credit. Some states and other interested parties questioned the adequacy of EPA\u2019s supporting data for this 50-percent discount and maintained that it amounted, in practice, to an inflexible requirement for using test-only networks. In light of the concerns raised by the 50-percent discount, you asked us to provide you with (1) the results of any audits, surveys, or studies performed since November 1992 that have a bearing on this discount and (2) the status of EPA\u2019s efforts to provide states with more flexibility in designing I&M programs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to EPA, motor vehicles produce much of the pollution that forms ozone (nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons), and they are likewise a major source of carbon monoxide in urban areas. About 30 percent of the nitrogen oxides, about 50 percent of the hydrocarbons, and about 90 percent of the carbon monoxide emitted annually in major urban areas come from motor vehicles, according to EPA\u2019s estimates. Although EPA points out that today\u2019s new cars are up to 90 percent cleaner than their 1970 counterparts, the number of vehicle-miles traveled has more than doubled since 1970 and is still increasing, effectively offsetting much of the gain from cleaner vehicles. In addition, EPA and others have found that malfunctioning and poorly maintained vehicles produce excess emissions. According to EPA, such vehicles can emit from 2 to 17 times as much pollution as they were designed to emit. To control emissions from mobile sources, the Congress amended the Clean Air Act in 1990 to require states, as part of their strategy for reaching attainment, to implement enhanced I&M programs in areas classified as serious or worse ozone nonattainment areas and in certain areas with carbon monoxide problems.", "To implement the act, EPA promulgated an enhanced I&M rule on November 5, 1992, which specified a performance standard, or minimum emission reduction requirement, for pollutants in each area required to implement an enhanced I&M program. EPA\u2019s November 1992 rule also established a model program whose use, EPA believes, will enable states to meet the performance standards for areas under their jurisdiction. The model program assumes that states will implement test-only programs and that they will require annual emission testing for all 1968 and newer vehicles and more extensive testing for 1986 and newer vehicles using high-tech, computer-controlled emission analyzers, combined with other tests of vehicles\u2019 emission control systems. Use of the model program, according to EPA, would reduce hydrocarbons by 31.9 percent, carbon monoxide by 35.4 percent, and nitrogen oxides by 13.4 percent by 2000. The actual performance standard for each area varies on the basis of local factors, such as the age of the local vehicle fleet, the relative proportions of light-duty trucks and passenger vehicles, and the average speed and trip length for vehicles in the area.", "EPA\u2019s 1992 rule allows a state to vary the model program\u2019s design elements as long as the state\u2019s I&M program reduces vehicles\u2019 emissions by as much or more than is needed to meet the minimum performance standard for carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons, and nitrogen oxides. Besides the type of testing network, which is one of the key variables that EPA considers in assessing an I&M program\u2019s effectiveness, a state may vary other design elements, including the frequency of inspections, types of automobiles (by model and year) to be inspected, types and weights of light-duty trucks to be inspected, type of testing equipment, number and types of vehicle emission control systems to be inspected, stringency of the tailpipe test, number and percent of vehicles that may receive a waiver, availability of multiple waivers, amounts that owners must spend toward repairing their vehicle\u2019s emission control system before a waiver may be granted, and other factors. Some factors that states do not choose also affect an I&M program\u2019s effectiveness in reducing emissions, such as the composition and age of the area\u2019s vehicles, miles traveled, speeds traveled, lengths of the trips taken, types of fuels used, climate, and temperature. Thus, the type of testing network is only one of many variables that can influence an I&M program\u2019s effectiveness.", "To establish emission reduction credits for the type of testing network (test-only, test-and-repair, or hybrid) used in an enhanced I&M program, EPA obtained supporting data from three primary sources: audits,tampering surveys, and special studies. These data, combined with more than 15 years\u2019 experience with I&M programs, led EPA, in its November 1992 rule, to require a 50-percent reduction in the number of emission credits assigned to tailpipe and selected other tests performed under test-and-repair programs. This 50-percent discount applied by default if a state did not have operating data from its existing test-and-repair program showing that its program had achieved a higher rate of effectiveness. EPA officials pointed out that although the number of credits for a test-and-repair network is discounted by 50 percent, the number of credits for an entire program is generally discounted by only 35 to 45 percent, depending upon the program\u2019s other design elements and the local area\u2019s parameters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Few New Data Addressing the 50-Percent Discount", "paragraphs": ["Since 1992, EPA has not conducted any audits or tampering surveys to obtain new data supporting its position on the 50-percent discount.

This study, which is supported by a 5-year, $5 million research grant to the Georgia Institute of Technology, calls for, among other things, evaluating the effectiveness of Atlanta\u2019s I&M program.", "According to EPA officials, additional data were not required because the agency adequately supported its 1992 decision and a May 1994 court ruling upheld this decision. The court\u2019s opinion noted that \u201cample evidence in the record supports the EPA\u2019s imposition of the 50 percent penalty.\u201d Nevertheless, EPA officials told us that they plan to do more audits and tampering surveys in the future, once states have more experience with operating enhanced I&M programs. They also pointed out that, beginning 2 years after implementing an enhanced I&M program, a state must conduct an ongoing evaluation of at least one-tenth of 1 percent of the vehicles subject to annual inspection in order to quantify the program\u2019s emission reduction benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States and Others Have Few New Data Addressing the 50-Percent Discount", "paragraphs": ["Officials from 14 of the 23 states required to implement enhanced I&M programs told us that their states have not conducted audits or tampering surveys to address the 50-percent discount, primarily because their states either already have implemented, or at one point had planned to implement, a test-only I&M program. Therefore, the states believed that data from audits or tampering surveys were not needed or were not a high priority in relation to their I&M program\u2019s other needs.", "Officials from the other nine states required to implement enhanced I&M programs told us that while their states have conducted some audits and/or tampering surveys since 1992, these efforts were not designed to assess the relative effectiveness of different types of I&M networks and therefore could not be used, according to the officials, to compare test-only to test-and-repair programs. For example, New Jersey, which has both test-only and test-and-repair facilities, audits each of the 35 test-only stations twice each year but uses a different approach to target test-and-repair stations for audits. Given a far larger number of test-and-repair stations and limited resources, New Jersey generally targets these stations for audits on the basis of customers\u2019 complaints, low failure rates, or other signs of problems. The state\u2019s goal when doing these audits is to improve compliance by targeting the worst-offending stations\u2014not to assess the relative effectiveness of different network types. Officials from the other eight states also indicated that their audit data cannot be used to empirically assess the effectiveness of the different network types.", "State officials said that there were several reasons why their states had not developed data since 1992 to address the 50-percent discount. They cited the 1994 court case, EPA\u2019s 1995 commitment to provide states with greater flexibility in designing I&M programs, and uncertainty about how to demonstrate the effectiveness of different I&M network types while making major changes in their programs.", "EPA officials also said that there were several reasons why states had not developed data to address the 50-percent discount. They said some states have intended to use test-only facilities all along and therefore did not have a reason to develop information on alternative networks. Other states, according to EPA, did not believe that their I&M programs were more than 50 percent as effective in reducing emissions as test-only programs; therefore, they did not see the need to collect data to justify higher credits.

The California Senate Transportation Committee commissioned a study by the RAND Corporation, which, in October 1994, found no empirical evidence requiring the separation of the test and repair functions. In February 1995, another California study, performed for the California I/M Review Committee, found little difference in the effectiveness of a test-only program and a test-and-repair program in reducing emissions. EPA has taken issue with these findings and stated in March 1995 that it does not consider the studies cited in support of such conclusions to be based on sound methodology. These California studies are discussed in appendix II.", "Georgia is also conducting a special study to address the 50-percent discount as part of an overall assessment of the Atlanta I&M program\u2019s effectiveness. As of December 1995, Georgia Tech had completed a 2-year assessment of the Atlanta hybrid network\u2019s effectiveness and was incorporating peer review comments into the final paper. On the basis of the data collected thus far, the principal researcher believes that the Atlanta program should receive only a 35-to 45- percent discount\u2014not a 50-percent discount. EPA officials said that they have some concerns about the study\u2019s use of remote sensing devices to demonstrate the program\u2019s effectiveness in reducing emissions.

The other three studies, according to their principal investigators, not only provided an indication of an I&M program\u2019s effectiveness but also directly assessed the I&M network\u2019s effectiveness in reducing emissions. However, no clear consensus on the relative effectiveness of test-and-repair and test-only programs emerged from these studies. For example, in contrast to the Georgia study discussed earlier, which indicated that Atlanta\u2019s I&M hybrid program was more effective in reducing emissions than EPA\u2019s 50-percent discount would indicate, a California study found little difference in the effectiveness of a test-only program and a test-and-repair program and observed that both were less effective than EPA\u2019s model program.

Accordingly, the agency has taken several actions to give states more flexibility in designing and implementing enhanced I&M programs that the states believe will meet their individual needs. For example, in February 1995 EPA established emission reduction credits for different types of hybrid I&M networks. In essence, EPA provided states with examples of approvable I&M programs by establishing alternative I&M network designs that, if properly implemented, would be as effective in reducing emissions as EPA\u2019s test-only model program and would enable states to meet their performance standards. These alternative I&M networks included (1) an age-based hybrid, in which older vehicles are sent to test-only facilities, while newer vehicles may go to test-and-repair facilities; (2) a retest hybrid, in which all vehicles are initially tested at test-only facilities and vehicles that require retesting are sent, after being repaired, to test-and-repair facilities if they have failed only once and to test-only facilities if they have failed more than once (repair verification); and (3) a targeted hybrid, in which information on the emission performance of vehicles (by make, model, and engine type) is used to target poorly performing types of vehicles for test-only inspections while other types of vehicles are sent to test-and-repair facilities.", "Also in February 1995, EPA established credits for the states that require repairs to be performed by trained, certified mechanics, and for less costly testing systems. States can earn extra credits if repairs are performed by trained, certified mechanics because such repairs are generally more effective and longer lasting. Furthermore, now that EPA provides credits for less costly and less complex testing equipment, more test-and-repair facilities can participate in enhanced testing programs. Additionally, EPA has been working with states and other stakeholders to establish emission reduction credits for the use of remote sensing devices to measure vehicles\u2019 emissions in actual traffic conditions. Once identified, poorly performing vehicles can be called in for repairs before they are due to be reinspected. By giving credits for using remote sensing devices to identify vehicles needing out-of-cycle repairs, EPA will be able to help the states with alternative networks meet their performance standards. EPA officials believed that such credits would be finalized by the spring of 1996.", "Additionally, in September 1995 EPA revised its 1992 rule to allow states to meet a new, less stringent performance standard as long as the states could still meet their overall targets for reducing emissions. This change gave more states the flexibility to offset the 50-percent discount for test-and-repair networks with additional reductions in emissions from stationary sources. According to EPA, in making such a decision, a state must consider the impact that the decision could have on stationary sources. For example, stationary sources may have to replace or add more pollution control equipment, reconfigure their manufacturing processes, or change the raw materials they use\u2014actions that can be more expensive than obtaining equivalent reductions from mobile sources. In October 1995, EPA also proposed greater flexibility for certain areas within a 13-state region of the northeastern United States where the movement of ozone pollution is a problem. This proposal, if approved, would allow qualified areas to meet an even lower performance standard, thereby helping these areas meet the commitments in their state\u2019s plan while choosing to implement test-and-repair I&M networks.", "EPA\u2019s actions, when taken together, provided states with significantly more flexibility than was previously available. However, the agency continued to discount the number of credits for test-and-repair programs by 50 percent, and many expressed concern that states did not have sufficient flexibility to design I&M programs that best suited their needs. The Congress responded to these concerns in late November 1995 by passing a law that eliminated EPA\u2019s automatic 50-percent discount and gave states 18 months to collect new data supporting their particular I&M program\u2019s effectiveness in reducing vehicles\u2019 emissions. On December 12, 1995, EPA issued guidance to its regions suggesting innovative program features that states may use to improve the effectiveness of their test-and-repair programs. Subsequently, officials from seven states told us they would likely collect new data supporting the effectiveness of their test-and-repair programs, and officials from several other states were considering this new option. The current I&M plans for each state appear in appendix I.", "EPA officials told us they will work with these states to ensure that adequate test data are collected during this 18-month evaluation period. They pointed out that the agency plans to meet with all affected states in March 1996 to help these states develop appropriate methodologies for assessing the effectiveness of their interim I&M programs in reducing emissions. They said that these states\u2019 enhanced I&M programs will be assessed using criteria similar to those specified in the evaluation component of the 1992 enhanced I&M rule.

For example, they suggested that we refer to the reduction in emission credits for test-and-repair networks as the 50-percent discount, a term used in a 1995 statute, rather than as the 50-percent penalty, a term used earlier by a federal court. We made this change throughout the report. They further suggested that we point out early in the report that recent legislation has eliminated any automatic discounts of test-and-repair networks.

In a covert audit, undercover vehicles are purposely set to fail either tailpipe emission tests or tampering checks. Officials from most of the states required to have an enhanced I&M program said that while they have done overt and/or covert audits, these efforts were not designed to evaluate the appropriateness of EPA\u2019s 50-percent discount. In some instances, state officials told us that they generally targeted problem stations, often on the basis of consumers\u2019 complaints, for overt and covert audits in order to minimize the number of improper inspections. For example, New Jersey, which has both test-only and test-and-repair facilities, audits each of the 35 test-only stations twice each year while using a different approach to monitor test-and-repair stations. Because there are many more test-and-repair stations in New Jersey and resources are limited, the state generally targets test-and-repair stations for a covert audit on the basis of customers\u2019 complaints, low failure rates, and other indicators of poor performance or noncompliance.

Accordingly, RAND suggested that an independent comprehensive inquiry into the state of emission and evaluation protocols is urgently needed.", "Furthermore, the study concluded that existing national data, limited as they are, suggest little difference in the measures of effectiveness between centralized (test-only) and decentralized (test-and-repair) I&M programs.

The principal researcher said that the study was not designed to evaluate the 50-percent discount provision; however, the study indicated that the Vancouver, British Columbia, test-only network, which was implemented in September 1992, is superior to a test-and-repair I&M program. The study found that the failure rate for vehicles in British Columbia dropped from 14 percent to 11 percent from 1993 to 1994 and concluded that the program had a lasting impact on reducing emissions in the province. A majority of the vehicles that failed in the first year passed in the second year, indicating that repairs generally were not just temporary adjustments. Ninety-nine percent of the vehicles were tested correctly, although in about 1 percent of the inspections, the contractor used a less stringent standard for nitrogen oxide, resulting in a few vehicles (less than 1 percent) being improperly passed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "An Analysis of EPA\u2019s 50-Percent Discount for Decentralized I/M Programs", "paragraphs": ["This February 1995 study was prepared by the California Inspection and Maintenance Review Committee.

The principal researcher said that the results of the study may be used in weighing the environmental impact of any action to reduce the number of vehicles to be tested in Minnesota.

One computation showed that ozone would be reduced only by 1.7 percent if IM-240 testing were introduced. Thus, the study concluded, among other things, that (1) IM-240 testing in Pennsylvania would lead to negligible reductions in ozone emissions, (2) centralized emission testing is significantly more costly than decentralized testing, and (3) achieving emission reductions from mobile sources appears to cost more than achieving similar reductions from stationary sources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Measuring I/M Program Effectiveness Using Remote Sensing Data", "paragraphs": ["According to the principal researcher, this ongoing study, subtitled Results of the Continuous Atlanta Fleet Evaluation, is in final draft form and should be completed early in 1996.

The study compares the results of remote sensing device measurements from nine Georgia counties that do not have I&M requirements with the results from four counties that do. It also compares the ratio of the percentage reductions in hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide actually achieved with the ratio of emission reductions postulated from the EPA model for a program of the same type.", "The study found that the four counties with an I&M program have lower emission averages than the nine counties without an I&M program. It concluded that the reasons for the higher levels of emissions in the nine counties are (1) a higher proportion of trucks compared with the other four counties and (2) the absence of an I&M testing program. The principal researcher said their research provides evidence that, as a whole, test-and-repair programs are probably less effective than test-only programs. However, there is sufficient variability in both network types to change the effectiveness of any particular program. He estimated that test-only programs vary from 50 to 90 percent in effectiveness (when compared with the EPA mobile model) and that test-and-repair programs vary from 40 to 80 percent in effectiveness.
