In addition, we obtained and analyzed air  passenger screening complaint data from April 2011 through June 2012  from a database TSA uses to document screening complaints collected  through TSA\u2019s Talk to TSA web-based portal. On the basis of information  from and discussions with TSA officials related to the controls in place to  maintain the integrity of TSA\u2019s complaint data, we determined that the  data from each database were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We  also reviewed TSA documentation and interviewed TSA officials from  headquarters offices and 6 airports selected for the type of security and  screening equipment used, among other things. The airport interviews are  not generalizable, but provide insights. Additional details on the scope  and methodology, including our assessment of data reliability, can be  found within that report. To obtain information about TSA\u2019s Pre\u2713\u2122  program, we analyzed TSA program documentation, interviewed TSA  officials, and reviewed TSA\u2019s website information in November 2012. We  discussed this information with TSA officials and incorporated their  technical comments as appropriate. We conducted all of this work in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings based  on our audit objectives.", "In summary, TSA receives thousands of air passenger screening  complaints through five central mechanisms, but does not have an  agencywide policy, consistent processes, or a focal point to guide receipt  and use of such information.

For example, TSA data indicate the  following:", "From October 2009 through June 2012, TSA received more than  39,000 screening complaints through its TSA Contact Center (TCC),   including more than 17,000 complaints about pat-down procedures.", "From October 2009 through June 2012, TSA\u2019s Office of the Executive  Secretariat received approximately 4,000 complaints that air  passengers submitted by mail.", "From April 2011 (when it was launched) through June 2012, the  agency\u2019s Talk to TSA web-based mechanism received approximately  4,500 air passenger screening complaints, including 1,512 complaints  about the professionalism of TSA staff during the screening process.", "However, the data from the five centralized mechanisms do not reflect the  full nature and extent of complaints because local TSA staff have  discretion in implementing TSA\u2019s complaint processes, including how they  receive and document complaints. For example, comment cards were  used in varying ways at 6 airports we contacted. Specifically, customer comment cards were not used at 2 of these airports, were on display at 2  airports, and were available upon request at the remaining 2 airports we  contacted. TSA does not have a policy requiring that complaints  submitted using the cards be tracked or reported centrally.", "We concluded that a consistent policy to guide all TSA efforts to receive  and document complaints would improve TSA\u2019s oversight of these  activities and help ensure consistent implementation. TSA also uses TCC  data to inform the public about air passenger screening complaints,  monitor operational effectiveness of airport security checkpoints, and  make changes as needed. However, TSA does not use data from its  other four mechanisms, in part because the complaint categories differ,  making data consolidation difficult. A process to systematically collect  information from all mechanisms, including standard complaint  categories, would better enable TSA to improve operations and customer  service. Further, at the time of our review, TSA had not designated a focal  point for coordinating agencywide policy and processes related to  receiving, tracking, documenting, reporting, and acting on screening  complaints. Without a focal point at TSA headquarters, the agency does  not have a centralized entity to guide and coordinate these processes, or  to suggest any additional refinements to the system.", "To address these weaknesses, we recommended that TSA establish a consistent policy to guide agencywide efforts for receiving,  tracking, and reporting air passenger screening complaints; establish a process to systematically compile and analyze information  on air passenger screening complaints from all complaint  mechanisms; and designate a focal point to develop and coordinate agencywide policy  on screening complaint processes, guide the analysis and use of the  agency\u2019s screening complaint data, and inform the public about the  nature and extent of screening complaints.", "The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) concurred with the  recommendations and indicated actions that TSA had taken, had  underway, and was planning to take in response. For example, DHS  stated that TSA would review current intake and processing procedures  at headquarters and in the field and develop policy, as appropriate, to  better guide the complaint receipt, tracking, and reporting processes. We  believe that these are beneficial steps that would address the  recommendation, provided that the resulting policy refinements improve  the existing processes for receiving, tracking, and reporting all air  passenger screening complaints, including the screening complaints that  air passengers submit locally at airports through comment cards or in  person at security checkpoints.", "In commenting on a draft of our November 2012 report, TSA also stated  that the agency began channeling information from the Talk to TSA  database to the TCC in October 2012. However, DHS did not specify in  its letter whether TSA will compile and analyze data from the Talk to TSA  database and its other centralized mechanisms in its efforts to inform the  public about the nature and extent of screening complaints, and whether  these efforts will include data on screening complaints submitted locally at  airports through customer comment cards or in person at airport security  checkpoints. DHS also did not provide sufficient detail for us to assess  whether TSA\u2019s planned actions will address the difficulties we identified in  collecting standardized screening data across different complaint  categories and mechanisms. DHS stated that the Assistant Administrator  for the Office of Civil Rights & Liberties, Ombudsman and Traveler  Engagement was now the focal point for overseeing the key TSA entities  involved with processing passenger screening complaints. It will be  important for the Assistant Administrator to work closely with, among  others, the office of the Assistant Administrator of Security Operations  because this office oversees screening operations at commercial airports  and security operations staff in the field who receive screening complaints  submitted through customer comment cards or in person at airport  security checkpoints. We will continue to monitor TSA\u2019s progress in  implementing these recommendations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Several Methods to Inform Air Passengers about Making Screening Complaints, but Does Not Consistently Implement Them", "paragraphs": ["TSA has several methods to inform passengers about its complaint  processes, but does not have an agencywide policy or mechanism to  ensure consistent use of these methods among commercial airports. For  example, TSA has developed standard signs, stickers, and customer  comment cards that can be used at airport checkpoints to inform  passengers about how to submit feedback to TSA; however, we found  inconsistent use at the 6 airports we contacted.", "For example, customer comment cards were displayed in the checkpoints  at 2 airports, while at 2 others the cards were provided upon request.  However, we found that passengers may be reluctant to ask for such  cards, according to TSA. TSA officials at 4 of the 6 airports also said that  the agency could do more to share best practices for informing  passengers about complaint processes. For example, TSA holds periodic  conference calls for its Customer Support Managers\u2014TSA staff at certain  commercial airports who work in conjunction with other local TSA staff to  resolve customer complaints and communicate the status and resolution  of complaints to air passengers\u2014to discuss customer service. However,  Customer Support Managers have not used this mechanism to discuss  best practices for informing air passengers about processes for  submitting complaints, according to the officials we interviewed. Policies  for informing the public about complaint processes and mechanisms for  sharing best practices among local TSA officials could help provide TSA  reasonable assurance that these activities are being conducted  consistently and help local TSA officials learn from one another about  what practices work well.", "We recommended that TSA establish an agencywide policy to guide its  efforts to inform air passengers about the screening complaint processes  and establish mechanisms, particularly at the airport level, to share  information on best practices for informing air passengers about the  screening complaint processes.

Specifically, TSA airport officials responsible for resolving air passenger  complaints are generally in the same chain of command as TSA airport  staff who are the subjects of the complaints. While TSA has an  Ombudsman Division that could help ensure greater independence in the  complaint processes, the division primarily focuses on handling internal  personnel matters and is not yet fully equipped to address external  complaints from air passengers, according to the head of the division.", "TSA is developing a new process for referring air passenger complaints  directly to the Ombudsman Division from airports and for providing air  passengers an independent avenue to make complaints about airport  security checkpoint screening. In August 2012, TSA\u2019s Ombudsman  Division began addressing a small number of air passenger complaints  forwarded from the TCC, according to the head of that division. TSA also  began advertising the division\u2019s new role in addressing passenger  screening complaints via the TSA website in October 2012. According to  the Assistant Administrator of TSA\u2019s Office of Civil Rights & Liberties,  Ombudsman and Traveler Engagement, the division will not handle  complaints for which there exists an established process that includes an  appeals function, such as disability complaints or other civil rights or civil  liberties complaints, in order to avoid duplication of currently established  processes. According to the Assistant Administrator, the agency also  plans to initiate a Passenger Advocate Program by January 2013, in  which selected TSA airport staff will be trained to take on a collateral  passenger advocate role, respond in real time to identify and resolve  traveler-related screening complaints, and assist air passengers with  medical conditions or disabilities, among other things.

The program allows frequent flyers of five airlines, as  well as individuals enrolled in other departmental trusted traveler  programs\u2014where passengers are pre-vetted and deemed trusted  travelers\u2014to be screened on an expedited basis. This program is  intended to allow TSA to focus its resources on high-risk travelers.  According to TSA, more than 4 million passengers have been screened  through this program to date. Agency officials have reported that with the  deployment of this program and other risk-based security initiatives, such  as modifying screening procedures for passengers 75 and over and  active duty service members, TSA has achieved its stated goal of  doubling the number of passengers going through expedited screening.  According to TSA, as of the end of fiscal year 2012, over 7 percent of  daily passengers were eligible for expedited screening based on low risk.  However, the estimated number of passengers that will be screened on  an expedited basis is still a relatively small percentage of air passengers  subject to TSA screening protocols each year.
