To help achieve this goal,  the United States has efforts under way to interdict illegal narcotics  moving through the transit zone \u2014 a 6 million square mile area that  includes the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, Central America, the  northern coast of South America, Mexico, and the Eastern Pacific. Drug  interdiction efforts consist of several phases, including the detection and  monitoring of potential drug-smuggling aircraft and vessels, and the  seizure of drugs and arrest of drug smugglers.

In addition, we requested from DOD, the  Coast Guard, and Customs agency data on budget obligations, flight hours,  and ship days; obtained available agency results data; and reviewed annual  agency performance reports for fiscal years 1998 through 2000. We  reviewed documentation for DOD\u2019s, the Coast Guard\u2019s, and Customs\u2019 drug  seizure databases and for two interagency drug seizure databases, and  attended a conference on cocaine seizure data.

South America is a  major source of drugs, particularly cocaine, shipped through the transit  zone to the United States. In 2000, ONDCP estimated that 31 percent of  cocaine shipped from South America to the United States transited the  Caribbean Corridor, and 66 percent came through the Mexico-Central  America Corridor (which includes the Eastern Pacific). The remaining 3  percent went directly from South America to the continental United States  (see fig. 1).", "According to the National Drug Control Strategy 2000 Annual Report, drug  interdiction in the transit zone is intended to disrupt the flow of drugs,  increase risks to traffickers, force traffickers to use less efficient routes  and methods of delivery, and prevent significant quantities of drugs from  reaching the United States. Drug interdiction operations may also produce  information that can be used by domestic law enforcement agencies  against trafficking organizations.", "According to the 1999 National Interdiction Command and Control Plan, a  completed drug interdiction normally consists of six phases, some of  which may occur simultaneously. (1) Provision of intelligence information  to drug interdiction agencies indicating that a drug-smuggling activity is  planned or underway. (2) Initial detection of a potential smuggling aircraft  or vessel. (3) Monitoring, which consists of tracking a target aircraft or  vessel (maintaining information on its position, course, and speed) and  moving to intercept it. (4) Identifying drug-smuggling traffic from  legitimate traffic. (5) Handoff, or shifting of primary responsibility  between forces, such as from DOD to the Coast Guard. (6) Apprehending  (detaining, arresting, or seizing) suspects, drugs, or vehicles or causing the  suspects to jettison their drugs or to turn back from their mission. In this  report, we use the term \u201cdrug interdiction\u201d to refer to activities in any or  all of these six phases.", "In a hypothetical example, drug interdiction agencies receive intelligence  that a drug-smuggling aircraft will be leaving South America en route to  the United States in the next few days. A DOD radar facility subsequently  detects a small, low-flying plane on a known trafficking route. Alerted by  this information and other intelligence, a military aircraft uses its radar  system to track the plane. A Customs aircraft then approaches the suspect  plane to make a visual identification. The Customs pilot observes the  suspect plane dropping what appears to be a load of drugs to a waiting  smuggling vessel in the waters below. The location of the vessel is given to  the Coast Guard so that it can apprehend the drug-smuggling suspects and  seize the drugs. The plane is tracked by the Customs pilot, and foreign law  enforcement forces are alerted so that they can apprehend the drug- smuggling suspects when the plane lands at a foreign airfield."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Interdiction Roles of DOD, the Coast Guard, and Customs Overlap", "paragraphs": ["The interdiction roles of DOD, the Coast Guard, and Customs overlap  regarding the types of activities they perform and the geographic areas  they cover.

DOD uses  equipment such as Navy ships and aircraft, Air Force aircraft, and radar  for this purpose (see fig. 2). The Coast Guard and Customs also provide  aircraft and ships for detection and monitoring, but DOD coordinates and  integrates their efforts. By statute, DOD personnel may not directly  participate in a search, seizure, arrest, or other similar activity, unless  authorized by law. As a result, DOD relies on U.S. or foreign law  enforcement agencies to exercise civilian law enforcement powers to  carry out that part of the interdiction effort.", "Within the transit zone, the Coast Guard is the lead agency for the  apprehension of maritime drug traffickers. In addition, Coast Guard law  enforcement detachments are required by statute to travel on board  designated Navy ships for drug interdiction missions to perform law  enforcement functions. During boarding operations, the Navy ships come  under the operational control of the Coast Guard detachments. These  detachments perform the actual search and seizure of a suspect vessel,  and make any arrests, since the U.S. military is prohibited from doing so.(See fig. 3 for examples of Coast Guard assets.)", "Within the transit zone, Customs is co-lead with the Coast Guard for the  apprehension of drug trafficking aircraft. The agency also assists the Coast  Guard with apprehension of maritime drug traffickers. For example, a  Customs aircraft equipped with surface search radar can detect and track  a maritime vessel, then work with Customs boats and Coast Guard ships  to apprehend the suspect drug traffickers.

The three agencies provided  us with estimates of those funds, but these estimates had a number of  limitations. In the case of DOD, the agency could not isolate its funds  obligated for transit zone drug interdiction for several reasons. First, DOD  could not always distinguish funds obligated for detection and monitoring  from those used for noninterdiction counterdrug activities. DOD  provided us with a list of funds obligated for individual DOD programsfor fiscal years 1998 through 2000, broken out by country or geographic  area and by type of counterdrug activity (such as detection and  monitoring). However, there were instances where the individual funded  program had multiple purposes. For example, funds DOD obligated to  several programs in the Caribbean were used for both detection and  monitoring and for noninterdiction counterdrug activities. Including such  cases resulted in an overestimate of the funds obligated exclusively for  detection and monitoring, and thus for transit zone drug interdiction.  Second, the funds obligated did not include active-duty personnel costs,resulting in an underestimate of total funds obligated for transit zone drug  interdiction. Third, funds obligated for detection and monitoring in the  Eastern Pacific area could not be included in our analysis because DOD  did not track funds obligated specifically for that area, resulting in an  underestimate of total funds obligated for transit zone drug interdiction.", "As with DOD, the Coast Guard could not identify funds obligated for  transit zone drug interdiction. The agency\u2019s estimate did not cover the  entire time period requested and was not specific to the transit zone. The  Coast Guard provided us with estimates of funds obligated for fiscal years  1999 and 2000. According to Coast Guard budget officials, data were  unavailable for 1998 because ONDCP did not require agencies to report  their funds obligated for drug interdiction until 1999. In addition, the  Coast Guard\u2019s estimates of funds it obligated for drug interdiction were  based on the hours spent on drug interdiction missions combined with a  cost factor. Because the agency\u2019s tracking system does not distinguish  hours spent in the transit zone from hours spent in U.S. territorial waters,  the data the Coast Guard provided to us included funds obligated for drug  interdiction activities in both areas.", "Likewise, Customs could not isolate funds obligated for transit zone drug  interdiction, in this case resulting in an underestimate of these funds.  Three factors contributed to this underestimation. First, the data were not  representative of all of Customs\u2019 transit zone air interdiction efforts.  Customs\u2019 estimates of funds it obligated for transit zone interdiction were  based on the recorded hours each aircraft spent on interdiction activities  in the transit zone, multiplied by the average hourly operating cost for that  type of aircraft. Customs provided data for specific flights made during  fiscal years 1998 through 2000 where pilots indicated that their mission  was in the transit zone. However, pilots were not required to record that  information in Customs\u2019 data system. For example, a Customs aircraft  could take off from Miami and fly to a drug interdiction mission in the  transit zone. Unless the pilot specified the location of the plane, those  hours would be logged to the Miami Air Branch rather than to any specific  geographic area. Customs was not able to estimate, for those flights in  which the geographic area had not been recorded, the amount of time  those pilots spent in the transit zone. Second, as with DOD, the Customs  data did not include personnel costs because Customs does not track  personnel costs by mission type. Third, Customs did not provide data on  funds obligated for its marine unit\u2019s transit zone drug interdiction activities  because, according to a Customs official, marine unit data were unreliable  prior to October 2000. The marine unit did not have a centralized reporting  system before its merger with the air unit in 1999, and the agency\u2019s data  collection system was not modified to incorporate data from its marine  assets until October 2000.", "Agency budget officials told us that although they do not track funds  obligated for transit zone drug interdiction, they track funds obligated for  drug interdiction in other ways that are more consistent with their  responsibilities in the transit zone and elsewhere. For example, ONDCP  requires that DOD, the Coast Guard, and Customs estimate funds obligated  for each goal of the National Drug Control Strategy, including the goal of  protecting America\u2019s air, land, and sea frontiers from the drug threat.  Budget officials from the Coast Guard and Customs told us that, in pursuit  of this goal of the Strategy, their drug interdiction missions often involved  activities that took place in both the transit zone and in U.S. territory or  U.S. territorial waters. Because of this, these agencies focus on tracking  budget data that are not specific to the transit zone. Coast Guard and  Customs officials told us that tracking budget data specifically by transit  zone would not enhance their capabilities to manage their overall drug  interdiction responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Estimates of Asset Use Had Limitations", "paragraphs": ["Because DOD, the Coast Guard, and Customs do not track data on assets  used (flight hours and ship days) explicitly for transit zone drug  interdiction, the three agencies attempted to estimate this information in  response to our request.

Specifically, DOD  provided data for fiscal year 2000, collected from JIATF-East and  JIATF-West, on the amount of time DOD assets spent on detection and  monitoring activities in the transit zone. We requested data for fiscal years  1998 and 1999 on DOD\u2019s flight hours and ship days directly from  JIATF-East and -West. In May 1999, JIATF-East changed the way it  collected information on flight hours and ship days, when it began  differentiating between total time spent on detection and monitoring  missions (including time en route to the mission area) and the amount of  time the asset was actually on-site. This change limits direct comparison of  asset use data across the 3 fiscal years.", "The Coast Guard\u2019s difficulties in estimating asset time used for drug  interdiction in the transit zone were similar to its difficulties for estimating  funds obligated. The agency provided us with asset data for fiscal years  1998 through 2000 but could not isolate its transit zone drug interdiction  time because plane and ship crews do not track their time that way. The  Coast Guard records flight and ship hours by type of mission (such as drug  interdiction, migrant interdiction, or fisheries enforcement), but not by  zone.", "As with its data on funds obligated, the asset data provided by Customs  underestimates the time it used for transit zone drug interdiction. We  received flight hour data from Customs for fiscal years 1998 through 2000.  According to Customs officials, the asset data represent a substantial  undercount of actual drug interdiction time in the transit zone for two  reasons. First, pilots are not required to record the location of their  missions in Customs\u2019 data system. Customs, therefore, only provided us  with flight hour data in which that data field was filled in. As a result, one  Customs official estimated that the data we received were missing \u201cwell  over\u201d 25 percent of the agency\u2019s transit zone flight hours. Second, Customs  could not provide us with reliable data on its transit zone drug interdiction  ship days.

Because of the  overlap between various agencies\u2019 records, this resulted in an overstated  amount. Although the FDSS has controls to prevent the same seizures  from being counted more than once, FDSS was not designed to prevent  individual agencies from reporting the same seizures in their own  databases.", "The El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC) serves as the central  clearinghouse for the reporting of drug seizure data to the FDSS. Five  federal agencies, including the Coast Guard and Customs, currently report  drug seizures to the FDSS.

Although  these controls may help ensure more accurate reporting, there remains the  potential for multiple counting of seizures in those instances where a drug- smuggling aircraft or vessel crosses over both the JIATFs\u2019 areas of  responsibility.

However,  DOD has left it up to each JIATF to determine how the CCDB will be used,  and what other specific data sources and calculations will be used to  provide data for the report. Analysts for JIATF-East and JIATF-West  informed us that the data they report to DOD on cocaine seizures are  derived from a combination of two sources: (1) data maintained internally  by each JIATF on the activity of each asset under its control and (2) data  from the CCDB regarding the type of aircraft, ship, or radar that was the  initial detection asset for each seizure.", "Each JIATF maintains its own data on the activity of the assets under its  control.

The CCDB contains a field for the detection asset that initially  reported the drug-smuggling target. Data are entered into this field after  the quarterly CCDB meeting, where each seizure (and other drug- smuggling events that did not result in seizures) is discussed in detail by  representatives from the agencies involved in drug interdiction in the  transit zone. The representatives must agree on which asset was the initial  detection asset.", "The CCDB database manager informed us that this specific field only  describes the type of asset that made the initial detection (e.g., a Coast  Guard ship or a Customs surveillance aircraft), but not whether the asset  was under the command of either JIATF-East or JIATF-West. Thus, it is up  to the judgment of the JIATF analysts how to report the incident. A  JIATF-West analyst told us that there might be situations where both  JIATF-East and JIATF-West could each claim that an asset under its  command made the initial detection that resulted in a subsequent cocaine  seizure. According to the analyst, this could happen because some  cocaine-smuggling events in the Eastern Pacific, particularly those  involving maritime vessels, take place over a series of days or weeks, and  may cross over the areas of responsibility of the two JIATFs. JIATF-East  may make the initial detection, but then lose the target. JIATF-West may  re-acquire the target a few days later, leading to the seizure of a load of  cocaine. According to the analyst, it is unclear which command should be  credited with the initial detection (and the subsequent seizure), and both  JIATF-East and JIATF-West may report the detection (and the seizure) to  DOD. Thus, both JIATFs would be reporting the same seizure to DOD, and  DOD seizure totals would be inflated. The JIATF-West analyst did not  provide evidence that such reporting had occurred.
