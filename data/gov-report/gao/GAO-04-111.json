As of March 2003, the services had contracts privatizing about 28,000 family housing units and planned to privatize 140,000 units by fiscal year 2005. As a result of this privatization, about 7,600 units had been constructed or renovated. It can take developers several years to renovate existing housing or construct new units after they are privatized. As the program progresses, it will become increasingly important to have complete data on which to determine how quickly the privatization program is creating adequate family housing. Costs for consultants are less than half of the services' privatization support costs. The services anticipate many privatization support and consultant costs to peak in fiscal year 2004 when the need for consultants diminishes once most privatization contracts are signed. Remaining support costs will then focus increasingly on managing the portfolio of the privatized housing. The services are not consistent in their definitions for privatization support and consultant costs. The differences in the services' definitions for privatization support costs result in inconsistent budgeting for these costs. Also, the differences in the services' definitions for consultant costs result in inconsistent reporting of consultant costs in the department's quarterly housing privatization report to Congress. Further, the Office of the Secretary of Defense does not report its own program consultant costs in the quarterly report. Several factors, such as differences in labor categories, hours, and skills mix that each consulting firm can use to accomplish work, limited our evaluation of how consultant fees for the military housing initiative compare among the services. Even though these factors hinder a comparative evaluation of consultant fees, service officials told us they believe that they have contracted with firms that provide the best value to the government based on their needs and that the consultants' fees are fair and reasonable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has estimated that about 60 percent, or  over 180,000 units, of its family housing inventory in the United States is  inadequate, lacking modern amenities, and in need of renovation or  replacement in 1998. DOD has determined that fixing this problem using  only traditional military construction would cost as much as $16 billion  and take over 20 years. Recognizing this problem, Congress provided DOD  with new authorities to improve military housing more economically and  at a faster rate than could be achieved through traditional military  construction funding. Known as the Military Housing Privatization  Initiative, the basic premise behind this program is for DOD to use private  sector investment capital and housing construction expertise to finance,  own, operate, and maintain military housing. Under this program, the  department can provide direct loans, loan guarantees, or co-investments of  land or cash to encourage the private sector to use private investment  funds to build or renovate housing for use by military servicemembers and  their families. Under the privatization effort, for example, developers  assume responsibility for existing military housing units included in the  contracts and may demolish or renovate existing units and construct new  units. For DOD, this program has represented a new way of doing business  and has proven to be inherently complex to implement because of the  extensive real estate, financial, and legal expertise required. As a result,  DOD has relied on consultants to provide this expertise and help advance  the program.", "Over time, Congress has expressed concern about the lack of progress  with the military\u2019s housing privatization program and required the Office  of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) to report quarterly to Congress on the  status of the services\u2019 housing privatization projects. In 2000, Congress  added another requirement that DOD report quarterly information on the  services\u2019 expenditures for consultants due to its concern about the cost of  implementing the program. In turn, DOD has included this information in  its Military Housing Privatization Initiative Housing Privatization  Report to the Congress.  The military services consider consultant costs as  a type of privatization support costs\u2014a category that includes other  support costs for the program, such as civilian salaries, training, and  travel.", "In March 2003, you requested that we review the costs of consultants used  by DOD to support privatizing military housing. In July 2003, we provided  your offices with briefing materials on our preliminary findings. This  report summarizes our findings.

In conducting our work, we interviewed Army, Navy, Marine  Corps, and Air Force headquarters\u2019 officials to obtain information related  to the status of the privatization program, the use and costs of consultants,  and the variances in privatization support and consultant costs.

Servicemembers, in turn, may use their housing allowance to  pay rent and utilities to live in the privatized housing. Because the program  represents a new way of doing business for both the military and the  private sector, DOD has relied on consultants for a variety of advisory and  assistance services. In completing privatization agreements, many  financial, budgetary and other issues need to be resolved to the  satisfaction of the government, developers, and private lenders before a  deal can be closed. Further, each privatization agreement is different and  involves unique issues. According to DOD officials, consultants provide  the necessary expertise and assistance to help resolve these issues.", "Initially, DOD established the Housing Revitalization Support Office in  OSD to facilitate implementation of the military housing privatization  program. This office established the financial and legal framework for the  new initiative and provided assistance to the services as they began to  consider housing privatization. Initial progress in implementing the  program was slow and, in 1998, DOD shifted primary responsibility for  implementing the program to the individual services. With this change, the  Housing Revitalization Support Office was eliminated, and housing  privatization oversight responsibility was assigned to a newly created  office in OSD\u2014now known as the Housing and Competitive Sourcing  Office.

DOD now includes this information in  its Military Housing Privatization Initiative Housing Privatization  Report to the Congress.  The report lists each privatization project,  identifies the number of units to be privatized, shows the project  milestones, and includes the cumulative amount spent on consultants by  project and service.", "Military construction appropriations fund the military housing  privatization program, including privatization support and consultant  expenditures. Privatization support includes costs for consultants, federal  civilian salaries, and training and travel activities. Some of the services  also include costs for environmental assessments; land boundary surveys;  and supervision, inspection, and overhead construction activities.

Similarly, the Army and the Navy do not include the  costs for supervision, inspection, and overhead construction activities as  privatization support costs while the Air Force does. Without a common  definition, these differences in accounting lead to an increased variance in  the services\u2019 reported costs and add difficulty for DOD and Congress to  accurately determine total privatization support costs across the services.", "According to officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), DOD does not have written budget guidance defining what  types of privatization support costs should be included in the services\u2019  budget estimates. Thus, the services account for housing privatization  support costs differently. For example, according to Navy officials, the  Navy\u2019s privatization support budget account does not include costs for  activities that the other services do, such as environmental assessments  and land boundary surveys. As such, the Navy\u2019s privatization support  expenses may not be as low as they appear in its budget. Navy has  combined the management of the family housing program with its real  estate, acquisition, and construction contracting expertise in the Naval  Facilities Engineering Command\u2014the command responsible for military  construction. Thus, the costs for environmental assessments, land  boundary surveys, and supervision, inspection, and overhead construction  activities are part of how the command conducts its mission and are not  captured in the Navy\u2019s privatization support budget. According to Navy  officials, these activities are conducted and funded within the command  and a budget request distinction is not made as to whether the costs for  these activities are for a privatization housing project or a traditional  military construction project. For example, Navy\u2019s estimated $5 million  costs for environmental assessments for its privatization housing efforts  through 2008 will not be reflected in its privatization support account  although this cost is in the other services\u2019 privatization support accounts.

In contrast, the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps view portfolio  management as a consultant cost; and this expense is included in the  report to Congress. As a result, OSD is providing inconsistent service data  regarding consultant costs in the department\u2019s quarterly housing  privatization report to Congress.

Despite some commonalities (e.g., program manager  and financial analyst), the services for the most part list different labor  categories and staff positions in their consultant contracts. The Air Force,  for example, identified 22 labor categories for each of its five consultants,  while the Navy and Army listed 5 and 7 labor categories, respectively.", "Labor and hour mixes. Each consulting firm generally emphasizes a  different mix of staff and anticipated number of labor hours, depending on  the needed work. As such, contracting with a consultant with lower hourly  fees will not necessarily result in the lowest total cost because the  different consultant firms use a mix of staff with varying hourly pay rates  and charge different hours to complete the work. Air Force data, for  example, showed that one firm, which charges higher average hourly fees,  planned to dedicate fewer labor hours to a proposed task than another  firm, which charges a lower average hourly fee. The particular mix of staff  and labor hours proposed by both firms led to only a 3 percent cost  variance for a proposed project of about $780,000. In addition, Air Force  data showed that two firms proposed that its senior managers dedicate  considerably fewer hours to the project although charging higher hourly  fees, while another firm proposed that its senior managers dedicate  considerably more hours to the project but charge significantly lower  hourly fees. Thus, a comparison of consultant fees in isolation could  create a misleading assessment.", "Scope of work. Different scopes of work within the various housing  privatization projects may generate different labor mixes or entirely new  labor categories for a particular consultant, making comparison difficult.  For example, the Air Force uses two different sets of labor categories for  the same firm\u2014one for the portfolio management work and another,  which is slightly different, for the privatization support work.", "Capacities. Consulting firms have different capacities\u2014some are small  businesses while others are global enterprises\u2014and each firm has  different capabilities and expertise. According to Air Force data, for  example, the firms charging the lowest average hourly fee at the  managerial level have only six Air Force family housing privatization  projects between them.
