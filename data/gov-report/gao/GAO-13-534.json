Recognizing the limitations of its current cost data, the Department of Energy (DOE) and NNSA are implementing the Institutional Cost Reporting initiative intended to create a standardized report of certain costs, including many indirect costs. However, DOE is uncertain how it will use the data gathered by this initiative, and these efforts may provide only limited improvements because the data will continue to only be reported at an aggregate level.", "NNSA examines M&O contractors\u0092 models for allocating indirect costs for compliance with Cost Accounting Standards\u0092 requirements at least annually, which helps ensure accuracy.

NNSA generally relies on the M&O contractors\u0092 internal audits, however, to assess whether M&O contractors\u0092 day-to-day cost allocation practices conform to disclosed cost allocation models. NNSA reviews some summary data to independently assess day-to-day compliance with Cost Accounting Standards but does not conduct independent audits.

NNSA undertakes these responsibilities  through eight sites. Three of these sites\u2014Lawrence Livermore National  Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National  Laboratories\u2014are national security laboratories. These three laboratories  are critical to carrying out NNSA\u2019s mission to provide management and  security of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.

M&O contractors are  required to follow federal requirements governing NNSA indirect cost  management. These include Cost Accounting Standards, which contain  requirements for the measurement, assignment, and allocation of costs to  government contracts and provide criteria for the classification and  allocation of indirect costs. These standards also provide contractors with  some flexibility in how they classify and allocate indirect costs.

In 2005, we  reported that indirect costs at NNSA\u2019s laboratories could not be readily  compared because of differences in how indirect costs are identified and  allocated to programs, and because of differences in the facilities\u2019  missions, corporate structures, and accounting systems. In 2010, we  reported that NNSA does not collect reliable and timely information on  indirect costs at the NNSA sites, including the laboratories, which is  crucial for effective management of government operations and for  oversight.

In that report, we noted that while DOE required its M&O  contractors to separately report data on costs to support missions, such  as administrative support, these costs could not be readily compared.  These include costs that are classified as both direct and indirect. Further,  in 2012, in response to limitations in these data, we reported that DOE  was trying to improve its ability to oversee its M&O contractors\u2019 costs  through the implementation of the Institutional Cost Reporting initiative.Specifically, this initiative is a multiyear effort that aims to collect certain  cost data and report them at an aggregate level across broad cost  categories such as maintenance and central administrative support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "M&O Contractors Differ in How They Allocate Indirect Costs, and Efforts to Standardize Cost Reporting May Provide Limited Improvements", "paragraphs": ["M&O contractors differ in how they classify and allocate indirect costs,  which continues to make it difficult for NNSA, Congress, and others to  compare program costs across laboratories.

To allocate costs to  programs, M&O contractors classify costs as either direct or indirect.  Direct costs, such as labor and materials, are assigned to the benefitting  program or programs. Indirect costs\u2014those costs that cannot be  assigned to a particular program such as costs for administration and site  support\u2014are accumulated, or grouped, into indirect costs pools. The  M&O contractor estimates the amount of indirect costs (accumulated into  indirect cost pools) that will need to be distributed to each program and  adjusts the costs to actual costs by the end of the fiscal year. The  contractor then distributes these costs based on a rate in accordance with  the cost allocation model. Typically, labor costs receive a higher  allocation of indirect costs than do costs such as direct material  expenditures. The final program cost is the sum of the total direct costs  plus the indirect costs distributed to the program (see fig. 1).", "In implementing this allocation process, however, similar costs can be  allocated differently because M&O contractors\u2019 cost allocation models,  which outline the M&O contractor\u2019s structure for identifying and allocating  indirect costs, differ. Officials in NNSA\u2019s OFFM said that because of the  flexibility the Cost Accounting Standards provide, NNSA does not have  the authority to require M&O contractors to classify and allocate costs in a  uniform manner. Specifically, M&O contractor cost allocation models  differ in how they (1) classify costs as either direct or indirect, (2)  accumulate these costs into indirect cost pools, and (3) distribute indirect  costs to specific programs. For example:", "Classification. M&O contractors differ in how they classify costs as  direct or indirect. For example, M&O contractors at Los Alamos told  us they make significant use of service centers\u2014departments which  perform specific technical or administrative services for programs  such as for telecommunications and computing and separately assign  these costs directly to the benefitting laboratory department  overheads or programs. In total, service center costs for fiscal year  2012 totaled around $180 million at Los Alamos. In contrast, M&O  contractors at Lawrence Livermore reported making limited use of  service centers\u2014their costs totaling around $20 million for fiscal year  2012\u2014and instead classified these costs as indirect. Lawrence  Livermore officials said that they conducted a business process  analysis, which found that it was more efficient and cost-effective for  their laboratory to allocate these costs through an indirect-cost pool  than to try to develop and administer service centers that would then  charge each program directly.", "Accumulation. M&O contractors differ in how they accumulate indirect  costs into indirect-cost pools. For example, the M&O contractor at  Sandia used both program management and division support indirect- cost pools to accumulate certain indirect support costs that could not  be charged to specific projects. The M&O contractors at Los Alamos  and Lawrence Livermore recovered these costs through different  indirect-cost pools such as program office overhead and site support.  For fiscal year 2011, we found that M&O contractors accumulated  costs into differing numbers of indirect-cost pools, with one site using  as few as 4 pools and another using as many as 11.", "Distribution. M&O contractors differ in how they distribute indirect  costs accumulated into indirect-cost pools to programs. For example,  in fiscal year 2013, the M&O contractor at Lawrence Livermore  distributed General and Administrative costs\u2014costs incurred for the  administration of the lab such as executive management and human  resources\u2014to total costs excluding materials and subcontract costs  incurred by programs, while the M&O contractor at Los Alamos  distributed these costs to total program costs including those for labor,  materials, and subcontract costs.", "M&O contractors\u2019 cost allocation models have also substantially changed  over time. For example, according to M&O contractor documentation for  Los Alamos, the M&O contractor substantially changed and simplified its  cost allocation model in fiscal year 2013 to improve compliance with Cost  Accounting Standards and increase the transparency of these costs.  M&O contractor documentation outlining the major changes indicated that  these changes increased administrative efficiency at the laboratory. While  the change in the cost allocation model did not change the total amount of  indirect costs allocated at the laboratory, the changes did affect the  amount of indirect costs allocated to certain program costs, such as the  cost of subcontractors employed at the laboratory and construction  projects, which now received a greater distribution of indirect costs. The  M&O contractor at Lawrence Livermore also substantially changed its  cost allocation model in recent years. For example, for fiscal years 2005  to 2013, the M&O contractor decreased the number of different rates  used to allocate indirect costs to its programs from 184 to 12. The M&O  contractor at Sandia has also substantially changed its cost allocation  model since fiscal year 2010. For example, the M&O contractor combined  certain indirect pools and changed the amount of indirect costs allocated  to some program costs, such as those for subcontractor labor.", "Because of the differences in how M&O contractors allocate indirect costs  and changes in allocation practices over time, it remains difficult to  compare program costs either across laboratories or at an individual  laboratory over time. In particular, it is unclear whether the allocation  differences or other factors, such as more effective program  management, were the primary cause for the difference in program costs.  Specifically, differences in how costs are classified as either indirect or  direct, accumulated into indirect-cost pools, and distributed to specific  programs can impact the ratio of indirect to total program costs at the  laboratories. This ratio is, in part, used by Congress to compare M&O  contractor performance. However, as we have previously reported, this  ratio alone should not be used as a tool to compare performance as it  does not account for the myriad factors that can affect the ratio of indirect  to total program costs. Specifically, data on these costs do not account  for differences in M&O contractor allocation practices or differences in  laboratories\u2019 mission, size, age, or condition, which affects costs. For  example, the maintenance costs for a 50-year-old manufacturing facility  will likely be higher than those of a modern research facility.", "DOE officials noted that Cost Accounting Standards do not require all  contractors to use the same methodology to allocate indirect costs and  that project management and cost estimation can be conducted through a  variety of project management tools. However, GAO has previously noted  shortcomings with data collected, as well as its use by DOE and NNSA to  manage projects and estimate costs. For example, in 2010, we reported  that NNSA cannot accurately identify the total costs to operate and  maintain weapons facilities and infrastructure.  In 2011, we reported that  NNSA needs more comprehensive infrastructure and workforce data to  improve its enterprisewide decision making.  Further, in 2012, we  reported that NNSA lacked the analytical capability needed to review  proposals for program activities and verify cost estimates. Additionally,  according to a senior CAPE official responsible for working with NNSA to  develop more accurate cost estimates for its weapons programs, the cost  data collected by NNSA\u2019s M&O contractors has shortcomings. According  to the official, M&O contractors organize their cost data to meet two  primary goals. First, contractors want to ensure that they are fully  reimbursed for their costs. Second, contractors want to ensure that they  fairly allocate indirect costs to programs and projects. However, the  CAPE official stated that these data are of limited use to support decision  making for programs, projects, and activities including weapons life  extension programs, facility construction projects, and facility operations.  The official stated that, during his team\u2019s review, they found that the M&O  contractors\u2019 cost data for the laboratories was rarely in a form that would  be useful for decision-making analysis. In addition, the official stated that  the quality of data varied widely across M&O contractors and substantial  effort by the CAPE team and the M&O contractor was required to  understand and explain trends in the data. The CAPE official added that  NNSA does not currently have the data needed to accurately identify the  total costs to operate and maintain its weapons facilities and structures.  The official stated that NNSA\u2019s needs are changing rapidly as officials  deal with difficult choices in a budget-constrained environment. He added  that the need for better cost data collection to support decision making is  both immediate and imperative. The official stated that CAPE is actively  working with NNSA to guide and improve its ability to gather, analyze,  and present more useful M&O contractor cost data to decision makers. In  May 2013, NNSA announced the creation of the Office of Program  Review and Analysis, to provide independent analytical advice to help  improve NNSA\u2019s ability to budget, plan, and oversee programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE and NNSA Are Taking Additional Steps to Standardize the Reporting of Certain Indirect Costs, but These Efforts May Provide Only Limited Improvements", "paragraphs": ["DOE and NNSA are taking steps to standardize the reporting of certain  costs; however, these efforts may provide only limited improvements  because the data will continue to only be reported at an aggregate level.  As noted previously, in 2010, DOE began implementation of Institutional  Cost Reporting\u2014a DOE-wide initiative to create a standardized report of  certain costs, including many indirect costs\u2014to improve its ability to  oversee its sites\u2019 costs. Specifically, Institutional Cost Reporting is a  system to collect and report costs at an aggregate level across 28 broad  cost categories. DOE officials and documentation noted several  anticipated improvements that are expected from implementing  Institutional Cost Reporting, including improved data reliability as  compared with previous method for collecting and reporting support  costs. In January 2012, we recommended that DOE take steps to ensure  that the data resulting from the Institutional Cost Reporting are complete  and comparable for monitoring sites\u2019 support costs, and DOE concurred  with our recommendation. DOE established joint DOE and contractor  teams to perform peer reviews intended in part to standardize the data  collected through Institutional Cost Reporting. In May 2013, DOE officials  said that they had completed the reviews for several sites, including  Lawrence Livermore, Los Alamos, and Sandia. Officials stated that they  were uncertain when the remaining reviews would be completed.", "According to DOE documents, the Institutional Cost Reporting initiative  established general goals to develop more timely, accurate, and  meaningful data on M&O contractor\u2019s costs. However, DOE officials  responsible for helping implement the initiative stated that they are  uncertain how or if the data will actually be used. This is because this  initiative replaced an earlier system used by DOE to collect and report  support costs and, like this earlier system, the Institutional Cost Reporting  data will only provide data at an aggregate level across cost categories,  such as maintenance. In addition, DOE officials told us that since the  Institutional Cost Reporting data appear at an aggregate level, further  analyses will be needed to assess the causes for any differences in  Institutional Cost Reporting cost categories across the laboratories and  other sites. For example, if costs for an activity such as maintenance are  significantly higher at one laboratory than another, further research would  be needed to determine if the difference is due to efficiency or differences  in mission, condition of infrastructure, location, or other reasons. A senior  DOE official said that Institutional Cost Reporting is in its early stages and  that DOE does not currently know how the data will be used. Further,  DOE officials said they were uncertain about the extent to which  Institutional Cost Reporting data can be used to improve the transparency  and management of laboratory costs, especially indirect costs. To better  understand the Institutional Cost Reporting data and help identify  potential management uses, DOE officials said that they had initiated  several analyses to review specific cost items in the Institutional Cost  Reporting data. However, a DOE official helping oversee these efforts  noted that the data gathered through Institutional Cost Reporting may  ultimately not prove to be useful, as it may not provide meaningful data  that can be used to aid management and oversight. Officials with DOD\u2019s  CAPE office have also expressed concerns over the usefulness of these  aggregated data to improve transparency, aid management, and identify  opportunities for cost savings. Moreover, in commenting on a draft of this  report, DOE noted that it has determined that the Institutional Cost  Reporting initiative data are aggregated at such a high level that they  cannot be used to compare detailed contractor costs.", "OFFM officials also stated that their use of the Institutional Cost Reporting  data to assess costs and potentially identify cost savings is still largely in  the planning stages. Specifically, OFFM officials stated that, while the  Institutional Cost Reporting data is more useful and comparable than  other data, such as indirect cost rates, additional analyses are still  needed to determine if the cost differences identified in Institutional Cost  Reporting data are due to efficiency differences or other differences  among the laboratories. To date, OFFM officials have taken some steps  to use Institutional Cost Reporting data to compare costs across its  laboratories and help identify cost savings.

Some of these instances  affected the accurate allocation of indirect costs. OFFM officials stated  that instances of noncompliance have been resolved or are in the process  of being resolved. Examples are as follows:     In March 2009, OFFM and NNSA site officials determined that the  M&O contractor\u2019s indirect cost allocation model for Lawrence  Livermore did not fully comply with Cost Accounting Standards.  Specifically, activities such as science and technology strategic  planning and laboratory outreach were included in a strategic mission  support indirect-cost pool. These costs were viewed by Lawrence  Livermore as broadly institutional in the same manner as General and  Administrative costs. According to NNSA officials, the M&O contractor  allowed this practice to occur because it believed that these programs  did not equitably benefit from the activities covered by these indirect  costs. OFFM officials disagreed, and the M&O contractor changed its  cost allocation model in fiscal year 2013 to include these indirect costs  in the General and Administrative indirect-cost pool.", "In October 2009, OFFM reviewed M&O contractor indirect cost  allocations at Lawrence Livermore being applied to the National  Ignition Facility\u2014a research facility intended to demonstrate nuclear  fusion reactions using lasers\u2014and determined that the M&O  contractor\u2019s cost allocation model did not comply with certain aspects  of the Cost Accounting Standards. Specifically, the M&O contractor\u2019s  model did not equitably distribute indirect costs during the  construction of the facility, as the Cost Accounting Standards require.  NNSA\u2019s contracting officer concurred but permitted the M&O  contractor to continue using this model through October 2012 to  minimize disruption to the program. As a result, 18 other programs at  the site continued to assume a greater share of these indirect costs,  which totaled about $134 million for fiscal year 2013, according to our  analysis of M&O contractor documents. For example, according to  M&O contractor documents, the Departments of Defense and  Homeland Security, which conduct research at Lawrence Livermore,  paid more each year to cover indirect costs that would have otherwise  been collected from the National Ignition Facility project.", "In July 2010 and January 2011, OFFM determined that the M&O  contractor\u2019s indirect cost allocation model for Los Alamos did not fully  comply with Cost Accounting Standards because construction  projects and certain other types of labor were fully or partially exempt  from having to contribute the standard cost allocation amounts for  General and Administrative indirect costs at the laboratory. According  to OFFM officials, other programs at the site needed to contribute  more money to the General and Administrative cost pool to  compensate for this shortfall, resulting in the inequitable sharing of  these indirect costs across all programs.

In 2009, Los Alamos\u2019 M&O contractor conducted an  internal audit to determine whether its laboratory\u2019s day-to-day labor  allocation practices conformed to its disclosed cost allocation model.  The audit determined that labor hours reported by M&O contractor  employees did not always reflect the actual work performed, and labor  costs may not have been allocated equitably among all benefitting  programs and therefore was not consistent with their cost allocation  model. For example, one employee interviewed during the  contractor\u2019s internal audit noted an instance where labor hours were  transferred from one program to another to prevent a cost overrun.  The M&O contractor identified and implemented corrective actions to  address the problem, including providing training and guidance to  laboratory employees about proper time and labor reporting practices.  In April 2011, the M&O contractor\u2019s internal audit office conducted a  follow-up audit and found that three of four corrective actions  identified in the prior report were completed but that there was still  need for further improvement regarding the allocation of labor costs.  Specifically, the follow-up report concluded that the allocation of  indirect labor costs posed a high risk and significant concern.  According to the M&O contractor documentation, M&O contractor  managers later determined that the problem was not significant  enough to warrant further corrective action. However, the M&O  contractor\u2019s internal audit management and OFFM officials told us  that they are continuing to work to resolve the issue.", "Lawrence Livermore. Lawrence Livermore\u2019s M&O contractor internal  auditors reported similar problems in September 2010, including some  instances where indirect labor hours were inaccurately allocated to  direct projects, inconsistent with its disclosed cost allocation model.  To correct these problems, M&O contractor managers agreed to  update policies, procedures, and guidance on proper cost allocation  practices at the laboratory, and develop training for employees.

However, OFFM and OIG officials and M&O  contractors hold varying opinions regarding the level of risk of inaccurate  indirect cost allocation practices at the laboratories. For example, some  OFFM and OIG officials and M&O contractors told us that they believe the  risk is generally low compared with other federal agencies. Specifically,  because NNSA M&O contractor operations are federally funded, and the  operations are not mixed with private activities, the risk is low that federal  funds are being used to pay an inequitable and higher share of indirect  costs for private, nonfederal activities. In contrast, senior NNSA field  office official told us that he is concerned about the ongoing possibility  that indirect costs could be manipulated\u2014that is, allocated to other  programs\u2014to avoid exceeding program budgets and, therefore, believes  the risk is high. This concern was echoed by an M&O contractor\u2019s internal  audit office, which reported in April 2011 that, based on its audit findings  the allocation of indirect costs posed a high risk. This contractor\u2019s internal  audit office also confirmed that M&O contractor labor hours in at least one  instance were transferred to another program to prevent a cost overrun.  Despite the uncertainty of the risk of noncompliance, NNSA\u2019s Chief  Financial Officer in OFFM does not conduct formal periodic risk  assessments. One of the federal standards for internal control\u2014risk  assessment\u2014states that management should assess the risks faced  entity-wide, and at the activity level, from both external and internal  sources. The standard also states that if risks have been identified,  management should decide what actions should be taken to mitigate  them. The identification and prioritization of these risks can then influence  decisions regarding the type, timing, and extent of future monitoring or  oversight. Risk identification methods may include, among other things,  forecasting and strategic planning, and consideration of findings from  audits and other assessments. Without a formal, periodic risk assessment  regarding the level of risk posed by noncompliance, NNSA may not have  a well-documented basis for its decisions regarding the type, timing, and  extent of future monitoring or oversight.", "Recently, the OIG has taken some steps to improve its understanding of  the risks associated with M&O contractors\u2019 noncompliance with Cost  Accounting Standards. First, the OIG contracted a private auditing firm to  perform a limited audit at Lawrence Livermore in 2012 to test compliance  with one Cost Accounting Standard that addresses the allocation of direct  and indirect costs.problems or potential issues or challenges were identified.

In particular,  NNSA includes provisions in its contracts to encourage or require  laboratories to take steps to manage costs. For example, NNSA\u2019s  contracts require M&O contractors to regularly benchmark costs to  standards for high performing external businesses and other contractors.  Laboratory M&O contractors take some steps to benchmark costs and  practices to industry and take corrective actions as needed, but these  efforts have varied from laboratory to laboratory. For example, the M&O  contractor at one laboratory stated that they undertook a benchmarking  study to compare the costs of servicing the laboratory\u2019s fleet of vehicles  in-house as compared with using an outside vendor. The M&O contractor,  concluding that an outside provider would be more cost-effective,  contracted with an outside provider and estimated an annual savings of  approximately $775,000. In addition to M&O contractor-led efforts, NNSA  has also taken steps to benchmark costs at its laboratories and sites.  Specifically, NNSA hired external consulting groups to conduct  benchmarking studies in the areas of finance, information technology, and  human resources management across multiple NNSA sites, which  provided their reports to NNSA in March 2009.areas for improvement and, while M&O contractors noted that they  consider the information from these studies in decision-making  processes, they were unable to provide documentation showing what  steps were taken specifically in response to findings or recommendations  in these studies.", "Although contracts for the three laboratories do require that  benchmarking be performed, the contract provisions do not specify the  areas that should be examined, how frequently benchmarking should  occur, and what process should be used for implementing any needed  corrective actions. In contrast, DOE provides more specific requirements  for benchmarking pension and post-retirement benefit costs.  Specifically, DOE guidance requires contractors to benchmark certain  employee benefits every 2 to 3 years and implement corrective action  plans if benchmarking efforts show that the value of certain employee  benefits are 5 percent or higher than industry averages.", "In addition to benchmarking, OFFM is involved in other activities to help  identify cost savings, improve efficiency, and help ensure the  reasonableness of costs. We previously reported on efforts taken by DOE  and NNSA to reduce M&O contractors\u2019 costs at its laboratories such as  through streamlining and centralizing certain support functions, such as  for human resources. In addition to those efforts, the OIG also conducts  audits to help reduce costs, including indirect costs. OFFM officials said  that they also participate in NNSA\u2019s Business Management Advisory  Council, which includes NNSA\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, chief operating  officers from each M&O contractor, field office representatives, and the  NNSA Senior Procurement Executive. The Business Management  Advisory Council meets quarterly to discuss proposals and initiatives to  improve efficiency and identify cost savings. For example, we previously  reported that, in 2011, the Business Management Advisory Council  considered consolidating human resource and other services at all of  NNSA\u2019s sites to achieve cost savings.", "To further encourage M&O contractors to manage the laboratories in an  effective and efficient manner, NNSA also includes performance-based  fees in its contracts. Specifically, field office contracting officials rate the  M&O contractors\u2019 efforts to identify and implement cost-savings  measures, while also achieving mission goals, through annual  performance evaluation plans. These cost management efforts also  include efforts to identify and implement cost-savings measures.  However, according to NNSA officials, the amount of performance-based  fee tied to cost management efforts is relatively small\u2014$1 million or less  at each laboratory annually\u2014and may not provide a meaningful incentive  to the contractors. In contrast, the overall incentive fees for laboratory  M&O contractor work can be up to $60 million annually.

Specifically, according to NNSA officials, NNSA  added requirements in the proposed combined contract for its Y-12 and  Pantex sites in fiscal year 2013, which would link future contract  extensions to cost-savings goals to improve cost management. For  example, these new provisions would have required the M&O contractors  to achieve at least 80 percent of the proposed cost-savings measures, as  outlined in their contractual language, in order to receive a contract  extension.

Specifically, we  concluded that NNSA failed to meaningfully assess the majority of each  offeror\u2019s proposed cost savings, and based its source selection decision  on the unsupported assumption that all cost savings proposed by every  offeror would be achieved. The protest decision recommended that NNSA  reopen the procurement for this contract and request additional  information from the offerors about their proposed cost savings.  Following this decision, in May 2013, NNSA announced that it would  reopen competition for the combined contract.
