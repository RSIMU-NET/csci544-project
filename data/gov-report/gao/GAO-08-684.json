All transfers of administrative jurisdiction, which do not involve the transfer of title, became effective the day (Dec. 15, 2006) that the President signed the Federal and District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of 2006. Nine conveyances between the Secretary of the Interior and the District, excluding Poplar Point, are planned to be completed by the end of summer 2008. The District intends to complete the conveyance of Poplar Point by the fall of 2009, if it is able to meet several conditions in the law, including developing a Secretary of the Interior approved land-use plan. The date for the completion of the conveyances of title between the General Services Administration and the District is uncertain and depends on an agreement between the District and the AOC on the District conveying not more than 12 acres of District property to the AOC. Although the District and the federal government have taken several steps to complete the conveyances, several factors have affected their efforts, and additional steps must be taken to complete the conveyances. The District and the National Park Service formed working groups as a first step toward completing the conveyances. However, negotiations about cleanup; testing properties for contamination; disagreement over land to be conveyed as part of the Boathouse Row properties, two properties along the western shores of the Anacostia River; and decision changes about environmental impact statement development for Poplar Point have slowed the completion of the conveyances between the District and Secretary of the Interior. Limited development has occurred on property already transferred or to be conveyed between the District and the federal government. Development will take many years to complete because the District must first develop plans for most of these sites. For example, commercial and residential development of Poplar Point is not likely to begin until 2011 because of the steps, such as the development of a land-use plan, which must be completed before the conveyance can occur. Development may take over a decade to complete at Poplar Point. The District and the federal government face several challenges as they move forward to develop or manage the exchanged properties. For example, some cleanup and development uncertainties, such as the extent and location of the cleanup required, will likely affect the timeliness of property development at Poplar Point. Other challenges facing the District include (1) transitioning the Deputy Mayor's Office from policymaking and oversight roles to the lead in coordinating development, a function that has not been the Deputy Mayor's Office core business, and (2) reaching community agreement about development at Poplar Point."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On December 15, 2006, Congress directed the conveyances of title or  transfers of administrative jurisdiction of 30 properties within the District  of Columbia between the federal government and the District of Columbia  government. The exchange was primarily intended to provide the District  with property for economic development to help expand its tax base and  reduce the District\u2019s structural fiscal imbalance\u2014that is, the difference  between the District\u2019s costs to provide services and its ability to raise  revenue. The exchange was also intended to decrease the District\u2019s  financial dependence on the federal government. In May 2003, we reported  that the District\u2019s structural imbalance, which stems partly from the  District\u2019s public service costs that far exceeded that of the average state  fiscal system, likely exceeded $470 million annually and could have been  as high as $1.1 billion, depending on the assumptions used. The two  largest properties to be conveyed\u2014both to the District\u2014are Poplar Point,  a 110-acre property east of the Anacostia River administered by the  Department of the Interior\u2019s (DOI) National Park Service (NPS), and  Reservation 13 (Hill East), a 67-acre property along the western shores of  the Anacostia River at the southeastern end of Capitol Hill administered by  the General Services Administration (GSA). As the largest properties to be  conveyed, Poplar Point and Reservation 13 are planned to have the most  development and, thus, are likely to generate most of the new tax revenue  that would be available to reduce the District\u2019s structural fiscal imbalance.  Some of the property conveyances and transfers involve underutilized  federal and District property, thus potentially providing management and  efficiency benefits to both governments. Although the statute conveys the  largest properties to the District, the federal government, including  agencies such as NPS, GSA, and the Architect of the Capitol (AOC),  receives some property. For example, as part of the exchange, GSA  receives property that includes buildings on the West Campus of St.  Elizabeths, facilitating plans to consolidate the Department of Homeland  Security\u2019s headquarters on the property.", "The law authorizing the conveyances and transfers of the properties  mandates that we report periodically over a 10-year period about (1) how the  properties are used and developed and (2) how this use and development  comply with the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan, which is the  District\u2019s guiding document for the Anacostia River\u2019s restoration and  revitalization. None of the conveyances had occurred by the beginning of our  audit phase. After consulting with the congressional committees specified in  the law, we developed research questions that reflect an assessment of land  conveyances and development progress to date. In the future, we plan to  report periodically on the questions mandated in the law. The research  questions for this report are as follows:  1.  What is the status of the conveyances and transfers of the properties  identified in Public Law 109-396?  2.  What steps have the District and the federal government taken toward  completing the conveyances, what factors have affected their  completion, and what additional steps remain?  3.  What preliminary development has occurred on the properties to be  exchanged between the District and the federal government, and what  are the current plans for use of these properties?  4.  What development challenges do the District and federal government  face going forward?", "To answer each of the four questions, we reviewed and analyzed  documents showing basic property data\u2014such as maps, agency reports  and Public Law 109-396\u2014and conducted site visits to key properties. We  also reviewed and analyzed planning documents, such as a summary of the  properties created by the District government; area master plans; and  development proposals. We interviewed senior officials from the District  government, NPS, the U.S. Park Police (USPP), GSA, and the AOC as well  as members of stakeholder groups, including Advisory Neighborhood  Commission 6, the Capitol Hill Restoration Society, the Earth  Conservation Corps, the Anacostia Economic Development Corporation,  the National Capital Planning Commission, and the U.S. Commission of  Fine Arts. We conducted this performance audit from August 2007 through  June 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe  that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings  and conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Federal and District of Columbia Government Real Property Act of  2006 was intended to provide the District with property for economic  development to help expand its tax base and decrease the District\u2019s  financial dependence on the federal government. Expanding the District\u2019s  tax base should help reduce the District\u2019s structural fiscal imbalance. A  structural fiscal imbalance exists when the cost of providing an average  level of public services exceeds the amount of revenue a government  raises by applying average tax rates. We highlighted this structural  imbalance in a 2003 report, finding that the District\u2019s public service costs  far exceeded that of the average state fiscal system, and these costs were  largely beyond its control, due to factors such as its large low-income  population. The report estimated that the imbalance likely exceeded $470  million annually and could have been as high as $1.1 billion, depending on  the assumptions used. Our analysis indicated that the cost of delivering an  average level of services per capita in the District exceeded that of the  average state fiscal system by approximately 75 percent (or $2.3 billion  more annually than if it faced average cost circumstances) and was over  one third more than the second-highest cost fiscal system, New York. We  found that even if the District addressed its underlying management  problems, such as inadequate financial management, billing systems, and  internal controls, such actions would not be enough to offset the  structural imbalance because the imbalance is determined by other  factors, as previously mentioned, largely beyond the District\u2019s direct  control. We also stated that addressing the imbalance may require changes  to federal policies to expand the District\u2019s tax base or to provide  additional financial support. If the assumptions underlying this structural  imbalance analysis change, then estimates of the amount of the structural  imbalance could change in either direction. Development of the properties  conveyed or transferred from the federal government to the District  through Public Law 109-396 is intended to enable the District to expand its  tax base.", "The federal government and the District must comply with environmental  laws when completing the transfers and conveyances. Two environmental  laws relevant to the properties involved are the National Environmental  Policy Act (NEPA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response,  Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA). NEPA requires federal  agencies to assess the likely environmental effects of the projects that they  propose. Federal agencies must prepare EISs for proposed major actions  significantly affecting the quality of the human environment. Upon  completing the EIS, a federal agency prepares a public record of its  decision addressing how it incorporated the findings of the EIS, including  consideration of alternatives into its decision-making process. The NEPA  process is designed to involve the public and gather the best available  information so that decision makers can be fully informed when making  their choices. The public may participate in the NEPA process by  attending NEPA-related hearings or public meetings and by submitting  comments directly to the lead agency. The lead agency must take into  consideration all comments received from the public and other parties on  NEPA documents during the comment period. The entire NEPA process  can take several years to complete.", "CERCLA was enacted in 1980 to clean up highly contaminated hazardous  waste sites across the country. CERCLA requires that parties statutorily  responsible for cleaning up pollution bear the costs of cleaning up  contaminated sites.

According to District and NPS officials, they had mutually agreed in early  discussions that a full NEPA process involving development of an EIS  would not be required before the conveyance; however, once they moved  into more details of the transfer and proposed development of Poplar  Point, both parties agreed that meeting NEPA requirements by developing  an EIS appeared to be the most prudent course.", "Despite the extended time frame for Poplar Point, the District and NPS  originally hoped to have the other conveyances completed by the fall of  2007. However, NPS\u2019s desire to conduct soil sample tests to determine  property contamination levels, as well as negotiations over environmental  elements of the exchange agreement for Boathouse Row, have lengthened  the time needed to complete these conveyances. In October 2007, NPS  tested soil and groundwater samples taken from Waterside Mall  (Reservations 721, 722, and 723) and Virginia Avenue properties  (Reservations 128, 129, 130, and 299) for potential contamination.

According  to senior District and NPS officials, the District and NPS agreed to identify  a new cleanup plan before going jointly to Washington Gas to negotiate its  agreement (or compel it) to undertake the necessary cleanup. These  officials also stated that Reservation 343E, which is contaminated as a  result of the prior operations of a NPS concessioner, is covered in the  FOSET agreement. The District and NPS will identify and agree on a  remediation plan for portions of Reservations 343D and 343E and  Reservation 298 after completion of a land use plan, the development of  which began in the spring of 2008 and is scheduled to be complete by the  fall of 2008. In short, the District and DOI have come to an agreement  about the process for reaching cleanup agreements for these properties.  The District and DOI agree that in doing so they are meeting the  requirements of CERCLA, Section 120(h) applicable to property  transferred by federal agencies, including use of a \u201cdeferral\u201d of certain  actions until after the properties are transferred to the District.", "An additional factor affecting the exchange agreement between the  District and NPS involves disagreement between the District and the U.S.  Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) over a small land parcel currently  administered by the Corps on the Boathouse Row property. From a  docking area within Reservation 343D, the Corps operates a debris  removal facility that helps remove trash from the Anacostia River.  According to NPS and the Corps, although this property was mistakenly  included in an aerial photograph sent to the District at one point, this land  was never intended to be part of the conveyance. Prior to the enactment of  Public Law 109-396, the Corps and NPS attempted to complete a transfer  of jurisdiction through the District of Columbia Office of the Surveyor  transferring a small parcel of additional land from NPS to the Corps to  facilitate their existing operation.

According to the District, the Corps\u2019 current location is not a good spot  because it would disrupt the Riverwalk Trail, a proposed trail that runs  along the Anacostia River and passes through the Boathouse Row  property, hinder the value and desirability of surrounding boathouses and  marinas, and is incompatible with the planned use of the site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Change in Mayoral Administrations and Dissolution of the District\u2019s Development Corporations Are Other Factors That Have Affected Conveyance Timelines", "paragraphs": ["Other factors affecting the completion of the conveyances between the  District and the Secretary of the Interior, according to stakeholders, was  the change in mayoral administrations in the District at the beginning of  2007 and the dissolution of the District\u2019s development corporations later  that year. The change of mayoral administrations brought new personnel  into city departments and put interaction with the federal agencies briefly  on hold, according to senior NPS officials. Also, the new administration  dissolved the Anacostia Waterfront Corporation (AWC) and the National  Capital Revitalization Corporation (NCRC) and transferred their duties to  the Office of the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Economic Development  (DMPED) in September 2007. AWC and NCRC were quasigovernment  entities tasked with managing a variety of economic development projects,  with AWC focusing on the Anacostia Waterfront Initiative area and NCRC  covering the rest of the city. The mayor and D.C. Council cited a number  of reasons for the dissolution. The mayor and D.C. Council wanted more  direct control of development activities, because the quasigovernment  entities were seen as less accountable. In particular, city officials were  frustrated by the disagreement between the two corporations over control  of properties along the Southwest Waterfront. In addition, the District  wanted to improve management by reducing redundancies in staff and  improving effectiveness. The ultimate goal of direct control and  streamlined management is to speed-up delivery of the projects, while  reducing costs, according to District officials. The dissolution resulted in  staff changes and attrition. According to a senior District official, the staff  of DMPED has increased from 33 full-time equivalents (FTEs) in  September 2007 to 63 FTEs in June 2008 and is expected to grow to a total  of 73 FTEs by August 2008 which is allowing the agency to increase its  capacity and more effectively respond to its increased mission.

As we have previously discussed, Poplar Point\u2019s  conveyance is not likely to occur until the fall of 2009 because a number of  conditions, such as the development of a Secretary-approved land-use  plan, must be met before the entire conveyance can occur.", "To develop the vision for Poplar Point\u2019s future and help devise alternative  development scenarios for the NEPA process, the District selected a  Master Developer for the site in February 2008. The Master Developer\u2019s  vision for Poplar Point includes 1.5 million square feet of office space, 3.8  million square feet of residential units, 405,000 square feet of retail space,  70 acres of parks, a waterfront entertainment district, a deck over I-295 to  connect the site with Historic Downtown Anacostia, and an option for a  soccer stadium (see fig. 3). The District has required that at least 51  percent of the new jobs created as a part of the development go to District  residents. In addition, the project must include affordable housing, and 35  percent of the contracting dollars must be awarded to small and local  businesses. This Master Developer will be part of a long-term collaborative  planning and development process with the community, according to the  District. An EIS consultant will work with the District, the Master  Developer, and NPS to create a stakeholder engagement process that will  comply with the requirements of NEPA. The District worked with NPS and  USPP to select an architectural and engineering firm in March 2008 to  design replacement facilities for the NPS and USPP facilities located on  Poplar Point. According to a senior District official, commercial and  residential construction will not likely begin on the site until 2011, and  development will take many years, perhaps up to a decade."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The District Envisions Mixed-Use Development for Reservation 13 in Accordance with the Master Plan for the Site", "paragraphs": ["Current plans call for Reservation 13, a 67-acre property along the shores  of the Anacostia River at the southeastern end of Capitol Hill, to be  transformed into an urban multiuse waterfront district that is in  accordance with the Anacostia Waterfront Framework Plan and the Hill  East Master Plan approved by the D.C.

For example, the Boathouse Row properties (portions of  Reservations 343D and 343E), 12- and 6- acre properties located on the  western shores of the Anacostia River, will be used for recreational uses  (see fig. 6). Currently classified as land with a light industrial use,  according to District and NPS officials, portions of Reservation 334D  required a more stringent cleanup agreement than previously existed  between Washington Gas and NPS because the District intends to change  the land use from light industrial to recreational. The District issued a  request for proposals in December 2007 to select a firm to assist in the  creation of a master plan for these properties with the goal of increasing  use of and access to the Anacostia River, while expanding opportunities  for maritime development. The District selected a planning firm in April  2008. This planning effort is under way and expected to be completed by  the end of September 2008. In addition, construction of the Riverwalk Trail  is under way and the portions along Boathouse Row are expected to be  completed in late 2008.", "In addition, the Eastern Market properties (Reservations 44 to 49), located  next to the Eastern Market metro station, will be rehabilitated and  enhanced to create a gateway and link to a recently renovated commercial  strip along 8th Street, SE, called Barracks Row (see fig. 7).

The plan must be  developed through a public process and set aside no fewer than 1.25 acres  of the former Convention Center Site as open space. The Reservation 174  triangle will remain open space to complement the surrounding residential  and commercial development.

One senior NPS official said that multiple government  agencies could be responsible for contamination on the site. The District\u2019s  current plan is to complete the necessary cleanup and then seek  reimbursement from the responsible federal agencies. According to  District and NPS officials, the federal government is potentially  responsible for the majority of the costs of the cleanup on Poplar Point,  the scope of which is still in the process of being determined. Any  contamination that is found in areas where residential construction is  planned could delay the progress of construction until the cleanup is  finished or construction plans are modified. If cleanup costs for the site  are higher than expected, delays could result if funding is not available. In  addition, if significant federal funding is needed by the District to  complete the cleanup, a negative impact on future agency budgets is  possible. The quicker the District is able to develop property such as  Poplar Point, the more quickly the District will potentially be able to  reduce the structural fiscal imbalance that it faces.", "According to a senior NPS official and a senior USPP official, replacing  U.S. Park Police facilities may be complicated and might affect the  timeliness of the conveyance of the Poplar Point site to the District, which  in turn will affect when development on the site begins. Replacing the NPS  National Capital Parks Headquarters East facilities should be relatively  straightforward because the building is an ordinary office building, but the  replacement of USPP facilities will be more challenging. For example,  according to a senior NPS official and a senior USPP official, USPP needs  space for helicopter landings and a firing range. These facilities have flight  space, noise, and safety implications that will affect neighbors  substantially, therefore the District and DOI will require community input.  The process could make identifying a site difficult and delay the  conveyance. In addition, a senior USPP official said that USPP prefers that  the motorcycle and special event units remain close to downtown because  even a mile or two difference can affect response times. USPP\u2019s  preference could complicate site identification.", "The timeliness of the conveyance of the Poplar Point site to the District for  development may also be affected by the legal interpretation of the  statute\u2019s restriction on the initiation of construction projects on Poplar  Point. Under the statute, existing NPS facilities and properties must be  withheld from conveyance until the NPS Director certifies that the  facilities and related property to which NPS is to be relocated are ready to  be used and occupied by NPS. The District may not initiate any  construction project on Poplar Point, except for any required to prepare  facilities for occupation by NPS, until the NPS Director makes this  certification. However, what qualifies as a \u201cconstruction project\u201d and what  various types of preconstruction work, utility relocation, soil-boring, or  environmental remediation would be allowed, is unclear, according to a  senior NPS official. NPS lawyers were examining this issue at the time of  our review. Therefore, the definition of \u201cconstruction project\u201d that is  ultimately decided upon will impact the speed of development and what  could be completed concurrently. A senior NPS official stated that NPS  wants to ensure that NPS and USPP have no disruption of operations  while they remain at their current facilities, which may further limit  activities on-site before the relocation.

For example,  DMPED is moving from overseeing the activities of AWC and NCRC to  actually being responsible for hiring master developers, NEPA  consultants, and architecture and engineering firms and for managing their  work.
