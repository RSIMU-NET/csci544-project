The Reagan administration first implemented this policy, known as the Mexico City Policy, in 1984, and subsequent administrations have rescinded and reinstated it. The Mexico City Policy initially applied only to family planning and reproductive health assistance, which received about $560 million of GHP funds in fiscal year 2018.

As of September 30, 2018, about $12 billion in estimated planned award funding was subject to the policy. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), with over $6 billion, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), with over $5 billion, awarded about 96 percent of this amount. Agencies implemented these awards across multiple geographic regions and global health assistance areas. About two-thirds of estimated planned funding subject to the policy supported HIV/AIDS assistance, while the remaining third supported other global health areas, such as maternal and child health, and family planning and reproductive health. Over two-thirds of planned funding subject to the policy was for awards in Africa.", "U.S. agencies identified seven prime awards and 47 sub-awards in which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) declined to accept the terms and conditions of the PLGHA policy, and these awards had about $153 million remaining in estimated planned funding not obligated as of September 30, 2018. The seven prime awards that were declined included six USAID awards and one CDC award and amounted to about $102 million of the $153 million in estimated planned funding that was not obligated. Marie Stopes International and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation declined the two largest of these awards, resulting in about $79 million in planned funding that was not obligated. These two awards included, among other activities, mobile family planning and reproductive health outreach activities to underserved, rural populations in multiple countries.

In fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated about $8.7 billion for the  Global Health Programs (GHP) account managed by the Department of  State (State) and the U.S. Agency for International Development  (USAID). In January 2017, the President reinstated and expanded a  policy requiring foreign nongovernmental organizations (NGO) to agree  that, as a condition of receiving family planning assistance, they would  not perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning.  The Reagan administration implemented the first iteration of this policy,  known as the Mexico City Policy, in 1984. The policy initially applied only  to USAID family planning and reproductive health assistance. The Trump  Administration renamed the policy Protecting Life in Global Health  Assistance (PLGHA) and applied it to all global health assistance to the  extent allowable by law. Opponents of the policy argue it could limit  access to health care, particularly in places that rely on NGOs who  cannot disentangle family planning services from other global health  assistance, such as HIV/AIDS. State has emphasized that the policy  does not affect the level of funding for global health assistance and U.S.  agencies can reprogram funds if declined by NGOs to other organizations  who agree that they will not perform or actively promote abortion as a  method of family planning.", "You asked us to review the implementation of the PLGHA policy.

HHS provided data for four component agencies:  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Health  Resources and Services Administration, the National Institutes of Health,  and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.  DOD provided data for two component agencies: the Department of  Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program and the Department of the Army.  We analyzed the data to describe the agencies\u2019 reported number and  estimated total value of the awards, the amount obligated and the  estimated amount of planned funding for these awards that was not yet  obligated as of September 30, 2018, the implementing agency, the type  of global health assistance, and the recipient countries.", "Funds obligated before the PLGHA policy was first implemented in May  2017 were not subject to the policy\u2019s terms and conditions. To estimate  the value of planned funds not yet obligated as of September 2018 and  therefore subject to the PLGHA policy, we subtracted the obligated  amount from the estimated total award value of each award. While this calculation provides an estimate of the funds subject to the PLGHA, it is  limited by two factors. First, while planned award funding that was not  already obligated before May 2017 when PLGHA was first implemented  was made subject to the PLGHA policy, agencies did not have obligations  data as of May 2017 readily available but were able to readily identify  obligations as of September 30, 2018. Therefore, information provided on  planned funding that was not yet obligated as of September 30, 2018,  may not capture all of the funding made subject to the PLGHA policy  because it does not include obligations between May 2017 and  September 30, 2018, for NGOs that accepted PLGHA terms and  conditions. Second, estimates of total award value can change over time,  according to agency officials. For example, awards could have extensions  with additional funding not yet reflected in the estimated total award  values agencies provided us. In addition, the estimated total award values  the agencies provided could be based on a maximum or ceiling for some  awards, which may overstate actual amounts.", "To identify the awards active in May 2017 involving NGOs that declined to  accept the PLGHA terms and conditions following implementation of the  PLGHA policy, we requested data from agencies identifying any prime  award or sub-award where the NGO declined to accept the terms and  conditions, and thus ceased receiving U.S. global health assistance  funding under those awards. With the exception of one CDC award, only  USAID identified instances in which NGOs with active prime or sub- awards declined to accept the PLGHA terms and conditions. We  analyzed CDC\u2019s and USAID\u2019s data on declined awards to describe the  number and estimated total value of these awards, as well as the amount  of funding these agencies reported as obligated as of September 30,  2018, the amount of planned funding that was not yet obligated as of this  date, the type of global health assistance, and the recipient countries.  Efforts taken by prime awardees to replace declined sub-awards were not  part of our review. We also interviewed agency officials and  representatives of Marie Stopes International (MSI) and International  Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF), two prime awardees that publicly  declined to accept the terms and conditions of the PLGHA policy.

We examined the reliability of the data identified by the  agencies through our data collection instruments and found them to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of delineating the agencies,  assistance areas, countries, estimated total value of awards, and  obligations, as well as for calculating planned funding that was not  obligated as of September 30, 2018, to estimate the amount of funding  subject to the policy.

These two NGOs declined  the two largest of the six prime awards declined and their local affiliates  were implementers of many of the sub-awards that were declined. We  discussed with MSI and IPPF the characteristics of these two awards and  the accuracy of USAID\u2019s data provided to us on them.", "We examined the reliability of the data on awards identified by the  agencies through testing for logical assumptions such as whether award  start dates preceded their end dates, and whether an award\u2019s estimated  total value met or exceeded the total amount of funding that had been  obligated to it. In addition, we met with agency officials to discuss and  correct any discrepancies in the award data they provided. However, we  did not independently verify the awards identified or the funds associated  with each award. Overall, we found the data on awards subject to the  PLGHA policy and in which NGOs declined the terms and conditions of  the policy to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of delineating the  agencies, assistance areas, countries, estimated total value of awards,  and obligations. As noted earlier, we also calculated the amounts of  planned funding that were not obligated as of September 30, 2018, to  estimate the amount of funding subject to the policy.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2018 to March 2020 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
