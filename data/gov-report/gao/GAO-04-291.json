Therefore, in this report GAO was asked to identify examples of selected federal agencies' experiences and some of the key lessons they have learned in designing their training and development programs. This work focused on ways that these agencies (1) assessed agency skills gaps and identified training needs, (2) developed strategies and solutions for these training and development needs, and (3) determined methods to evaluate the effectiveness of training and development programs. GAO worked with five agencies to identify their experiences and lessons learned: the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), Department of Defense; Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Department of the Interior (Interior); Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of the Treasury; the Office of Personnel Management (OPM); and Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Agency officials provided information during interviews and furnished supporting documentation for analysis and review."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified important lessons learned from five federal agencies' experiences in designing training and development programs for their employees that could be useful to other agencies facing similar challenges. These lessons learned are related to the following three areas. Assessing Agency Skill Requirements and Identifying Training Needs: The agencies used a variety of approaches to assess current and future skill requirements, such as implementing workforce planning models and conducting knowledge and skills inventories. Generally, the agencies are transitioning to more comprehensive approaches. One of the lessons learned was to involve stakeholders and benchmark with others to identify critical skills and competencies and related training needs. For example, IRS officials believed they needed a leadership competency model directly based on the work of their agency's business units. To develop a comprehensive model, they interviewed top IRS leaders and benchmarked with leading practices in the public and private sector. Developing Strategies and Solutions for Training Needs: The agencies considered a mixture of delivery mechanisms, as well as potential sources for training and development opportunities. However, projecting costs and benefits of proposed training and development programs presented challenges for them. The agencies usually developed broad information on anticipated benefits and expected costs of potential investments, although often without tying benefits to specific performance improvements or considering all costs. One of the lessons learned was to establish mechanisms to avoid duplication or inconsistencies. Education Service Representatives in each regional VHA network, for example, coordinate training and development programs with headquarters--sharing information about successful practices and identifying areas where coordination is needed. Determining Methods for Evaluating Training Programs: Overall, the agencies relied primarily on participants' end-of-course evaluations, but they are beginning to use more comprehensive evaluation approaches, including limited use of return-on-investment analysis techniques. One of the lessons learned is to plan for the use of multiple data types and sources in order to attain a balanced assessment once the course is implemented. For example, USACE's training center incorporated pre- and post-tests on over 90 percent of its courses, as well as approaches to collect participants' and course managers' feedback, as part of the design. Four of the five agencies provided comments on a draft of this report. Interior and VA said that they generally agreed with the report's findings regarding their respective agencies. IRS and OPM said that they appreciated the opportunity to be included in the report and to share information on training activities. USACE provided no comments on the draft report."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To effectively address the nation\u2019s most urgent priorities and take  advantage of emerging opportunities, federal agencies need to continue to  build their fundamental capabilities to carry our their work in an  environment that is increasingly complex and rapidly changing.

Specifically, we focused on the agencies\u2019 experiences and lessons learned  related to   assessing current and future agency skill and competency requirements  and identifying related training and development needs,  developing strategies and solutions for training and development needs,   determining methods to evaluate the effectiveness of training and  development programs.", "For this review, lessons learned were defined as knowledge that could be  applied in the future that the agencies gained through either positive or  negative experiences.  The experiences and lessons learned from the five  agencies we reviewed may well provide some valuable ideas and useful  approaches that could be adopted by other federal agencies as they attempt  to address ongoing training and development challenges\u2014particularly  those related to the elements within the training process that relate to  design and development.", "To address these issues and as agreed with your office, we focused our  review on five federal agencies:  U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE),  Department of Defense; Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), Department of  the Interior (Interior); Internal Revenue Service (IRS), Department of the  Treasury; Office of Personnel Management (OPM); and Veterans Health  Administration (VHA), Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).  At the  headquarters of the five agencies\u2014and in some field locations\u2014we  collected and reviewed documents on the agencies\u2019 training and  development efforts and interviewed officials from the agencies\u2019 human  capital and training organizations, as well as assorted program offices.  We  selected the five agencies for various reasons, including your office\u2019s  interests, the diversity of employee occupations within the agency, and  reported innovative approaches for training and developing their  employees.  This agency selection process was not designed to identify  examples that could be considered representative of all training and  development efforts at the five agencies or the federal government as a  whole.  Furthermore, in citing examples that relate to the lessons learned  on the design of training, we did not assess the effectiveness of these  training programs and practices.  Rather, we attempted to highlight some of  the experiences and lessons that the agencies found helped them move  forward in improving their training and development programs.  Federal  agencies\u2019 training and development strategies, and how they are designed  to operate in conjunction with other strategies to improve individual and  organizational performance, continue to change and evolve.", "We conducted our review from August 2002 through November 2003 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

This assessment guide consists of a set of principles  and key questions that federal agencies can use to ensure that their training  and development investments are targeted strategically and are not wasted  on efforts that are irrelevant, duplicative, or ineffective.  As detailed in our  assessment guide, the training and development process can loosely be  segmented into four broad, interrelated components: (1) planning/front- end analysis, (2) design/development, (3) implementation, and   (4) evaluation.  Figure 1 depicts an overview of this process along with the  general relationships between the four components that help to produce a  strategic approach to federal agencies\u2019 training and development efforts.   Although these components can be discussed separately, they are not  mutually exclusive and encompass subcomponents that may blend with  one another.  For instance, evaluation is an integral part of the  planning/front-end analysis as agencies strive to reach agreement up front  on how the success of various strategies to improve performance,  including training and development efforts, will be assessed.  As noted in  the assessment guide, agencies can build on lessons learned and  performance data and feedback from previous experiences.  This report  can provide a starting point for agencies to use to build on the experiences  and lessons learned by the five agencies we reviewed as part of their efforts  to design and develop training and development programs.  (See app. II for  a description of the five agencies included in this study.)", "Our assessment guide also summarizes our observations on the core  characteristics that make a training and development process effective and  strategically focused on achieving results.  These eight core characteristics  are described in more detail in appendix III, and include  leadership commitment and communication,   partnerships and learning from others,   data quality assurance, and   continuous performance improvement.", "A concerted effort to integrate these core characteristics can further an  agency's efforts to continually improve its training and development  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Used Varied Approaches in Assessing Skills and Competencies and Identifying Related Training Needs", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies face diverse challenges in their efforts to identify and  measure the skills and competencies that their employees must possess to  support missions and goals.  Officials from the five agencies in our review  recognized the importance of assessing the need for specific skills and  competencies now and in the future in order to identify related workforce  training needs.  These agencies generally focused on the desired  performance of the agency and its employees, determined the difference  between the desired and actual skill levels, and attempted to identify the  key factors contributing to performance, including the need for enhanced  workforce competencies.  Officials used a variety of approaches and tools  to assist in determining the human capital skills and competencies that are  critical to achieving their long-term goals.", "An agency\u2019s ultimate goal in undertaking training and development efforts  is, of course, to optimize employee and organizational performance.  To  help ensure that each training program is linked to improving individual  and agency performance, agencies first need to analyze their strategic and  performance goals so that they can determine where training and  development can most effectively enhance goal achievement.", "Organizations can evaluate the extent to which human capital approaches  support their accomplishment of current, emerging, and future strategic  goals through the use of workforce planning.  Workforce planning focuses  on determining the skills and competencies needed now and in the future  to meet the agency\u2019s goals; identifying the current and projected level of the  skills and competencies of the workforce; and crafting strategies for  acquiring, developing, and retaining people to address any identified needs.   These needs include the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for the  agency to pursue its current and future mission as well as the size of the  workforce and its deployment across the organization.  After identifying  the skills and competencies that employees need now or in the future,  agencies must tackle the challenge of determining what combination of  strategies to use, such as hiring new employees with needed skills and  competencies, relying on outsourcing, and/or enhancing employees\u2019 skills  and competencies through training and development. While agencies\u2019  approaches to workforce planning will vary, we have identified the need for  a strategic workforce planning process to ensure that each agency\u2019s human  capital program capitalizes on its workforce\u2019s strengths and addresses  related challenges in a manner that is clearly linked to achieving the  agency\u2019s missions and goals.

One common approach  that officials used to help identify training needs was interviewing or  surveying managers, supervisors, and employees.  Agencies also  established councils and held conferences, made comparisons with leading  organizations through benchmarking, and analyzed workforce data and  trends.", "OPM\u2019s 2001 skills assessment, for example, relied on a survey of agency  managers and supervisors.  Officials used the survey results to identify the  most important occupational competencies needed to achieve OPM\u2019s  mission, the level at which employees possessed those competencies, and  the level at which they would be needed in the future.  Their analysis  identified minor gaps in the level of competencies needed for both current  and future work in mission critical occupations.  In addition, the analysis  pointed out more serious developmental needs for OPM\u2019s retirement and  insurance benefits specialists.  These needs were related to the changing  role of these specialists, who increasingly need to work more closely with  clients in responding to complex issues.", "Also in 2001, IRS established a workforce planning council consisting of  senior management representatives from each of the agency\u2019s operating  divisions.  IRS officials told us that this council has become the primary  vehicle for communicating workforce planning information among IRS\u2019s  four operating divisions.  At FWS, the human resources office hosted a 3- day workforce planning conference in 2002 to draw on the experience and  expertise of agency personnel in identifying critical workforce issues for  the agency for the next 3 to 5 years.  Managers and program experts  representing all eight major FWS program offices, seven field regions, and  headquarters offices participated.", "Agencies also compared their performance and needed skills and  competencies with leading organizations through benchmarking.  In  August 2000, VHA commissioned an internal task force charged with  developing a well-defined, comprehensive succession plan for the agency.   The ideas garnered from benchmarking led to VHA establishing an  expectation for agency leaders to help identify and train their successors.   The task force\u2019s December 2001 report presented a comprehensive  succession plan for VHA, and implementing a comprehensive leadership  development program was one of the six major components of this plan.", "Agency officials also analyzed workforce data to assess skills and help  identify training needs.  Generally, they collected information on employee  demographics and retirement eligibility and used these data to project  attrition and retirement rates. OPM officials, for example, collected and  analyzed attrition and turnover data on the agency\u2019s senior executives  along with the distribution of current executives by unit and projected  retirements through 2010.  They also collected and analyzed data on hires,  separations, and workforce diversity across the agency.  As part of this  analysis, officials assessed the agency\u2019s use of contractors and considered  how sourcing alternatives could affect OPM\u2019s plans for hiring, training, and  development.", "Officials from the five agencies told us that they used a wide range of  resources and tools to assess skills and competencies as part of identifying  and designing needed training and development programs.  They used  workforce planning models; assessed the workforce in view of  organizational, occupational, and unit-based competency standards;  conducted knowledge and skills inventories; and evaluated job  performance appraisals and information from individual development  plans (IDP).  To identify needed executive competencies, for example,  OPM used a five-step workforce planning model that it had developed in its  role of providing human capital tools for use by other federal agencies (see  fig. 3).  The resulting analysis called for enhancing leadership development  within OPM.", "Officials said that their agencies have transitioned, or are in the process of  transitioning, to more comprehensive, consistent planning approaches.   This transition is coming about as agencies attempt to institutionalize their  workforce planning efforts as part of their ongoing strategic planning and  budgeting processes.  In 2002, FWS conducted its first formal, agencywide  workforce planning process.  Although FWS initially employed a contractor  to help develop a permanent workforce planning process, it plans to  continue to manage it in-house.

To identify the essential characteristics that  enable IRS employees to function as effective leaders in the newly  modernized agency, human capital specialists at IRS conducted behavioral  interviews with 35 top IRS leaders in 1999, asking them to identify major  successes and challenges during their careers.  Using information gathered  from these interviews, officials identified core management responsibilities  and corresponding competencies required for leaders in IRS.  With the  assistance of a contractor, IRS validated the leadership competency model  by comparing it against leading practices in the public and private sector  and linking it to the mission and goals of the agency.  The resulting  competency model now forms the basis for IRS\u2019s leadership development  efforts, as well as how IRS selects, evaluates, and recognizes its leaders.   Figure 4 shows a listing of IRS\u2019s five core management responsibilities and  the 21 corresponding leadership competencies.", "VHA benchmarked with other organizations and used a pilot test in  developing its high performance development model   VHA conducted an extensive literature search and benchmarked with  several leading private sector firms (including Bell South, Coca-Cola, and  Motorola) to provide a foundation for its effort to create a new competency  model for VHA employees.  VHA used this information in developing its  high performance development model, which was implemented throughout  the department in 2002.  This model consists of eight core competencies  and related performance tools that represent the major skills and  competencies that employees need to fulfill VHA\u2019s mission.  The model was  designed to serve as a framework for identifying and developing future  leaders, as well as to enhance development of VHA\u2019s entire workforce.   VHA said that using this model helped more effectively align training and  development programs with agency priorities.  According to VHA, the fact  that the core competencies apply to all levels and functions within the  agency helps ensure alignment within and between organizational units  and is a key component in motivating sustained and improved  performance.

Using this system (currently in four of USACE\u2019s  eight divisions) employees prepare an IDP assessing their knowledge,  skills, and abilities in relation to a series of mission essential tasks.  With  supervisory guidance, each task is identified as critical, important, or  beneficial and employees indicate whether they have received adequate,  partial, or no training in that area.  With this assessment as a guide, the  supervisor and employee can consult the system\u2019s built-in course catalog to  select internal or external training to enhance the employee\u2019s development.   In addition, the system also has the capability of aggregating data.  USACE  officials said that this capability provides a simple method for division  managers to obtain a picture of the level of skills and competencies in their  workforce.  This information informs decisions on training priorities and  helps managers determine the most efficient use of available resources.", "IRS aggregated data from 360-degree feedback instruments to help  identify training needs   To assess the progress and developmental needs of leaders within IRS, the  agency\u2019s leadership development office recently aggregated and analyzed  multiyear data from the 360-degree performance assessments of IRS  managers.  This analysis helped to show areas of strength and weakness in  skills and competencies across the agency\u2019s managerial ranks.  The  director of leadership and organizational effectiveness at IRS said that, in  the past, the agency did not sufficiently assist managers in effectively using  360-degree feedback they received.  However, he said that IRS now  emphasizes the importance of using 360-degree feedback data, both on an  organizational and individual basis, to focus on strengths in developing key  leadership competencies.  IRS\u2019s Extraordinary Leader Program involves  designing unique developmental approaches to help managers become  more effective leaders.  Using results of the manager\u2019s 360-degree  assessment, IRS creates a customized leadership development program  focusing first on correcting any \u201cfatal flaw\u201d weaknesses and then building  on the manager\u2019s demonstrated strengths in areas that IRS has identified as  key to providing effective leadership within its organizational culture and  operating environment.", "Lesson learned:  Link the agency\u2019s workforce planning efforts with  training needs assessments to ensure consistency and enhance  strategic alignment.", "The agencies\u2019 training and development organizations had a range of  responsibilities, including designing training and development programs  based on strategic initiatives, soliciting input from stakeholders, and  prioritizing and scheduling training based on strategic initiatives and  stakeholder input.  Generally, the training organization and agency  stakeholders can work together more effectively when they better  understand how each office or function within the agency contributes to  achieving business goals.  In some cases, this included efforts to link  training needs assessments with the agency\u2019s overall workforce planning  efforts.  Officials told us that this linkage helped ensure that workforce  plans developed by the agency\u2019s human capital office were consistent with  training needs assessments done by the agency\u2019s training and development  organization.", "FWS involved key internal stakeholders in its planning processes   When assessing workforce skills and competencies, FWS officials worked  to ensure that the agency\u2019s workforce plan was linked with a training needs  assessment done by its training center.  The workforce planning effort  identified broad competencies needed across the agency\u2019s workforce while  the training needs assessment identified the types of training courses to  develop skills and competencies within agency units and occupations.   Officials said that they viewed the training needs assessment as a tool that  was useful in refining the agency\u2019s workforce plan and in prioritizing and  budgeting for the development and delivery of training.  Both efforts  involved key stakeholders from the human capital and training offices as  well as other FWS units.

USACE in 2001 formed the Learning  Advisory Board, comprised of senior managers from across the agency, to  review the adequacy of USACE\u2019s training and development and ensure that  training is properly aligned with the agency\u2019s missions, goals, and plans.  In  addition, the four divisions that use the automated training management  program can also rely on data from that system to assess training needs.   This system allows managers to compare information on individuals\u2019 skills  and competencies with workforce planning results from within the division  and across the agency.

To aid in communication and  coordination, agencies within the department designate employees to serve  as liaisons between each of the Interior agencies and FWS\u2019s training center.   These liaisons facilitate efforts to incorporate their agency\u2019s needs into the  training center\u2019s plans and the design and delivery of training and  development programs.  According to agency officials, these liaisons help  ensure that the center\u2019s courses remain current because they facilitate a  dialogue between the various agencies.

It offers courses accredited by several professional  associations, including the National Society for Professional Engineers, the  American Institute of Architects, and the International Association for  Continuing Education and Training.  USACE officials said that they would  like to offer training to a greater number of employees from private sector  firms; however, current law requires receipts for services provided to  private individuals and organizations to be deposited into the general  treasury as miscellaneous receipts.  USACE officials said that this  requirement hampers the ability of USACE\u2019s training center to keep funds it  could generate to further invest in its training programs.

They usually relied on training officials, agency managers, and  subject matter experts to assist in developing strategies and approaches for  addressing training needs.  Although the agencies designed and delivered  training using both centralized and decentralized approaches, we found  that leadership development programs were more highly centralized and  managed at headquarters.  Agency officials acknowledged that they found  projecting costs and benefits of proposed training and development  programs to be very challenging.

Considerations involved in assessing investment  opportunities for the training plan include balancing the competing  demands confronting the agency and the amount of resources available in  order to determine how those demands can best be met with available  resources.  It is also important to consider how to effectively integrate all  of the strategies the agency plans to use to improve performance and meet  emerging demands.  When training is identified as a solution to improve  performance, agencies can compare various training strategies by weighing  their estimated costs and anticipated benefits to build a convincing  business case that supports the selected training strategy.

Officials told us they considered a mixture  of both on-the-job and other developmental programs, contemplated an  assortment of mechanisms for delivering the training, and assessed  potential sources to meet their learning needs.  For example, USACE\u2019s  leadership development program for midlevel engineers and scientists  involved formal classroom training, mentoring, and a 6-month  developmental assignment.  VHA employees can access a wide variety of  informational and educational content through the VA Knowledge  Network, a satellite-based system of live and on-demand programming  delivered directly to employees\u2019 desktops.  IRS\u2019s training unit developed an  automated ROI workbook tool that the agency\u2019s business units can use to  assess whether proposed training programs should be delivered in a  classroom or by an e-learning approach.  OPM partnered with an employee  union to offer a midcareer development program that provided an  opportunity for current OPM employees to enhance existing skills, explore  new career fields, and gain practical experience.  Officials from FWS\u2019s  training center cited courses in negotiation, communication, and  interpersonal skills as examples of vendor-provided courses.  They said the  center decided not to invest in designing these courses since they do not  require field experience and expertise, which are critical in designing other  FWS courses.", "Projecting costs and benefits of proposed training and development  programs was a challenge for the five agencies.  They usually developed  broad information on anticipated benefits and expected costs, often  without tying anticipated benefits to specific performance improvements  or considering all costs related to the training program.  For example, VHA  officials told us that the agency\u2019s assessments of anticipated benefits and  expected costs of proposed training are generally unsystematic.  One VHA  office or field location may not have analyzed the relative costs or benefits  of proposed training while another office or location may have considered  anticipated benefits and developed estimates of costs and savings using  different training approaches.  At FWS, some proposed training programs,  such as its Advanced Leadership Development Program, involved detailed  estimates of costs, both for the training center and for participating FWS  field offices, as well as the identification of specific competencies to be  developed in the program.  Other proposed training programs at FWS did  not have documented and detailed estimates of expected costs and  benefits.  FWS officials said that they assess the anticipated costs and  benefits of all their proposed training and development programs but that  the extent of these assessments and the amount of documentation  supporting the assessments vary, depending on many factors, such as the  content, delivery mechanism, and uniqueness of the proposed training.", "According to agency officials we interviewed, limited funding sometimes  affected agencies\u2019 abilities to design and deliver training and development  programs that officials believed were needed.  USACE officials said, for  example, that in a recent survey, about two-thirds of agency supervisors  and one-half of agency executives believed that the agency had less funding  for training civilian employees than is needed.  Funding and resource  limitations sometimes forced the agencies to think of new and practical  ways to ensure that their employees had the knowledge and skills needed  to carry out their work.  For example, because of an unexpected decrease  in available travel funds, VHA officials canceled plans for a large national  conference on the use on an automated managerial cost accounting  system.  This system was designed to provide VHA managers with data  important in making clinical decisions, managing workload, and controlling  medical care costs.  Instead, to enable employees to obtain the information  that would have been presented at the conference, VHA officials provided  the content via a satellite broadcast along with a series of audio  conferences.", "At FWS, the number of people that the training center can train onsite, of  course, is limited by the current capacity of the facility classrooms and  residences.  According to FWS officials, incorporating a blended learning  approach into its curriculum has enabled trainees to perform part of the  course work outside class, thus allowing instructors to focus on those  topics that require special attention.  Training center officials also said that  the agency has increased its use of e-learning and other mechanisms to  develop employees where they work instead of coming to the training  center.

Analyzing the tasks of specific  jobs and occupations can help ensure that training accurately reflects the  way employees are expected to perform on a day-to-day basis.  To help  ensure that the training effectively addresses employees\u2019 developmental  needs, agencies can determine the workforce\u2019s level of proficiency in  mission-critical skills and competencies by conducting skills assessments  and using information obtained through interviews or surveys of  employees and their supervisors.  The increased information and insight  provided by these approaches can allow agencies to incorporate  information on employees\u2019 various competency levels and job needs into  the design of training and development programs--increasing both the  relevancy and timeliness of the learning.", "FWS targeted training to employees to leverage specific knowledge and  experiences FWS\u2019s training center recognized employees\u2019 various competency levels  and job needs when developing courses on the use of geographic  information systems (GIS), which are becoming increasingly important  mapping and information analysis tools for natural resources agencies,  according to FWS officials.  Rather than providing instruction focused  solely on software features and functions of GIS, the training center  designed its curriculum to teach the application of GIS to employees based  on their roles in natural resources management.  With a focus on these  varied roles and related needs, the center developed separate GIS training  courses for \u201cexplorers\u201d (natural resource managers or others just wanting  to know about GIS), \u201cusers\u201d (biologists and other personnel using GIS in  their daily job) and \u201cdevelopers\u201d (those individuals designing and  developing a natural resources GIS for use by others).  Officials at FWS\u2019s  training center said that with the training targeted to the specific  background and needs of employees, FWS can minimize the time spent  teaching participants information that they already know or do not need to  know in carrying out their job responsibilities.  The training center\u2019s  curriculum consists of 15 separate GIS courses, with 3 additional courses  under consideration or development.

IRS  officials said that they considered internal resources to design the training  but quickly realized that the agency did not have sufficient expertise.  The  officials also considered using a contractor but concluded that the costs  would be too high.  Instead, IRS decided to partner with the Federal  Executive Institute, an OPM-sponsored training facility in Charlottesville,  Virginia, that provides training to senior employees from across the federal  government.  IRS officials found that partnering IRS design and subject  matter experts with institute and other renowned leaders in the field  delivered the most cost-effective approach and yielded the best results.   The design team produced a course called \u201cLearning Through Others,\u201d  delivered on the Charlottesville campus.  According to IRS officials, this  course surpassed agency needs and expectations and was less expensive  than a direct contracting arrangement with an outside vendor.  They added  that participants in the training program could learn public service values  through lessons and encounter competency-based experiential learning,  business-related challenges, and a capstone simulation.

IRS officials said that online delivery lessened employee time in  taking the training from approximately 6 to 2 hours and in some cases  eliminated the need for travel.  To ensure the accessibility and usability of  these online briefings, IRS worked to resolve various challenges in the  conversion, such as designing the online product for the lowest computing  capabilities of the bulk of the trainee population and providing alternative  delivery mechanisms for individuals who were without a computer or  Intranet access.  The officials said that they also learned it is important to  design the online briefings based on a common template and style guide to  standardize their look and feel, provide online text-only versions of the  training for persons who are visually impaired, and test the usability of the  online briefings with end users on a range of equipment and allow  sufficient time for needed revisions.", "OPM initiated a pilot program for its employees to use online courseware   To explore opportunities for increased use of e-learning approaches, OPM  established a pilot program that allowed about 250 of its employees access  to approximately 1,800 online courses through the Department of  Transportation\u2019s  Transportation Virtual University.

Valid and reliable data are the starting point for  such assessments.  To assess the results achieved through training and  development, agencies can rely upon hard (quantitative) data, such as  productivity/output, quality, costs, and time, or soft (qualitative) data, such  as feedback on how well a training program satisfied employees'  expectations.  By taking steps to agree on measures of success up front,  agency officials can decide on the objectives for each training and  development program.  Using a balanced approach that reflects feedback  from customers and employees, as well as organizational results, is  particularly important as agencies transform their cultures and operations.   In addition, because the work of federal employees can be complex and  often cannot be reduced to a single task, a balanced approach to both the  types and sources of data helps to strengthen the linkages between training  and development programs and improved performance.", "USACE conducts evaluations of some training courses In addition to obtaining end-of-course participant feedback and  administering pre- and post-tests for many of its courses, USACE\u2019s training  center also conducts course evaluations of its offerings.  To conduct this  evaluation, the designated course manager from USACE\u2019s training center is  responsible for observing the full course and assessing various aspects of  its design and delivery, including the training content, materials, and  instructors.
