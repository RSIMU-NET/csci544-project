With this much cash changing hands, casinos may be particularly vulnerable to money laundering in the form of money from illegal activities being placed into legal gaming transactions.", "Recent BSA regulations requiring casinos to establish anti-money-laundering compliance programs, together with the implementation of certain provisions in the Money Laundering Suppression Act of 1994 with respect to certain tribal casinos, should help to deter or detect potential money laundering. These actions, coupled with possible changes to Nevada\u2019s regulations, should bring greater consistency and uniformity to transaction reporting for casinos and improve the information available to law enforcement. Measures that deter money laundering before it happens, such as Nevada\u2019s prohibited transactions, may also help to combat money laundering in casinos. Although there is no data to measure effectiveness, Nevada gaming officials strongly believe in the preventative aspects of prohibiting transactions that may lend themselves to money laundering.", "The current federal strategy for deterring and detecting money laundering in casinos involves Treasury, which promulgates BSA reporting and recordkeeping regulations, and IRS, which performs compliance reviews. IRS has detailed agents to several state gaming commissions and taken steps to assure that casinos are complying with BSA currency transaction reporting requirements. IRS\u2019 Examination Division has done some monitoring of Nevada\u2019s compliance program and has established a cycle for reviewing casino compliance in Atlantic City. Until recently, almost all of the casinos in the country were in these two locations.

It seems likely, given the competing demands on resources, that IRS compliance review coverage for casinos will be limited.

However, FinCEN disagreed for several reasons with our recommendation that Treasury consider the costs and benefits of an amendment to BSA to allow for the prohibition, as Nevada does, of certain cash transactions in casinos that may lend themselves to money laundering. FinCEN\u2019s reasons for disagreeing included concern that our work had not demonstrated that the prohibition of certain cash transactions would in fact deter money laundering and that additional prohibitions would increase the reporting burden on casinos.

As we did our work, we became aware of the issue of IRS\u2019 declining resources versus the growth in casino gaming and the related potential for money laundering. While our work was not designed to develop specific solutions, we saw the need for Treasury to explore the feasibility of less resource intensive ways to deter money laundering. That concept embodies the intent of our recommendation. It seemed reasonable to us that due consideration should be given to trying to identify some less resource intensive options, including the possibility, by prohibiting certain transactions, of making the laundering process more difficult and enhancing casinos\u2019 ability to self-regulate the issue, while simultaneously relieving some of the pressure on IRS resources. Given the federal downsizing environment, accompanied by the growth in casino gaming, we continue to believe that the identification of additional, less resource intensive ways to deter money laundering would be an appropriate step for Treasury.", "As agreed with the Subcommittee, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from its issue date.

FinCEN stated that our recommendation is vague and ambiguous as to what specific transactions should be considered. Further, they said that the report does not provide any basis for determining that prohibiting certain transactions does in fact deter money laundering to any appreciable extent. Our descriptive work relating to the growth of casinos, currency transaction reporting requirements, and related enforcement efforts was not intended to delineate the costs and benefits of specific prohibitions against money laundering. However, in analyzing our descriptive information, especially in relation to the level of enforcement of anti-money-laundering provisions of BSA and the likelihood that IRS enforcement resources will remain limited, the need for less resource intensive means to deter money laundering seemed evident. We believe that a study to identify means to deter money laundering in casinos, such as by prohibiting certain transactions, would be an appropriate step for Treasury to take as part of an effort to control money laundering while expending fewer federal resources. 2. Treasury notes that, in addition to the prohibition of certain cash transactions in Nevada that we cited, other states also have prohibited transactions, and that we do not cite which of these Treasury should evaluate. Our work did not include an enumeration of all transactions that are prohibited by all states, nor are we suggesting that Treasury undertake such an effort. However, if Treasury is aware of other prohibited transactions that seem likely to inhibit money laundering, they too should be considered. 3. FinCEN said that it is Treasury\u2019s position that the most effective means of combating money laundering is to determine which cash transactions should be recorded or reported, and then to work with the industry to ensure that suspicious activity is detected and reported. We agree that these are very useful strategies. However, this should not rule out adding an additional weapon to the arsenal against money laundering. To the extent that transactions that lend themselves to money laundering could be prohibited, the regulation process could be even more effective. Given the limited examination resources of IRS, follow-up on all recorded transactions seems unlikely. Accordingly, we believe that an action that could augment current enforcement efforts is worthy of consideration. 4. FinCEN stated that Treasury also believes that, given the diversity of gaming operations among states, it should be up to each state to determine the appropriateness of prohibiting certain transactions. We did not suggest that states could not or should not have their own regulations or prohibitions.
