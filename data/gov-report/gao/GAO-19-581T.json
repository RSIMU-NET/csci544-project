At that time, the department implemented an IT system, called CAT, to help support the program.

Specifically, the program did not have ready access to workload data that would allow it to monitor the effects of the program on VA medical centers' resources. VA has initiated various projects since 2015 to implement a new system, but has not yet been successful in its efforts. (See figure.) Specifically, in July 2015 VA initiated a project to improve the reliability of CAT's data, called CAT Rescue. However, the department reported in January 2017 that it had identified numerous defects during system testing. The project ended in April 2018 before any new system capabilities were implemented. A companion project was initiated in September 2015 to develop the Caregivers Tool (CareT), a new system intended to replace CAT. The CareT project was expected to use improved data from CAT Rescue, while also adding new system capabilities. However, the user acceptance testing of CareT identified the need for the department to develop more system capabilities than originally planned. Further, VA reported that implementing a system by October 1, 2018, as specified in the Maintaining Internal Systems and Strengthening Integrated Outside Networks Act of 2018 (MISSION Act), was not feasible. Subsequently, VA terminated CareT in February 2019. The department initiated another project in March 2019 to implement a new system, the Caregiver Record Management Application (CARMA). GAO has ongoing work to evaluate the department's efforts to implement an IT system to support the Family Caregiver Program as required by the MISSION Act.", "GAO's prior work has determined that successfully overcoming IT acquisition challenges can best be achieved when critical success factors are applied. These factors can serve as a model of best practices that VA could apply to enhance the likelihood that the acquisition of a replacement IT system for the Family Caregiver Program will be successfully achieved. Examples of these critical success factors include, maintaining active engagement of program officials with stakeholders, involving end users and stakeholders in the development of requirements, and ensuring participation of end users in testing system functionality prior to formal end user acceptance testing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommended in 2014 that VA expedite the process for identifying and implementing an IT system that would fully support the Family Caregiver Program.

Agency officials stated that  stakeholders, among other things, reviewed contractor proposals during  the procurement process, regularly attended program management office  sponsored meetings, were working members of integrated project  teams, and were notified of problems and concerns as soon as  possible. Further, officials from two investments noted that actively  engaging with stakeholders created transparency and trust, and  increased the support from the stakeholders.", "Additionally, officials for six of the seven selected investments indicated  that the knowledge and skills of the program staff were critical to the  success of the program. This included knowledge of acquisitions and  procurement processes, monitoring of contracts, large-scale  organizational transformation, Agile software development concepts,  and areas of program management such as earned value management  and technical monitoring.", "Finally, officials for five of the seven selected investments identified  having the end users test and validate the system components prior to  formal end user acceptance testing for deployment as critical to the  success of their program. Similar to this factor, leading guidance  recommends testing selected products and product components  throughout the program life cycle. Testing of functionality by end users  prior to acceptance demonstrates, earlier rather than later in the program  life cycle, that the functionality will fulfill its intended use. If problems are  found during this testing, programs are typically positioned to make  changes that would be less costly and disruptive than ones made later in  the life cycle.", "In conclusion, VA has invested considerable time in multiple efforts  toward improving and replacing its IT system to better serve the Family  Caregiver Program. However, even with these efforts, the department has  not yet implemented a system and the program is not prepared for  expansion. Going forward, it is important that VA take steps to improve its  efforts to implement a replacement IT system for the Family Caregiver  Program.
