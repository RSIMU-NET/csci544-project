Ultra-filtered milk is also a common ingredient in high-protein sports drinks, energy bars, and nutrition supplements. It comes in two forms: (1) a dry powder, which is currently all imported and (2) a thick liquid, referred to as \u201cwet,\u201d which is produced domestically. Dry ultra-filtered milk imports enter the United States under the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s broader classification of milk protein concentrates, which includes similar products made by other processes, such as blending nonfat dry milk with highly concentrated milk proteins. U.S. milk producers have expressed concern that imported ultra-filtered milk may displace domestically produced milk used to make cheese.", "For regulatory purposes, cheese products fall into two broad categories\u2014 standardized and nonstandardized cheese.

(See app. II for further explanation of ultra filtration and its use in the cheese-making process.) Although ultra- filtration equipment is expensive, it creates an ingredient well suited for making cheese and other food products requiring a high milk protein content. In addition, the removal of water and lactose reduces the volume of milk, and thereby lowers its transportation and storage costs. All ultra- filtered milk imported into the United States in 2000 was in a dry powder form.", "The U.S. Customs Service\u2019s milk protein concentrates classification includes processed milk products containing between 40 percent and 90 percent protein. Imported powdered milk products with less than 40 percent protein are usually classified as nonfat dry milk and are subject to a tariff-rate quota that limits the amount that can be imported at a low tariff rate. In addition to ultra-filtered milk products, the milk protein concentrate classification includes concentrates made through other processes, such as blending nonfat dry milk with highly concentrated proteins. These products are often tailored to a specific use in products requiring a protein ingredient.", "FDA\u2019s standards of identity regulations permit cheese manufacturers under the \"alternate make\" provisions to use ultra filtration as an acceptable procedure during the cheese-making process.  Consequently, milk that has been ultra-filtered as an integral part of the cheese-making process is acceptable as a component of a standardized cheese, according to FDA. In 1999 and 2000, organizations representing cheese makers petitioned FDA to amend its cheese standards to expand its definition of milk to include wet ultra-filtered milk. The industry petitioners requested permission to use wet ultra-filtered milk from external sources as an ingredient in standardized cheeses because it would increase the efficiency of cheese manufacturing and would explicitly recognize filtered milk products as interchangeable with other forms of milk. One of the industry petitioners, who had also asked FDA to allow the use of the dry ultra-filtered milk in standardized cheeses, later withdrew this part of the request when U.S. milk producers raised concerns that increased imports might displace domestic milk products.

According to these executives, international milk prices were below U.S. milk prices in recent years, giving U.S. dairy food manufacturers a financial incentive to substitute imported milk protein concentrates for domestic milk in products such as nonstandardized cheese. This price differential primarily stimulated U.S. imports of milk protein concentrates having lower percentages of protein\u2014between 40 and 56 percent. More recently, U.S. demand for these milk protein concentrates has decreased, according to an Australian exporter, because the international price of milk protein is near the U.S. price.", "The strong growth of the U.S. nutritional foods industry has created new demand for high-protein milk protein concentrates that are 70- to 85- percent protein. Representatives of Australia and New Zealand exporters told us that this industry grew out of extensive research and development to create nutritional supplements for athletes, the elderly, and health conscious individuals. Milk protein concentrates provide an important source of protein in these nutritional products. Because high-protein milk protein concentrates are often customized for use in specific end products, their producers and exporters can sell them at higher prices than the equivalent amount of domestic milk protein, the exporters said. Despite their higher prices, the demand for these specialized high-protein products in the United States is strong. Industry executives noted that high-protein milk protein concentrate imports have not displaced domestic milk supplies because they are filling the growing demand for new nutritional products.

According to the American Dairy Products Institute, ultra-filtration makes cheese manufacturing more efficient using new technology and may benefit consumers if cost savings are passed on. It also allows more efficient movement of milk from areas with an excess of fluid milk to areas with an insufficient supply, the American Dairy Products Institute said. The National Cheese Institute noted that the \u201calternate make procedure,\u201d already included in the regulations for some of the standardized cheeses, provides a legal basis for the use of filtered milk in the manufacture of standardized cheese. However, the institute wants to see the standards amended to explicitly recognize ultra-filtered milk in the standards\u2019 definition of milk. By explicitly recognizing ultra-filtered milk as milk for cheese manufacturing, FDA would allow manufacturers to use ultra- filtered milk in the standardized cheeses that do not include \u201calternate make procedure\u201d provisions. The National Cheese Institute states that the greater use of ultra-filtered milk would help manage seasonal imbalances in the milk supply in various regions and in the demand for cheese. The institute said the lower hauling costs for filtered milk have enabled cheese makers to buy milk from distant regions and meet their needs for manufacturing, especially when regional milk supplies are disrupted by adverse conditions.

Ultra-filtered milk provides cheese makers with an alternative product for this purpose."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Process of Ultra Filtration", "paragraphs": ["Ultra-filtered milk concentrates the proteins by removing the water and lactose in milk, permitting greater efficiency in cheese making. Because the starting ingredients contain less liquid, the volume of whey (primarily water, lactose, whey proteins, and minerals) removed during cheese making is reduced and less effort and time are spent to expel the liquid from the cheese curds leading to its transformation into cheese. Figure 3 is a simplified diagram of the ultra-filtration process that enlarges a portion of the process to show how milk components are separated.", "In ultra filtration, a filter (membrane with minute pores) retains the larger molecules (fat and protein) and allows the smaller molecules (water, lactose, and some minerals) to pass through. Although vitamins are a component in milk, they are not shown in the figure because they are found within the fat and water components. Ultra filtration is not 100- percent efficient because some milk flows parallel to the filter pushed by pressure and not all of the milk comes in contact with the filter. Therefore, wet ultra-filtered milk will contain some water, lactose, and minerals.", "Because of practical limitations on the amount of ultra-filtered milk that can be used in making cheese, ultra-filtered milk is normally used to supplement skim or whole milk used to make cheese. Cheese-making experts said that the majority of cheese vats in U.S. plants are not designed to use only ultra-filtered milk, which is thicker than skim or whole milk. A high proportion of ultra-filtered milk would cause the equipment to malfunction. In addition, because highly concentrated ultra- filtered milk is not nutritionally equivalent to fluid milk, it could not be used as the sole ingredient in cheese. If cheese were made entirely from ultra-filtered milk, its texture, composition, and other characteristics would be different from cheese made traditionally. Although experts believe that these limitations can be addressed, the limitations currently prevent cheese makers from making cheese entirely from ultra-filtered milk at a concentration greater than \u201c2X\u201d in which half of the water is removed leaving twice as many solids (fat and protein) as compared to whole milk."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Cheese-making Process", "paragraphs": ["Figure 4 shows a flowchart of the cheese-making process. Ultra-filtered milk can be used to maintain consistent levels of fat and protein components in the raw milk used to make cheese, ensuring that cheese quality is the same throughout the year. It can also be used in larger quantities to increase the total solids (fat and proteins) in the raw milk, resulting in larger yields. Cheese making involves transforming milk proteins into solid lumps (curds), separating the curds\u2019 solids from the liquid (whey), shaping or pressing these curds into molds, and aging the shaped curds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: U.S. Imports of Milk Protein Concentrates by Country, 1990-1999", "paragraphs": ["Table 2 shows U.S. imports of milk protein concentrates between 1990 and 1999.

We have substituted these sentences as suggested. 2.  We have added language to the footnote and to appendix V to explain that we are referring to the amount of \u201ctrue\u201d protein in whole milk, which is approximately 3 percent. While some sources in literature cite the higher value of \u201ccrude\u201d protein, we feel \u201ctrue\u201d protein is the best value to use in our example. According to academic experts, the total or \u201ccrude\u201d protein in milk that FDA refers to is estimated from measuring the total nitrogen content of milk. The total amount of nitrogen comes from both protein and non-protein sources. The experts noted that the measurement of \u201ccrude\u201d protein is inaccurate because test equipment does not measure the amount of non-protein nitrogen precisely. By testing for \u201ctrue\u201d protein only, which electronic testing equipment can accurately detect, this measurement error is corrected.  In addition, USDA\u2019s AMS, in its 1999 decision on milk market order reform, stated that the use of total or \u201ccrude\u201d protein measurement overstates the amount of protein in milk by the amount of non-protein nitrogen, which has little or no effect on dairy product yields.  Therefore, AMS decided that milk should be priced under federal milk orders on the basis of its true protein content. 3.
