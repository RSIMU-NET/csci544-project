The incident raised questions about Interior's oversight of offshore oil and gas activities. In response, in May 2010, Interior reorganized its offshore oil and gas management activities, and in October 2011, created BSEE to among other things, develop regulations, conduct inspections, and take enforcement actions. In February 2011, GAO added the management of federal oil and gas resources to its High-Risk List.

For example, to supplement its mandatory annual regulatory compliance inspections, in 2012, BSEE leadership began developing a risk-based inspection initiative to identify high-risk production facilities and assess their safety systems and management controls. During pilot testing in 2016, several deficiencies\u2014including the usefulness of its facility risk-assessment model and unclear inspection protocols\u2014caused BSEE to halt the pilot. According to bureau officials, during the development of the initiative, BSEE headquarters did not effectively obtain and incorporate input from regional personnel with long-standing experience in previous risk-based inspection efforts, who could have identified deficiencies earlier in the process. GAO previously found that when implementing large-scale management initiatives a key practice is involving employees to obtain their ideas by incorporating their feedback into new policies and procedures. Instead, BSEE leadership appears to have excluded the input of regional personnel by, for example, not incorporating input beyond the risk-assessment tool when selecting the first pilot facility, even though it was prescribed to do so in the bureau's inspection planning methodology. This undercut the pilot effort, raising questions about whether the bureau's leadership has the commitment necessary to successfully implement its risk-based program. Without higher level leadership within Interior establishing a mechanism for BSEE to obtain and incorporate input from personnel within the bureau, BSEE's risk-based inspection initiative could face continued delays.", "Similarly, since 2013, BSEE leadership has started several key strategic initiatives to improve its internal management, but none have been successfully implemented, in part, because of limited leadership commitment. For example, BSEE's leadership identified the importance of developing performance measures in its 2012-2015 strategic plan. BSEE began one of three attempts to develop performance measures in July 2014 by hiring a contractor to develop measures, but the bureau terminated this contract in January 2015 after determining a need to complete its internal reorganization before developing such measures. A second effort to develop performance measures started in December 2015, using the same consultant, and yielded 12 performance measures in March 2016, but BSEE did not implement them, in part, because data did not exist to use the measures. By the time BSEE received this consultant's report, it had already begun a third effort to internally develop performance measures; as of November 2016 had identified 17 draft performance measures, but BSEE leadership missed repeated deadlines to review them. BSEE officials told GAO that after leadership approval, the bureau plans to pilot these measures and develop others. BSEE leadership has not demonstrated continuing oversight and accountability for implementing internal management initiatives, as evidenced by its limited progress implementing key strategic initiatives. Without higher-level oversight within Interior addressing leadership commitment deficiencies within BSEE, the bureau is unlikely to succeed in implementing internal management initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations, including that higher-level leadership within Interior (1) establish a mechanism for BSEE management to obtain and incorporate input from bureau personnel that can affect the bureau's ability to achieve its objectives and (2) address leadership commitment deficiencies within BSEE, including by implementing internal management initiatives and ongoing strategic initiatives in a timely manner.

The Deepwater Horizon  incident raised questions about the Department of the Interior\u2019s (Interior)  oversight of offshore oil and gas activities in the Gulf of Mexico and led to  investigations by Interior\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG) and Interior\u2019s  Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Safety Oversight Board. In response to  the Deepwater Horizon incident, Interior initiated a number of policy  reforms intended to strengthen its oversight of offshore oil and gas  production on the OCS.

As an interim step, Interior restructured MMS into the Bureau of Ocean  Energy, Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE),  responsible for offshore oil and gas management and the Office of  Natural Resources Revenue responsible for revenue collections. On  October 1, 2011, Interior completed the reorganization of MMS by  splitting BOEMRE into the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management  (BOEM), which is responsible for leasing and resource management, and  the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE), which is  responsible for reviewing drilling permits, inspecting offshore drilling rigs  and production platforms, and developing regulations and standards for  offshore drilling.", "Over the past several years, we have issued a number of reports  identifying Interior\u2019s challenges in managing federal oil and gas  resources.

Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with our  recommendations. Simultaneous to our assessment of BSEE\u2019s  organizational restructuring, bureau leadership was developing its Fiscal  Year 2016-2019 Strategic Plan, which identifies key initiatives to improve  its safety and environmental oversight as well as its internal management.

BSEE  carries out these inspections on behalf of the Secretary throughout  America\u2019s 1.7 billion acres of the OCS. BSEE\u2019s Office of Offshore  Regulatory Programs is responsible for overseeing the bureau\u2019s national  inspection program, which is carried out by the bureau\u2019s regional offices.  During inspections, BSEE inspectors scrutinize all safety system  components designed to prevent or ameliorate blowouts, fires, spillages,  or other major accidents. Additionally, inspectors check for compliance  with current plans, lease terms, and appropriate stipulations. During  inspections, BSEE inspectors check for installation, operation, and  maintenance of all appropriate safety and antipollution devices. They  perform the inspections, in part, by using a checklist derived from  regulated safety and environmental requirements. If an inspector  identifies a regulatory violation at an offshore facility, BSEE issues a  citation to the operator known as an incident of noncompliance (INC) in  response to operator violations of safety or environmental standards. An  INC may be issued in the form of (1) a warning, (2) an order to shut down  a particular component of the facility (when it can be shut down without  affecting the overall safety of the facility or operations), or (3) an order to  shut down an entire drilling rig or production platform in cases when the  violation could result in serious consequences to the environment or  human health and safety, such as a fire or spill.

In 1998, MMS, BSEE\u2019s predecessor organization, contracted for  a study from Carnegie Mellon University to develop a model to target  inspections of offshore facilities based on risk. MMS did not implement  the model at the time because it was too complex, according to BSEE  officials. In 2009, one year prior to the Deepwater Horizon incident and  the dissolution of the MMS in 2010, the Gulf of Mexico Regional Office  piloted a risk-based inspection strategy in the Houma, Louisiana and  Lake Jackson, Texas districts that regional management recommended  for immediate implementation. However, BSEE officials told us that the  2010 Deepwater Horizon incident and Interior\u2019s 2010 Safety and  Environmental Management System (SEMS) regulation prompted the  bureau to reconsider approaches to conducting risk-based inspections.  Since 2011, when it was established as the successor to MMS, BSEE  has highlighted in every Interior budget justification for the bureau its  ongoing efforts to identify and increase oversight of the highest-risk  facilities and operators. Additionally, BSEE affirmed its intentions in its  2016-2019 Strategic Plan to develop this risk-based inspection capability  as part of its National Inspection Program.", "Beginning in 2012, BSEE began an initiative to develop an approach for  conducting inspections of offshore facilities based on the level of risks  they posed. Specifically, BSEE engaged Argonne National Laboratory  (Argonne) to develop a quantitative model to serve as the foundation of  BSEE\u2019s risk-based inspection capability. The model ranks offshore  production platforms according to five indicator factors: (1) whether the  facility is a major complex,  (2) whether the facility\u2019s slot count is 15 or  greater, (3) the number of inspections resulting in an INC in the previous  year, (4) whether the facility experienced an incident\u2014such as an  explosion, fire, fatality, or injury\u2014in the previous year, and (5) whether the  facility experienced an incident in the previous 2 years. BSEE intended  to use risk-based inspections to augment the required annual inspections  by using the results of the Argonne model to identify facilities for  supplemental multi-day inspections focusing on each facility\u2019s risk  management strategies. According to 2015 BSEE documentation on its  risk-based approach, the bureau planned to eventually shift inspection  resources from lower-risk facilities to higher-risk facilities and transition  the overall inspection program from annual compliance inspections to a  risk-based approach to more effectively use BSEE\u2019s available inspection  resources.", "However, to date, BSEE has not successfully implemented this  supplemental risk-based inspection capability in the 5 years since taking  over the initiative from MMS. BSEE leadership led the development of the  risk-based program; however, according to officials, leadership developed  the program with little input from regional personnel. Officials in the Gulf  of Mexico region with knowledge and experience conducting previous  risk-based inspection efforts told us they were not apprised of key  program products until those products were well under development and  were given little opportunity to provide comment on them. As a result,  BSEE first identified deficiencies with its risk-based program during pilot  testing in 2015, rather than working closely with experienced regional  personnel earlier in the process to obtain their input to identify potential  deficiencies and remediate them during program development. For  example, BSEE identified deficiencies in three components of its  proposed inspection program: (1) an underlying risk model for ranking all  production platforms, (2) the annual inspection planning methodology,  and (3) the facility-specific inspection protocol.", "Risk Model. BSEE regional officials who have longstanding  experience evaluating offshore risk told us that the model is not  sophisticated enough to identify platforms for risk-based inspection  planning, and that they could have identified its deficiencies earlier in  the program development process. Specifically, they said that the  model does not contain sufficient information to target facilities for  additional risk-based inspections. For example, Argonne\u2019s model does  not incorporate risk factors such as a facility\u2019s change in ownership  status or operator bankruptcy\u2014factors that BSEE regional officials  told us can be correlated with higher risk, as operators tend to reduce  expenditures on maintenance at these times. Additionally, the model  does not account for the severity of incidents of noncompliance\u2014for  example, whether an incident results in shutting down a facility or a  warning\u2014or the quantity assessed\u2014such as whether a facility was  cited many times or once in a single inspection. Some BSEE regional  officials considered these types of operator performance and risk- related intelligence to be as, or more, important for identifying high- risk facilities than the five factors assessed by the model.", "BSEE headquarters worked directly with Argonne on the risk model,  and although headquarters officials said they included regional  personnel, they did not provide us with evidence of efforts they made  to include those personnel or obtain their input on the risk model\u2019s  initial development. BSEE headquarters officials told us that Argonne  reached out periodically to senior regional personnel, but they did not  specify when the laboratory conducted such outreach, what  contributions regional personnel made, or whether regional personnel  raised concerns during Argonne\u2019s outreach. Conversely, BSEE  regional personnel told us that BSEE headquarters did not inform  them of the development of a risk model or ask them for input leading  up to the pilot.", "Inspection Planning Methodology. In 2015, BSEE outlined an  inspection planning methodology founded on Argonne\u2019s quantitative  risk model that describes how BSEE would target and plan  supplemental safety inspections for offshore production platforms.  BSEE\u2019s inspection planning methodology prescribes the use of two  additional categories of information, alongside Argonne\u2019s model, to  select production platforms for supplemental risk-based inspections.  Specifically, it states that BSEE would use the model\u2019s ranking to  identify the 20 percent of platforms that pose the highest risk. BSEE  would then consider information on operator performance\u2014reported  hydrocarbon releases, number of incidents of noncompliance  assessed in each category, and the quality of SEMS audit reports\u2014 and other risk-related intelligence\u2014including proximity to shore,  production rates, and inspector assessment of overall safety\u2014to  further narrow the selection of high-risk facilities.", "BSEE planned to test its inspection planning methodology by  selecting and conducting five pilot inspections in late 2015 and early  2016. According to BSEE\u2019s program deployment and implementation  plan, the bureau applied Argonne\u2019s model to identify the pilot  inspections in the Lafayette district. However, although BSEE\u2019s  inspection planning methodology prescribed the incorporation of  additional information on operator performance and other risk-related  intelligence in its selection of pilot facilities, a BSEE regional official  told us that during the Risk Based Oversight Team\u2019s discussions,  BSEE leadership relied heavily on the risk model alone. Furthermore,  although regional personnel participated on the Risk Based Oversight  Team when it selected the pilots, a regional official told us they were  largely sidelined during the discussions. As a result, regional officials  told us the pilot selections were not among the highest risk facilities.  For example, three of the top five facilities BSEE selected were idle  and not producing and therefore were not inspected as part of the  pilot. By going against BSEE\u2019s inspection planning methodology,  BSEE leadership appears to have excluded the input of regional  personnel, undercutting the pilot effort and raising questions about  whether the bureau\u2019s leadership has the commitment necessary to  enable the successful implementation of its risk-based program.", "Inspection Protocol. BSEE\u2019s inspection planning methodology also  specified that the Risk-Based Oversight Team should develop an  inspection protocol in advance of conducting risk-based inspections  that is tailored to each facility and describes the roles and  responsibilities of personnel, including what components and safety  systems will be reviewed or tested. Additionally, BSEE\u2019s program  methodology describes the protocol for deliverables and the  dissemination of the inspection results.", "However, BSEE did not establish a clear pilot inspection protocol for  the inspection team and operator for the first pilot, which led to  confusion for BSEE personnel and the operator. Specifically, BSEE  officials involved in the inspection told us that headquarters did not  inform inspection team members of their responsibilities, resulting in  ineffective use of time. In turn, for the second pilot inspection, BSEE  officials told us that BSEE leadership asked regional personnel to  develop the inspection protocol. Officials told us that the second pilot  inspection was an improvement over the first because personnel were  better prepared to carry out their responsibilities. However, officials  said the inspection proved to be more time consuming than BSEE  expected, particularly when compared to the time required to conduct  a typical annual inspection. Specifically, according to one official, the  inspection team needed between 500 and 600 total work hours to  complete the pilot inspection, in part due to the time required in  developing a facility-specific protocol. For comparison, the official told  us that a typical annual inspection of a deep water platform requires  about 100 total work hours. In addition, the official told us that annual  inspections are a more comprehensive review of a facility\u2019s safety  systems because inspectors test and validate all necessary  components, whereas a risk-based inspection considers only specific  aspects of safety performance culture. Therefore, it is not clear  whether risk-based inspections, as performed during the pilot, have  proven to be a more effective method for evaluating safety relative to  annual inspections.", "Additionally, BSEE\u2019s inspection planning methodology prescribes that  the Risk-Based Oversight Team provide final pilot reports to the  operators of the facilities at the earliest opportunity. However,  according to officials, BSEE did not provide the operator of the first  pilot facility with a report of its findings. Similarly, they said BSEE did  not provide a report to the operator of the second pilot facility, only a  verbal debrief until the operator requested a report through BSEE\u2019s  regional office. Because BSEE did not provide formal reports to  operators included in the both pilots in a timely manner, a BSEE  debrief noted that one of the operators was confused about the final  results of the inspection. The purpose of the risk-based inspection  initiative is to provide operators with the opportunity to address issues  and improve their safety management systems, for which they need  timely access to inspection results.", "BSEE headquarters led the development of the inspection planning  methodology and the facility-specific inspection protocol without  obtaining and incorporating input from regional personnel who had  knowledge and experience conducting risk-based inspection efforts.  The Gulf of Mexico region was to evaluate risk routinely when  planning inspections since at least the year 2000, because BSEE\u2019s  inspection policy stipulates that the region is to conduct supplemental  unannounced inspections based on a quantitative and qualitative  assessment of risk. In addition, BSEE\u2019s inspection policy states that  the bureau is to evaluate quantitative and qualitative risk assessment  criteria to determine whether a facility\u2019s annual scheduled inspection  should be a complete inspection or an inspection of a selected sample  of safety components. Furthermore, personnel from that region  conducted a risk-based inspection pilot in 2009 in the Houma,  Louisiana, and Lake Jackson, Texas, districts that regional  management recommended for immediate implementation.  Nevertheless, regional officials who had knowledge of the 2009 pilot  said that BSEE headquarters led and developed the first facility- specific inspection protocol without their input.", "According to officials, BSEE headquarters proceeded with pilot  inspections before regional personnel had the opportunity to raise  concerns about the risk model, the inspection planning methodology, and  the facility-specific inspection protocol. As a result of these deficiencies,  officials involved in the first pilot inspection described it as a failure that  produced few, if any, results. Only after the first pilot did BSEE leadership  begin to engage regional personnel and incorporate their input on the  program, according to officials. In response to the deficiencies BSEE  identified during the first two risk-based pilot inspections, in July 2016,  BSEE revised the risk-based inspection program based on a proposal  that regional personnel told us they developed, which incorporates a risk- based methodology that they had previously used in the Gulf of Mexico.  Specifically, to supplement the facility-based approach that BSEE  leadership had been developing since 2012 based on Argonne\u2019s risk  model, BSEE regional personnel proposed reconstituting an inspection  methodology that MMS used prior to the Deepwater Horizon incident  called \u201cblitz\u201d inspections. Blitz inspections focus on specific facility  components\u2014such as compressors, generators, or cranes\u2014that the  bureau determines are high-risk based on analyses of trends in incidents.  Officials told us that they added this tier of inspections because it allowed  them to target risk across more facilities in less time than is required for  comprehensive risk-based facility inspections. Specifically, BSEE intends  for a typical round of blitz inspections to encompass approximately 50  facilities for 2 to 3 hours each. Under the initial program methodology  developed by BSEE leadership, BSEE stated that it would be able to use  the facility-based methodology as a systematic way of deciding where to  commit annual inspection resources. However, officials said the bureau  now anticipates using the risk-based methodology to target no more than  five facilities per year, instead of the more than 20 per year officials  originally estimated. Instead, BSEE\u2019s revised program methodology will  use both blitz inspections and facility-based inspections based on  Argonne\u2019s model. BSEE\u2019s current plans are to conduct additional pilots  under the revised program methodology prior to implementation in fiscal  year 2017."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Limited Efforts to Obtain and Incorporate Input Hindered BSEE\u2019s Ability to Identify and Remediate Deficiencies in Its Risk-Based Inspection Program", "paragraphs": ["In July 2003, we found that when implementing large-scale management  initiatives, a key practice is involving employees to obtain their ideas and  gain their ownership by incorporating employee feedback into new  policies and procedures.

Further, management\u2019s responsibility to develop policy  and programs in a collaborative manner is established in both BSEE\u2019s  internal policy and federal internal control standards. BSEE\u2019s inspection  policy states that headquarters is responsible for coordinating the  development of national inspection policy, including taking into account  region-specific circumstances.

Specifically, in December 2015,  BSEE headquarters engaged Argonne to conduct an Environmental Risk  Assessment, and in February 2016, established an internal  Environmental Stewardship Collaboration Core Group (Core Group)  comprised of BSEE personnel. In July 2016, both Argonne and the Core  Group produced final reports summarizing their findings. Both reports  found that some of BSEE\u2019s activities, such as those focused on safety  oversight, were not clearly linked to environmental stewardship.  Additionally, Argonne also reported that some environmental protection  and stewardship activities are not described in sufficient detail in BSEE  regulations, policies, and interagency agreements. Argonne  recommended that BSEE clarify functions that primarily focus on safety to  explicitly identify environmental protection as an aspect of safe  operations. Likewise, the Core Group found that some programs\u2019  relationships to environmental stewardship might not always be readily  apparent to program staff or more broadly within BSEE.", "The efforts were overlapping because BSEE leadership tasked both  Argonne and the Core Group with the same five objectives to identify: (1)  linkages and gaps in BSEE\u2019s environmental stewardship of offshore oil  and gas operations, (2) all environmental risks in offshore oil and gas  operations, (3) mitigations already in place to reduce the identified  environmental risks, (4) stewardship priorities for the Environmental  Compliance Division; and (5) opportunities for improvement of BSEE  environmental stewardship.", "However, the efforts were also fragmented because BSEE leadership did  not effectively coordinate the execution of these efforts, which hindered  information sharing between Argonne and the Core Group that could  have enhanced the value of each effort\u2019s report. Instead, both efforts  were executed simultaneously with little evidence of information sharing  or communication. For example, Argonne presented its work at the Core  Group\u2019s initial meeting in February 2016; however, at that time, Argonne  had not yet completed the majority of its contracted tasks. BSEE officials  involved in the Core Group also told us that Argonne did not contribute to  the Core Group activities throughout the effort. According to BSEE  officials, Argonne\u2019s findings were added to the Core Group report by  bureau leadership following the completion of the Core Group\u2019s  assessment and without discussion or assessment by Core Group team  members. Similarly, some officials involved in the Core Group said that  BSEE headquarters did not communicate the objectives of the Argonne  effort, thereby limiting the ability of the Core Group to coordinate with  Argonne to maximize its results.", "Furthermore, Argonne did not have access to bureau information and  personnel that could have enhanced its efforts. Argonne\u2019s report stated  that BSEE regional experts had information and technical knowledge that  could be used to review their assumptions and to identify additional  industry activities for analysis. Argonne also stated that it may have over-  or underestimated potential risks, and did not determine the effectiveness  of BSEE\u2019s environmental stewardship activities. In turn, Argonne recommended BSEE regional subject matter experts review its analysis  regarding the assumptions used in the risk evaluation and repeat the risk  characterization using parameters that regional experts determine to be  more appropriate. Because Argonne was aware of the limitations of its  assessments, Argonne recommended that BSEE regional experts redo  and validate these assessments. In addition to its report, Argonne  provided the bureau with a spreadsheet-based risk assessment tool for  BSEE to use during office verification and field monitoring. However,  given Argonne\u2019s concern about the accuracy of its analysis, BSEE plans  to review and verify Argonne\u2019s work.", "In addition to its report, the Core Group established a bureau-wide  definition for environmental stewardship and BSEE leadership drafted  three work plans. The work plans include one plan to promote  environmental stewardship on a continuous basis,  one work plan to  redo Argonne\u2019s analysis, and another to create a manual with  environmental compliance standard operating procedures for several of  its core functions. BSEE anticipates that this work will be ready for  management review in January 2017.", "BSEE headquarters was responsible for coordinating with Argonne  officials to ensure they had access to BSEE subject matter experts during  the assessment, especially for the risk characterization and ranking task.  Because effective coordination did not occur, the resources used to do  these two simultaneous analyses were not used efficiently. BSEE\u2019s  National Environmental Compliance Policy calls for coordination within  the bureau when developing national policies and procedures. When  BSEE initiated these efforts, bureau policy stated that communication and  coordination within the Bureau and with external stakeholders is an  essential component of success for its environmental division. In April  2016, BSEE updated its national policy but maintained an emphasis on  good coordination across the bureau. Specifically, the current policy  states that the Environmental Compliance Division collaborates within the  bureau on national efforts to develop goals and policies. Furthermore,  communication is an element of good federal internal controls. Under the  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government management  should internally and externally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Because BSEE  management tasked both environmental risk response efforts with the  same objectives and did not effectively communicate information to  coordinate the efforts, the efforts overlapped and ultimately delivered few  results that BSEE can implement immediately. Without higher level  oversight within Interior establishing a mechanism for BSEE management  to obtain and incorporate input from personnel within the bureau and any  external parties, such as Argonne, that can affect the bureau\u2019s ability to  achieve its objectives, BSEE\u2019s Environmental Stewardship efforts are  likely to experience continued implementation and efficacy problems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "BSEE Leadership Has Made Limited Progress in Implementing Strategic Initiatives to Improve Its Internal Management", "paragraphs": ["Since 2013, BSEE began four strategic initiatives to improve its internal  management, but their successful implementation has been hindered by  limited leadership commitment and not addressing factors contributing to  trust concerns.

The Office of  Management and Budget defines ERM as an effective agency-wide  approach to addressing the full spectrum of the organization\u2019s risks by  understanding the combined impacts of risks as an interrelated portfolio,  rather than addressing risks only within silos (i.e., viewing problems in  isolation). BSEE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016-2019 Strategic Plan identifies the  integration of enterprise risk management into bureau-wide decision  making as a key initiative to meet BSEE\u2019s strategic goal to enhance  decision making through the collection, management, and analysis of  high-quality information. In conjunction with a contracted ERM support  consultant, BSEE developed an iterative ERM cycle that includes six  steps: (1) establish an ERM program, (2) identify individual risks and  group them into strategic risks, (3) prioritize risks, (4) develop risk  treatments, (5) implement selected risk treatments, and (6) monitor  performance.", "BSEE completed the first three of these six steps in its iterative ERM  cycle. BSEE officials told us that they had taken actions on the other  three steps. Specifically:  1.

Identify individual risks and group them into strategic risks: In 2014,  BSEE identified 12 strategic risks that cover the lifecycle of BSEE  operations.  3.  Prioritize risks: In 2014, the bureau prioritized its strategic risks,  according to BSEE ERM planning documentation. BSEE assessed  each strategic risk by evaluating the potential severity and likelihood  of a failure event occurring and ranked them based on the results.  4.  Develop risk treatments: BSEE planned to verify the prioritization of its  top several strategic risk treatments by July 2016 but did not do so.  BSEE officials told us that the bureau halted ERM implementation  while it acquired automated ERM software. However, in November  2016, BSEE determined that it would reinitiate ERM implementation  simultaneous to the implementation of software. BSEE now plans to  complete evaluation of risk treatments in March 2017.  5.  Implement selected risk treatments: BSEE planned to finalize a plan  for its prioritized risk treatments by August 2016 but did not do so  because of the aforementioned temporary halt to ERM  implementation. BSEE officials told us that the bureau has  implemented some risk treatments. BSEE now plans to finalize its risk  treatment plan in March 2017.  6.  Monitor performance: BSEE plans to begin monitoring the  performance of its risk treatments following their implementation.

In  2015, BSEE\u2019s ERM support consultant assessed existing interagency  relationships by prioritizing the 35 known memorandums of agreement,  understanding, and collaboration based on the risk exposure they pose to  the bureau. Of these 35 interagency memorandums, BSEE\u2019s consultant  determined that 11 created a significant or moderate increase in risk  exposure to the bureau. For example, the consultant determined that a  memorandum of understanding with BOEM to carry out assigned  responsibilities under the agreement between the U.S. and Mexico  concerning transboundary hydrocarbon reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico  created the greatest risk exposure to BSEE.

In July 2014, the bureau  initiated the first of three formal efforts to develop performance measures.  Specifically, BSEE contracted with a consultant to reassess its existing performance management system and update it as needed to ensure  managers can make informed data-driven decisions. However, BSEE  terminated the contract in January 2015 because, according to BSEE  officials, leadership determined that the bureau needed to complete its  ongoing internal organizational restructuring prior to developing  programmatic performance measures.", "In December 2015, BSEE began its second effort, using the same  consultant under a separate contract to develop performance measures  for the national programs it established during its organizational  restructuring\u2014investigations, environmental compliance, and  enforcement, as well as its Integrity and Professional Responsibility  Advisor (IPRA). Specifically, the contract stipulated that the consultant  analyze program objectives and components, develop potential  performance measures, identify data sources and data collection  requirements, and coordinate with BSEE officials to establish objectives  for each measure.

However, BSEE headquarters officials told us that they are not  implementing the measures and plans developed by the consultant due to  a variety of factors, such as data availability limitations. For example, one  proposed measure included a methodology to assess the effectiveness of  issuing civil penalties to operators for safety or environmental infractions  as a deterrent to committing future infractions. However, BSEE  headquarters officials stated that the bureau does not issue enough civil  penalties to conduct such an assessment\u2014that is, the universe of  available data to assess is too small.

While BSEE has documented its policies,  they are not clear, because (1) neither the IPRA guidance nor the Interior  Department Manual specifies criteria for the severity thresholds for  allegations that are to be referred to the IG and (2) the IPRA guidance  does not align with the Interior Department Manual and BSEE  organization chart concerning the IPRA reporting chain. Moreover,  BSEE\u2019s IPRA pilot initiative did not address the unclear and conflicting  guidance regarding IPRA\u2019s referral criteria and reporting chain,  respectively. Without assessing and amending its IPRA guidance to  clarify (1) the severity threshold criteria for referring allegations and (2)  the IPRA reporting chain, BSEE risks further eroding organizational trust  in the IPRA to carry out its mission to promptly and credibly respond to  allegations or evidence of misconduct by BSEE employees."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2012, BSEE has begun several key strategic initiatives to improve  its safety and environmental oversight. However, the bureau has made  limited progress in implementing them. For example, BSEE\u2019s  Environmental Stewardship Initiative encompassed two simultaneous  efforts to reduce environmental risks related to U.S. offshore oil and gas  operations, but the efforts were partially overlapping, had ineffective coordination and communication, and produced few results. Without  establishing a mechanism for BSEE management to obtain and  incorporate input from bureau personnel and any external parties, such  as Argonne, that can affect the bureau\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives,  BSEE\u2019s risk-based inspection program is likely to experience continued  delays and implementation problems. Likewise, since 2013 BSEE has  begun several strategic initiatives to improve its internal management but  has made limited progress in implementing them. Without a higher-level  organization within Interior addressing leadership commitment  deficiencies within BSEE, including by implementing internal  management initiatives and ongoing strategic initiatives (e.g., ERM and  performance measure initiatives) in a timely manner, the bureau is  unlikely to succeed in implementing internal management initiatives,  including its key strategic initiatives for ERM and performance measures,  in a timely manner. Additionally, BSEE documentation identifies the need  to enhance communication vertically and horizontally across the bureau,  but it is unclear whether the bureau\u2019s employee engagement initiative will  address the lack of quality information that BSEE officials told us  undermines trust across the organization or set expectations for sharing  accurate and timely information as called for by BSEE\u2019s Fiscal Year 2016- 2019 Strategic Plan. Without expanding the scope of its employee  engagement strategy to incorporate the need to communicate quality  information throughout the bureau, BSEE\u2019s employee engagement  initiative might not address the lack of quality information being  communicated throughout the bureau that is exacerbating trust concerns.  Further, BSEE\u2019s IPRA pilot initiative did not address unclear and  conflicting guidance that could undermine organizational trust in how the  IPRA addresses allegations of misconduct. Without assessing and  amending IPRA guidance to clarify (1) severity threshold criteria for  referring allegations of misconduct to the IG and (2) its reporting chain,  BSEE risks further eroding organizational trust in the IPRA to carry out its  mission to promptly and credibly respond to allegations or evidence of  misconduct by BSEE employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In this report, we are making four recommendations. We recommend that  the Secretary of the Interior direct the Assistant Secretary for Land and  Minerals Management, who oversees BSEE, take the following two  actions:", "Establish a mechanism for BSEE management to obtain and  incorporate input from bureau personnel and any external parties,  such as Argonne, that can affect the bureau\u2019s ability to achieve its  objectives.", "Address leadership commitment deficiencies within BSEE, including  by implementing internal management initiatives and ongoing  strategic initiatives (e.g., ERM and performance measure initiatives) in  a timely manner.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of the Interior direct the BSEE  Director take the following two actions:", "To address trust concerns that exist between headquarters and the  field, BSEE should expand the scope of its employee engagement  strategy to incorporate the need to communicate quality information  throughout the bureau.", "To increase organizational trust in IPRA activities, BSEE should  assess and amend IPRA guidance to clarify (1) severity threshold  criteria for referring allegations of misconduct to the IG and (2) its  reporting chain."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of the Interior for  review and comment. In its written comments, reproduced in appendix I,  Interior neither agreed nor disagreed with our four recommendations.  Interior stated that the recommendations reflect ongoing BSEE  commitments and that BSEE and Interior agree with the concepts laid out  in the first three recommendations. For the fourth recommendation,  Interior stated that BSEE will examine the current guidance for the  Integrity and Professional Responsibility Advisor. However, Interior also  stated that the draft report neither fully describes the progress made  within BSEE nor fully represents the current status of the programs,  initiatives, and activities highlighted therein. Interior requested that we  consider information that it stated provides status updates and  corrections, while also laying out in more detail BSEE's continuing  commitments in these areas.  Interior also enclosed additional  documentation. We reviewed the additional information and  documentation that Interior provided and found no evidence to support  the revision of any of our findings. In turn, we disagree with Interior\u2019s  characterization of the progress that BSEE has made and believe that  actions to implement our recommendations are necessary. Specifically:", "Regarding our recommendation that Interior develop a mechanism for  BSEE management to obtain and incorporate input from bureau  personnel and any external parties that can affect the bureau\u2019s ability  to achieve its objectives, Interior\u2019s comments do not discuss any  specific actions taken or underway to do so. Additionally, in its  comments, Interior stated that regional personnel, such as regional  managers and district managers, were involved throughout the  development of the risk model and the pilot testing. To support this  statement, Interior provided documentation of electronic  communications from BSEE headquarters to senior regional  leadership informing them of certain aspects of the program and  meeting documents showing that certain regional officials attended  meetings regarding program development. However, instead of  demonstrating that regional managers were involved in the  development of the model and methodology, this documentation  demonstrates that regional officials raised concerns about the model  and methodology but that headquarters officials said they would not  make any changes in response to these concerns. Specifically,  Interior provided e-mails that indicate headquarters informed regional  officials of the development of the model through the Strategic Plan  Implementation Team in late 2012. However, e-mails from early 2015  indicate that regional officials were not involved in the development of  the risk model or risk-based inspection program methodology in the  intervening more than 2 years, because they had to request  information from headquarters about the underlying basis of the  model and the methodology that they were being asked to comment  on. After regional officials reviewed the methodology and the model,  they e-mailed headquarters and raised concerns with the model.   Headquarters officials replied that they validated the model and that  changing the parameters of the model would decrease its  effectiveness. Therefore, the e-mails that Interior provided support  what regional personnel told us\u2014that their input was not incorporated  into the model and methodology prior to the first pilot. We found that  regional personnel became more involved in the risk-based inspection  initiative after the first pilot exposed deficiencies in headquarters\u2019  approach. In its comments, Interior disagreed with our assessment of  pilot test deficiencies and stated that BSEE expected to encounter  issues while pilot testing. However, we believe that some of those  issues may have been averted had BSEE included the input of  regional officials earlier in the process. As described throughout the  report across multiple initiatives, we have concerns about the  fundamental working relationship between the region and  headquarters, which are substantiated by the e-mails that Interior  provided in response to our draft report. In turn, we continue to  believe that Interior should develop a mechanism for BSEE  management to obtain and incorporate input from bureau personnel  and any external parties that can affect the bureau\u2019s ability to achieve  its objectives in the next risk-based inspection pilot test, which will be  conducted by a joint headquarters-regional team in March 2017.  However, as we discussed in the report, the first pilot had deficiencies  in identifying high-risk offshore facilities, so the extent to which BSEE  will be able to apply lessons learned is uncertain.", "Regarding our recommendation that Interior address leadership  commitment deficiencies within BSEE, including implementing internal  management initiatives (e.g., ERM and performance measure  initiatives) in a timely manner, Interior\u2019s comments do not discuss any  specific actions taken to meet the intent of our recommendation.  Interior states that BSEE's implementation of ERM is on target and  that BSEE has an established ERM framework, completed its risk  register, has a fully developed maturity model, has aligned enterprise  and strategic risks with its strategic plan and has linked program risks  with appropriate strategic risk categories, in addition to other activities.  Interior also stated that BSEE is on schedule to complete its first full  ERM cycle in March 2017. Additionally, Interior states that ERM is a  relatively new program directed by a fall 2016 Office of Management  and Budget Circular regarding ERM.  However, while Circular No. A- 123 was revised in July 2016 with new ERM implementation  requirements effective for fiscal year 2017, Interior\u2019s statement is  misleading because BSEE\u2019s efforts have been ongoing since 2013.  Additionally, Interior provided clarifications but does not dispute our  findings on its efforts to develop performance measures. Specifically,  Interior states that the November 2016 completion of a fiscal year  2016 Baseline Performance Measure Report represented the first  step of implementation of BSEE\u2019s performance measure program and  that the bureau anticipates having an initial performance dashboard in  fiscal year 2018. By considering November 2016 as the first step  toward a performance measures program, Interior appears to  disregard BSEE\u2019s efforts over the prior 4 years. If BSEE succeeds in  fiscal year 2018, this will be the culmination of 6 years of attempting to  develop performance measures to inform management decision  making. Therefore, we continue to believe that Interior should address  leadership commitment deficiencies within BSEE, including by  implementing internal management initiatives, such as ERM and  performance measures, in a timely manner rather than revising  initiative start dates.", "Regarding our recommendation that BSEE expand the scope of its  employee engagement strategy to incorporate the need to  communicate quality information throughout the bureau, Interior  stated that BSEE is committed to enhancing communication and  collaboration among its personnel and agrees with the importance  strengthening communication between headquarters and the regions.  Interior asserts that, since receiving our draft report, BSEE has  completed assessment and analysis of employee feedback, and  developed an engagement plan. However, Interior did not provide  documentary evidence of this plan or what it entails. Moreover, in our  report we identified a long history of poor communication between  headquarters and regional officials, leading to a widespread lack of  trust across the bureau. Without providing evidence of BSEE\u2019s  activities\u2014and in light of the bureau\u2019s documented struggles to  effectively implement organizational change\u2014we cannot confirm that  any action has been taken and continue to believe that BSEE should  expand the scope of its employee engagement strategy to incorporate  the need to communicate quality information throughout the bureau.", "Regarding our recommendation that BSEE assess and amend IPRA  guidance to clarify (1) severity threshold criteria for referring  allegations of misconduct to the IG and (2) its reporting chain, Interior  stated that the creation of the IPRA directly impacts trust concerns  within BSEE and that the bureau will examine current guidance for the  IPRA. However, Interior stated that contrary to our draft report, the  Interior Department Manual already includes severity threshold criteria  for referring allegations of misconduct to the IG. We believe that the  language in the Interior Department Manual, which states that  \u201cserious allegations\u201d and \u201cserious complaints\u201d should be referred to  the IG, does not provide the specificity needed to adequately define  the boundaries of IPRA responsibility. Additionally, Interior stated that  the IPRA reports to the BSEE Director, consistent with the reporting  chain established in the bureau\u2019s organizational chart and the Interior  Department Manual. However, the BSEE Director told us that, in  practice, the IPRA often reports to the BSEE Deputy Director rather  than the Director. Moreover, our work found that the decision making  process of the IPRA Board\u2014whereby the IPRA Board determines  how to respond to an investigation without consultation with the  Director\u2014does not align with the IPRA\u2019s prescribed reporting chain.   As a result, we continue to believe that BSEE should assess and  amend IPRA guidance to clarify (1) severity threshold criteria for  referring allegations of misconduct to the IG and (2) its reporting  chain.", "Interior\u2019s comments on our draft report underscore our concerns  regarding deficiencies in BSEE leadership commitment and support the  decision to incorporate the restructuring of offshore oil and gas oversight  into our High-Risk List in February 2017. Specifically:  In its comments, Interior highlighted BSEE\u2019s decision to contract with  NAPA to evaluate the bureau\u2014at a cost of approximately $450,000\u2014 as an example of the bureau\u2019s commitment to maturing the  organization. However, the timing, scope, and methodology cause us  to question its value. Specifically, BSEE issued the contract five  months after we began our review, and its scope\u2014which includes  identifying BSEE strategic and organizational initiatives and assessing  their progress\u2014mirrors our work already underway. Further, the  contract stipulates that all work \u201cshall be developed in a collaborative  manner with BSEE leadership, but with a focus on document review  rather than in-depth interviews with bureau personnel.\u201d This calls into  question the independence of the NAPA evaluation. Additionally,  when we met with the NAPA team, they indicated that their  instructions were to focus on BSEE headquarters and not conduct  outreach to the bureau\u2019s operational components in the regions. In  our experience working with BSEE, we have found extensive outreach  to the field to be essential to understanding the operations of the  bureau. As a cumulative result of these factors, it is uncertain whether  BSEE\u2019s decision to engage in this evaluation will produce the  organizational improvement advertised by Interior.", "Interior\u2019s written comments contain factual errors that are contradicted  by the evidence we collected in our work, further heightening our  concerns regarding BSEE leadership\u2019s commitment to taking the  steps needed to improve the bureau. For example, Interior states that  environmental risk was not a consideration in the Core Group  objectives or final report. However, the Core Group\u2019s final report  states that the purpose of the report was \u201cto assist in determining  current and emerging environmental risks and whether BSEE has the  best mitigation strategies in place.\u201d Likewise, Interior states that  BSEE\u2019s Environmental Stewardship Collaboration Core Group and  Argonne Environmental Risk Assessment were not simultaneous  efforts. On the contrary, according to its final report, the Core Group  convened from February 2016 to May 2016. The Statement of Work  for the Argonne environmental risk assessment contract was issued in  December 2015, and Argonne delivered its final report in July 2016.", "Interior also provided technical comments that we incorporated into the  report, as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of the Interior, and other interested parties.
