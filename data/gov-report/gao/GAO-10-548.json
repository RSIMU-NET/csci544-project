FSA made about $395 million in payments under these programs to 8,463 farmers who RMA identified as having received suspicious crop insurance claims payments in those same years. Almost half of crop disaster payments for farmers RMA identified as having suspicious crop insurance claims payments were in five states. RMA provides its annual list of suspicious claims payments to FSA state and county offices and to the insurance company selling the policy to the farmer for appropriate follow-up action. However, GAO previously reported that few suspicious claims payments resulted in a conviction for fraud. As reported, the factors considered when accepting a case for investigation and prosecution include sufficiency of the evidence, complexity of the case, whether the fraudulent activity is part of a pattern or scheme, and workload and resources that would be needed to investigate and prosecute the case. For 2001 through 2007, GAO could not use FSA's electronic data files to determine whether crop disaster payments complied with a statutory cap because the reliability of these files is undetermined for the purpose of assessing whether a crop disaster payment was in compliance with the cap. However, in using hard copy files to determine compliance with the cap, GAO found that payments to selected farmers were in compliance. Furthermore, FSA officials did not provide systems documentation, such as specifications and business rules on how FSA used data in its systems to calculate crop disaster payments. FSA's experience with ad hoc crop disaster programs shows that a lag--as much as 4 years--between the occurrence of a disaster-related crop loss and the application for a disaster payment for that loss prevented FSA county officials from verifying the cause of the loss. Under the new program, there will still be a lag before farmers can apply for a payment; in contrast, farmers have to file a crop insurance claim immediately after a loss and be subject to insurance verification. Without more timely eligibility determinations for the new crop disaster program, FSA county officials will be unable to verify that applicants experienced losses due to an eligible cause. In addition, insufficient documentation of the data systems FSA used for calculating and issuing payments under the ad hoc programs makes it difficult to validate the accuracy of those payments. A similar lack of documentation under the new program could hamper FSA officials' efforts to track payments and ensure the payments adhere to statutes, regulations, and FSA guidelines."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a safety net of  permanently authorized and regularly funded programs, including  federally subsidized crop insurance and emergency disaster loans, to help  farmers recover financially from natural disasters. Congress has  historically supplemented these ongoing programs in an ad hoc manner by  providing one-time payments through crop disaster programs that  compensate farmers for disaster-related crop losses they sustained. Most  recently, under three separate congressionally authorized ad hoc crop  disaster programs, USDA provided $7 billion in disaster payments to  farmers whose crops were damaged or destroyed by natural disasters from  2001 through 2007. The Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (the  2008 farm bill) established and funded a $3.8 billion permanent trust fund,  and directed the Secretary of Agriculture to make crop disaster assistance  payments to eligible producers who suffer crop losses on or before  September 30, 2011, under a new program\u2014the Supplemental Revenue  Assistance Payments Program. Under this new program, USDA\u2014through  its Farm Service Agency (FSA)\u2014began making payments in early 2010 for  crop losses incurred in 2008. Crop disaster payments are largely based on  data from USDA\u2019s Risk Management Agency (RMA), which is responsible  for administering the federally subsidized crop insurance program. In  addition to crop disaster payments, farmers may also receive federal  assistance through crop subsidy programs and the crop insurance  program.", "You asked us to review USDA\u2019s ad hoc crop disaster assistance programs,  as well as the new crop disaster program. Accordingly, we determined (1)  how FSA administered its three crop disaster programs for crop losses  from 2001 through 2007 and the results of payments made under these  programs and (2) what lessons FSA can learn from its experience with the  previous three crop disaster programs for managing its new crop disaster  program.", "To determine how FSA administered its crop disaster programs for crop  losses from 2001 through 2007 (the period covered by the three programs),  we reviewed statutes, regulations, and guidance related to the programs.  We also obtained and analyzed electronic data files from FSA to determine  how FSA applied statutes, regulations, and guidance in administering the  programs. To assess the reliability of the data in these files, we performed  electronic testing of the required data elements, reviewed existing  information, and interviewed knowledgeable FSA officials about the data  and the systems that produced them. We determined that the payment  data in the files were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of determining  the distribution of crop disaster payments by state, program, and type of  recipient. However, the reliability of FSA\u2019s electronic data files is  undetermined for the purpose of assessing whether a crop disaster  payment complied with a statutory cap. In addition, to develop  nongeneralizeable examples of farmers receiving disaster payments for  crop losses, we first identified the four states with the highest amount of  total crop disaster program payments for all three programs: Kansas,  North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas. We also selected North Carolina,  another state with high payment levels, to expand the geographic  dispersion of our review. We identified the 27 counties comprising the top  20 percent of the crop disaster payments FSA administered in each of  those five states. For these 27 counties, we interviewed FSA officials about  their experiences administering crop disaster programs. In addition, we  reviewed hard copy payment files for 75 selected farmers who received  disaster payments from among the 10 percent of farmers receiving the  largest payments under all three programs (i.e., 15 farmers from each  county that received the largest disaster payments under all three  programs in each of these five states).", "Because FSA bases its disaster assistance payments largely on RMA data,  we also obtained information on crop insurance claims payments from  RMA. We interviewed RMA officials and reviewed relevant documentation  to assess the reliability of the RMA data and determined the data to be  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. To determine what  lessons FSA can learn from its experience with past crop disaster  programs for managing the new crop disaster program, we reviewed  statutes, regulations, and guidance related to the new program. We also  interviewed FSA officials responsible for administering crop disaster  programs and FSA data experts responsible for developing the crop  disaster payment systems.

These documents record farming information, such as  which crops are planted on each field, the farming practices used, and the  name of each individual with an interest in the farming operation. FSA  uses this information to determine farm program payments, including  payments for various agriculture disaster assistance programs.", "According to USDA documents, agriculture-related disasters are common:  one-half to two-thirds of the counties in the United States have been  designated as disaster areas in each of the past several years. As shown in  figure 1, many counties received disaster designations for multiple years  from 2001 through 2007.", "In order for a county to qualify for a USDA secretarial disaster designation,  a disaster must have caused a minimum loss of 30 percent of production of  at least one crop in the county. The secretarial disaster designation  process begins when an eligible disaster event, such as hail or drought,  occurs in a county. After monitoring and recording the disaster conditions,  local officials, including FSA county officials, contact their governor to  request a disaster designation for the county. Next, the governor submits a  written disaster designation request to the Secretary of Agriculture. As a  result of this request, FSA directs its county officials to complete a damage  assessment report to show whether the minimum loss requirement was  met.

RMA is also to address program compliance issues,  including protecting the program against fraud, waste, and abuse. Under  the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000, RMA uses information  technologies, such as data mining, to identify anomalous patterns of crop  insurance claims payments that are consistent with actions farmers could  take to obtain personal benefit through fraud or abuse of the crop  insurance program. RMA has identified 45 patterns of crop insurance  payments that it defines as anomalous, such as receiving payments while  experiencing high frequency of losses or high severity of losses in  comparison with surrounding farming operations; using poor farming  practices; or exhibiting irregular behavior with insurance agents or  adjusters that suggests collusion. RMA\u2019s data mining does not identify  specific instances of fraud or abuse of the crop insurance program; rather,  it identifies anomalous patterns of crop insurance claims payments that  are consistent with the potential for fraud and abuse and considers these  payments as \u201csuspicious.\u201d RMA places farmers who exhibit such patterns  on an annual list, after the year in which the crop insurance claims  payments are made, to monitor their current or future farming practices.

Staff in FSA county offices advise the  selected farmers that they have been identified for an inspection as a  result of data mining and conduct field inspections during the growing  season. In conducting these inspections, FSA inspectors are to determine,  among other things, the tillage method used; weed control practices; type  and amount of fertilizer applied; weather conditions; and how the  inspected crop compares with others in the area. As a result of these  inspections and other information, RMA reported total cost savings from  2001 through 2007 of $564 million, primarily in the form of estimated  claims payments avoided: $140 million in 2005, $27 million in 2006, and $85  million in 2007.", "RMA has the authority to impose sanctions against farmers, agents, loss  adjusters, and insurance companies that willfully and intentionally provide  false or inaccurate information to RMA or to insurance companies. RMA  also has the authority to disqualify farmers who have committed a  violation not only from the insurance program but also from most other  farm programs for up to 5 years.

The third program provided  assistance for crop losses in 2005, 2006, or 2007. Generally, under each  program, crop losses were eligible for crop disaster payments if the losses  resulted from any of the following: (1) damaging weather, such as drought,  excessive moisture, hail, freeze, tornado, or hurricane; (2) an adverse  natural occurrence, such as an earthquake; or (3) a condition related to  damaging weather or an adverse natural occurrence such as saltwater  intrusion, rationing of irrigation water, disease, or insect infestation.", "The authorizing statutes and program regulations established payment  limitations and eligibility requirements for the three crop disaster  programs. For example, the statutes prohibited producers\u2014who we refer  to as farmers in this report\u2014from receiving a payment for more than 1  year for each of the multiyear disaster programs. In addition, USDA  regulations prohibited an individual farmer or member of a farming  operation from receiving a crop disaster payment greater than $80,000.  Regarding eligibility requirements, the statutes provided that farmers were  only eligible to receive crop disaster payments if they had previously  obtained federal crop insurance or coverage through FSA\u2019s Noninsured  Crop Disaster Assistance Program for the crop that suffered weather- related damage. Specifically, for crops covered by the federal crop  insurance program (insured crops), farmers must have obtained crop  insurance coverage through that program.

Not all uninsured crops were eligible for payment under the  crop disaster programs. Furthermore, a statutory payment cap prohibited  USDA from paying an individual or a farming operation for more than 95  percent of what the value of the crop would have been in the absence of  the loss (expected value).

RMA put this farmer\u2019s operation on its annual list because the  farmer received crop insurance payments while exhibiting such  anomalous patterns as (1) having a loss ratio 150 percent greater than  other farmers within the area and (2) experiencing abnormally large crop  insurance claims in comparison with similar farming operations in the  county and repeating this behavior for multiple years.", "Similarly, the FSA county officials we interviewed identified some farmers  in their counties who received crop disaster payments that the FSA county  officials believed were based on suspicious crop insurance claims  payments. These FSA county officials told us that they were familiar with  the farmers in their county and could identify those who may have  received suspicious crop insurance payments, but because the county  officials received the crop insurance claim information several years after  the crop losses occurred, they could not verify the farmers\u2019 crop losses  and relied on RMA data to issue the crop disaster payments. The FSA  county officials provided the following as examples:    One farmer in North Dakota received over $85,000 in disaster payments  under the 2001 through 2007 crop disaster programs, claiming that disaster  conditions caused losses to his crops. According to an FSA county official,  the farmer\u2019s crop losses were likely due to poor farming practices because  this farmer did not fertilize his crops.", "A farmer in North Carolina received almost $160,000 in disaster payments  from 2001 through 2007, including about $60,000 for tobacco that he  claimed was damaged or could not be harvested.

These officials added  that in their past experience with appeals, USDA rarely upheld FSA county  office decisions to deny payments. One official said that USDA generally  approved appeals related to crop disaster applications unless the FSA  county office produced evidence that the payment applicant did not meet  program eligibility requirements. The official added that he did not collect  such evidence because, at the time of the crop loss, he did not anticipate  that a disaster program would provide assistance for those crop losses.  However, according to our analysis of data from USDA\u2019s National Appeals  Division, FSA was more likely to be favored in an appeal related to the  2001 through 2007 crop disaster programs than were the farmers. We  found the National Appeals Division upheld FSA\u2019s denial of crop disaster  payment applications for about 72 percent of the appeals, and the division  overturned FSA\u2019s denial, deciding that the farmer should have received a  crop disaster payment, for the remaining 28 percent."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although Weaknesses Exist in FSA\u2019s Data Systems, Hard Copy Files Show That Payments Complied with the Statutory Cap", "paragraphs": ["Under the crop disaster programs from 2001 through 2007, a statutory  payment cap allowed FSA to provide a farmer up to 95 percent of the  expected value of the crop in the absence of a disaster.

For example, FSA\u2019s data systems (1) could not be reliably merged  using program year, tax identification number, tax identification number  type, FSA state code, and FSA county code to determine whether  payments complied with the statutory cap and (2) were not sufficiently  documented. However, we assessed hard copy payment files for 75  selected farmers in the five states and found that the payments made to  these farmers complied with the statutory payment cap.", "We found that FSA could not provide documentation on how its systems  captured and processed data in order to calculate disaster payments for  crop losses from 2001 through 2007. Specifically, FSA officials could not  provide us with business rules, system specifications, or processing  algorithms associated with the payment calculations executed at FSA\u2019s  Application Development Center in Kansas City, Missouri. Such  documentation is important because it typically translates policies and  procedures into specific, unambiguous rules that govern how data are  entered, validated, stored, processed, and reported. As such, the  documentation facilitates accurate and consistent implementation of  policies and procedures. Although FSA officials provided copies of  program guidance and described actions FSA has taken to ensure the  quality of the data it generates, they could not provide sufficient  documentation for us to verify the agency\u2019s stated actions. For example,  FSA could not provide design specifications about the functional  requirements of the data systems it used to capture information about  disaster payments for crop losses from 2001 through 2007. Detailed design  specifications are important because they are used for developing  thorough test plans, maintaining the system, and ensuring that risks  associated with building and operating the system are adequately  controlled. Furthermore, FSA\u2019s documentation of the crop disaster  program data systems does not meet Office of Management and Budget  documentation guidelines. These guidelines require federal agencies,  among other things, to identify and document business rules; information  relationships; and the functional requirements, capabilities, and  interconnections of the computer systems. FSA officials could not provide  documentation describing how its systems operated.", "Also, for the purpose of assessing whether crop disaster payments  complied with the statutory cap, we performed a detailed review of hard  copy crop disaster payment files for 75 selected farmers who received  payments under all three crop disaster programs from the five counties  receiving the largest amount of crop disaster payments in each of five  selected states. According to our analysis, these 75 selected farmers  received payments that complied with the 95 percent statutory percentage  cap on all of their 2,263 fields that sustained crop losses from 2001 through  2007. Overall, as shown in table 3, 328 of these fields qualified for a  disaster payment that allowed the farmers to receive 95 percent of the  expected value of their crops for these fields.", "We also found that the total payment received by the 75 selected farmers  for the three programs varied from $61,592 to $2,256,386. According to our  analysis of the hard copy files, 24 percent of the fields we reviewed  qualified for payments because disaster conditions prevented farmers  from harvesting any crops from the fields; 69 percent because disaster  conditions reduced the amount of crops produced on the fields; and 7  percent because disasters prevented farmers from planting crops on the  fields.", "Forty-nine of the 75 selected farmers received payments for at least one  field they were unable to harvest. Furthermore, although not exceeding  the 95 percent cap, the crop disaster programs provided 37 of these 49  farmers\u2014who grew crops such as corn, cotton, soybeans, and wheat\u201490  percent or more of the expected value of the crops. However, these  farmers did not incur harvesting costs for these fields. Based on our  review of two academic studies, about 15 percent of the cost of  producing such crops can be associated with harvesting the crops. Thus,  although these 37 farmers may have incurred about 85 percent of the cost  of producing these crops, crop disaster program payments allowed these  farmers to receive 90 percent or more of the expected value of the crops,  even though FSA offices reduced farmers\u2019 crop disaster payments by a  certain percentage\u2014known as the \u201cunharvested\u201d payment factor\u2014to  reflect the fact that the farmers had not harvested these crops."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "FSA Can Learn Lessons for the New Crop Disaster Program from Three Prior Programs", "paragraphs": ["FSA\u2019s experience with ad hoc crop disaster programs provides lessons  that could benefit the agency\u2019s implementation of the new program.

Under the new program, FSA officials will still face  a lag time, and without more timely eligibility determinations, FSA county  officials will be unable to verify that applicants experienced losses due to  an eligible cause. Second, the lack of documentation in FSA\u2019s data systems  for calculating and issuing payments under the ad hoc programs makes it  difficult to validate the accuracy of those payments. A similar lack of  documentation under the new program could hamper FSA officials\u2019 efforts  to track payments and ensure the payments adhere to statutes,  regulations, and FSA guidelines."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Timely Eligibility Determinations Provides Lessons for New Crop Disaster Program", "paragraphs": ["Under the ad hoc crop disaster programs from 2001 through 2007, USDA  regulations and program guidance specified disaster conditions\u2014such as  hail, drought, or excessive rainfall\u2014that qualified as eligible causes of  crop loss. As such, FSA county officials reviewed each payment  application to determine whether the crop loss was eligible for payment.  However, because the programs were enacted on an ad hoc basis after the  disaster-related crop losses, these application reviews took place as many  as 4 years after the losses occurred. With such a lag, we found that FSA  county officials could not take actions, such as conducting field  inspections, to validate whether the crops suffered damage as a result of a  qualifying disaster condition. Instead, the FSA county officials relied on  information farmers supplied on their disaster payment applications and  information from RMA, such as crop insurance payment records, to  determine if an eligible disaster condition caused a farmer\u2019s crop losses.  Fourteen of the 27 FSA county officials we spoke with identified the  absence of making timely cause of loss eligibility determinations as a  concern under the 2001 through 2007 crop disaster programs, and many of  these county officials said that having the opportunity to determine the  eligibility of losses soon after the disaster would increase assurance that  crop disaster program payments are proper. This opportunity could exist  under the new Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program.", "Determining the cause of crop losses for each farmer will remain critically  important under the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program  because a farming operation must have lost at least 10 percent of  production on at least one crop of economic significance as a result of an  eligible disaster condition to qualify for a payment. Under the program,  FSA county officials are to determine crop loss eligibility at least 1 year  after crop losses occur because, under the new program guidelines, FSA  officials are to make this determination using annual market prices for  each crop to calculate payments, which are generally established at the  end of the crop year. As a result, crop disaster payment applicants can  submit their applications several months after their crop loss occurs, and  FSA officials will continue to depend on information from farmers and  RMA crop insurance data to determine whether applicants experienced  crop losses due to an eligible disaster condition. For example, a farmer  who planted corn in the spring of 2010 would not harvest that crop until  fall. Therefore, if a disaster destroyed the corn during the summer, the  farmer may wait until the fall of 2011\u2014after the crop year for corn ended  and when FSA could determine the market prices needed to calculate a  payment and process a claim\u2014before filing a loss claim. Without more  timely eligibility determinations, FSA county officials will not have the  opportunity to verify that payment applicants experienced crop losses due  to an eligible disaster condition. Because farmers know that, under the  new program, FSA cannot make determinations until the annual market  prices for each crop are available to calculate payments, there is no  incentive to file crop disaster claims when a crop loss occurs.", "In contrast, under the federal crop insurance program, if farmers incur  crop losses and file a claim with their insurance agent or company, the  company assigns an adjuster who visits the farm at the time of the  disaster-related loss and, using RMA guidance, determines the percentage  of loss for the acres planted. The adjuster forwards the claim to the  insurance company, which verifies and recalculates the claim. If all  company and RMA requirements are met, the company pays the claim to  the farmer. According to RMA guidance, a farmer may destroy any of the  damaged crops or replant a new crop after the insurance adjuster has  inspected the farmer\u2019s crop loss and provided written consent that the  farmer may take such actions. However, we have previously raised  concerns of fraud and abuse of the crop insurance program\u2019s claims  adjustment process. For example, in 2005, we reported that crop  insurance fraud cases, investigated by USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General  and resulting in criminal prosecutions between June 2003 and April 2005,  show how farmers, sometimes in collusion with insurance agents and  others, falsely claim prevented planting, weather damage, and low  production. In addition, we found that several of these cases demonstrated  the importance of having FSA and RMA work together to identify and  share information on questionable farming practices and activities. Under  the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program, as under the  2001 through 2007 crop disaster programs, FSA county officials receive  information about crop losses at the time the farmer submits an  application for payment. As a result, FSA officials may become aware of  crop losses after the claims adjustment process and after farmers have  planted a new crop on their fields that suffered disaster-related damage.  Without notification of the crop losses closer to the time of the disaster,  FSA county officials will not have the opportunity to verify the eligibility  of crop losses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses in Data Systems Provide Lessons for New Crop Disaster Program", "paragraphs": ["Under past crop disaster programs, FSA\u2019s automated payment system used  information in multiple data systems to calculate and issue payments.

In August 2009,  USDA\u2019s Office of Inspector General reported that integration of USDA\u2019s  information management systems, including FSA and RMA systems, could  improve the integrity of farm programs, such as the new crop disaster  program.", "In the context of these information technology issues, in early 2010, FSA  began issuing payments for the new crop disaster program using an  interim payment system that has weaknesses. According to FSA  documents, because of the significant amount of data required to calculate  payments under the new crop disaster program, FSA does not expect to  complete the development of a fully automated payment system that will  allow the agency to issue timely payments to farmers who sustained crop  losses in 2008. As a result, FSA developed an interim payment system that  requires FSA county office staff to use a manual process to complete  applications and calculate payments for 2008 crop losses, storing each  application in a single spreadsheet maintained in FSA county offices. FSA  staff at each county office manually enter applicant data into this  spreadsheet to calculate applicants\u2019 payments, and an independent official  verifies the accuracy of the data entry. According to program guidelines,  once the payment calculations are complete, the FSA county office staff  are to record the payment amounts in a Web-based system that  automatically issues the payments. FSA officials said that once the agency  fully develops the automated payment system, it plans to validate and  make any necessary adjustments to the payments calculated and issued  using the interim payment system. However, according to the FSA officials  responsible for implementing the new crop disaster program, the agency  did not develop a mechanism to link the final payment amounts in the  Web-based system to the application data in the spreadsheets maintained  in each FSA county office. Therefore, if USDA or an independent entity  sought to audit the payments under the new crop disaster program to  ensure they are proper, the auditor would have to manually review the  files in each of about 2,300 FSA county offices. Also, the program and the  auditors would not have the benefit of electronic edit checks to ensure the  accuracy of payments.", "Furthermore, according to FSA officials, the agency is still in early  development stages of the final automated payment system and has not  developed documentation of the data systems or written business rules  that describe how the final automated system will calculate and issue  payments. However, according to FSA officials responsible for developing  the final payment system for the Supplemental Revenue Assistance  Payments Program, FSA plans to issue the necessary documentation,  including design specifications and functional requirements, and perform  system testing.

Instead, FSA  officials relied largely on information from farmers and RMA to determine  the cause of crop losses. The Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments  Program provides an opportunity to eliminate this problem. Under this  program, however, FSA county officials will not receive information about  crop losses until the time the farmer submits an application for payment,  which may occur after farmers have planted a new crop on their fields that  suffered disaster-related damage.

Specifically, RMA uses data mining to identify patterns in crop insurance  claims payments that are consistent with the potential for fraud and abuse.  For example, these patterns include  farmers, agents, and adjusters linked in irregular behavior that suggests  collusion;  farmers who for several consecutive years received most of their crop  insurance payments from prevented planting claims;  farmers who appear to have claimed the production amounts for multiple  fields as only one field\u2019s yield, thereby creating an artificial loss on their  other fields; and  farmers who, in comparison with their peers, have excessive harvested  losses over many years.", "We compared RMA information with FSA records of crop disaster  payments to identify payments to farmers that RMA identified as receiving  suspicious crop insurance claims payments from 2001 through 2007.", "Specifically, we identified crop disaster payments made to farmers who  RMA identified as receiving suspicious crop insurance payments for at  least 1 year of the crop disaster program under which the farmer received  a disaster payment.

In attempting to determine whether payments exceeded the  statutory cap of 95 percent of the crop\u2019s expected value in the absence of a  disaster, we merged the crop disaster program crop loss records and crop  disaster program payment history records.

We appreciate FSA officials\u2019 cooperation in discussing the agency\u2019s data  systems with us. In April 2009, we visited USDA\u2019s Application  Development Center in Kansas City, Missouri; interviewed officials  responsible for each program file; and requested documentation for all  files used in determining payments under each of the crop disaster  programs. Specifically, in order to understand how FSA\u2019s data systems  operate, we requested 10 items: (1) descriptions of all data elements, (2)  code values for each variable, (3) key required to join the files, (4) system  documentation required to use the data field both within and between  files, (5) business rules, (6) tables showing the relationships between the  various files, (7) data descriptions, (8) state and county codes, (9)  information on how each file is related to the other files, and (10) process  flow charts that should provide system details. FSA provided the first  three items requested but not the remaining seven. Instead, FSA referred  us to handbooks for each of the crop disaster programs, but these  handbooks are standard operating procedures for county office staff to  implement each program and do not take the place of systems  documentation. As late as March 5, 2010, we asked FSA officials about  systems specifications and user requirements for the ad hoc crop disaster  programs and the Supplemental Revenue Assistance Payments Program.  These officials stated that they may not have provided these documents,  but even if they had, the documents for the ad hoc disaster assistance  programs would not be usable for our purposes since they were not  official, and the documents for Supplemental Revenue Assistance  Payments Program are in the initial phases of development. Under these  circumstances, we stand by our statement that FSA officials could not  provide systems documentation, such as specifications and business rules  on how FSA used data in its systems to calculate crop disaster payments.  2. We made these technical changes as appropriate.  3. We recognize that FSA received claims for disaster-related crop losses,  and the funds to pay for these losses, years after these crop losses  occurred. We modified the text to be consistent with our characterization  of FSA payments in the rest of the report.  4. We revised this report to note that FSA inspects fields for practices in  addition to those we discussed in a draft of this report.  5. We do not question FSA\u2019s approval of crop disaster payments. Instead,  we recommend that FSA county officials be notified at the time of crop  insurance claims for these losses so these officials have an opportunity to  verify that crop disaster payment applicants experienced losses because of  an eligible cause. In general, we did not seek to validate individual  applications for crop disaster payments.  6. In this report, we focused on FSA\u2019s crop disaster payments and not on  RMA\u2019s crop insurance claims payments. FSA bases its crop disaster  payments primarily on RMA\u2019s crop insurance data. As we noted in this  report, we found that about 6 percent of FSA\u2019s crop disaster payments  went to farmers who were identified by RMA\u2019s data mining as having  received suspicious crop insurance claims payments during that same  period.  We did not follow up on whether farmers had acted fraudulently  or whether RMA took any actions to obtain refunds of crop insurance  claims payments because these issues were not the focus of this report.   7. We acknowledge that the data systems for the ad hoc crop disaster  programs are complex and include numerous data files. Nonetheless,  reconciling the information in farmers\u2019 disaster applications and their  payments was important in addressing part of our first objective: how FSA  administered its three ad hoc crop disaster programs for crop losses from  2001 through 2007. To this end, in February 2009, we met with FSA  Wharton County, Texas, officials to understand how, within a county  office, the estimated disaster payments were calculated. In April 2009, we  visited USDA\u2019s Application Development Center to discuss the files we  needed, and how the files should be linked to determine how the actual  payments were calculated. At that time, center officials explained that the  system\u2014files and their linkages\u2014was not well documented. On several  occasions, we requested information on the formulas and variables used to  recreate the actual payments, but center officials did not respond to our  requests. Because center officials could not provide us with  documentation for business rules and file specifications (see response to  comment 1), we asked these officials if we could use specific variables\u2014 tax identification number, tax identification type, FSA state code, and FSA  county code\u2014maintained in the history file to determine whether  payments complied with the statutory cap that payments not exceed 95  percent of the crop\u2019s expected value in the absence of the disaster. These  officials noted that this approach should provide the information we  needed. From July 2009 through December 2009, we found discrepancies  in this approach and contacted center officials to gain additional  clarification on this approach. In each case, center officials continued to  confirm that this approach seemed reasonable. In October 2009, we  provided center officials with a list of farmers whose payments appeared  to exceed the statutory cap, resulting in overpayments, but FSA did not  provide comments. In December 2009, we provided FSA headquarters  officials with a more refined list of farmers who appeared to have been  paid in excess of the statutory cap. FSA headquarters officials responded  that they would investigate the farmers on this list. In December 2009,  these officials examined the apparent overpayments, found that the  payments were made correctly, and informed us that the originally agreed  upon approach would not provide us with accurate calculations. Because  we had already invested significant time and resources on the approach  FSA had told us represented a reasonable approach, and because we still  lacked adequate documentation of the system, we used hard copy  payment files for 75 selected farmers in five states to determine if these  farmers\u2019 payments complied with the statutory payment cap. For these 75  farmers, we found that the payments complied with the cap.", "As USDA observes, the system, and its internal coding, used to calculate  payments (and determine compliance with the payment cap) is very  difficult to understand. Although these systems are difficult to understand,  delays in and lack of responses to our questions further complicated our  analyses. We also agree with USDA that eligibility conditions that are not  well documented are very difficult to discern. Finally, although we  requested that all files cover the same time periods, FSA did not provide us  with consistent files.  8. We revised this report to reflect the use of the unharvested payment  factor. As we note, however, even with the use of this factor, farmers may  still have received payments that exceeded their costs of producing these  crops.  9. In response to USDA\u2019s comment that FSA has limited resources for  developing the automated payment system for 2008, we revised this report  to more clearly acknowledge that FSA verifies the data entries.  Furthermore, as we state in this report, FSA officials said that once the  agency fully develops the automated payment system, it plans to validate  and make any necessary adjustments to the payments it calculates and  issues using the interim payment system.  10. We revised this report to recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture  implement procedures so that FSA county officials have timely notice of  crop insurance claims for disaster-related losses."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individual named above, Thomas Cook, Assistant  Director; Kevin Bray; Richard Brown; Arturo Cornejo; Kristin Hughes;  Paula Moore; Carol Herrnstadt Shulman; Kiki Theodoropoulos; and James  W.
