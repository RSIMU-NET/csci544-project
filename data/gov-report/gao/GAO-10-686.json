Modernizing facilities and equipment at shipyards that build Navy ships can lead to improved efficiency, ultimately reducing the cost of constructing ships. In response to a request from the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense, GAO (1) identified investments in facilities and equipment at privately-owned shipyards over the last 10 years; (2) determined the Navy's role in financing facilities and equipment investments at these shipyards; and (3) evaluated how the Navy ensures investments result in expected outcomes. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed shipyard investment data over the past 10 years; interviewed shipyard, corporate, and Navy officials; and reviewed contracts, investment business cases, and other Navy and contractor documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 10 years, large shipyards that build Navy ships used public and corporate funds to invest over $1.9 billion in facilities and equipment to improve efficiency, develop new shipbuilding capabilities, and maintain existing capabilities. Examples of each category include the following: (1) Improving efficiency--General Dynamics Bath Iron Works built a new facility--the Ultra Hall--that improves efficiency by allowing shipbuilders to access work space more easily in a climate-controlled environment. (2) Developing capabilities--Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding-Newport News built a replacement pier that allowed shipbuilders to work on two aircraft carriers simultaneously due to a Navy scheduling conflict. (3) Maintaining capabilities--General Dynamics Electric Boat invested to repair docks in order to maintain the shipyard's ability to launch and repair submarines. Investments at two smaller shipyards, Austal USA and Marinette Marine shipyard, were primarily to maintain and develop new capabilities as both are competing for new Navy contracts. Over the last 10 years, the Navy expanded its use of investment incentives and has recently provided some form of investment support at all large shipyards. To incentivize facility and equipment investments, the Navy has (1) released money early from the reserve of contract funds normally held back to ensure ships are delivered according to specifications, (2) accelerated asset depreciation schedules, (3) tied a portion of the contractor's fee to investing in new facilities and equipment, and (4) adjusted the contract share-line to give the contractor more of the savings if costs decrease. The Navy also manages funds appropriated by Congress for Hurricane Katrina relief at shipyards in the Gulf Coast. Outside of Hurricane Katrina funding, the Navy has not supported investments at the two smaller shipyards. Navy officials stated that the Navy has to negotiate investment incentives with large shipyards because limited competition and instability of Navy work does not foster an environment for shipyards to invest without incentives. Shipyard officials argued that instability in Navy shipbuilding plans makes it difficult to invest without guaranteed work from the Navy and incentives are necessary to help meet corporate minimum rates of return needed to justify an investment, especially given the large dollar amounts involved with some investments. The Navy lacks policy to help ensure it achieves goals and objectives from providing facility and equipment investment incentives at private shipyards. Absent this policy, individual program offices and contracting officers make decisions about what type of incentive to use, desired return on investments, and what kinds of investments to support. Without policy, program officers and contracting officers use different methods to validate expected outcomes and safeguard the Navy's financial support."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Navy develop a policy that identifies the intended goals and objectives of investment incentives, criteria for using incentives, and methods for validating outcomes.

In its fiscal year 2011 long-range plan for  shipbuilding, the Chief of Naval Operations acknowledged that the Navy  faces a serious planning challenge over the next several decades as it  balances legacy ship retirements with the need for multimission platforms  and significantly increased capabilities of current new-construction ships.", "The Department of Defense\u2019s ability to afford the long-range shipbuilding  plan is of importance to both the Navy and privately owned shipyards. The  Navy has repeatedly reshaped and changed this long-range shipbuilding  plan, placing its goal of a 313-ship fleet in jeopardy. In May 2009, we  reported on several best practices used by commercial shipbuilders to  deliver ships on time and within budget that could be adopted by the Navy.  Based on this work, we made several recommendations to the Secretary of  Defense aimed at improving shipbuilding programs including retiring  technical risk and stabilizing design at key points and moving to fixed- price contracts for the first ships built in a class. As the department works  to implement some of these best practices, privately owned shipyards can  also contribute to the overall affordability of ships. One way that shipyards  can contribute is by making capital investments to modernize facilities and  equipment to improve efficiency, which could ultimately decrease the  overall cost of ships by reducing the number of labor hours needed to  build each ship.", "In light of congressional interest in the Navy\u2019s ability to afford its  shipbuilding plan, you asked that we review investments in facilities and  equipment at privately owned shipyards. Specifically, we (1) identified  what investments in facilities and equipment privately owned shipyards  made with both public and corporate funds over the last 10 years; (2)  determined the Navy\u2019s role in financing facilities and equipment  investments at shipyards; and (3) evaluated how the Navy ensures that its  role in facilities and equipment investments at private shipyards results in  expected outcomes.", "To identify facilities and equipment investments over the last 10 years, we  analyzed data on all capital investments over $1 million at the seven  privately owned shipyards that build Navy ships: General Dynamics Bath  Iron Works, General Dynamics NASSCO, General Dynamics Electric Boat,  Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding\u2013Gulf Coast, Northrop Grumman  Shipbuilding\u2013Newport News, Austal USA, and Marinette Marine shipyard.  We supplemented our analysis of the data by interviewing officials at each  shipyard to obtain an understanding of the purpose of these investments.  We then categorized the investments at major shipyards, and shipyard  officials confirmed our categorization of the investments. To assess the  reliability of each shipyard\u2019s data, we interviewed knowledgeable shipyard  officials about the data and confirmed that the data are subject to external  audits. We determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report. To determine the Navy\u2019s role in facilities and  equipment investments at privately owned shipyards, we reviewed  shipbuilding contracts, legislation making funds available for shipyards  affected by Hurricane Katrina, and reports to Congress by the Office of the  Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Ship Programs regarding capital  investment strategies at shipyards. To supplement this analysis, we held  discussions with a number of Navy offices responsible for shipbuilding  programs. To evaluate how the Navy ensures that its role in facilities and  equipment investments results in expected outcomes, we reviewed  shipyard business-case analyses and accompanying documents for Navy- supported projects and analyzed approaches across programs to identify  differences. Appendix I further discusses our scope and methodology.", "We conducted this performance audit from October 2009 to July 2010 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The shipbuilding industry in the United States is predominantly composed  of three different types of shipyards: (1) privately owned shipyards that  build naval vessels; (2) small privately owned shipyards that build  commercial vessels; and (3) U.S. government-owned naval shipyards that  conduct maintenance, repairs, and upgrades on Navy and Coast Guard  vessels. As a result of consolidation, two major corporations\u2014General  Dynamics and Northrop Grumman\u2014own most of the private shipyards  that build Navy ships. General Dynamics owns Bath Iron Works in Bath,  Maine; Electric Boat in Groton, Connecticut, and Quonset Point, Rhode  Island; and NASSCO in San Diego, California. Northrop Grumman owns  Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding\u2013Gulf Coast with locations in Pascagoula,  Mississippi, and New Orleans, Louisiana; and Northrop Grumman  Shipbuilding\u2013Newport News in Virginia. Some of these shipyards maintain  additional support facilities in other locations to assist in production  processes, such as Gulf Coast\u2019s Gulfport, Mississippi facility that  constructs lightweight ship components also known as composites. Along  with these five major shipyards, there are two midsized shipyards that  construct smaller Navy ships. Marinette Marine Corporation in Marinette,  Wisconsin, is owned by the Italian shipbuilder Fincantieri, and Austal USA  in Mobile, Alabama, is owned by Austal, which is headquartered in  Western Australia. Figure 1 shows the location and the current product  lines of each shipyard.", "Several of these shipyards have specialized production capabilities that  constrain and dictate the types of vessels each can build and limit  opportunities for competition within the shipbuilding sector. For instance,  of the five major shipyards, only Newport News is capable of building  nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, and only Newport News and Electric  Boat have facilities for constructing nuclear submarines. Furthermore, of  the five major shipyards, only NASSCO builds commercial ships alongside  Navy ships. It typically builds Navy auxiliary ships, such as the T-AKE  class of dry cargo / ammunition vessels, that share similarities with  commercial ships, and, according to the shipbuilder, production processes  and equipment are shared between the two types of projects.", "When the Navy contracts with these shipyards, it must follow provisions in  the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), which establishes uniform  policies and procedures for acquisition by all executive agencies. In  addition, the Cost Accounting Standards provide uniformity and  consistency in cost accounting practices across government contracts. As  a general policy under the FAR, contractors are usually required to furnish  all facilities and equipment necessary to perform government contracts.  However, in specific situations, including when it is clearly demonstrated  that it is in the government\u2019s best interest or when government  requirements cannot otherwise be met, the government may provide  government property to contractors to perform a contract. For example,  as part of the DDG 1000 destroyer contract, the Navy included a  requirement for Bath Iron Works to purchase unique equipment necessary  to produce the DDG 1000. This equipment was acquired as government  property because the equipment is unique to DDG 1000 construction and  the contractor is unlikely to use it to perform another contract.", "When a contractor furnishes facilities and equipment to perform a  contract, the government recognizes the costs associated with these items  by paying depreciation and facilities capital cost of money costs allocated  to the contract. Depreciation and facilities capital cost of money costs are  indirect contract costs, or costs incurred for the general operation of the  business that are not specifically applicable to one product line or  contract. The FAR, in conjunction with the Cost Accounting Standards,  includes provisions for how a contractor recovers costs such as  depreciation and facilities capital cost of money as part of indirect  contract costs allocated to government contracts. By recovering  depreciation costs, the contractor recoups the cost of an asset\u2014a facility  or a piece of equipment\u2014over the asset\u2019s estimated useful life. Facilities  capital cost of money acknowledges the opportunity cost for a contractor  when it uses its funds to invest in facilities and equipment in lieu of other  investments such as relatively risk-free bonds. Facilities capital cost of  money is determined by multiplying the net book value of the contractor\u2019s  capital assets by a cost-of-money rate, which is a rate tied to the U.S.  treasury rate.", "With respect to Navy shipbuilding, a shipyard\u2019s indirect costs, including  depreciation and facilities capital cost of money, are allocated to the  Navy\u2019s shipbuilding contracts at the shipyard in accordance with the Cost  Accounting Standards. When a shipyard makes facilities and equipment  investments, all ships under contract during the life of those assets are  allocated a portion of the assets\u2019 indirect costs. Therefore, if the number of  ships under construction at a given time in a shipyard increases, the  indirect costs per ship decrease, and if the number of ships under  construction at a given time in a shipyard decreases, the indirect costs per  ship increase."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Private Shipyards Made Investments to Improve, Upgrade, and Maintain Facilities and Equipment over the Last 10 Years", "paragraphs": ["Over the last 10 years, major shipyards used public and corporate funds to  invest more than $1.9 billion in facilities and equipment that improved  shipbuilding efficiency, developed new capabilities, and maintained  existing capabilities. Figure 2 shows the amount of money invested in each  category.", "These categories are defined as follows:  Improving shipbuilding efficiency. Investments in improving  shipbuilding efficiency generally reduce the number of hours shipbuilders  spend on a given task, and often allow shipbuilders to reorder the  sequence of shipbuilding work to achieve new efficiencies. For example,  investments in improving efficiency can make it possible for shipbuilders  to complete more work in specially-designed workshops and modular  assembly buildings, thus having to complete less of the work later on in  the shipbuilding process inside the more constrained environments of  almost-completed areas of the ship. To illustrate how these investments  improve efficiency, shipyard officials often describe the \u201c1-3-8 rule of  thumb\u201d of shipbuilding work: work that takes 1 hour to complete in a  workshop, takes 3 hours to complete once the steel panels have been  welded into units (sometimes called modules), and 8 hours to complete  after a block has been erected or after the ship has been launched. For  example, inside the recently-constructed Ultra Hall at Bath Iron Works,  shipbuilders can now access work spaces more easily in a climate- controlled environment allowing them to finish units at a higher stage of  completion before they are erected and then moved into the water. Figure  water. Figure  3 is a photo of a unit being moved out of the Ultra Hall.  3 is a photo of a unit being moved out of the Ultra Hall.", "Developing new capabilities. Shipyards make investments to develop new  capabilities so that they can complete new types of tasks. In some cases,  shipyards need these new capabilities to meet the Navy\u2019s technical  requirements for new ships. For example, to build a newly-designed  aircraft carrier with heavier metal plate requirements than those of  previous aircraft carriers, Newport News invested in new facilities and  equipment. These investments included building a heavy-plate facility, and  upgrading a crane to make it capable of lifting heavier modules. Other  shipyards also identified purchasing cranes as examples of investments to  develop new capabilities.", "Maintaining capabilities. From time to time, shipyards make major  investments to replace or repair facilities and equipment. This allows the  shipyards to maintain existing capabilities for years or decades. For  example, Electric Boat officials explained that its shipyard had to make a  major investment in dock repair in order to maintain the shipyard\u2019s ability  to launch and repair submarines.", "Through investments to improve efficiencies and develop new capabilities,  major shipyards modernized their facilities and equipment, thus  transforming their shipbuilding processes. Some of these investments  completely changed the physical layouts of shipyards. For example, Bath  Iron Works completed a Land Level Transfer Facility in 2001, replacing an  inclined-way transfer facility used since 1890. Bath Iron Works officials  explained that with the Land Level Transfer Facility, the shipyard now has  the capability to construct ships in larger, more fully outfitted units on any  one of three construction lanes. The shipyard also has a floating dry dock  that it can move to any of the three construction lanes to transfer the ship  into the water. With this arrangement, the shipyard can better manage  when a ship is ready to be moved to the water. Another example includes  NASSCO\u2019s facility expansion project, which fundamentally changed the  layout of the shipyard to increase production capacity, throughput, and  efficiency. In particular, NASSCO added new production lanes to reduce  shipyard congestion, allowing builders to move units around the shipyard  with reduced bottlenecks, and added a modern blast and paint facility to  improve paint process efficiency while reducing emissions. Finally,  Newport News built a new pier, thus increasing its capacity for servicing  and completing construction of aircraft carriers.", "Table 1 shows selected investments at each major shipyard, sometimes  funded through public or corporate funds, over the last 10 years. These  selected investments highlight examples of projects by investment  category as well as the magnitude of some investments at shipyards.", "Two midsized shipyards, Austal USA and Marinette Marine Corporation,  started construction of two different designs of the Littoral Combat Ship  for the Navy in 2005, and their investments have focused primarily on  maintaining shipyard capabilities and developing new capabilities in order  to compete for Navy contracts. Austal USA used both public and corporate  money to complete investments of approximately $155 million in facilities  and equipment since 1999, and Austal USA officials said these investments  were mostly to develop new capabilities to compete for Navy business.  For example, Austal USA officials said that to develop the capacity to  work on new Navy ships, their shipyard invested approximately $85  million to build the Modular Manufacturing Facility. Shipyard officials said  that with this facility, the yard constructs ships in a modular fashion to  maximize productivity, efficiency, and throughput. Marinette Marine  Corporation officials stated that investments over the last 10 years have  largely been to maintain capabilities, but the shipyard\u2019s new owner,  Fincantieri, plans to make significant investments in the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Supports Facilities and Equipment Investments by Offering Incentives at Most Major Shipyards and Has Expanded This Support over the Last 10 Years", "paragraphs": ["To incentivize investments, the Navy has provided support to most major  shipyards with four mechanisms: early release of contract retentions,  accelerated depreciation, special contract-incentive fees, and contract  share-line adjustments. However, the Navy has not incentivized  investments at the two midsized shipyards. Navy officials cited the lack of  competition and instability of Navy work in shipbuilding as major reasons  why the Navy needs to incentivize investments in facilities and equipment  at major shipyards. At the shipyards, officials argued that they cannot  secure corporate support for many investments without Navy incentives.  Shipyard officials also pointed to instability in the Navy\u2019s long-range  shipbuilding plans as a reason their shipyards usually do not pursue  investments without Navy support. Over the last 10 years, the Navy has  expanded its use of investment incentives and is now involved with  providing some form of investment support at all major shipyards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Navy Negotiated Facilities and Equipment Incentives with Most Major Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has provided support to most major shipyards with four types of  investment incentives: early release of contract retentions, accelerated  depreciation, special contract-incentive fees, and share-line adjustment.", "Early release of contract retentions. By releasing contract retentions  early, the Navy disburses money to a shipyard earlier than scheduled from  a reserve normally retained to ensure ships are delivered according to  specifications. For example, instead of holding 3.75 percent of the contract  payments in retentions, the Navy might hold only 1.5 percent of the  contract payments, releasing the remaining 2.25 percent early to a  shipyard in exchange for the shipyard investing in facilities or equipment.  Navy officials said that with this incentive, the Navy does not provide  additional funds to the shipyard, but rather provides funds to the  contractor it would receive anyway upon successful completion of the  contract. Shipbuilders said the early release of contract retentions  provides funds with which the shipyard can make investments that it  might otherwise not be able to make. The early release of contract  retentions may fund the entire capital investment or a portion of the  investment.", "Accelerated depreciation. When accelerating depreciation, the Navy pays  the shipyard higher payments for depreciation of an asset over a shortened  timeline than under a normal depreciation payment schedule. In exchange,  the shipyard agrees to fund the investment. This benefits the shipyard  because it recoups its investment faster than it would have under a normal  depreciation schedule. For example, if a shipyard asset has a useful life of  9 years, the shipyard recoups a portion of the investment each year over  that span. However, if an incentive agreement accelerated the depreciation  schedule, the shipyard would receive larger payments earlier and over  fewer years. Navy and shipbuilding officials explained that this kind of  incentive can help bridge a gap between an investment\u2019s expected rate of  return and the corporation\u2019s desired rate of return to help justify making  an investment. See table 2 for a comparison of normal and accelerated  straight-line depreciation.", "Special contract-incentive fee. While incentive fees are used in contracts  across the Department of Defense generally to motivate contractor efforts,  the Navy also uses special contract-incentive fees to specifically  encourage investments in facilities and equipment. On a contract that  includes such a special incentive fee, a shipyard may earn a fee for making  an investment. This special fee is available to the shipyard only if it agrees  to make a Navy-approved investment. The special fee may pay for all or  part of the investment. In some cases, the incentive bridges the difference  between the corporation\u2019s desired rate of return and the projected return  on an investment.", "Contract Share-Line Adjustment. The contract share-line defines what  share of underruns or overruns will accrue to the contractor and the Navy.  By adjusting the contract share-line ratio, the Navy can incentivize a  contractor to invest in facilities or equipment that will reduce costs. For  example, during original contract negotiations for a fixed-price incentive  or cost-plus incentive contract, the two parties may agree to an even share  of the savings if the total negotiated or allowable cost ends up being less  than the total target cost. Through a contract modification, the Navy could  change the original sharing ratio so that more of the savings are given to  the contractor. Under this modification, the contractor is incentivized to  invest in a facility or equipment that may reduce costs so that it earns a  higher fee. The Navy will benefit from these lower costs on all future  contracts. See figure 4 for an example of a share line adjustment.", "The Navy also manages Hurricane Katrina relief funds, which Congress  appropriated for infrastructure improvements at shipyards that build Navy  ships in states affected by Hurricane Katrina. This support differs from  incentive programs at other shipyards because it is direct federal funding  and is not tied to a specific Navy shipbuilding program. These funds were  not directed to repairing specific damage from the hurricane, but can be  used for a variety of projects at eligible shipyards.", "Table 3 provides an overview of investment incentive mechanisms and  how the Navy has used each incentive to support investments at shipyards.  Appendix II includes additional details of the investment incentives at  each shipyard.", "The Navy has not negotiated investment incentives at the two midsized  shipyards, Austal USA and Marinette Marine Corporation, which are both  competing for the Littoral Combat Ship contract, though both received  other forms of federal government support for facilities and equipment  investments. Both shipyards received grants from the U.S. Department of  Transportation\u2019s Maritime Administration, which are available to small  shipyards for capital and related improvements that foster efficiency and  competitive operations. For example, Marinette Marine Corporation  officials said that their shipyard received $1.4 million to help finance  investments for new cranes. In addition, Austal received almost $34  million of federal Hurricane Katrina funds to help finance its Modular  Manufacturing Facility. Both midsized shipyards have plans for further  expansions, but as of now, neither shipyard plans to request Navy  investment incentives to execute these plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Incentives May Encourage Major Shipyards to Make Facilities and Equipment Investments That They Might Not Make on Their Own", "paragraphs": ["Navy officials, shipyard officials, and corporate officials from Northrop  Grumman and General Dynamics provided different perspectives on  reasons for using incentives to encourage investment in the Navy  shipbuilding market.", "Navy officials told us that the Navy negotiates investment incentives with  major shipyards because limited competition in the market does not foster  an environment that encourages shipyards to invest without incentives.  For example, Newport News is the only shipyard capable of building  aircraft carriers. A Navy contracting officer said that, as a result, there may  be a disincentive for Newport News to invest in projects that improve  efficiency. Generally speaking, at contract negotiation, the government\u2019s  proposed contractor fee is based on a percentage of total estimated  allowable contract costs, with the percentage reflecting various weighted  risk factors. Newport News, as a sole supplier, will likely construct all  future aircraft carriers but could earn a lower fee if new efficiencies  reduce the total cost of construction. Even in cases where there is  limited shipbuilding competition, such as with surface combatants,  shipyards may face similar disincentives to invest. If the shipyard invests  to improve efficiency, these investments will likely reduce the price of a  ship and can lower future profits. However, where some competition  exists, better efficiency may lead to winning a greater allocation of future  work. Navy officials added that shipyards that are not confident Navy  work will materialize or be funded as scheduled are reluctant to make  capital investments without government incentives.", "Officials from major shipyards argued that instability in long-range Navy  shipbuilding plans discourages shipyards from making investments  without guaranteed Navy work. Because major shipyards generally do not  perform commercial work, there are few other inducements to invest in  new facilities and equipment other than Navy shipbuilding opportunities.  For example, at one shipyard, an official explained that it had invested in a  facility in anticipation of an upcoming contract. The Navy changed the  shipbuilding program and did not award the contract, rendering this  facility underutilized until receipt of another contract several years later.  The official emphasized that this shipyard will never invest again in new  facilities without a signed contract guaranteeing future work. The official  added that to do otherwise would not be a prudent business decision.", "Officials from major shipyards also argued that their shipyards need Navy  incentives because many potential investments in facilities and equipment  do not meet the corporation\u2019s desired rate of return. In addition, some  shipyard officials stated that since they cannot secure corporate  investments for many projects, they often looked first for state or federal  support for new investments to help to bridge the gap between their  corporation\u2019s desired rate of return and the expected rate of return of the  investment.", "Corporate officials argued that the low rates of shipbuilding production,  low shipbuilding fees relative to invested capital, and length of time it  takes to build a ship sometimes mean investments take too long to  generate an acceptable return, or will never generate an acceptable return.  Moreover, officials stated that shipyard investments are large, sometimes  exceeding $25 million for a single investment. Furthermore, other sectors  of these corporations are often better positioned than shipyards to  propose investments that achieve the corporation\u2019s desired rate of return  because these sectors can use less expensive investments to improve  processes for high-volume products. Corporate officials agreed that  corporations would generally make investments in maintaining  capabilities without meeting a corporation\u2019s desired rate of return because  these investments are necessary to stay in business."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Increased Support for Investments at Major Shipyards over the Past 10 Years, Generally by Expanding the Use of Investment Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 10 years, the Navy has moved from providing onetime  support of major capital investments to more routine support of  investment spending at all five major shipyards. In 2000, Bath Iron Works  was in the process of completing construction of its Land Level Transfer  Facility, which was an investment that the Navy incentivized through early  release of contract retentions. Since then, the Navy has used investment  incentives to facilitate facilities and equipment investments at four of the  five major shipyards, across multiple shipbuilding programs. At the fifth  major shipyard, Gulf Coast, the Navy administered Hurricane Katrina  recovery money to support investments. Since 2007, the Navy has actively  supported investments at all major shipyards with investment incentives  or Hurricane Katrina recovery funding. Figure 5 shows the Navy\u2019s  expanded support to private shipyards over the last 10 years.", "Senior-level Navy officials stated that negotiating facilities and equipment  incentives are becoming a routine part of contract negotiations, but  officials expressed different opinions over which mechanisms are most  useful. While the Navy has used early release of retentions and accelerated  depreciation throughout the past 10 years, it has recently started to  negotiate special contract-incentive fees during contract negotiation as a  part of its cost-control strategy, such as during the Virginia-class  submarine Block II and Block III contract negotiations. Senior-level Navy  officials have differing views on whether it is better to include incentives  as part of a contract or to negotiate after the Navy awards a contract. One  contracting officer observed that the length of time involved in obtaining  the required Cost Accounting Standards Board waiver for accelerated  depreciation may have led officials to pursue other investment incentives.", "Potential exists that contractors may ask the Navy and other services to  expand the scope of current incentive activities. Shipyards have already  started to request incentives for a variety of projects outside of  investments in facilities and equipment, and a shipyard recently requested  funding assistance for lean six-sigma process-improvement training. In  addition, the T-AKE contract includes a cost-reduction initiative in which  the Navy paid for projects that reduced costs through design and  producibility improvements, but did not require new investments in  facilities or equipment.

This results in differences in  expected outcomes across investment mechanisms. Table 4 highlights  variations in the types of expected outcomes with examples by shipyard,  investment, and investment mechanism. Given the variation in the  expected outcomes, it is difficult to ascertain if the Navy has a minimum  return it expects to receive by providing financial support or if just any  return is sufficient. the Contractor shall be eligible to receive a special incentive based upon the Contractor  and/or Major Subcontractor Newport News Shipbuilding investing in such projects that  result in savings to the Government for the submarines under this contract and long term  savings to the Government for the Virginia Class submarine program.", "As a result of this contract language, the contractors are not required to  include return on investment calculations, calculate the net present value  of savings on future submarines, or consider the share-line ratio to  calculate actual savings to the government. Reviewing officials stated that  even when contractors included return-on-investment calculations in the  business cases, the officials did not review it because such calculations  were not required in the contract language. The contracting officer  responsible for managing Virginia-class submarine CAPEX stated that this  contract language is too vague concerning when to approve or disapprove  a project based on estimated savings, and if a similar incentive is used  again, the contract should include criteria for when to approve or  disapprove a project. To illustrate, the contracting officer stated that a  contractor submitted a business case under Block II CAPEX for a project  expected to cost $4 million with $10,000 in expected savings on Block II  submarines and additional saving accruing on future submarines beyond  Block II. The contracting officer stated that the Navy did not approve the  project because the expected savings on Block II were so low, but such a  decision was difficult to support based on the contract language.", "Individual program offices and contracting officers also make decisions  about which types of investments to pursue, without any policy from the  Navy about the kinds of investments that are in its best interest. Most of  the investments the Navy supported fall into the category of improving  efficiency at the shipyards. Some of the more recent investments,  however, could also be considered as maintaining or developing  capabilities at the shipyards. It is unclear whether or not the Navy has  determined that these investments are in fact in its best interest. For  example, according to officials, the Virginia-class submarine Block II and  Block III clauses do not prohibit approving maintenance projects as long  as these projects generate cost savings. In 2009, the Navy paid a special  contract-incentive fee to Electric Boat to refurbish equipment past its  normal service life in order to prevent major failures that would result in  an injury or equipment damage and affect production schedules. In a  similar manner, Newport News submitted a business case to receive a  special contract-incentive fee to support repairs to its foundry, stating that  near-term investment was necessary because the average age of most of  the equipment is well past its average useful service life and at a high risk  of mechanical failure. The Navy did not approve this business case under  the Block II special contract incentive fee because Newport News was  unable to demonstrate savings on the Block II submarines, a stipulation in  the contract language. However, the Navy encouraged the shipyard to  resubmit the proposal if it could demonstrate savings on future submarine  construction. Such investments to maintain capabilities are likely to  generate some cost savings and may better position the shipyards to  increase submarine production rates, but some officials indicated that  such investments should actually be contractor responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Navy Has Not Considered the Extent to Which Investment Incentives Affect Indirect Costs at Shipyards", "paragraphs": ["The Navy also lacks policy on how to determine an incentivized  investment\u2019s effect on indirect costs to the Navy. As the Navy is  incentivizing investments up front, it is unclear whether contractors  should be able to recover indirect costs associated with these assets  through depreciation and facilities capital cost of money. While the Navy  did not allow the contractor to recover depreciation and facilities capital  cost of money for investments supported with Hurricane Katrina funds,  some agreements explicitly provide that the contractor can recover costs  for incentivized facilities and equipment investments. However, Defense  Contract Audit Agency officials questioned a facilities capital cost of  money claim that one shipyard included in its indirect costs because the  Navy provided an incentive to construct the facility. Nonetheless, officials  concluded that the contractor could recover these costs from the Navy  because it was unclear in the terms of the contract, and neither the  Federal Acquisition Regulation nor the Cost Accounting Standards address  recovery of facilities capital cost of money for facilities receiving incentive  support. Defense Contract Audit Agency officials stated that they believe it  is unfair that contractors can recover facilities capital cost of money costs  on incentivized facilities and this issue needs to be reevaluated if the Navy  continues to incentivize investments.", "In instances where the incentive agreement explicitly states that the  contractor can recover these long-term costs, officials evaluating business  cases stated that they do not always consider these long-term costs when  comparing the cost of the project with potential savings.

Some investment incentives require validation of anticipated  savings whereas others only require a validation of project construction  milestones. For example, officials described a lengthy review of savings  validation associated with the first Virginia-class submarine CAPEX Block  II project, but later indicated the process has evolved over time and other  validations have been more straightforward. According to Navy officials  managing the Virginia-class CAPEX incentive, the contract provides little  guidance on how to validate outcomes, so program officials developed the  current validation process after the contract was signed. However, the  CVN 21 program office did not validate anticipated savings after  investments were complete, but validated investments based on  construction milestones. Because the Navy negotiated a lower target cost  for the future carrier, Navy officials stated that it is not necessary to  validate the savings associated with these projects. These officials added  that it would be difficult to calculate an accurate baseline against which to  compare labor hours with and without the new investments because the  new carrier had never been constructed.", "In the absence of a Navy policy, program and contracting officials also  negotiate various methods to safeguard the Navy\u2019s financial interest in the  event that expected outcomes for the investment incentive are not  achieved. The range of methods is seen in table 5.", "In addition to variation in the types of safeguards used across incentive  mechanisms, the Navy has used the same investment mechanism\u2014early  release of contract retentions\u2014for two different programs, but the  safeguarding mechanism differed. The Navy modified the terms of the  DDG 51 contract by negotiating changes to target price as a safeguard  when it agreed to support the Ultra Hall investment through early release  of contract retentions and payment of a special contract-incentive fee. In  comparison, when the Navy agreed to an early release of contract  retentions to support the facilities expansion project at NASSCO, program  officials stated that the Navy did not renegotiate the terms of the T-AKE  contract. In both instances, officials stated that the maturity of the DDG 51  and T-AKE programs were factors in deciding to release contract  retentions early; the Navy awarded Bath Iron Works the first DDG 51  destroyer contract in 1985 and NASSCO started construction of the T-AKE  class in 2003."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 10 years, the Navy has expanded the use of investment  incentives to encourage shipyards to make investments that may reduce  costs of future ships.

However, the Navy has yet to do this, and the  absence of policy leaves the overall goals and intended outcomes of this  support unclear. Decisions about when a particular incentive should be  chosen, what returns are acceptable across programs, and what types of  investments the Navy should support are made on a case-by-case basis  without guidance. Also, it is unclear whether or not contractors should be  able to claim recovery for certain indirect costs related to assets  supported by incentive mechanisms.
