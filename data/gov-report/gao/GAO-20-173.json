Additionally, DRL officials said that embassy  officials have at least four opportunities to provide official input during the  approximately 18-month process of designing and awarding a project.

Embassy officials also said that, although DRL sought their  input during the process of selecting proposed democracy assistance  projects, DRL did not subsequently communicate its final selection of  projects. DRL officials said that sharing complete information can be  difficult because of the sensitivity of some DRL projects and the need to  safeguard the identities of some local partners.", "In addition, DRL officials said that managing projects from Washington,  D.C., instead of overseas may affect their ability to collaborate with  embassy officials. DRL officials commented that embassy personnel\u2019s  colocation facilitates their collaborating with one another and that the  political and other State officers who may function as in-country DRL  points of contact have numerous other duties, with limited capacity to  focus on DRL projects. DRL officials also said that frequent turnover  among State personnel makes it challenging to maintain embassy  officials\u2019 awareness of DRL\u2019s in-country projects.

DRL and other State officials said  that embassy personnel may not be able to use State\u2019s data systems to  retrieve information on projects, partly because some personnel lack  sufficient training or the permissions to access project data in certain  systems. Furthermore, the Office of Management and Budget has found  the quality of State\u2019s publicly reported data to be low in terms of  completeness and accuracy. State\u2019s Office of Inspector General found  that, while State has standardized and centralized its foreign assistance  budget planning and request processes, State\u2019s inability to provide  authoritative foreign assistance financial information is a program  management challenge.
