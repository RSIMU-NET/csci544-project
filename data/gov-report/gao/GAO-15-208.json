The number of Medicaid enrollees with private health insurance is expected to increase with the expansion of Medicaid.", "Selected states reported taking various steps to address challenges to ensuring that Medicaid is the payer of last resort and acknowledged recent Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) support, while also suggesting additional federal action. Four of the eight reviewed states reported various initiatives to improve coverage identification, such as arranging to participate in a data registry that allows participants to identify individuals with overlapping coverage. CMS has taken steps to issue TPL guidance and share some information on effective state practices, and such federal efforts should be ongoing to ensure that evolving approaches are captured and shared across states. In addition, officials in five states reported that enrollees with third-party coverage may be eligible to enroll in Medicaid managed care\u2014in which states contract with health plans to provide services to enrollees and may delegate TPL activities such as payment recoveries to these plans. One of the five states had initiated a program to oversee plans' TPL recoveries, while other states did not report similar oversight.

A 2013 Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)  Office of Inspector General (OIG) report indicated that states identified  about $13.6 billion in combined federal-state cost savings from private  health insurers in 2011, compared to about $3.7 billion in 2001\u2014with  states largely crediting increased cost savings to enhanced use of  available technology to identify Medicaid enrollees with other insurance.  However, the report also found that states commonly face challenges to  their TPL efforts, such as health insurers refusing to provide coverage  information to states or denying liability for procedural reasons, that pose  potential barriers to realizing cost savings. Furthermore, state Medicaid  agencies face administrative capacity constraints that may limit their  ability to go beyond basic program requirements to further improve cost  savings.", "Given the PPACA Medicaid expansion and the importance of ensuring  that Medicaid appropriately pays only after other liable third parties have  done so, you asked us to examine the prevalence of private sources of  health insurance among Medicaid enrollees, and state and Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) efforts to ensure that Medicaid is  the payer of last resort. In this report, we examine (1) the extent to which  Medicaid enrollees have private health insurance and (2) state and CMS  initiatives to improve TPL efforts.", "To examine the extent to which Medicaid enrollees have private health  insurance, we analyzed 2012 data\u2014the most recent data available at the  time we conducted the work\u2014from the American Community Survey  (ACS), a nationally representative annual survey conducted by the U.S.  Census Bureau. The ACS collects self-reported information, such as each  individual\u2019s type of health coverage (if any) as of the date of the survey,  disability status, age, and state of residence. For the ACS question  regarding each individual\u2019s type of health coverage, Medicaid is grouped  with other types of means-tested public coverage as a single response  option. Therefore, for purposes of the report, we refer to these groups  collectively as Medicaid enrollees. We further divided Medicaid enrollees  into four broad Medicaid eligibility categories\u2014children, adults, disabled,  and aged. For all Medicaid enrollees, and for each Medicaid eligibility  category, we estimated the number and percentage with private health  insurance and other sources of health coverage. We defined individuals  as having private health insurance if they reported health insurance  provided through an employer or union, or health insurance purchased  individually. Unless noted otherwise, estimates presented in this report  have a relative standard error of less than 15 percent. To determine the  reliability of the ACS data, we reviewed related documentation and  compared our results to other published estimates and determined that  the ACS data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. (A more detailed  description of our methodology is provided in app. I.)", "To examine CMS and state initiatives to improve TPL efforts, we  reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and related documents, and  interviewed officials from CMS and a sample of 8 states. To select the  sample of states, we began by identifying states that: (1) were among the  top 15 states with respect to either Medicaid enrollment or spending; and  (2) used capitated managed care\u2014in which states pay health plans a  monthly fee per Medicaid enrollee in exchange for services provided\u2014 to  deliver services to some or all Medicaid enrollees. We then reviewed challenges states reported in the 2013 HHS OIG report and obtained  input from federal officials and stakeholders about related state legislation  or practices and selected 8 of these states to include in our review:  Georgia, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Ohio,  and Washington. In several cases, officials in these states asked the  contractor responsible for aspects of TPL work in their state to respond to  our questions or included contractor representatives in the interviews. To  supplement information from the selected states, we also interviewed or  reviewed information provided by representatives of HMS\u2014a firm that  conducts various TPL services on behalf of over 30 states and about 160  Medicaid managed care plans\u2014national associations representing  Medicaid directors and Medicaid managed care plans, and other  stakeholders.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2013 through  January 2015 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

Individuals age 65 and older may receive  private coverage from a former employer or purchase such coverage to  supplement their Medicare coverage.

Coverage identification. To identify enrollees with third-party health  coverage, states are required to request coverage information from  potential Medicaid enrollees at the time of any determination or  redetermination of eligibility for Medicaid. States are also required to  obtain and use information pertaining to third-party liability, for  example by conducting data matches with state wage information  agencies, Social Security Administration wage and earning files, state  motor vehicle accident report files, or state workers compensation  files.  2.  Coverage verification. When other health coverage is identified,  states need to verify the information, including the services covered  through the other insurance and the dates of eligibility.  3.  Cost avoidance. Cost avoidance occurs when states do not pay  providers for services until any other coverage has paid to the extent  of its liability, rather than paying up front and recovering costs later.  After a state has verified other coverage, it must generally seek to  ensure that health care providers\u2019 claims are directed to the  responsible party.of the cost savings associated with third-party liability.", "The cost-avoidance process accounts for the bulk  4.  Payment recovery. When states have already paid providers for  submitted claims for which a third party is liable, they must seek  reimbursement from the third party, if it is cost effective to do so.", "States have flexibility in determining specific approaches to achieve these  ends. For example, states are increasingly contracting with managed care  plans to deliver services to Medicaid enrollees (such plans are hereafter  referred to as Medicaid managed care plans), and may delegate TPL  responsibilities to such plans. Both states and Medicaid managed care  plans may obtain the services of a contractor to identify third-party  coverage by conducting electronic data matches and to conduct other  TPL responsibilities, such as payment recovery.", "Ensuring compliance with Medicaid TPL requirements has long been  challenging for states. The McCarran-Ferguson Act affirms the authority  of states to regulate the business of insurance in the state, without  interference from federal regulation, unless federal law specifically  provides otherwise. Thus, states generally regulate private health  insurers operating in the state. However, states may not have authority  over private insurers that are not licensed to do business in the state but  still provide coverage to state residents. For example, some individuals  work and receive health insurance through employment in one state but  live in a neighboring state. In addition, states are preempted by the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) from  regulating employer-sponsored health benefit plans that self-insure  coverage rather than purchase coverage from an insurer.", "Due to the bifurcated nature of private health insurance regulation, both  federal and state legislation has been required to allow states to enforce  TPL requirements. For example, the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act  of 1993 required all states to enact laws prohibiting insurers from taking  Medicaid status into account in enrollment or payment for benefits and to  enact laws giving the state rights to payments by liable third parties. In addition, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (DRA) contained provisions  affecting state authority to verify coverage and recoup payments from  liable health insurers. Under the DRA, states must attest that they have  laws in place to require health insurers to, among other requirements,  provide information necessary to identify Medicaid enrollees with third- party coverage and, within specified time limits, respond to inquiries from  the state regarding claims, as well as to agree not to deny claims solely  because of the date the claim was submitted, the form that was used, or  the failure to properly document coverage at the point of service.", "The 2013 HHS OIG report on TPL cost savings and challenges  concluded that the DRA provisions likely had a positive effect on states\u2019  ability to avoid costs and recover payments from private health insurers,  in part through improvements in states\u2019 identification of enrollees with  insurance.

Four of the eight selected states  reported initiatives underway or completed to improve data-matching  strategies to identify private coverage, some of which focused on  nationally coordinated approaches. For example, Minnesota officials  reported that Minnesota law allows the state Medicaid agency and  Medicaid managed care plans to participate in a national coverage data  registry, launched in late 2013 by CAQH, an association of health plans  and trade associations. The data registry allows participating insurers  and states to submit coverage data files for comparison with files of other  participants in order to identify individuals with overlapping coverage.

Substantial  increases in TPL cost savings in recent years highlight that improvements  to TPL efforts, such as heightened attention to coverage identification,  can substantially improve TPL cost avoidance and recoveries. The scale  of the cost savings to Medicaid at both federal and state levels through  the identification of coverage through, and payment of services by, private  health insurance\u2014reportedly nearly $14 billion in 2011\u2014underscores the  potentially significant return on investment that may be gained from  continued TPL improvement efforts and attention to resolving remaining  gaps in state access to available coverage data.", "Selected states have taken a variety of steps to further improve TPL  efforts, and other states may also be implementing initiatives to address  persistent challenges states report in ensuring Medicaid pays after other  liable third parties.

Given the  significant federal Medicaid outlays, which are increasing as Medicaid  expands under PPACA, the federal government has a vested financial  interest in further increasing states\u2019 TPL cost savings, and CMS should  play a more active leadership role in monitoring, understanding,  supporting and promoting state TPL efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["In light of the federal interest in ensuring that Medicaid should pay only  after other liable third parties; state initiatives to improve TPL efforts, such  as coverage identification strategies; and states\u2019 increasing use of  managed care, we recommend that the Secretary of Health and Human  Services direct CMS to take the following two additional actions to  oversee and support state TPL efforts:", "Routinely monitor and share across all states information regarding  key TPL efforts and challenges.", "Provide guidance to states on their oversight of TPL efforts conducted  by Medicaid managed care plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for comment.

A relative standard error is calculated by  dividing the standard error of the estimate by the estimate itself. For  example, if an estimate has a mean of 100 and a standard error of 20, the  relative standard error would be 20/100, which would be 20 percent.  Estimates with small relative standard errors are considered more reliable  than estimates with large relative standard errors.
