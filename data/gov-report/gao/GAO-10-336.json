NHTSA redesigned CAFE standards for light trucks for model years 2008 through 2011, and some experts raised questions about the rigor of the computer modeling NHTSA used to develop these standards.

The standards are based on vehicle size and will cover model years 2012 to 2016. However, differences between the standards still exist because of variation in the legal authorities of each agency. For example, certain flexibility mechanisms designed to reduce compliance costs for manufacturers apply only to GHG standards, which could make aligning them with CAFE standards more difficult. However, potentially stricter penalties for GHG standard noncompliance could improve compliance with CAFE standards. Also, while NHTSA and EPA expect benefits from adopting a standard based on vehicle size, neither standard has a mechanism to ensure that a specific national target will be met. NHTSA and EPA are collaborating by sharing resources and expertise to jointly set CAFE and GHG standards. From fiscal years 1996 through 2001, NHTSA was barred from using appropriated funds to raise CAFE standards. In contrast, EPA has continually expanded its automotive engineering expertise, including at its vehicle testing lab. As a result, EPA was able to contribute several original research studies to the proposed joint standards. Because this collaboration is not formally required and the agencies are not documenting the processes used--a recognized best practice--they may not be able to replicate them in the future. To set the proposed standards, NHTSA improved upon the computer model compared to the version used that had been used to set the CAFE standards for 2008 through 2011 light trucks. One improvement was that NHTSA increased the model's transparency by using publicly available, rather than confidential, data to develop a baseline fleet of vehicles. With EPA's input, NHTSA updated several data inputs such as technology costs and the cost of emissions. While experts GAO interviewed had varying critiques of NHTSA's model, there was no consensus on how NHTSA could further improve it. In particular, experts' opinions differed sharply on two studies, which reported opposing findings concerning the relationship between vehicle weight (a key factor in determining fuel consumption) and safety--suggesting that additional research may be warranted. In part due to resource and data constraints, NHTSA has not yet evaluated its 2008 through 2011 light truck CAFE standards, which have a similar design to the new standards. Retrospective analyses of efforts and data inputs could inform NHTSA on the extent to which the standards met goals and provide means to improve the process of setting standards. Lacking such analysis, NHTSA does not know whether goals of the standards have been met or if changes are needed to the program. NHTSA officials said that while they would like to conduct such analyses, limited resources and time have prevented them from doing so, and they have no definitive plans to conduct them in the future."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In May 2009, the U.S. administration announced the National Fuel  Efficiency Policy relating to cars and light trucks, which beginning in 2012,  would not only increase corporate average fuel economy (CAFE)  standards but also establish for the first time greenhouse gas (GHG)  emissions standards. According to the administration, this effort will help  to accomplish several goals. First, by helping to reduce oil consumption,  CAFE standards could decrease the level of oil imports, in turn decreasing  both the nation\u2019s economic vulnerability to oil price shocks and the trade  deficit. Second, the administration intends for CAFE standards and GHG  emissions standards to begin addressing global climate change by  reducing emissions of GHGs such as carbon dioxide from the sector of the  economy that has long been the fastest-growing source of these  emissions\u2014mobile sources like cars and trucks.

Given the nation\u2019s current economic challenges, it is imperative that  in the course of setting new standards, agencies estimate as accurately as  possible the benefits and costs the standards will impose on industry and  consumers\u2014as the standards are in part based on estimates of these costs  and benefits. For example, if costs to consumers from increased standards  are underestimated, then the standards might be too stringent, leading to  high costs imposed on consumers without adequate benefits. The  stringency of these standards\u2014a key factor in generating costs to the  industry and consumers\u2014depends in part on analysis conducted by the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), the agency  responsible for regulating CAFE standards, and the Environmental  Protection Agency (EPA), the agency responsible for regulating GHG  emissions standards. Experts raised questions in 2006 when NHTSA set  new CAFE standards for model year 2008 through 2011 light trucks.  Specifically, experts expressed concerns about some of the data in the  model NHTSA used to estimate the potential impact of increasing these  standards.

To describe the design of the proposed CAFE  and GHG emissions standards, we analyzed (1) rulemaking documents  with information on the structure of the standards and how NHTSA and  EPA aligned them and (2) legislation governing CAFE and GHG standards,  as well as associated penalties for noncompliance. To describe how  NHTSA and EPA are collaborating to set CAFE and GHG emissions  standards, we reviewed and analyzed relevant rulemaking documents and  legislation and interviewed NHTSA and EPA officials on their  communication and coordination, analyzing this information against GAO  criteria for evaluating communication and coordination among federal  agencies. To identify improvements made to the Volpe model, we  evaluated (1) documentation about the model against GAO criteria for  developing cost estimates and assessing data reliability and (2) federal  guidance for conducting regulatory and economic analyses. We  interviewed experts and stakeholders with relevant expertise in areas such  as economic modeling and automotive technology costs about data inputs  and the design of the model. We also interviewed automobile industry  stakeholders\u2014including domestic and international automobile  manufacturers and an association representing original equipment  suppliers. Finally, to determine the steps NHTSA has taken to analyze the  effects of the model year 2008 through 2011 light truck standards, we  reviewed documentation related to these standards and interviewed  NHTSA officials to determine whether NHTSA took steps to assess the  outcomes of these standards or the accuracy of data it used to set these  standards.", "We conducted this performance audit from June 2009 through February  2010, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

EPCA required manufacturers to meet a single fleetwide CAFE standard  for all cars and either a single standard or class standards for light trucks.  The act provided the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) with the  authority to administer the CAFE program, and DOT delegated that  authority to NHTSA. In addition, other federal agencies have played a role  in the CAFE program (see table 1). For example, under EPCA, EPA is  responsible for the development of CAFE testing and calculation  procedures. When it was enacted, EPCA specified that the standard for  passenger cars would be 18 miles per gallon (mpg) in 1978, rising to 27.5  mpg by 1985, but it permitted NHTSA to determine the standard for light  trucks through rulemakings. As required in EPCA, NHTSA began setting  CAFE standards for light trucks at the \u201cmaximum feasible level\u201d and made  incremental increases to these standards from 1979 through 1996. During  that time, the light truck CAFE standard increased from 17.9 mpg to 20.7  mpg. However, from fiscal years 1996 through 2001, NHTSA was barred  from using appropriated funds made available in DOT\u2019s appropriation to  raise CAFE standards. The CAFE standard for cars remained at the 1985  setting of 27.5 mpg through model year 2010. The first increase in CAFE  standards for cars since 1985 will take place for model year 2011 cars.", "After years of little CAFE-related activity or movement in the two  standards, several changes took place. According to NHTSA officials, DOT  requested that the appropriations ban be lifted so that they could raise  CAFE standards. The ban was lifted beginning in fiscal year 2002, and in  2003, NHTSA promulgated increased CAFE standards for light trucks for  model years 2005 to 2007. In 2006, NHTSA issued another rule to increase  and reform the standards for light trucks, which we refer to as the model  year 2008 through 2011 light truck standards. In this light truck  rulemaking, NHTSA transitioned from a single CAFE standard applicable  to each manufacturer\u2019s fleet to a reformed, attribute-based standard based  on a vehicle\u2019s \u201cfootprint,\u201d or the size of its wheelbase multiplied by its  average track width. The move from a single standard for all light trucks to  attribute-based standards for each light truck vehicle model based on a  vehicle\u2019s footprint was designed to address a number of downsides to  \u201cunreformed\u201d CAFE standards, including potential safety implications  and consumer choice limitations. The Energy Independence and Security  Act of 2007 (EISA) amended EPCA to require not only light truck but a passenger car standards to be based on an attribute-based curve and for  the fuel economy of the entire industrywide fleet\u2014including cars and light  trucks\u2014to reach an average of 35 mpg by model year 2020. Subsequent to  the enactment of EISA, in 2008, NHTSA proposed CAFE standards based  on vehicle footprints for passenger cars and light trucks for model years   However, a final rule was issued only for model year  2011 through 2015. lso  2011 standards in March 2009\u2014a rulemaking effort and CAFE standard  that we refer to as the model year 2011 CAFE standard. The goal of this  final rule was to reach an estimated fleet average\u2014or target\u2014of 30.2 mpg  for cars and 24.1 mpg for light trucks in model year 2011.", "In recent years, public concerns have grown about the relationship  between the emission of GHGs and global climate change. According to  the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change\u2014a United Nations  organization\u2014global atmospheric concentrations of GHGs have increased  as a result of human activities, contributing to a warming of the earth\u2019s  climate. If unchecked, this could have serious negative effects, such as  rising sea levels and coastal flooding worldwide.", "Automobiles represent a significant share of GHG emissions. According to  EPA, in 2007, personal vehicle use accounted for 17 percent of total GHG  emissions in the U.S. In 2007, the United States Supreme Court ruled that  EPA has the statutory authority to regulate GHG emissions from new  motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act (CAA) because greenhouse gases  meet the CAA\u2019s definition of an air pollutant. Furthermore, the Supreme  Court held that EPA must regulate GHGs as such if EPA finds them to be  an endangerment to public health or welfare. Subsequent to this decision,  EPA issued a final Endangerment Finding of GHG emissions in December  2009, laying the foundation for setting GHG emissions standards for  vehicles.", "In addition, in 2005, citing compelling and extraordinary impacts of  climate change on the state, California filed a request with EPA for a  waiver of CAA preemption to set GHG emissions standards for new  motor vehicles starting in the 2009 model year. The CAA directs EPA to  grant a waiver unless EPA finds (1) the state\u2019s protectiveness  determination was arbitrary and capricious, (2) the state\u2019s standards are  not needed to meet \u201ccompelling and extraordinary conditions,\u201d or (3) the  state\u2019s standards are inconsistent with section 202(a) of the CAA  (provisions related to technical feasibility and lead time to manufacturers).  Under certain conditions set forth in the CAA, other states may adopt  California\u2019s motor vehicle emissions standards. The automobile industry  brought litigation in several states, including California, alleging, among  other claims, that the state standards were preempted by EPCA (which  preempts state standards relating to fuel economy). Federal district courts  in Vermont and California ruled against such claims, in the only two cases  to be judged on their merits to date. California\u2019s waiver request was  initially denied by the prior administration. EPA determined that  California\u2019s standards were not needed to meet compelling and  extraordinary conditions, as required by the CAA, because global climate  change and local or regional factors represent different causal links  affecting air pollution in California\u2014and previous waivers have addressed  only the local or regional air pollution problems. In addition, EPA found  that the effects of climate change in California are not compelling and  extraordinary when compared to the rest of the country. GAO found in  January 2009 that the \u201ccompelling and extraordinary\u201d test had never  before been used to completely deny a waiver request. The current  administration also found that the denial was a historical anomaly,  reconsidered the request, and granted the waiver in June 2009 after finding  that it should not have been denied under any of the statutory factors.  Petition for review of this decision filed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce  and the National Automobile Dealers Association is now pending in front  of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.", "In response to the EISA\u2019s call for higher CAFE standards and California  and other states\u2019 desire to establish fuel economy or GHG emissions  standards, the current administration announced its National Fuel  Efficiency Policy in May 2009. This policy involves setting higher CAFE  standards for model years 2012 through 2016 for cars and light trucks, as  well as new GHG emissions standards by EPA during this same period. As  a result, NHTSA and EPA are conducting a joint rulemaking to increase  CAFE standards and set new GHG emissions standards. (See fig. 1 for a  timeline of major CAFE and GHG emissions standards milestones.)", "The proposed joint rule would increase CAFE standards to achieve an  estimated fleetwide average of 34.1 mpg and implement GHG emissions  standards to achieve an estimated fleetwide average of 250 grams per mile  (g/mi) of carbon dioxide (CO) by model year 2016.

This  should lower the cost of compliance for manufacturers compared to a  case in which the standards were set separately and without regard for the  other\u2019s design. This harmonization is possible because fuel economy and  GHG emissions have a clear and direct relationship\u2014specifically, vehicle  tailpipe carbon dioxide emissions are directly related to the quantity of  fuel burned. Given the relationship between GHG emissions and fuel  economy, actions to increase fuel economy also necessarily reduce GHG  emissions; therefore, manufacturers can use the same technologies to help  meet both standards.", "NHTSA and EPA have proposed standards for both passenger cars and  light trucks that are based on vehicle footprint so that each vehicle is  subject to a target level based on its footprint, with smaller vehicles having  a stricter target (see fig. 3). The footprint-based standard is applied to  individual vehicle models based on the size of each vehicle. Because each  manufacturer sells a different mix of vehicle sizes, under the proposed  standards each manufacturer will have different CAFE and GHG emissions  standards.", "NHTSA first adopted a footprint-based approach\u2014as opposed to a single  fleetwide standard\u2014for model year 2008 through 2011 light truck  standards. A number of the experts we interviewed supported the  current approach of subjecting both passenger car and light truck fl eets to  footprint-based standards. In the model year 2008 through 2011 light truck  rule, NHTSA cited several potential benefits of a footprint-based approach  over a single, fleetwide CAFE standard, including the following:    Larger reductions in oil consumption. Oil consumption would be  reduced because automakers would be required to improve the fuel  economy of vehicles of all sizes rather than only those near the standard.", "Enhanced safety. Manufacturers would not have an incentive to comply  with CAFE standards by pursuing strategies that compromise safety\u2014 such as (1) reducing the size of vehicles (applicable fuel-economy targets  now become higher as size decreases) or (2) designing models to be  classified as light trucks rather than cars, which can increase a vehicle\u2019s  propensity to roll over\u2014in order to comply with CAFE standards. Under a  single standard, manufacturers could reduce vehicle size as one approach  for CAFE compliance.", "More even disbursement of the regulatory cost burden. Fuel-economy  improvements would be spread across the industry, instead of  concentrating on manufacturers of heavier, lower fuel-economy vehicles.", "Addressing concerns about consumer choice. Manufacturers now must  improve the fuel economy of all light trucks, regardless of size, which  addresses criticisms that single, fleetwide CAFE standards were hindering  the efforts of some companies to offer a mix of vehicles matching  consumer desires. For instance, under the previous system, instead of  installing more fuel-saving technologies across their fleets, manufacturers  might have moved toward building fewer large vehicles and more small  vehicles to meet new CAFE standards, even though consumers typically  have not demanded small vehicles. In a footprint-based standard,  manufacturers must improve the fuel economy of all light trucks, no  matter their size.", "The CAFE requirement for each manufacturer\u2014which is the basis for  determining compliance\u2014will be determined at the end of the model  year based on actual production. For example, manufacturers selling a  greater proportion of large vehicles will have a lower average target to  meet than will manufacturers focusing on smaller vehicles. Based on  estimated sales projections, the proposed targets are estimated to achieve  an average of 34.1 mpg across all model year 2016 vehicles sold.", "While NHTSA and EPA expect benefits from adopting a standard based on  vehicle footprint and predict that the administration\u2019s goal of a fleetwide  average 34.1 mpg and 250 grams per mile carbon dioxide in 2016 will be  met, there is no guarantee that a specific national target will be achieved.  This is a tradeoff of adopting a footprint standard compared to the single  national CAFE standard NHTSA used in the past. Because the actual  fleetwide fuel-economy levels will depend on actual vehicle sales\u2014 specifically, the size of cars consumers buy\u2014there is the possibility that  the actual fleetwide mpg in 2016 will be higher or lower and realized costs  and benefits of the standards will be higher or lower than estimated. For  example, even though all of the vehicles in each manufacturer\u2019s fleet may  be in compliance with its footprint-based requirement, manufacturers may  sell a greater number of large-footprint vehicles than predicted, which  would lower each manufacturer\u2019s CAFE requirement. If this is the case,  the national fleet may not reach the target of 34.1 mpg by 2016, and the  estimated benefits of the standards, which assume achieving a national  fleetwide average of 34.1 mpg, would not be fully realized. The opposite,  however, could also be the case. If a greater number of smaller vehicles  (generally with higher CAFE levels) are sold than expected, manufacturers  will have higher CAFE requirements, the national fleet may exceed the  target of 34.1 mpg, and estimated benefits assuming a fleetwide average of  34.1 mpg would be exceeded (see fig. 4). Similar scenarios could occur  with respect to EPA\u2019s GHG standards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variation in the Standards, Which Result Primarily from Differences in Legal Authorities, May Present Challenges, but GHG Penalties May Increase Compliance", "paragraphs": ["Several key differences between the EPA and NHTSA standards largely  arise from the legal authorities under which the standards are set.  NHTSA\u2019s authority to administer the CAFE program is derived from EPCA,  as amended by EISA, requires that NHTSA, for passenger cars and light  trucks in each future model year, establish standards at \u201cthe maximum  feasible average fuel-economy level that it decides manufacturers can  achieve in that model year.\u201d EPCA further directs NHTSA to make this  determination based on consideration of four statutory factors:  technological feasibility, economic practicability, the effect of other  standards of the government on fuel economy, and the need of the nation  to conserve energy. However, the law does not direct NHTSA on how to  balance these four factors\u2014which can conflict\u2014thereby giving NHTSA  discretion to define, give weight to, and balance the four factors based on  the circumstances in each CAFE rulemaking. Furthermore, how NHTSA  balances these four factors can vary from rulemaking to rulemaking. For  example, in the model year 2012 through 2016 rulemaking, NHTSA cited  economic practicability concerns\u2014given the state of the economy and the  financial state of automakers\u2014to set standards at a level lower than it  otherwise could have in accordance with Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) guidelines on federal regulatory impact analysis. In  addition to the four statutory factors, NHTSA also considers the potential  for adverse safety consequences and consumer demand when establishing  CAFE standards.", "EPA\u2019s authority to set GHG standards is derived from the CAA, which  authorizes EPA to regulate emissions of air pollutants from all mobile  source categories. EPA must prescribe standards for the emission of any  air pollutant from motor vehicles which causes or contributes to air  pollution that endangers public health or welfare. In prescribing these  statutory standards, EPA considers such issues as technology  effectiveness, cost of compliance, the lead time necessary to implement  the technology, safety, energy impacts associated with the use of the  technology, and other impacts on consumers. EPA has the discretion to  consider and weigh these various factors, particularly those related to  issues of technical feasibility and lead time.", "Some differences affect the process each agency must use to set  standards, which in turn leads to key differences between the standards.  For example, EPCA requires that EPA, in testing fuel economy of  passenger vehicles, use 1975 test procedures or procedures that give  comparable results under which air conditioning is not turned on. As a  result, manufacturers cannot realize the benefits of air conditioning  improvements for complying with CAFE standards, and NHTSA has, to  date, not taken into account air conditioning improvements when setting  CAFE standards. Under the CAA, however, EPA is not subject to the  same limitations, and its proposed GHG standards account for air  conditioner improvements. Specifically, the mpg equivalent of EPA\u2019s 2016  target of 250 g/mi of COThis creates potential challenges to harmonization and for manufacturers  attempting to manage the design of a fleet. For example, EPA\u2019s proposed  GHG standards offer a \u201ctemporary lead time\u201d mechanism for  manufacturers that sell a limited number of vehicles in the U.S. Although  this specific flexibility does not exist in the CAFE standards, under EPCA,  NHTSA may exempt qualifying small-volume manufacturers (defined as  manufacturers that produce under 10,000 vehicles worldwide annually)  from the passenger car standard for a model year. As a result,  manufacturers that are able to take advantage of EPA\u2019s temporary lead  time mechanism to comply with GHG standards may face challenges in  complying with CAFE standards. Some experts we met with said that  these inconsistencies in flexibility mechanisms between the two sets of  standards may present challenges to some manufacturers in meeting the  harmonized standards.", "Mechanisms available for enforcing the standards also differ between the  two agencies due to statutory differences. For example, the Clean Air Act  prohibits the sale of vehicles without a certificate of conformity from EPA  which indicates that the vehicle meets applicable emission standards. If  EPA determines that a vehicle does not meet the emission standards, it  may not issue a certificate, thus preventing the manufacturer from legally  selling the vehicle. The Clean Air Act also gives EPA authority to recall  noncompliant vehicles. NHTSA can take neither of these actions. Because  a CAFE standard applies to a manufacturer\u2019s entire fleet for a model year,  CAFE fines are assessed for the entire noncomplying fleet. Pursuant to  EPCA, fines associated with CAFE noncompliance are currently $5.50 for  every tenth of an mpg a manufacturer\u2019s fuel economy is short of the  standard multiplied by the number of vehicles in a manufacturer\u2019s fleet for  a given model year. NHTSA recognizes that some manufacturers regularly  pay fines instead of complying with CAFE standards; in particular, many  European manufacturers pay fines each year. Fines for CAFE standards  have not been increased since 1997, and GAO has reported that, as a  result, CAFE penalties may not provide a strong enough incentive for  manufacturers to comply with CAFE. NHTSA officials noted that under  EPCA, NHTSA has the authority to raise the fines up to $10 per tenth of an  mpg. However, raising fines requires an analysis finding that substantial  energy conservation would result and that raising fines would not have  substantially deleterious impact on the U.S. economy. GAO has  recommended that agencies collecting penalties regularly conduct these  types of analyses.", "In contrast to CAFE fines, penalties for violation of a motor vehicle  emission standard under the CAA, which may be much higher, are  determined on a per-vehicle basis. The CAA gives EPA broad authority to  levy fines and require manufacturers to remedy vehicles if the agency  determines there are a substantial number of noncomplying vehicles.  EPA must consider an assortment of factors, such as the gravity of the  violation, the economic impact of the violation, the violator\u2019s history of  compliance, and other matters, in determining the appropriate penalty.  The CAA does not authorize manufacturers to intentionally pay fines as an  alternative to compliance, and EPA does not include in its standard-setting  modeling analysis the option for manufacturers to pay fines instead of  compliance. Manufacturers may be subject to fines as high as $37,500 per  vehicle under Section 205 of the CAA. Given that fines for noncompliance  with GHG standards may be higher than fines for noncompliance with  CAFE, having harmonized standards may provide incentives to  manufacturers that have traditionally chosen to pay CAFE penalties  instead of complying with standards, to comply with both sets of  standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Although the Agencies Closely Collaborated and Capitalized on EPA\u2019s Recent Research in Setting Standards, Joint Rulemaking for Future Standards Is Not Guaranteed", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EPA and NHTSA Are Collaborating through a Joint Rulemaking Process, Which Represents an Expansion of EPA\u2019s Role Compared to Previous CAFE Rulemakings", "paragraphs": ["In conducting the joint rulemaking, the agencies have collaborated on  major tasks.

This enabled manufacturers to learn about both new standards at the  same time and plan appropriately. Officials of both agencies told us that  staff from both agencies met on a regular basis, often daily, to coordinate  their efforts throughout the rulemaking process. In addition, according to  agency officials, the two agencies formed a number of joint technical  teams to examine data used in modeling efforts\u2014for instance, one team  examined data on automotive technology that can improve fuel economy  and reduce GHG emissions\u2014to ensure that both agencies were using  similar data and making similar assumptions to develop standards. As a  result of these efforts, each agency had significant input into the  development of both sets of standards.", "EISA mandated NHTSA to consult with both EPA and the Department of  Energy (DOE) in prescribing CAFE standards beginning with model year  2011. NHTSA\u2019s use of EPA\u2019s expertise in environmental issues and DOE\u2019s  expertise in energy efficiency in informing CAFE standards is important  given CAFE\u2019s environmental and energy-security implications. For  example, NHTSA has prepared draft and final environmental impact  statements, as required by the National Environmental Policy Act,  discussing the environmental implications of recent CAFE rulemakings,  and EPA has reviewed and provided input on that work. However, EPA\u2019s  role in the joint CAFE and GHG emissions rulemaking goes beyond the  EISA requirement for consultation. For example, EISA does not require  either EPA or DOE to participate in CAFE rulemaking at as high a level as  EPA has in the current joint CAFE and GHG emissions rulemaking.", "This level of EPA involvement in the proposed 2012 through 2016 CAFE  and GHG rulemaking is greater than EPA\u2019s involvement in previous CAFE  rulemakings, particularly prior to NHTSA\u2019s proposal of CAFE standards  for model year 2011. For the model year 2011 proposal, NHTSA and EPA  staff jointly assessed which technologies would be available for those  model years and their effectiveness and cost. They also jointly assessed  key economic and other assumptions affecting the stringency of future  standards. Finally, they worked together in updating and further improving  the model that had been used to help determine the stringency of the  model year 2008 through 2011 light truck standards. However, even in the  rulemaking for model year 2011, EPA did not devote as many resources or  have as much involvement in setting CAFE standards as it did in the model  year 2012 through 2016 proposed CAFE and GHG rulemaking.", "The increased involvement by EPA as an equal partner in the proposed  model year 2012 through 2016 CAFE and GHG emissions rulemaking came  at the direction of the current administration, when it announced plans to  increase CAFE standards and introduce GHG emissions standards for  vehicles. EPA officials noted that the involvement of the White House and  clear directives to both the Secretary of Transportation and Administrator  of EPA for a collaborative approach caused both agencies to commit to  the joint process, which officials viewed as successful."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Both NHTSA and EPA Used Computer-Based Models to Conduct Analyses That Inform the Level of Standards; Results Were Largely Similar", "paragraphs": ["To determine the appropriate level of CAFE and GHG emissions  standards, NHTSA and EPA each conducted its own regulatory impact  analysis using computer models. NHTSA used a model developed by the  Volpe National Transportation Systems Center (referred to as the Volpe  model), earlier versions of which have been used in previous CAFE  rulemakings. The model estimates the costs and benefits to  manufacturers, consumers, and society of differing levels of CAFE  standards. (See app. II for an in-depth description of NHTSA\u2019s Volpe  model.) EPA developed a similar model called the Optimization Model for  Reducing Emissions of Greenhouse Gases from Automobiles (OMEGA) to  conduct a similar analysis of and inform its proposed GHG standards.", "While the models are distinct from one another, and NHTSA and EPA each  conducted its own modeling, the two agencies collaborated on and  coordinated this work. In particular, the OMEGA model and Volpe model  generally used consistent data inputs and assumptions\u2014for example, the  same economic assumptions and, to the extent possible given structural  differences between the models, consistent data on vehicle fleets and fuel- saving technologies. According to officials from both agencies, the two  agencies worked closely together to develop these data inputs and  assumptions. NHTSA\u2019s and EPA\u2019s analyses are also structured similarly  and have two components\u2014one that attempts to determine manufacturer  response to the standards and another that estimates the effects of the  proposed standards on manufacturers, consumers, and society.", "In addition, although the two models differ in several ways, analyses  conducted with each model produced similar results, helping to validate  each modeling effort. Some differences involve the treatment of  compliance flexibilities or credits\u2014mechanisms created in a standard to  reduce the cost of compliance for manufacturers. Other differences  involve how the models account for manufacturers conducting multiyear  product planning and how technologies were carried over between model  years. Both NHTSA and EPA conducted analyses of the respective effects  of the proposed CAFE and GHG standards.

NHTSA contributed research on fuel efficiency and  costs. For example, NHTSA officials said that they conducted new  research related to estimating the rebound effect and the costs of oil  imports. In 2008, during the development of the model year 2011 rule,  NHTSA contracted with an automotive consulting firm to review  comments from stakeholders during the public comment period of the  rulemaking, which resulted in some technology costs being updated.  NHTSA officials said that this work helped improve its analysis. NHTSA  also contributed safety research. However, NHTSA has not recently  undertaken new safety research to support the current proposed  standards, despite significant and ongoing controversy over vehicle  safety and CAFE standards, as well as changes in technology available to  reduce vehicle weight. According to NHTSA officials, NHTSA has made  such research a priority for the near-future in order to support future  CAFE rulemaking.", "In addition, while NHTSA contracted with the National Academy of  Sciences (NAS) to provide an updated report on the costs of fuel-saving  technologies, and NAS held its first public meeting for this work in  September 2007, this work was not completed in time to support analysis  for the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. EISA mandated NHTSA to  contract with NAS to receive updates to its earlier report of fuel-saving  technology cost and effectiveness in 5-year intervals until 2025. We noted  in previous work that both experts and NHTSA officials said it would be  ideal to complete and update such work before NHTSA issues a new car or  light truck fuel-economy standard. Also, NAS work on technology costs  in 2002 was generally viewed by a wide range of experts as being thorough  and unbiased. While NAS indicated in a preliminary report that it would  finish its work by spring 2008, according to NAS officials, they required  more time to acquire technology cost data than initially anticipated. As a  result, the final NAS study has not yet been published and was not  available to inform analysis for EPA and NHTSA\u2019s September 2009 Notice  of Proposed Rulemaking.", "EPA contributed research in time to provide analysis for the proposed  rule. It also contributed funding to a greater degree, especially when  compared with past CAFE rulemakings where EPA\u2019s role was limited to  consulting. For example, EPA conducted or contracted for three peer- reviewed studies to support the rulemaking and the modeling efforts.  According to EPA officials, these studies included    an ongoing $1.1 million study done in conjunction with a consulting firm to  determine the direct manufacturing costs of fuel-saving and GHG  emissions-reducing technologies\u2014a key input in both agencies\u2019 models;    a $40,000 assessment of indirect costs of manufacturing more fuel-efficient    a $1 million vehicle simulation modeling study done in conjunction with a  consulting firm to refine estimates of emissions reduction and fuel- economy improvements stemming from combinations of technology.", "These studies provided the analysis of both CAFE and GHG standards  with updated information and data.", "The difference in the extent of new research that NHTSA and EPA  conducted for this rulemaking likely results from differences in resources  available to the agencies in the recent past. As we mentioned previously,  from fiscal years 1996 to 2001\u2014about 6 years\u2014NHTSA was prohibited  from using appropriated funds to change CAFE standards. According to  NHTSA, the agency lost staff with expertise in this area as a result and did  not begin to hire additional automotive engineers until summer 2009. By  comparison, EPA has been able to develop and maintain automotive  engineering expertise. This expertise has proved helpful in setting GHG  emissions standards for automobiles. For example, EPA has been home to  the National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory since 1971, and in the  early 1990s, it expanded its activities to conduct research and  development of technologies used to reduce emissions, which are often  marketed and licensed to the automobile industry. Although NHTSA  brings safety expertise to CAFE standards, which has been a concern with  raising CAFE standards in the past, the agency\u2019s primary mission and  expertise is in vehicle safety, not vehicle power train design and the  impact of vehicle emissions on the environment. Thus NHTSA cannot be  expected to have the same level of in-house expertise related to vehicle  power train design and environmental issues as EPA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Although the Collaboration between NHTSA and EPA Resulted in Improvements, the Process Is Not Being Formalized or Documented for Future Use", "paragraphs": ["Although the agencies had to work quickly, the joint proposed model year  2012 through 2016 rulemaking has met all of its milestones to date, and the  agencies stated that the collaboration has been successful.

The  agencies conducted the joint rulemaking under tight time frames and have  met all key milestones, such as publishing information about the rule and  receiving and responding to public comments.

By  comparison, according to NHTSA officials, other recent CAFE  rulemakings have taken a minimum of 14 months. The accelerated  timeline in the current rulemaking stemmed in part from the statutory  requirement that NHTSA issue new CAFE standards 18 months prior to  the beginning of the model year that will be affected and from the current  administration\u2019s announcement regarding the development of the new  standards in May 2009. In order to issue harmonized standards at the same  time, both EPA and NHTSA had to adhere to an accelerated timeline.", "Despite the dual challenge of conducting a joint rulemaking for the first  time and on a compressed timeline, some experts we spoke with thought  that the two agencies worked well with each other and hoped they would  continue to do so.

The proposed standards cover model years  2012 through 2016, and while it is not clear how fuel economy and GHG  emissions will be regulated after 2016, industry stakeholders and others  have said that they would like NHTSA and EPA to begin working on the  next set of standards in the near future. Officials with the California Air  Resources Board said that the state is already considering state GHG  emissions standards that would take effect in 2017, and depending on the  stringency of federal standards at that time, California may opt to  implement its own more stringent standards. Many industry stakeholders  we interviewed said that they prefer a national program with harmonized  standards over different federal and state standards because multiple  standards could substantially increase compliance costs. Some expressed  interest in EPA and NHTSA considering CAFE and GHG emissions  standards for model years beyond 2016 as soon as possible in order to  better ensure harmonized national standards and to give manufacturers  appropriate lead time to meet standards.", "Although we found interest in NHTSA and EPA developing standards for  model years beyond 2016, two issues could prevent the agencies from  replicating this effort in the future:    The processes for coordinating the rulemaking have not been documented  by either agency.

As GAO has reported, such guidance can aid  regulatory programs by improving efficiency and ensure that benchmarks  and time frames are met. In addition, by publishing such documentation, the  agencies can increase the transparency of their programs and processes.  However, the two agencies have not documented the processes for use  during future rulemakings, and officials at both agencies report they  currently have no plans to do so. EPA officials, however, told us that  documenting the processes would be a worthwhile task.", "The two agencies are not legally required to continue coordinating in  setting CAFE and GHG emissions standards.

It  has been criticized by some experts in previous rulemakings for, among  other things, a lack of transparency that limited public review. Because  EPA is setting GHG emissions standards for the first time, we did not  conduct a similar review of their modeling efforts using the OMEGA  model.", "The first key component of the Volpe model is a simulation of how  manufacturers might comply with proposed CAFE standards. The  \u201ccompliance simulation\u201d of the Volpe model attempts to simulate each  manufacturer\u2019s most cost-effective strategy to make its fleet comply with a  more stringent CAFE standard by incorporating technologies until the  manufacturer achieves compliance, exhausts all available technologies, or  pays fines for noncompliance when it becomes more cost-effective than  incorporating additional technologies. It relies on several key sources of  data, including  the \u201cbaseline vehicle fleet,\u201d a forecast of the vehicle models manufacturers  will produce for sale in the U.S. in future model years;    a list of available fuel-saving technologies, categorized into five groups;    estimates of the costs, effectiveness in reducing fuel consumption,  applicability, and availability of these technologies; and    pathways that estimate available fuel-saving technologies and the order in  which manufacturers could take advantage of these technologies to most  cost-effectively meet new CAFE standards.", "This technology simulation is run for each vehicle model in the baseline  fleet and produces an estimate of each vehicle\u2019s new fuel economy,  weight, and total cost after the manufacturer has modified the vehicle in  response to the CAFE standard. The compliance simulation\u2019s output is a  forecast of model years 2012 through 2016 vehicles\u2014namely, a re- engineered fleet of vehicles with new prices, fuel types, fuel-economy  values, and weights to reflect the changes manufacturers would make to  their vehicles to meet the proposed model year 2012 through 2016 CAFE  standards. The data for each vehicle in the forecasted model year 2012  through 2016 fleet is then used in the second portion of the analysis.", "This \u201ccalculation of effects\u201d is the second key component of the Volpe  model, which uses the compliance simulation data to estimate the costs  and benefits of potential changes to the CAFE standard to manufacturers,  consumers, and society as a whole. It uses a variety of data inputs,  including fuel prices projected for the lifetimes of the vehicles in the fleet,  the economic costs of fuel consumption, and damage costs for criteria  pollutants. This analysis produces information on the estimated benefits  and costs of higher CAFE standards, such as the benefit to consumers of  fuel savings from driving more fuel-efficient vehicles, increases in new  vehicle prices, changes in the number of vehicle miles traveled, and the  societal benefits of reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. The estimated  costs and benefits are used by NHTSA to set CAFE standards at a level  that appropriately balances their costs and the benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHTSA Made Several Improvements to Its Analysis That Could Help NHTSA Better Estimate the Costs and Benefits of Increasing CAFE Standards", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Transparency", "paragraphs": ["To increase the transparency of inputs to the Volpe model for the 2012  through 2016 rulemaking, NHTSA used publicly available data to develop  the model\u2019s baseline vehicle fleet. In previous rulemakings, NHTSA  developed its baseline fleet by using confidential product plans submitted  by manufacturers that described the vehicles manufacturers planned to  sell in the U.S. in future years. However, manufacturers submitted these  plans to NHTSA as confidential business information, and NHTSA could  not make these plans available to the public. Comments submitted as  part of prior CAFE rulemakings, as well as several experts we spoke to,  indicated that the lack of transparency regarding NHTSA\u2019s use of product  plans was troublesome because researchers could not replicate NHTSA\u2019s  analysis. In developing their respective models for the joint rulemaking,  NHTSA and EPA used a baseline fleet that drew primarily from public and  commercially available information to make their analyses more  transparent and provide additional validation of the results of their  analyses. Specifically, NHTSA and EPA relied almost entirely on  information sources such as model year 2008 vehicle sales data, EPA\u2019s  emission certification and fuel-economy database, and vehicle sales  forecasts from several public sources.", "There are several advantages of using public and commercially available  data more extensively than product plans. First, federal regulatory analysis  from OMB recommends that analyses be transparent to allow third parties  to determine how the model produces its estimates and conclusions. By  increasing the transparency of the baseline vehicle fleet, NHTSA allowed  outside experts the opportunity to review the model\u2019s inputs and outputs  and replicate the results of the model to better ensure that its analysis is  thorough and sound. Second, because the submission of product plans is  strictly voluntary, NHTSA has not consistently received complete  information from all manufacturers with U.S. sales, which has inhibited its  ability to forecast the future vehicle fleet across manufacturers using that  data. Although several companies submit nearly complete product plans,  others submit only partial plans, while still others do not submit any  information. NHTSA also indicated it could save staff time by not having to  correct errors in the manufacturers\u2019 submissions that NHTSA does  receive. Third, by using actual fuel-economy test data from model year  2008 vehicles, NHTSA would be able to use this verified fuel-economy  information, rather than the estimates of the fuel-economy performance  from vehicles\u2019 manufacturers.", "Despite these advantages, there are some disadvantages to using the  publicly available model year 2008 data to establish the baseline vehicle  fleet. For example, by forecasting the model year 2012 through 2016  vehicle fleet using model year 2008 vehicle data, NHTSA and EPA\u2019s  baseline includes vehicles that have been eliminated or for which  production has been reduced, such as the Chrysler PT Cruiser and  Hummer H2. It also does not include several vehicle models and  technologies that manufacturers have recently introduced or plan to  introduce, such as Ford\u2019s EcoBoost system (a package of engine  technologies that in combination significantly improve fuel economy), the  Honda Insight (a conventional hybrid), Chevrolet Volt (a plug-in hybrid  electric vehicle), or Nissan\u2019s all-electric LEAF. In addition to specific  vehicles, NHTSA\u2019s baseline vehicle fleet forecast does not account for  broad-scale changes to vehicle lines that manufacturers have started, such  as Chrysler\u2019s plans to use Fiat power trains to offer small and medium- sized cars. Finally, NHTSA has found it difficult to determine, from either  public or commercial sources, a number of specific data used in the  baseline, such as information on electric power steering and reduced  rolling-resistance tires. Consequently, NHTSA has had to use a small  amount of data from product plans submitted in spring 2009 to fill these  data gaps. NHTSA is also consulting with manufacturers regarding the  possible release of model year 2010 or model year 2011 product plans that  NHTSA could use in its development and analysis of the final model year  2012 through 2016 standards.

For example, NHTSA revised the cost of turbocharging and  downsizing an engine\u2014a cost range of $512 to $1,098, depending on  engine type, compared to the range of $822 to $1,129 used for the model  year 2011 CAFE standards\u2014using data available from EPA\u2019s ongoing  teardown study with FEV, an automotive research, design, and  development company. It also revised the costs of several other key  technologies such as cylinder deactivation\u2014a cost range of $28 to $190,  compared to the range of $306 to $400 used for the model year 2011 CAFE  standards. However, despite this concerted effort, NHTSA and EPA were  not able to make further refinements because the anticipated NAS study of  vehicle technology was not completed on schedule.", "Indirect costs to manufacturers. NHTSA adopted research that EPA had  contracted for to refine estimates of the indirect costs to manufacturers of  manufacturing more fuel-efficient vehicles. These costs include research  and development and marketing costs associated with the introduction of  a new technology and give decision makers a more comprehensive view of  the total costs a manufacturer would incur for implementing new  technology than direct costs alone can provide. EPA supplemented an  initial contractor report on this subject with an additional in-house study,  which involved significant staff resources.", "The social cost of carbon dioxide emissions. NHTSA adopted an estimate  of the damage resulting from carbon dioxide emissions that is more in-line  with recent scientific and economic research, leading to a better reflection  of the estimated benefits of increased CAFE standards related to  reductions in GHG emissions. In the model year 2008 through 2011 light  truck rule, NHTSA declined to include an economic value for reducing  GHG emissions, citing the wide variation in published estimates of GHG  emissions costs. However, a November 2007 federal court decision found  that NHTSA\u2019s decision to not provide a monetized estimate of the benefit  of reducing GHG emissions was arbitrary and capricious. For the  proposed model year 2012 through 2016 standards, NHTSA is using  estimates of $5, $10, $20, $34, and $56 per metric ton of carbon dioxide\u2014 with an emphasis on the $20 value. These values, also adopted by EPA in  its analysis, reflect the current administration\u2019s interim set of estimates of  the social cost of carbon for agencies to use in regulatory analyses until a  federal interagency working group develops a more comprehensive  estimate for use in future economic and regulatory analyses.", "Projected fuel prices. NHTSA used the most recent and updated  projections of fuel prices provided by the Energy Information  Administration (EIA) to place a value on the fuel-saving costs and benefits  of different CAFE standards. Among other things, the monetized benefits  of the new CAFE standards are more sensitive to changes in fuel prices,  meaning that the estimated benefits of more stringent CAFE standards will  increase or decrease to a greater extent in response to changes in the price  of fuel compared to changes in other variables. For the current proposal,  NHTSA is using a range of prices from $2.50 in 2011 to $3.82 in 2030, which  is consistent with the EIA\u2019s 2009 main fuel price projections, and is  focusing on an average retail gas price of $3.77 per gallon in 2007 dollars.  In addition, NHTSA is reviewing the EIA\u2019s high and low fuel price  projections to determine a range of potential costs and benefits, a best  practice recommended by OMB guidance. In projecting fuel prices, EIA  considers recent and likely future developments in the world oil market,  the effect of the current geopolitical situation on oil supply and prices, and  conditions in the domestic fuel supply industry that affect pump prices.  However, EIA projections have at times underestimated gas prices, most  recently in 2008 during the price spike. Several experts we spoke to noted  that gas prices are extremely difficult to predict. However, most of the  experts we spoke to also indicated that despite its limitations, EIA is the  most credible source for projected fuel prices. Although EIA officials told  us they do not issue guidance to agencies on how to use EIA projections in  regulatory impact analyses, they expect agencies to consider that events  EIA cannot predict will impact energy demand and fuel prices.", "By applying the best research available, NHTSA should obtain better  estimates of the benefits and costs of higher CAFE standards and allow  standards to be set at a level better reflecting those benefits and costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Thorough Analysis", "paragraphs": ["In line with OMB guidance on federal regulatory analysis, NHTSA  conducted more thorough analyses in the proposed model year 2012  through 2016 standards than in previous CAFE rulemakings, including the  model year 2008 through 2011 light truck rule. First, NHTSA tested and  compared the benefits and costs of a greater number of CAFE levels set at  different stringencies (also known as alternative scenarios) than it has in  the past. By doing so, NHTSA gives decision makers a better picture of  which level of CAFE standards provides the best balance between costs  and benefits. NHTSA doubled the number of alternative CAFE scenarios it  has tested from four to eight since the model year 2008 through 2011 light  truck final rule. Specifically, NHTSA considered scenarios in which fuel- economy levels are increased at an annual average rate ranging from 3 to 7  percent, as well as scenarios in which the benefits are modified\u2014for  example, selecting a level at which the total costs of new CAFE standards  are equal to their total benefits or a level that maximizes the net benefits of  new CAFE standards to society. As a result, NHTSA was able to provide  more comprehensive information for decision makers and increase public  understanding of NHTSA\u2019s process for setting standards.", "However, NHTSA also considered factors external to the model in  determining the level of the proposed model year 2012 through 2016  standards. Although OMB guidance on regulatory analysis specifies that  agencies should select the scenario that maximizes the net benefits of the  regulatory action to society, NHTSA did not propose to select the  \u201cmaximum net benefits\u201d scenario as its preferred alternative for the  standards in the proposed rule. Instead, NHTSA proposed to select a  scenario in which CAFE standards increase at an average rate of 4.3  percent per year. According to NHTSA officials, that decision was justified  because the four statutory factors that they must weigh when setting  CAFE standards outweigh OMB guidance. Several experts we spoke to  said that NHTSA\u2019s decision was justified because selecting the \u201cmaximum  net benefits\u201d scenario would have resulted in CAFE standards that  automobile manufacturers could not realistically meet without making  significant tradeoffs. For instance, one expert thought manufacturers  would have to change their fleet mix to build and sell smaller vehicles and  would have to pass on substantial costs to consumers, which could reduce  vehicle sales. In addition, another expert thought that if lead time is not  sufficient, manufacturers will not be able to hire staff quickly enough to  handle the additional work.", "Additionally, as provided for in OMB guidance, NHTSA expanded its use of  two types of uncertainty analysis, which differs from previous  rulemakings. Specifically, relative to previous rulemakings, NHTSA  expanded its sensitivity testing and probabilistic uncertainty analyses,  both of which assess the uncertainty associated with key assumptions and  inputs in its analysis, in comparison to previous rulemakings. NHTSA\u2019s  sensitivity analysis and probabilistic uncertainty analysis test whether  variability in the values of key model inputs would dramatically affect the  costs and benefits of a potential CAFE level. The variability of key inputs  may arise from different estimates of credible studies or simply be the  result of limited current knowledge. These sensitivity and uncertainty  analyses provide decision makers with a sense of which potential CAFE  level, despite the variability of key inputs, will best balance benefits and  costs. In comparison to the model year 2008 through 2011 light truck rule,  NHTSA\u2019s current sensitivity and probabilistic uncertainty analyses  considered more case scenarios focusing on a number of critical inputs,  including projections of fuel prices, the rebound effect, the value of  reducing carbon dioxide emissions, and the military security benefits of  reducing fuel consumption, of which variability in one input or a  combination of inputs may affect the results of the overall analysis."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Continue to Have Concerns about the Model, but Do Not Agree on How to Further Improve Inputs to the Model", "paragraphs": ["As part of this work, we spoke with a number of experts familiar with the  Volpe model about their assessment of the data used in the model.  Although they provided criticism, they did not agree on what needed to be  improved (see app. I for information on experts with whom we consulted).  In general, nearly all of the experts we spoke to offered some critique of  the model and its data. For instance, some, but not all, experts said that  NHTSA was too cautious in updating the values for variables such as the  social cost of carbon dioxide emissions, given the state of current  research. These experts said that NHTSA was underestimating the social  cost of carbon dioxide emissions, which would lead to an underestimation  of the benefits of CAFE standards and the establishment of standards set  at a lower than ideal level. However, we could not find general consensus  among experts we spoke to that NHTSA should have modified values for  specific variables or made other improvements to the model. For example,  NHTSA used a lower value for the rebound effect (10 percent) to more  closely align with values identified in recent research. Several experts  thought that NHTSA should have adopted the value (5 percent) identified  in the research, which was even lower than what NHTSA used, while  others thought that NHTSA\u2019s more cautious approach was appropriate  until additional studies using different data sets verified the findings.", "We did find considerable controversy among experts over the potential  safety impact of weight reduction in vehicles\u2014much more so than for  other variables assessed in the Volpe model. While some experts stated  that manufacturers could safely reduce vehicle weight while maintaining  the size of the vehicle by substituting lightweight but durable materials for  heavier materials (material substitution), other experts maintained that  any effort to reduce vehicle weight would adversely affect safety. Two  studies, one developed by NHTSA (Kahane study) and a second  conducted by an automotive engineering consulting firm (Dynamic  Research, Inc., study), came to different conclusions on this issue, and to  date, no subsequent study has been conducted in a manner designed to  resolve the conflict. DOE has sponsored research through the Lawrence  Berkeley National Laboratory that examines the relationship between  vehicle weight and driver casualty risk using police-reported crash data  and CAFE compliance records, but given the high level of ongoing  controversy, this approach may not satisfy all the experts invested in this  issue. In addition, neither the Kahane study nor the Dynamic Research,  Inc., study were able to assess directly how material substitution as a  particular approach to weight reduction could affect safety because the  vehicles analyzed in the two studies were limited to model years 1985  through 1999. During this period, CAFE standards were not attribute- based, and manufacturers had a greater incentive to improve fuel economy  by reducing vehicle size rather than by reducing vehicle weight through  material substitution. In addition, several experts noted that by using the  Kahane study in its current work, NHTSA may be overestimating the safety  implications of higher CAFE standards because the study does not  consider technology solutions like material substitution as an option that  could improve fuel economy without negatively affecting safety. Because  NHTSA accounts for the safety effects of proposed standards by  estimating their safety implications, relying on this research in the future  could result in standards being set at a lower level. In the past, concerns  about safety have prevented non-attribute-based CAFE standards from  being increased.", "We also learned from experts that vehicle safety is challenging to address  because the safety tradeoff between larger, heavier vehicles and smaller,  lighter vehicles does not lend itself to a clear policy solution. Generally,  larger and heavier vehicles, which enhance the safety of their passengers  as a result of their size and weight, pose a greater safety threat to other  vehicles on the roadways than smaller, lighter cars do. Conversely,  although smaller, lighter cars pose less of a threat to other vehicles on the  road, they cannot provide the same degree of safety to their passengers  that larger, heavier vehicles do. The degree of difference in the size and  weight of vehicles has some bearing on passenger safety: larger, heavier  vehicles provide their passengers safety benefits and impose on others  safety costs, while smaller, lighter vehicles provide others safety benefits  and impose on their passengers safety costs. Several experts with whom  we spoke thought that additional research was needed to better  understand the relationship between vehicle size, weight, and safety, as  well as to identify how best to reduce the weight of vehicles in a manner  that creates the least risk. Experts recommended several different  methodological approaches to assess this relationship, including future  studies that examined material substitution in accident outcomes once  vehicles with this technology became more prevalent in the fleet. Others  recommended the use of computer crash simulation modeling to identify  best practices in the use of material substitution."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Largely Due to Resource Constraints, NHTSA Has Limited Plans to Assess the Model Year 2008 through 2011 Light Truck CAFE Standards or Key Data Used to Develop the Standards", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies can use retrospective analyses of rulemakings to help  determine the extent to which the expected costs, benefits, and goals of a  regulation are being realized. A retrospective analysis of CAFE standards  could help NHTSA and Congress determine the extent to which goals of  the standards\u2014such as improvements in fuel economy\u2014are being met  and provide insight into ways to improve the standards. In addition, a  retrospective analysis of key data inputs could help determine if there are  systematic issues with the estimation of those data and identify means to  improve the data in the future. EPA officials noted that they have used  retrospective analyses of other regulatory programs to assess the accuracy  of program costs. For example, in 2002, EPA issued a retrospective cost  analysis of a large number of light-duty vehicle criteria pollutant standards  and mobile source fuel standards implemented between 1992 and 2001.  However, because EPA has not previously issued GHG emissions  standards for automobiles, it would not be able to conduct these types of  analyses for GHG emissions standards at this time.", "With respect to the model year 2008 through 2011 light truck CAFE  standards, the following retrospective analyses could be conducted by  NHTSA:    An overall analysis of the standards to determine the extent to which the  new, footprint-based standards met intended goals (e.g., increases in fuel  economy and reductions in fuel consumption). As the proposed model  year 2012 through 2016 CAFE standards are also to be based on vehicle  footprint, this analysis could help determine if the move to the footprint  based standard provided the intended benefits or imposed unexpected  costs.", "An analysis of the accuracy of key data inputs, including the baseline fleet  and technology cost estimates. NHTSA has been criticized in the past for  not adequately estimating these two sets of data, which provide crucial  information for determining the effects of the proposed standards, and  thus need to be as accurate as possible.", "Although NHTSA officials we spoke with recognize the value of these  analyses and hope to conduct them, they report that resource limitations  have prevented them from doing so in the past and will prevent them from  doing so in the near future. In addition, NHTSA is not required to do any of  these analyses. A discussion of NHTSA officials\u2019 responses regarding  retrospective analyses and the resource limitations that have prevented  them from being conducted follows:    Model year 2008 through 2011 light truck standards. NHTSA staff said  that such retrospective analysis of the model year 2008 through 2011 light  truck standards would be worthwhile and informative. However,  according to NHTSA officials, in recent months the agency has devoted all  of its dedicated CAFE staff\u2019s time to the proposed model year 2012  through 2016 CAFE rule and, as a result, has not been able to devote  resources to conducting a retrospective analysis. In addition, given that  NHTSA staff said that the agency is being asked by a majority of  commenters addressing the subject to begin working on CAFE standards  beyond model year 2016 as soon as possible, they may not be able to work  on a retrospective analysis once the model year 2012 through 2016  standards are finalized and released. However, a number of experts we  interviewed said that NHTSA should conduct such an analysis in order to  provide insight into the standards and their actual effects.", "Manufacturers\u2019 sales data. While NHTSA told us that it would like to look  back at manufacturers\u2019 actual sales as a means to assess the accuracy of  the product plans that manufacturers submitted and that NHTSA used as  the baseline fleet in setting model year 2008 through 2011 light truck  standards, it said that it has no definitive plans for conducting this analysis  in the near future. NHTSA officials cited a lack of resources in the agency  for not conducting such an analysis. In addition, because 2008 sales were  an anomaly\u2014they were unusually low given the economic downturn\u2014 officials thought a study of the extent to which actual 2008 sales were in- line with the forecasted sales for 2008 that were used to set those  standards would be of little value. However, an analysis of actual future  years\u2019 sales against the estimated sales of the baseline fleet used in the  rulemaking would be of value, as it would help validate data and  potentially identify means to improve fleet forecasts in future CAFE  rulemakings.", "Cost estimates of technology. NHTSA officials also told us that an  assessment of the cost estimates of technology used in previous analyses  would be valuable. However, NHTSA staff also said that such an analysis  would be challenging, as it is hard to get accurate data on the actual cost  of technology components. This is because these components are either  sold directly to, or produced by, automobile manufacturers, meaning that  there is no clear, public historical data on their sales price. However, while  some experts with whom we spoke recognized the challenges in  conducting such an analysis, they thought that such an assessment would  provide value and recommended several different approaches for  conducting this type of analysis. For example, some experts suggested that  costs could be validated through a vehicle teardown program, such as the  type of project EPA initiated last year, or through an analysis of sales data  and technology that manufacturers incorporated into recent models to  comply with increased standards. While these studies could potentially  impose large resource demands, they would also potentially help improve  the cost of technology assumptions in future CAFE rules, helping to create  standards that more accurately reflect costs and benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Because CAFE and GHG emissions standards are closely related and  automobile manufacturers will be subject to both, close collaboration  between NHTSA and EPA can minimize compliance costs to the industry  and ensure harmonized standards. Furthermore, regardless of how the  government may set any future standards\u2014jointly or independently\u2014a  continued partnership between the two agencies can help assure fiscal  responsibility by leveraging\u2014rather than duplicating\u2014federal efforts and  resources, including expertise and human capital costs. However, the  current level of collaboration between NHTSA and EPA, which stems from  the joint rulemaking process the agencies undertook at the discretion of  the current administration, is not set in law or otherwise required. If  NHTSA and EPA do not collaborate closely on future standards, there is a  risk that the standards may not be harmonized, which would lead to  increased compliance costs for manufacturers; the standards may not  reflect the expertise of both agencies, such as the vehicle power train  technology and environmental expertise of EPA and vehicle safety  expertise of NHTSA; and the goals that the standards are attempting to  accomplish may not be met. Also, the standards may not accurately reflect  the best estimates of key costs and benefits, thus imposing added costs on  the economy or failing to provide as large benefits to society as the  standards could.", "In addition, this is the first joint rulemaking conducted between these  agencies, and NHTSA and EPA are under tight time frames to set the  standards. However, the agencies are not documenting the processes  being used. If NHTSA and EPA must collaborate on future standards, staff  may spend additional time recreating these processes\u2014ones which appear  to be working effectively\u2014and relearning how best to interface with one  another\u2019s leadership structure, management processes, and research  activities. As a result, the two agencies may not share their respective  expertise and resources as well, potentially leading to inefficiencies, less  thorough and rigorous regulatory analyses, and standards that may not be  effectively harmonized or developed with similar time frames.", "NHTSA has not yet conducted\u2014nor does it have plans to conduct\u2014a full  and formal analysis of the effectiveness and outcomes of its adoption of  the footprint-based CAFE standards for light trucks. Also, it has no plans  to assess the accuracy of key data inputs used to set these standards, even  though it is now proposing a footprint-based approach for passenger  vehicles as well. Conducting these types of analyses can help  policymakers determine whether anticipated benefits and costs have been  realized and identify corrections in or improvements to existing programs.  NHTSA is not required to conduct such analyses and has limited staff and  resources to devote to this effort. As a result, it is not clear if the new  standards have met goals that NHTSA intended\u2014such as fuel savings and  improved safety outcomes\u2014and if the move to the footprint-based  standards was worthwhile. Furthermore, NHTSA does not know how well  it estimated key data inputs that help determine the level at which  standards are set, including technology costs; whether manufacturers used  the types of technologies NHTSA expected in order to comply with new  standards; and whether baseline fleets matched the vehicle mix actually  sold. Consequently, agency officials cannot learn from the past and make  adjustments to the process, such as seeking different data sources, to  ensure that future standards are based on the most accurate data  available.", "Given the importance of safety in setting CAFE standards, ensuring that  decision makers and the public have the most accurate information on the  relationship between vehicle size, weight, and safety will be important if  the standards are to be changed in the future. In addition, the data inputs  that NHTSA and EPA use to help set and analyze the effects of the  proposed model year 2012 through 2016 standards should be based upon  the best available research and reflect a consensus among experts and  stakeholders. Given the controversy among experts and the increasing  availability of material substitution\u2014an advancement in technology to  reduce weight that could compensate for safety effects\u2014new research  could help to answer questions regarding the extent to which weight can  be reduced without affecting safety and whether there are best practices  for employing material substitution.", "Finally, while other sources of technology costs were used in developing  CAFE and GHG emissions standards, the 2002 NAS work on technology  costs was generally viewed by a wide range of stakeholders and experts as  being thorough and unbiased. Congress authorized NHTSA to contract  with NAS at 5-year intervals until 2025 so that the agency would have  current information available to set future standards.

We looked into this issue because in our 2007 report.  NHTSA officials told us they needed additional staff with expertise in  automotive engineering and computer modeling to assist in developing  technology cost and effectiveness estimates, as well as other tasks, to  prepare for future changes in CAFE standards. NHTSA commented in  response to this draft that the prohibition did not prevent DOT from  sustaining relevant engineering, energy, and environmental expertise, and  that after 2001, NHTSA leveraged DOT\u2019s expertise. NHTSA also  commented that in our current review, we did not examine broader staff  capabilities within DOT. We agree that this information is important.  However, we were not able to confirm the extent to which NHTSA  leveraged DOT\u2019s expertise because NHTSA did not provide this  information.
