On October 30, Recovery.gov (the federal Web site on Recovery Act spending) reported that more than 100,000 recipients had reported hundreds of thousands of jobs created or retained. GAO is required to comment quarterly on the estimates of jobs created or retained as reported by direct recipients of Recovery Act funding from federal agencies. In the first quarterly GAO report, being released today, we address the following issues: (1) the extent to which recipients were able to fulfill their reporting requirements and the processes in place to help ensure recipient reporting data quality and (2) how macroeconomic data and methods, and the recipient reports, can be used to help gauge the employment effects of the Recovery Act. Because the recipient reporting effort will be an ongoing process of cumulative reporting, our review represents a snapshot in time. At this juncture, given the national scale of the recipient reporting exercise and the limited time frames in which it was implemented, the ability of the reporting mechanism to handle the volume of data from a wide variety of recipients represents a solid first step in moving toward more transparency and accountability for federal funds; however, there is a range of significant reporting and quality issues that need to be addressed. Consequently, our report contains several recommendations to improve data quality that Office of Management and Budget (OMB) staff generally agreed to implement. We will continue to review the processes that federal agencies and recipients have in place to ensure the future completeness and accuracy of data reported. Finally, our report notes that because the recipient reports cover about one-third of Recovery Act funds, both the data in those reports and other macroeconomic data and methods together can offer a more complete view of the overall employment impact of the Recovery Act."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As detailed in our report, our analysis and fieldwork indicate there are significant issues to be addressed in reporting, data quality, and consistent application of OMB guidance in several areas. Many entries merit further attention due to an unexpected or atypical data value or relationship between data. As part of our review, we examined the relationship between recipient reports showing the presence or absence of any full-time equivalent (FTE) counts with the presence or absence of funding amounts shown in either or both data fields for \"amount of Recovery Act funds received\" and \"amount of Recovery Act funds expended.\" Forty-four percent of the prime recipient reports showed an FTE value. However,we identified 3,978 prime recipient reports where FTEs were reported but no dollar amount was reported in the data fields for amount of Recovery Act funds received and amount of Recovery Act funds expended. These records account for 58,386 of the total 640,329 FTEs reported. While OMB estimates that more than 90 percent of recipients reported, questions remain about the other 10 percent. Less than 1 percent of the records were marked as having undergone review by the prime recipient. The small percentage reviewed by the prime recipients themselves during the OMB review time frame warrants further examination. While it may be the case that the recipients' data quality review efforts prior to initial submission of their reports were seen as not needing further revision during the review timeframe, it may also be indicative of problems with the process of noting and recording when and how the prime recipient reviews occur and the setting of the review flag. In addition, the report record data included a flag as to whether a correction was initiated. Overall, slightly more than a quarter of the reports were marked as having undergone a correction during the period of review. In its guidance to recipients for estimating employment effects, OMB instructed recipients to report solely the direct employment effects as \"jobs created or retained\" as a single number. Problems with the interpretation of this guidance or the calculation of FTEs were one of the most significant problems we found. Jobs created or retained expressed in FTEs raised questions and concerns for some recipients. One source of inconsistency was variation in the period of performance used to calculate FTEs, which occurred in both the highway and education programs we examined. While there were problems of inconsistent interpretation of the guidance, the reporting process went relatively well for highway projects. DOT had an established procedure for reporting prior to enactment of the Recovery Act. As our report shows, in the cases of Education and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which do not have this prior reporting experience, we found more problems. State and federal officials are examining identified issues and have stated their intention to deal with them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to be here to discuss the report we are issuing  today on the first set of recipient reports made available in October 2009 in  response to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\u2019s section 1512  requirement.

As shown in figure 2, OMB specified time frames for  different stages in the reporting process: for this current report, prime  recipients and delegated subrecipients were to prepare and enter their  information from October 1 to October 10; prime recipients were able to  review the data for completeness and accuracy from October 11 to  October 21, and a federal agency review period began October 22.

We  built on information collected at the state, local, and program level as part  of our bimonthly reviews of selected states\u2019 and localities\u2019 uses of  Recovery Act funds. These bimonthly reviews focus on Recovery Act  implementation in 16 states and the District of Columbia, which contain  about 65 percent of the U.S. population and are estimated to receive  collectively about two-thirds of the intergovernmental federal assistance  funds available through the Recovery Act.", "To understand state quality review and reporting procedures, we visited  the 16 selected states and the District of Columbia during late September  and October 2009 and discussed with prime recipients projects associated  with 50 percent of the total funds reimbursed as of September 4, 2009, for  that state in the Federal-Aid Highway Program administered by the  Department of Transportation (DOT). Prior to the start of the reporting  period on October 1, we obtained information on prime recipients\u2019 plans  for the jobs data collection process. After the October 10 data reporting  period, we went back to see if prime recipients had followed their own  plans and subsequently talked with at least two subrecipients to gauge  their reactions to the reporting process and assess the documentation they  were required to submit. We gathered and examined issues raised by  recipients in these jurisdictions regarding reporting and data quality and  interviewed recipients on their experiences using the Web site reporting  mechanism. During the interviews, we looked at state plans for managing,  tracking, and reporting on Recovery Act funds and activities. In a similar  way, we examined a nonjudgmental sample of Department of Education  (Education) Recovery Act projects at the prime and subrecipient level. We  also collected information from selected transit agencies and housing  authorities as part of our bimonthly Recovery Act reviews.", "To gain insight into and understanding of quality review at the federal  level, we interviewed federal agency officials who have responsibility for  ensuring a reasonable degree of quality across their program\u2019s recipient  reports. We assessed the reports from the Inspectors General (IG) on  Recovery Act data quality reviews from 15 agencies. We are also  continuing to monitor and follow up on some of the major reporting issues  identified in the media and by other observers. For example, a number of  press articles have discussed concerns with the jobs reporting done by  Head Start grantees.

OMB guidance stated  that \u201cthe number of jobs should be expressed as \u2018full-time equivalents  (FTEs),\u2019 which is calculated as total hours worked in jobs created or  retained divided by the number of hours in a full-time schedule, as defined  by the recipient.\u201d Consequently, the recipients are expected to report the  amount of labor hired or not fired as result of having received Recovery  Act funds. It should be noted that one FTE does not necessarily equate to  the job of one person. Organizations may choose to increase the hours of  existing employees, for example, which can certainly be said to increase  employment but not necessarily be an additional job in the sense of adding  a person to the payroll.", "Problems with the interpretation of this guidance or the calculation of  FTEs were one of the most significant problems we found. Jobs created or  retained expressed in FTEs raised questions and concerns for some  recipients. While reporting employment effects as FTEs should allow for  the aggregation of different types of jobs\u2014part-time, full-time, or  temporary\u2014and different employment periods, if the calculations are not  consistent, the ability to aggregate the data is compromised.", "One source of inconsistency was variation in the period of performance  used to calculate FTEs, which occurred in both the highway and education  programs we examined. For example, in the case of federal highways  projects, some have been ongoing for six months, while others started in  September 2009. In attempting to address the unique nature of each  project, DOT\u2019s Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) faced the issue of  whether to report FTE data based on the length of time to complete the  entire project (project period of performance) versus a standard period of  performance, such as a calendar quarter, across all projects. According to  FHWA guidance, which was permitted by OMB, FTEs reported for each  highway project are expressed as an average monthly FTE. Because FTEs  are calculated by dividing hours worked by hours that represent a full-time  schedule, a standard period of performance is important if numbers are to  be added across programs.", "As an illustration, take a situation in which one project employed 10  people full time for 1 month, another project employed 10 people full time  for 2 months, and a third project employed 10 people full time for 3  months. FHWA\u2019s use of average monthly FTE would result in FTEs being  overstated compared either with using OMB\u2019s June 22 guidance or to  standardizing the reports for one quarter. Under FHWA\u2019s approach, 30  FTEs would be reported (10 for each of the three projects); on the other  hand, using a standardized measure, 20 FTEs would be reported (3-1/3 for  the first project, 6-2/3 for the second project, and 10 for the third).  Conversely, if a project starts later than the beginning of the reporting  period, applying OMB\u2019s June 22 guidance, which requires reporting of  FTEs on a cumulative basis, could result in reporting fewer FTEs than  would be the case under a standardized reporting period approach. In  either case, failure to standardize on a consistent basis prevents  meaningful comparison or aggregation of FTE data.", "This was also an issue for education programs. For example, in California,  two higher education systems calculated FTE differently. In the case of  one, they chose to use a 2-month period as the basis for the FTE  performance period. The other chose to use a year as the basis for the  FTE. The result is almost a three-to-one difference in the number of FTEs  reported for each university system in the first reporting period. Although  Education provides alternative methods for calculating an FTE, in neither  case does the guidance explicitly state the period of performance of the  FTE.", "OMB\u2019s decision to convert jobs into FTEs provides a consistent lens to  view the amount of labor being funded by the Recovery Act, provided each  recipient uses a standard time frame in calculating the FTE. The current  OMB guidance, however, creates a situation where, because there is no  standard starting or ending point, an FTE provides an estimate for the life  of the project. Without normalizing the FTE, aggregate numbers should  not be considered, and the issue of a standard period of performance is  magnified when looking across programs and across states.", "Recipients were also confused about counting a job created or retained  even though they knew the number of hours worked that were paid for  with Recovery Act funds. While OMB\u2019s guidance explains that in applying  the FTE calculation for measuring the number of jobs created or retained  recipients will need the total number of hours worked that are funded by  the Recovery Act, it could emphasize this relationship more thoroughly  throughout its guidance.", "While there were problems of inconsistent interpretation of the guidance,  the reporting process went relatively well for highway projects.
