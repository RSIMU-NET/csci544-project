In the next 6 years, the Missile Defense Agency (MDA), the developer, plans to invest about $58 billion more. MDA's overall goal is to produce a system that is capable of defeating enemy missiles launched from any range during any phase of their flight. MDA's approach is to field new capabilities in 2-year blocks. The first--Block 2004--was to provide some protection by December 2005 against attacks out of North Korea and the Middle East. Congress requires GAO to assess MDA's progress annually. This year's report assesses (1) MDA's progress during fiscal year 2005 and (2) whether capabilities fielded under Block 2004 met goals. To the extent goals were not met, GAO identifies reasons for shortfalls and discusses corrective actions that should be taken."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["MDA made good progress during fiscal year 2005 in the development and fielding of two of the seven elements reviewed. Most of the others encountered problems that slowed progress. Meanwhile, contractors for the seven elements exceeded their fiscal year budget by about $458 million, or about 14 percent, most of which was attributable to cost overruns in developing the Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element. Accelerating Block 2004 allowed MDA to successfully field missile defense assets faster than planned. But, MDA delivered fewer quantities than planned and exceeded the cost goal of $6.7 billion by about $1 billion. The increased cost is primarily the added cost of sustaining fielded assets. However, the increase would have been greater if some development and other activities had not been deferred into Block 2006. Also, MDA has been unable to verify actual system performance because of flight test delays. Time pressures caused MDA to stray from a knowledge-based acquisition strategy. Key aspects of product knowledge, such as technology maturity, are proven in a knowledge-based strategy before committing to more development. MDA followed a knowledge-based strategy with elements not being fielded, such as Airborne Laser and Kinetic Energy Interceptor. But it allowed the GMD program to concurrently mature technology, complete design activities, and produce and field assets before end-to-end testing of the system--all at the expense of cost, quantity, and performance goals. For example, the performance of some GMD interceptors is questionable because the program was inattentive to quality assurance. If the block approach continues to feature concurrency as a means of acceleration, MDA's approach may not be affordable for the considerable amount of capability that is yet to be developed and fielded. MDA has unusual flexibility to modify its strategies and goals, make trade-offs, and report on its progress. For example, MDA's Director may determine when cost variations are significant enough to report to Congress. MDA is taking actions to strengthen quality control. These actions are notable, but they do not address the schedule-induced pressures of fielding or enhancing a capability in a 2-year time frame or the need to fully implement a knowledge-based acquisition approach."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For nearly 50 years, the Department of Defense (DOD) has been spending  money to develop a missile defense system capable of protecting the U.S.  homeland and U.S. deployed forces from ballistic missile attacks. Since  1985, DOD has spent almost $90 billion for this purpose, and it plans to  invest an additional $58 billion, or about 14 percent of its research and  development budget, over the next 6 years. The Ballistic Missile Defense  System (BMDS) under development includes a diverse collection of land-,  air-, sea-, and space-based assets located around the globe and founded on  cutting-edge technology. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA)\u2014the  component within DOD responsible for managing the development of the  various missile defense programs\u2014originally focused on developing a test  bed in which the design of the various BMDS assets could be matured and  demonstrated. However, in 2002, the President directed MDA to begin  fielding an initial BMDS capability in the 2004 and 2005 time frame.", "MDA is currently developing eight BMDS elements: Ground-Based  Midcourse Defense (GMD); Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (Aegis BMD);  Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications (C2BMC);  Airborne Laser (ABL); Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI); Space Tracking  and Surveillance System (STSS); Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  (THAAD); and BMDS Sensors. MDA has adopted an evolutionary  acquisition approach in which the BMDS will be developed and fielded in  2-year blocks. The first block, known as Block 2004, ended on December  31, 2005. The block fielded an initial capability that includes initial  versions of GMD; Aegis BMD; Patriot Advanced Capability-3; and the  Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications elements.  This capability is designed to provide limited protection of the United  States from ballistic missile attacks out of North Korea and the Middle  East and protection of U.S. forces and critical assets from short- and  medium-range ballistic missiles. Future blocks are expected to enhance  this capability. Over time, MDA expects its block approach to produce an  overarching BMDS capable of protecting the United States, deployed  forces, friends, and allies from ballistic missile attacks of all ranges.", "To facilitate oversight of the ballistic missile defense program, the Defense  Authorization Acts for fiscal years 2002 and 2005 mandated that we  prepare annual assessments of MDA\u2019s ongoing progress. To date, we have  delivered assessments covering fiscal years 2003 and 2004 to Congress.  Because our assessment of MDA\u2019s fiscal year 2005 progress was ongoing  when Block 2004 ended, we were also able to make observations about the  outcome of the block. Specifically, this report  1.  assesses the progress MDA made during fiscal year 2005 toward the  fiscal year plans of work established by seven of the BMDS elements;  2.  compares the fielded Block 2004 capability with the quantity, cost, and  performance goals established for that capability;  3. identifies reasons why the fielded capability fell short of goals; and  4.  discusses corrective actions being taken by MDA.", "To address our objectives, we looked at the accomplishments of seven  BMDS elements\u2014GMD, Aegis BMD, C2BMC, ABL, KEI, STSS, and  THAAD. These elements collectively account for about 73 percent of  MDA\u2019s research and development budget. For each element, we examined  documents such as System Element Reviews, test plans and reports,  production plans, and Contract Performance Reports. We also interviewed  officials within each element program office and within MDA functional  offices, such as the Office of Safety, Quality, and Mission Assurance. In  addition, we discussed each element\u2019s test program and the results of tests  with DOD\u2019s Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation  (DOT&E).

For example, the initial capability emplaced in 2004 employs early-warning  satellites for launch detection, ground-based radars in California and  Alaska, and sea-based Aegis radars in the Sea of Japan for surveillance and  tracking of enemy missiles, interceptors at launch sites in Alaska and  California to engage and destroy incoming warheads, and command and  control nodes in Alaska and Colorado to orchestrate the mission.", "A typical scenario to engage an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)  would unfold as follows:  Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume of a  missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible attack.", "Upon receiving the alert, land- or sea-based radars are directed to track  the various objects released from the missile and, if so designed, to  identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors, decoys, and debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a \u201ckill vehicle\u201d mounted atop a  booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat. The interceptor boosts itself  toward a predicted intercept point and releases the kill vehicle.", "The kill vehicle uses its onboard sensors and divert thrusters to detect,  identify, and steer itself into the warhead. With a combined closing speed  on the order of 10 kilometers per second (22,000 miles per hour), the  warhead is destroyed through a \u201chit-to-kill\u201d collision with the kill vehicle  above the atmosphere.", "To develop a system capable of carrying out such an engagement, MDA is  executing an evolutionary acquisition strategy in which the development  of missile defense capabilities is organized in 2-year increments known as  blocks. In 2001, when it adopted the block strategy, MDA planned to  construct a test bed in which new sensors, weapon projects, and  enhancements to existing capabilities could be matured. When assets were  considered mature, MDA planned to integrate them into the BMDS to  increase the system\u2019s capability to respond to the evolving threat.  However, with the President\u2019s directive to begin fielding an initial BMDS  capability beginning in 2004, MDA switched its emphasis from developing  a test bed to developing and fielding an operational capability.", "MDA is completing its Block 2004 program of work. The associated  military capability of this block is primarily one for defending the United  States against ICBM attacks from North Korea and the Middle East,  although the block increases the United States\u2019 ability to engage short- and  medium-range ballistic missiles. Block 2004 is built around the GMD  element, augmented by shipboard Aegis BMD radars and missiles, and  integrated by the system-level C2BMC element. In addition, MDA  attempted to accelerate the fielding of the Forward-Based X-Band- Transportable (FBX-T) radar into Block 2004. This radar, being developed  by the Sensors Program Office, was originally intended for operation  during Block 2006.", "MDA is also carrying out an extensive research and development effort to  expand its current operational capability into future blocks. During fiscal  year 2005, MDA funded the development of four other major BMDS  elements in addition to the four elements that were to be fielded as part of  the Block 2004 BMDS. These elements are the ABL, KEI, STSS, and  THAAD. MDA expects to field a limited THAAD capability during Block  2008. The other elements, which are primarily in technology development,  will likely be fielded in later blocks. Table 1 provides a brief description of  all elements being developed by MDA. More information about them is  provided in appendix II.", "Since 2002, missile defense has been seen as a national priority and has  been funded nearly at requested levels. However, DOD\u2019s Program Budget  Decision of December 2004 called for MDA to plan for a $5 billion  reduction in funding over fiscal years 2006-2011. In addition, MDA will  continue to compete with hundreds of existing and planned technology  development and acquisition programs for research, development, and  evaluation funding.

In 2005, the  program installed C2BMC suites (communications software and  hardware) at U.S. Strategic Command, U. S. Northern Command, and U.S.  Pacific Command. The additions at U.S. Strategic Command and U.S.  Northern Command provide redundant capability and more flexibility to  test, exercise, and maintain the C2BMC. MDA also planned to install a Web  browser in the United Kingdom, to provide situational awareness for the  British government. However, the Web browser will not be operational  until 2006 because DOD did not complete final policy agreements as  scheduled.", "Development of two C2BMC software upgrades was also completed  during the fiscal year. The first upgrade gave C2BMC the ability to display  GMD assets on the user\u2019s computer monitors, improved the user\u2019s ability  to call up BMDS information, reduced the time to transfer force-level  planning files, and installed the software and hardware necessary to  provide an operational capability at U.S. Pacific Command. The final  decision to make the U.S. Pacific Command suite operational has not yet  been made, but a decision is expected in March 2006. Completion of the  second upgrade was a little behind schedule, but it was completed by the  first quarter of calendar year 2006. Development of the upgrade, known as  Spiral 4.5, was completed by the end of September 2005, but all testing is  not expected to be completed until the end of March 2006.

Of the three planned intercept tests, the  program conducted one (IFT-14). However, this test was also aborted  when the interceptor failed to launch. MDA planned two other intercept  tests, but the tests did not take place because MDA restructured GMD\u2019s  test plan after the interceptor failures to implement a less risky test  strategy.

To complete all tests as  planned, the officials told us that there can be no test failures.", "The Airborne Laser Program Office planned to complete tests of the  element\u2019s high-energy laser by September 30, 2005. The laser is a  component of the ABL prototype that will be used to demonstrate the  element\u2019s lethality as early as the 2008 time frame. Prior to installing the  laser on the prototype aircraft, the program tested the laser in its System  Integration Laboratory at Edwards Air Force Base. Program officials  expected the tests, which began in November 2004, to be completed by the  end of fiscal year 2005. During this time frame, officials wanted to  demonstrate that the laser could generate 100 percent of its design power  and that it could repeatedly operate at that power for periods of about   10 seconds. As of October 2005, the laser had produced 83 percent of the  power it is designed to generate and was able to operate for periods of  about 5 \u00bc seconds. After solving technical problems with the laser\u2019s abort  system and completing the planned installation of an ammonia cooling  system, the program was able, in December 2005, to extend the laser\u2019s  operating time to more than 10 seconds. Although the laser has not  reached 100 percent of its design power, officials told us that the   83 percent obtained thus far is sufficient to achieve 95 percent of  maximum lethal range against all classes of ballistic missiles. The ABL  Program Manager originally told us that he expected the laser to remain in  the system integration laboratory until it produced 100 percent of its  design power. Nonetheless, on December 9, 2005, MDA\u2019s Director gave the  ABL program permission to disassemble the System Integration  Laboratory and install the laser on the aircraft. Program officials told us  that they would continue to test the laser, when the aircraft is on the  ground, in an attempt to demonstrate that the laser can produce   100 percent of its design power.", "During fiscal year 2005, the STSS program intended to integrate and test  the spacecraft for two demonstration satellites and integrate and test the  sensor payload, which includes surveillance and tracking sensors, for the  first of the two satellites. The program is constructing the demonstration  satellites from hardware developed by the Space-Based Infrared System- Low program before it was canceled in 1999 and plans to launch the  satellites in fiscal year 2007, after all hardware has been integrated and  tested. The program did not complete the payload integration and test  activities in fiscal year 2005, as planned, because thermal vacuum testing  is taking longer than expected. Hardware issues have emerged as the  payload is being tested in a vacuum and at cold temperatures for the first  time. For example, in a vacuum, the sensors\u2019 optics did not cool to the  desired temperature and the power supply to the acquisition sensor\u2019s  signal processor failed. The program office believes that repairs will  correct the problems, but program officials are in the process of deciding  whether further tests must be completed after the repairs are made and  before the sensor payload is placed aboard the satellite.", "As part of its fiscal year 2005 activities, the KEI program intended to  complete a number of tasks that would have enabled it to conduct the  NFIRE experiment. The experiment places sensors aboard a satellite that  will be launched into space, where the sensors will observe and collect  infrared imagery of boosting intercontinental ballistic missiles. In fiscal  year 2005, the KEI program expected to calibrate and deliver the sensor  payload, complete the space vehicle integration and acceptance test,  procure targets, and certify mission operation readiness. However,  anomalies in the sensor payload delayed the delivery of the payload, in  turn delaying the remaining activities. The day-to-day management of all  NFIRE activities has since been transferred to the STSS program, which  has extensive experience with the development of satellites.

Although the GMD contractor  experienced the largest overrun, exceeding its fiscal year 2005 budget by  approximately 25 percent, it is notable that the ABL contractor overran its  fiscal year budget. The ABL contract had been restructured in 2004 to  provide a more realistic cost estimate for the work planned.

All estimates of the contracts\u2019 costs at  completion are based on the contractors\u2019 performance through fiscal year  2005. Collectively, the six contracts, for which data were available to  estimate a cost at completion, could overrun their budgets by about   $1.3 billion to $2.1 billion. It should be noted that the cost variance at  completion projected for most of the contracts is based on more than one  block of work. For example, the STSS contract covers the contractor\u2019s  work on Block 2006 and Block 2010. Appendix III provides further details  regarding the performance of the prime contractors for the seven elements  shown in the table.", "About $240 million of the GMD overrun can be traced to the interceptor,  with the EKV accounting for more than 42 percent, or $102 million, of that  amount. The EKV\u2019s cost growth was caused by poor quality control  procedures and technical problems during development, testing, and  production. The interceptor\u2019s cost also grew when the contractor had to  bring a new supplier online to produce the motors for the BV+ booster,  one of the two boosters being developed to carry the EKV into space. A  new supplier was needed because explosions at the old supplier\u2019s plant  prevented it from delivering the motors.", "As of September 30, 2005, the SBX radar, which is also being developed by  the GMD program, had also overrun its fiscal year budget by about   $55 million. The cost of developing this component increased when  numerous unplanned changes were made to the platform that holds the  radar, subcontractor costs could not be negotiated at the expected price,  and additional efforts were required to ensure a functional radome.", "The ABL prime contractor also experienced cost growth during fiscal year  2005, even though the ABL contract had been restructured in 2004. This  action provided a more realistic budget and schedule for remaining  contract activities leading up to a 2008 ABL lethality demonstration. With  the restructure, the contractor was no longer required to report past cost  and schedule growth. However, in fiscal year 2005, the contractor once  again reported that ABL\u2019s cost was growing and that some work had been  delayed. Cost grew and schedules slipped as the contractor made software  changes to address problems identified during tests of the Beam  Control/Fire Control, modified the laser\u2019s abort system so that it would not  shut down the operation of the laser prematurely, and reprioritized  activities throughout the program. Other costs were attributable to  problems with ABL\u2019s Active Ranger System and Beacon Illuminator Laser.  For example, the contractor\u2019s cost grew when it redesigned and replaced  contaminated, damaged, and inefficient optics in the commercial off-the- shelf Active Ranger System. In addition, the contractor incurred additional  cost because numerous faults in the power supply for the Beacon  Illuminator Laser forced changes in circuit cards and circuit boards.", "For the first time since the THAAD contract was awarded, in 2000, the cost  of the work being performed in a given fiscal year was greater than the  funds budgeted for that work. The THAAD Program Office attributed the  contractor\u2019s overrun to unanticipated missile integration problems. For  example, the Flight Termination Assembly, which is responsible for  terminating a THAAD missile in flight, failed qualification tests that in turn  delayed qualification of the next larger assembly. In another instance,  work was delayed while engineers determined why telemetry equipment,  which is placed aboard a test missile to report the missile\u2019s condition in  flight, sent corrupted data to the test station. Program officials told us that  the program solved all known problems that could have prevented a  successful first flight test. However, the officials said that the missile still  has telemetry problems that prevent the test station from collecting all of  the data that will be generated in the third flight test.

Although MDA was developing an alternate source for boosters, the  second developer could not produce all of the boosters needed to field   20 interceptors. Therefore, MDA decided two interceptors would be  diverted for testing. One was used in ground testing, and the second,  which will not be built until calendar year 2006, will be used in a flight test.  In mid-2005, after two unsuccessful flight tests, the GMD Program Office  reduced its goal for operational interceptors further\u2014from 18 to 14\u2014to  set aside more interceptors for ground tests.

To date, around $90 billion has been spent, and over the next   6 years, DOD expects that it will need about $58 billion more to enhance  the BMDS. Beyond that, more funding will be required if DOD is to reach  its ultimate goal of developing a system capable of countering ballistic  missile launches from any range during all phases of flight. By driving to a  fielding date during Block 2004, MDA placed assets in the field faster than  originally planned. However, in doing so, MDA strayed from the  knowledge-based approach that allows successful developers to deliver,  within budget, a product whose performance has been demonstrated.  Instead, MDA fielded assets before their capability was known. In  addition, the full cost of this capability is not transparent to decision  makers because MDA has deferred the cost of some Block 2004 activities  into the next block.", "The fielding of the Block 2004 capability provides an opportunity for DOD  to take stock of the approach it has taken thus far on missile defense and  determine whether changes are warranted for its approach to future  blocks. We believe they are. The concurrent development approach  dictated by the directed fielding date and enabled by considerable  flexibility to lower goals and defer capability has resulted in delivering  fewer assets than planned. Accountability has been very broadly applied  as to mean delivering some capability within funding allocations. While  recognizing this approach did successfully accelerate fielding, to the  extent it continues to feature concurrency as a means for acceleration, it  may not be affordable for the considerable amount of capability that is yet  to be developed and fielded. While the effects of this approach were  perhaps most keenly felt with the Block 2004 capability, signs of its  continuance can be seen in the developmental activities that were  deferred during fiscal year 2005.", "It is possible for MDA to return to a knowledge-based approach to  development while still fielding capability in blocks. To its credit, MDA  instituted its own audits and is heeding the results of those audits in taking  a number of steps to correct the quality assurance and testing problems  encountered thus far. Yet these corrective actions have not gone far  enough to put all of the BMDS elements on a knowledge-based approach  to development and fielding. MDA\u2019s experience during Block 2004 shows  that it may not always be possible to deliver a capability in a 2-year time  frame. Clearly, a block or stepped approach to fielding a new system is  preferable to attempting a single step to full capability. However, a  primary tenet of a knowledge-based acquisition strategy is that a program  should be event- rather than schedule-driven.

DOD  partially concurred with our first recommendation. DOD stated that MDA  has implemented a knowledge-based acquisition strategy that relies upon  discrete activities to produce data that can be used to judge an element\u2019s  progress. DOD noted that unlike the knowledge points discussed in DOD  acquisition regulations, the knowledge points used by MDA are discrete  points, not reviews. According to DOD, MDA\u2019s strategy is consistent with  the principles of DOD acquisition regulations while providing MDA\u2019s  Director with the flexibility to determine their applicability to the BMDS  block development concept. We agree that knowledge is obtained through  discrete events, such as a successful test or the completion of a  cost/benefit analysis, but we define knowledge points as meaning more  than discrete events. Rather, knowledge must be looked at in the  aggregate. For example, the knowledge gained from a number of discrete  events must be considered collectively to confirm that the design of a  system is stable. It is these aggregations that we consider to be the  knowledge points that should form the basis for investment decisions. For  example, the GMD program\u2019s successful demonstration of various  functions of the BMDS engagement may have been sufficient to continue  funding of the element\u2019s development, but the discrete events were not  sufficient to demonstrate that the element\u2019s design and production  processes were sufficiently mature to begin production and fielding. We  also note that the knowledge points discussed in DOD acquisition  regulations do represent measurable, demonstrated knowledge, such as  technology and design maturity, that then become the basis for reviews.  They are not the reviews themselves, as reviews can take place regardless  of the level of knowledge available.", "DOD also partially concurred with our recommendation that MDA assess  whether the 2-year block strategy is compatible with a knowledge-based  acquisition strategy. DOD stated that MDA uses knowledge points to  establish block goals and makes adjustments to those goals when  necessary. DOD noted that the 2-year block strategy is compatible with  this approach. We have not seen the decisions made on Block 2004 as  being consistent with knowledge points. During Block 2004, MDA allowed  the GMD program to complete all phases of the acquisition cycle\u2014 technology development, product design, production, and fielding\u2014 simultaneously to enable the program to field a capability within the 2-year  time frame. If MDA is to be truly knowledge-based, it must be dedicated to  taking the time to gather the knowledge needed to be successful in the  next acquisition phase. Because MDA did not follow this strategy in Block  2004, we still believe that MDA should assess future blocks to determine  whether those blocks can be developed within the 2-year time frame  without resorting to a concurrent schedule.", "DOD did not concur with our third recommendation to adopt more  transparent criteria for identifying and reporting program changes. In  responding to this recommendation, DOD responded that MDA in 2005, by  statute, began submitting fielding baselines to Congress and must report  significant cost, schedule, or performance variances to these baselines in  future reports. DOD believes that these reports and the quarterly reviews  conducted by DOD staff provide an adequate level of oversight. We agree  that MDA is required to report significant variances to established  baselines to Congress and that MDA keeps DOD informed about the  Ballistic Missile Defense program. However, given the management  flexibilities accorded MDA and the large amount of resources (more than  $50 billion) that DOD currently plans for missile defense, more transparent  criteria is needed for better program management and oversight.", "DOD provided technical comments to our draft report, which we  considered and incorporated as appropriate.

One of these successful intercepts, Flight Test Mission  (FTM) 04-1, was conducted in fiscal year 2005. Operational test officials  reported that the test incorporated many operational characteristics. For  example, the warfighter had no preknowledge of the target launch time,  the target was representative of a real-world threat, and the fielded missile  configuration was used. However, the officials said that in early tests,  including FTM 04-1, ship position with respect to the target\u2019s trajectory  was controlled to increase the probability of intercept. The officials are  recommending that in future tests Aegis BMD\u2019s tactical mission planner  should dictate the ship\u2019s position and the sectors that its radar searches,  rather than the program scripting the ship\u2019s locations and its radar\u2019s  search sectors.", "Additional tests are also needed to demonstrate that the program has  resolved problems that limit the SM-3 missile\u2019s ability to divert to its  target. Although the current configuration is adequate for the current  threat, the missile will require more divert capability if it is to hit more  complex targets and targets with more challenging trajectories than were  seen in early tests. For example, the missile\u2019s Solid Divert and Attitude  Control System (SDACS) needs to operate in a pulse mode, rather than its  current sustain mode, to increase the missile\u2019s ability to maneuver toward  its target. Performance problems with the SDACS\u2019s pulse mode of  operation were first noticed in a June 2003 flight test, Flight Mission (FM)- 5, and have remained a concern to the program. Program officials  modified the SDACS\u2019s design in fiscal year 2005, and they believe that the  root cause of the problem is understood.

If the tests are successful, the pulsed SDACS could  be incorporated into the missile in fiscal year 2007. Although the earliest  fielded missiles will not be capable of pulse mode operation, which will  reduce their divert capability, program officials believe that these missiles  will provide a credible defense against a large population of the threat.
