The HRF, as part of DOD's CBRN Response Enterprise, is intended to bridge the gap between the National Guard's initial response to a CBRN incident and any need for additional capabilities that the DOD military services' active-duty personnel can provide, if requested. The HRF is to provide command and control, search and extraction, medical triage, decontamination, fatality search and recovery, and assistance and support capabilities.", "House Report 114-102 included a provision that GAO review matters related to the HRF.

Six HRF Commanders told GAO that they have a goal to train between 10 percent and 30 percent additional National Guard personnel with prior HRF or similar mission experience. According to the HRF Commanders, these additional personnel, over the 583 authorized personnel, can mitigate the loss of personnel through turnover and other deployment disqualification factors, such as medical and personal factors. The capability and readiness measures indicate that the 10 HRFs are prepared for their mission. However, while the Federal Emergency Management Agency Region X (Washington) HRF partially deployed to support civil authorities after a mudslide occurred, until an entire HRF is deployed in response to a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) incident, the HRF capabilities and mission readiness will not be entirely known.", "DOD has made progress in incorporating the HRF into the CBRN Response Enterprise by updating plans, guidance, and exercises.

The  Department of Defense (DOD) often is expected to play a prominent role  supporting civil authorities and must be prepared to provide a rapid  response when called upon to respond to an incident. In the 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review Report, the Secretary of Defense directed  DOD to restructure its Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and  High-Yield Explosives Consequence Management Response Force to  enhance its lifesaving capabilities, maximize its flexibility, and reduce  response times through regional forces. In response, DOD established  the Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear (CBRN) Response  Enterprise and, according to DOD\u2019s estimate, between fiscal year 2011  and 2012 the department spent about $43 million to establish the  Homeland Response Force (HRF) as part of that enterprise. The HRF  consists of 10 National Guard forces\u2014one in each of the 10 Federal  Emergency Management Agency regions across the United States. Each  of the 10 HRFs consists of 583 authorized Army and Air National Guard  personnel who, as part of the HRF, are to bridge the gap between the  initial response by the National Guard in its State Active Duty or Title 32  status to a Governor\u2019s request for assistance and the need for additional  capabilities provided by the active-duty military service members in their  Title 10 status. According to the DOD analysis conducted prior to and  during the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report, the addition of the  HRF to DOD\u2019s CBRN Response Enterprise would provide critical  advantages through faster response times; additional personnel for  lifesaving capabilities; increased regional distribution and integration; a  better balance between state and federal consequence management of  the incident response; and a comprehensive approach to training,  evaluation, and exercises.", "In December 2011, we found that the Chemical, Biological, Radiological,  Nuclear, and High-Yield Explosive (CBRNE) Enhanced Response Force  Package (CERFP) which comprise National Guard personnel, faced  personnel, training, and equipment challenges. We made a number of  recommendations to improve preparedness and ensure effective  command and control of CERFP operations, among other  improvements. As of June 2016, DOD had implemented 10 of our 11  recommendations. In addition, in June 2015, we testified on the progress  and remaining challenges DOD faces in addressing our  recommendations to strengthen its strategy, plans, and guidance in  support of civil authorities. See the Related GAO Reports section for  additional reports on support of civil authorities.", "House Report 114-102, accompanying a bill for the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, included a provision that we  review the preparedness of the HRF to accomplish its mission.

We analyzed each HRF evaluation report to identify  any systemic capability strengths or areas for improvement that the  National Guard Bureau had identified during the evaluations. We  reviewed the process used by the National Guard Bureau to ensure the  reliability and validity of its own evaluation process and determined that  the evaluation process was sufficient for our use in examining the status  of HRF capabilities. We relied on the results of those 10 evaluations  rather than conducting an independent assessment of HRF capabilities.  To describe the current status of HRF readiness\u2014the personnel, related  training, and equipment necessary to conduct the mission\u2014we analyzed  readiness information for each HRF input into DOD\u2019s Defense Readiness  Reporting System for fiscal year 2012, the year by which all 10 HRFs  were established, through March 2016. We also conducted a data  reliability assessment of the information in the Defense Readiness  Reporting System. We provided a questionnaire on the readiness system  to officials in the National Guard Bureau\u2019s CBRN Enterprise Training and  Readiness Office. We reviewed their responses to our questionnaire and  interviewed the official responsible for maintaining the readiness data  input by each HRF. We determined that the information was reliable for  our purposes. We received responses from all 10 HRF Commanders to a  survey on personnel, on the relevance of training on readiness, and on  equipment needed to conduct the mission. In addition, we conducted four  site visits to HRFs located in Federal Emergency Management Agency  Region III (Pennsylvania), Region IV (Georgia), Region VI (Texas), and  Region X (Washington), based on factors such as HRF readiness, forces  with upcoming exercises, regions with cities with an Urban Areas Security  Initiative designation, and input from various DOD CBRN Response and  Federal Emergency Management Agency officials, among other factors.  We chose these HRFs because they had at one time deployed part of  their force to support civil authorities, had upcoming exercises scheduled,  or were recommended by officials knowledgeable of the HRF. During our  site visits, we interviewed HRF Commanders and personnel about  maintaining capabilities and readiness and observed equipment and  temporary facilities used to support a response. While our discussions  and observations from these visits are not generalizable, the information  we collected from the HRF Commanders and their personnel provide  context for the evaluation results and the Commander\u2019s comments from  the readiness system.", "To assess DOD\u2019s progress incorporating the HRF into the DOD CBRN  Response Enterprise, we reviewed plans and guidance from the   U.S. Northern Command, the U.S. Pacific Command, the National Guard  Bureau, the Army, and the Air Force. For example, we reviewed the U.S.  Northern Command\u2019s and the U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s Defense Support  of Civil Authorities (DSCA) plans and the National Guard Bureau\u2019s HRF  guidance, including the HRF/CERFP Concept of Operation.

In  particular, the plan strongly recommends the use of a dual-status  commander for medium- and large-scale consequence management  support operations requiring the deployment of a HRF, the Defense  CBRN Response Force, or the Command and Control CBRN Response  Element follow-on forces. U.S. Pacific Command officials stated that the  command\u2019s DSCA plan anticipates the use of Title 10 CBRN forces  already assigned to the area of responsibility to provide immediate  response if requested, and also noting a close working relationship with  state leadership in Hawaii. The plan contains multiple pre-planned force  packages, sets of capabilities, to support a response to various incident  scenarios, several of which reference the California HRF capabilities. For  example, the plan contains a scenario in which a pre-planned force  package for CBRN capability would support a response in two  geographically-separated areas or islands (e.g., Hawaii, Guam, or  American Samoa) in the U.S. Pacific Command\u2019s area of responsibility to  provide support to CBRN search and extraction, decontamination,  emergency medical, ground medical evacuation, aviation medical  evacuation and casualty evacuation, and security and logistics.

This concept of operation includes an outline of the structure of  the HRF elements through task organization charts, provides time frames  for a response to CBRN incidents, and provides guidance and  expectations for how the HRF will prepare for and respond to a request  for support. The HRF/CERFP Concept of Operation reinforces the HRF  mission as a support mechanism that responds to CBRN incidents when  directed by the Secretary of Defense, coordinated by the Chief of the  National Guard Bureau, and with the consent of the governors of the  affected states. For example, the HRF/CERFP Concept of Operation  describes the role of the National Guard Coordination Center to  coordinate and synchronize notification and deployment of National  Guard forces, such as the HRF and any additional follow-on National  Guard CBRN forces, in response to a request for support after a CBRN  incident. In addition, the National Guard Coordination Center coordinates  information exchange between the state requesting support, the National  Guard, the U.S. Northern Command, and the National Military Command  Center to include information on deployment of National Guard and Title  10 CBRN Response Enterprise forces.", "In addition, the National Guard Bureau drafted an instruction and a  manual for the management of the HRF, among other CBRN response  forces, which National Guard Bureau officials stated will support the  incorporation of the HRF into DOD CBRN response operations by  informing DOD and state emergency managers about HRF capabilities  and response operations. These two guidance documents will also  include roles and responsibilities for HRF management and planning  expectations, which will support regional response and unity of effort with  combatant commands, states, and local first responders in a CBRN  incident response. The instruction was issued in June 2016, as this report  was in its final stages. National Guard Bureau officials said that the  manual is under review. The guidance is intended for use by DOD\u2019s  CBRN Response Enterprise and all of the U.S. states\u2019 and territories\u2019  emergency management departments.", "Further, the Army and the Air Force have taken actions to incorporate the  HRF by issuing joint guidance. The guidance provides doctrine and  tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as information setting the  foundation for the tactical employment of the HRF. In addition, the  guidance outlines the structure, element composition, capabilities, and  planning considerations of the HRF, among other things.

At a minimum, the HRFs are expected to  participate in collective training exercises with two or more HRFs and  CERFPs. The guidance indicates that, during collective training, the HRF  should be assessed using the Joint Mission Essential Task List, which  includes the tasks likely to be used during a response to a CBRN  incident. Each organization is synchronizing its exercise schedule with the  primary collective exercises, Vibrant Response and Vigilant Guard.   U.S. Northern Command officials told us that its exercises will be  synchronized by fiscal year 2017. National Guard Bureau officials told us  that it will take 2 more years to synchronize its exercise schedule  because planning for exercises in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 is already  underway. In particular, National Guard Bureau officials are in the  process of synchronizing a 6-year exercise schedule from fiscal year  2018 through fiscal year 2023 that includes the consolidation and  alignment of the evaluations, inspections, Vigilant Guard, collective  training exercises, and special focus exercises for the HRF and other  regional CBRN forces.", "According to U.S. Northern Command and National Guard Bureau  officials, synchronization will increase the opportunity for National Guard  and Title 10 forces to exercise together and will focus the exercises on  individual regional response. In support of increasing the opportunity for  Title 10 and National Guard forces to exercise together, U.S. Northern  Command issued guidance that authorizes the deployment of part of the  Title 10 Defense CBRN Response Force to participate in National Guard- sponsored Vigilant Guard exercises. This includes allowing personnel  from the Defense CBRN Response Force participating in the exercise to  be under the command and control structure established for the specific  Vigilant Guard exercise, which may include operating under a dual-status  commander construct. Figure 6 shows the Region X (Washington) HRF  participating in a CBRN exercise.", "In response to our survey, about half of the HRF Commanders reported  that they had exercised with Title 10 CBRN response forces in fiscal  years 2013-15, as shown in figure 7.", "With the synchronization of these exercises with other scheduled events  and exercises (i.e., special focus events, evaluations, inspections,  deployment readiness exercises, and other collective training events),  CBRN Response Enterprise forces will likely have more opportunities to  practice command and control and the dual-status commander concept  together.

We analyzed each HRF evaluation report to  identify any systemic capability strengths or areas for improvement that  the National Guard Bureau had identified during individual HRF  evaluations. In addition, we reviewed summary results of evaluations  conducted for fiscal years 2011-13 to understand the types of capabilities  issues that were identified in the first 2 years of the establishment of the  HRF. The National Guard Bureau\u2019s Joint Interagency Training and  Education Center relies on the use of standard actions and tasks, from  the Joint Mission Essential Task List and Training and Exercise Outlines,  for each HRF capability to ensure the validity of the evaluation.   In addition, the Joint Interagency Training and Education Center uses a  standard grading process during the evaluation to ensure the reliability of  each HRF evaluation. We reviewed the process used by the Joint  Interagency Training and Education Center to ensure the reliability and  validity of its own evaluation process and determined that the evaluation  process was sufficient for our use in assessing the status of HRF  capabilities. We relied on the results of those 10 evaluations rather than  conducting an independent assessment of HRF capabilities.", "To describe the status of HRF readiness, we examined readiness  information and conducted a survey of all 10 HRF Commanders. In  accordance with the HRF\u2019s Concept of Operation and the Department of  Defense\u2019s (DOD) Defense Readiness Reporting System, we focused our  review of readiness on the personnel, related training, and equipment  necessary to conduct the HRF mission in response to a chemical,  biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) incident. In the Defense  Readiness Reporting System, training is reported as part of the  assessment of HRF personnel. We reviewed readiness ratings for each  HRF as recorded in DOD\u2019s Defense Readiness Reporting System for  fiscal year 2012, the first year all 10 HRFs were established, through  March 2016. In addition, we reviewed the HRF Commanders\u2019 comments  input into the Defense Readiness Reporting System, to identify any  issues impacting readiness. We conducted a data reliability assessment  of the information in DOD\u2019s Defense Readiness Reporting System. We  provided a questionnaire on the readiness system to officials in the  National Guard Bureau\u2019s CBRN Enterprise Training and Readiness  Office. We reviewed their responses to our questionnaire and interviewed  the official responsible for maintaining the readiness data input by each  HRF. During two site visits, we observed how the HRF personnel input  information into their system. We determined that the readiness  information from the Defense Readiness Reporting System was reliable  for our purposes.", "In addition, we sent a survey to all 10 HRF Commanders on the  personnel, the relevance of training on readiness, and on equipment  needed to conduct the mission. As part of the survey development, we  conducted an expert review and pre-tested the draft survey. We  submitted the questionnaire for review by our survey specialist, our  subject matter expert on CBRN, and HRF topic experts from the National  Guard Bureau. The expert review phase was intended to ensure that  content necessary to understand the questions was included and that  technical information included in the survey was correct. To minimize  errors that might occur from respondents interpreting our questions  differently than we intended, we pre-tested our questionnaire with  Commanders and senior staff from three HRFs. During the pre-tests  conducted by video teleconference and telephone, we asked the HRF  officials to read the instructions and each question aloud and to tell us  how they interpreted the question. We then discussed the instructions  and questions with officials to identify any problems and potential  solutions by determining whether (1) the instructions and questions were  clear and unambiguous, (2) the terms we used were accurate, (3) the  questionnaire was unbiased, (4) the questionnaire did not place an undue  burden on the officials completing it. We noted any potential problems  and modified the questionnaire based on feedback from the expert  reviewers and pre-tests, as appropriate. In addition, we provided the  survey to the National Guard Bureau for a classification review to  determine whether any of the survey questions would elicit classified  responses and/or whether the compilation of the survey responses  themselves would create a classified response. National Guard Bureau  officials determined that the survey responses would not be classified.", "We sent an email to each HRF Commander beginning on   November 16, 2015, notifying them about the topics of our survey and  when we expected to send the survey. We then sent the   self-administered Microsoft Word form questionnaire and a cover email to  the HRF Commanders on November 18, 2015, and asked them to fill in  the questionnaire and email it back to us within 2 weeks. We closed the  survey on December 14, 2015. We received 10 completed questionnaires  for an overall response rate of 100 percent. Because we collected data  from every HRF rather than a sample of forces, there was no sampling  error. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey may  introduce errors, commonly referred to as non-sampling errors. For  example, differences in how a particular question is interpreted, the  sources of information available to respondents, how the responses were  processed and analyzed, or the types of people who do not respond can  influence the accuracy of the survey results. We took steps in the  development of the survey, the data collection, and the data analysis to  minimize these non-sampling errors and help ensure the accuracy of the  answers that were obtained. For example, a social science survey  specialist designed the questionnaire, in collaboration with our staff with  subject matter expertise. Then, as noted earlier, the draft questionnaire  was pre-tested to ensure that questions were relevant, clearly stated, and  easy to comprehend. The questionnaire was also reviewed by external  experts at the National Guard Bureau and our survey specialist, as  mentioned above. Data were electronically extracted from the Microsoft  Word questionnaires into a comma-delimited file that was then imported  into a statistical program for analyses. Only one variable was manually  entered (the HRF\u2019s state) and that data entry accuracy was verified. We  examined the survey results and performed computer analyses to identify  inconsistencies and other indications of error, and addressed such issues  as necessary. Quantitative data analyses were conducted by our survey  specialist using statistical software and a review of open-ended  responses was conducted by our staff with subject matter expertise. A  data analyst conducted an independent check of the statistical computer  programs for accuracy.", "In figure 8, we show the verbatim wording of key survey questions whose  results are discussed in this report.", "Finally, we selected four HRFs to visit to discuss and observe the actions  taken to maintain HRF capabilities and readiness that we examined in the  National Guard Bureau\u2019s evaluations and readiness reports. While our  discussions and observations from these visits are not generalizable, the  information we collected from the HRF Commanders and their personnel  provide context for the evaluation results and the Commanders\u2019  comments from the readiness reporting systems.

We chose  these HRFs because they deployed part of their force to support civil  authority, had upcoming exercises scheduled, or were recommended by  officials knowledgeable of the HRF. During our site visits, we interviewed  HRF Commanders and personnel about mission capabilities and  readiness and the actions they take to maintain capabilities and  readiness. In addition, we reviewed equipment inventories and observed  some of the temporary facilities used to support a CBRN response.", "To assess the extent to which DOD has made progress incorporating the  HRF into its CBRN Response Enterprise, we collected plans, policies,  and guidance from the National Guard Bureau; the Joint Chiefs of Staff;  the U.S. Northern Command; the U.S. Pacific Command; the Army; and  the Air Force.", "We reviewed DOD guidance and other documents including the Strategy  for Homeland Defense and Defense Support of Civil Authorities as well  as the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review Report to gain an  understanding of the department\u2019s priorities and efforts to restructure the  enterprise and its support of civil authorities during CBRN incidents in the  United States. We also reviewed U.S. Northern Command\u2019s and U.S.  Pacific Command\u2019s Defense Support of Civil Authorities (DSCA) plans to  assess the extent to which the combatant commands incorporated the  HRF into their plans. In addition, we examined the National Guard  Bureau\u2019s HRF policies and guidance, including the Implementation Base  Plan (IMPLAN)\u2013Homeland Response Force (HRF/CERFP) and the  HRF/CERFP Concept of Operation, and a draft instruction and manual on  the management of the HRF, to determine the extent to which the  National Guard Bureau incorporated the HRF into its CBRN response.  Further, we examined the Army and Air Force\u2019s joint guidance for HRF  operations, Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear, and High-Yield  Explosives Enhanced Response Force Package (CERFP)/Homeland  Response Force (HRF) Operations, to understand the military services\u2019  inclusion of the HRF in their operations guidance.
