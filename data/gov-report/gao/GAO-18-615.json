According to State policy, as soon as M/PRI becomes aware of potentially qualifying incidents, M/PRI will start the process for considering whether the incident warrants an ARB. M/PRI relies on informal communication to identify potentially qualifying incidents to begin the vetting process because State does not have a policy, procedure, or process for internal communication of such incidents to M/PRI, according to State officials and GAO analysis. As illustrated in the figure below, other State entities began responding to the incidents in early 2017, but M/PRI was not made aware of the incidents until mid-August 2017, when a former M/PRI official contacted the office after seeing media reports. If M/PRI is not aware of incidents, it cannot initiate State's ARB incident vetting process. This situation puts State at risk of not meeting statutory time frames for convening an ARB and could result in State being less able to improve security programs and practices at other U.S. diplomatic posts.

According to State  officials and our analysis, State\u2019s FAM and Foreign Affairs Handbooks do  not establish a policy, procedure, or process for internal communication of  such incidents to M/PRI. In 2006, the Under Secretary of State for  Management issued a cable requiring U.S. diplomatic posts to report  potential ARB incidents directly to M/PRI.

Despite the  2006 cable on potential ARB incident reporting, in 2013, State\u2019s Inspector  General found that State had no systematic process ensuring immediate  notification of security-related incidents to M/PRI, and that DS did not  routinely provide security reports to M/PRI. The Inspector General made  an informal recommendation that DS should include M/PRI as an  addressee on all security-related incident reports. In 2015, the Inspector  General noted that DS, in response to the recommendation, said that  such a blanket inclusion of M/PRI on all security-related incident reports  would result in M/PRI being inundated with a large number of irrelevant  reports.", "Because State has no policy that ensures M/PRI becomes aware of  incidents that may involve injury, loss of life, or destruction of property,  M/PRI officials said they typically become aware of potentially qualifying  incidents\u2014such as explosions at diplomatic facilities\u2014when such  incidents are discussed internally and widely publicized.
