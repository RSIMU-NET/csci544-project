The Act  defines trade enforcement as the enforcement of customs and trade laws  of the United States. Enforcing trade also includes protecting revenue,  which means ensuring that the duties and taxes owed on goods imported  into the United States are collected.

To examine how CBP conducts trade enforcement across its  high-risk issue areas and ensures that its enforcement activities are  effective, we reviewed CBP documents pertaining to trade enforcement  and high-risk issues, as well as strategic and annual plans and other  documents. We also interviewed CBP officials who formulate trade policy  and carry out trade enforcement. In addition, we visited CBP field offices  in Baltimore, Maryland; Long Beach, California; and New York, New York,  to observe trade enforcement activities and interview CBP officials  located at air and sea ports. We selected the CBP ports and field offices  to visit based on a number of factors, including the volume of imports  coming through the ports and the number of relevant trade enforcement- related units at the port.

At that time,  CBP\u2019s priority mission was homeland security, but the agency was also  responsible for facilitating the movement of legitimate trade and people.", "Congress required in Section 412(b) of the Homeland Security Act that  the Secretary of DHS, at a minimum, maintain the level of staff and  associated support staff in certain customs revenue functions, which  was in part defined as those functions performed by staff in nine positions  that were present in the U.S. Customs Service when it became part of  DHS in 2003. These customs revenue functions involve trade functions,  including trade enforcement. For the purposes of our report, we refer to  these as the nine mandated trade positions.", "Since the creation of CBP, Congress has passed additional legislation  that relates to CBP\u2019s trade functions.

Accordingly, CBP developed the Resource  Optimization Model for trade positions. In its model, CBP identified the  staffing levels for 15 positions, of which 9 were the mandated trade  positions from the Homeland Security Act, and 6 were nonmandated  trade positions that also perform trade functions. According to CBP, the  Resource Optimization Model generated a staff level range that projects  the optimal staffing levels necessary for each of the 15 positions to  conduct trade processing and enforcement across the seven Priority  Trade Issue areas for a given fiscal year.

For a breakdown of DHS OIG  recommendations by topic, see figure 11.", "Some of these 103 DHS OIG recommendations addressed weaknesses  concerning guidance or strategy or procedures, as they relate to the 11  topics.", "Recommendations addressing guidance include, among other things,  providing guidance to ports and field offices to ensure that employees  resolve reports during the in-bond process,  review bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones facilities, and use the correct targeting criteria for rail shipments.", "Recommendations addressing strategy and procedures, among other  things, include establishing written procedures or conducting assessment  for developing, changing, and using the Workload Staffing Model, an  Excel spreadsheet-based model that CBP uses to identify staffing  needs for CBP officers at ports of entry; and determining whether resources are appropriately allocated to ensure  effective penalty case management at Fines, Penalties and  Forfeitures field offices.", "Of the 103 DHS OIG recommendations pertaining to trade enforcement  and addressed to DHS or CBP, 85 have been closed and 18 remain open  (see table 10 for a list of DHS OIG reports with open recommendations  and their status as of October 24, 2016). DHS OIG officials report that the  agency concurred with these open and closed recommendations. The  18 open recommendations originate from five reports. In one particular  report, the independent public accounting firm KPMG LLP (KMPG)  recommended that CBP implement additional training at ports and/or  additional oversight controls to ensure that risk assessments for bonded  warehouses and foreign trade zones (FTZ) are consistently performed in  accordance with required guidelines. KMPG had found that CBP was  unable to provide evidence of completing compliance reviews to support  the assessed risk level for certain bonded warehouses and FTZ reviews,  and improperly recorded the risk level of an FTZ based on the compliance  review that was conducted. KMPG found that the problem was that CBP  personnel did not consistently adhere to bonded warehouses\u2019 and FTZs\u2019 policies and procedures for completing compliance reviews. These  conditions increased the risk that imported goods awaiting entry into  commerce may not be secure, which could result in a loss of revenue.", "KMPG also recommended that CBP implement additional training at port  locations on tracking in-bond entries for compliance. An in-bond entry  allows for the movement of cargo through the United States without  payment of duty or appraisement prior to entry into either domestic  commerce or exportation to a foreign country, and CBP oversees in-bond  compliance using the In-Bond Compliance Module. However, KMPG  found that port personnel did not have a clear understanding of how to  operate the compliance module, which, according to OIG-15-76, may  result in missed opportunities for CBP to assess fines and penalties and  collect the associated revenues."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["This report examines (1) U.S. Customs and Border Protection\u2019s (CBP)  structure for carrying out trade enforcement, (2) how CBP conducts trade  enforcement across its high-risk issue areas and ensures that its  enforcement activities are effective, and (3) the extent to which CBP  meets its staffing needs for trade enforcement. We also provide  information on audits related to CBP\u2019s trade enforcement and the  implementation status of any recommendations made in such audits.", "To examine CBP\u2019s structure for carrying out trade enforcement, we  reviewed organizational documents for CBP, specifically for the Office of  Trade and the Office of Field Operations. We also spoke with CBP  officials in headquarters representing directorates and branches that have  a trade enforcement component within CBP to better understand their  role and organizational structure. We interviewed CBP officials in the field  who carry out trade enforcement to learn about their roles and  responsibilities. The trade enforcement staff we spoke to in the field  include the following positions: Customs and Border Protection officer;  entry specialist; import specialist; national account manager; drawback  specialist; customs auditor; international trade specialist; agriculture  specialist; paralegal specialist; Fines, Penalties and Forfeitures specialist;  and seized property specialist. We also interviewed officials at all 10  Centers of Excellence and Expertise (Centers) and asked most Centers  questions pertaining to the Center\u2019s organizational structure and  resources, the benefits of having Centers, and any challenges that they  have faced since the Centers became operational.", "To examine how CBP conducts trade enforcement across its high-risk  issue areas and ensures that its enforcement activities are effective, we  reviewed CBP documents pertaining to trade enforcement and Priority  Trade Issues, as well as planning documents. We interviewed CBP  officials who set policy and conduct enforcement activities for Priority  Trade Issues in headquarters as well as CBP officials in the field who  carry out trade enforcement activities. Specifically, we met with officials  representing units within the Office of Trade and the Office of Field  Operations: National Targeting Center; Regulatory Audit; Fines, Penalties  and Forfeitures Office; and Trade Operations Division. We also spoke  with CBP officials representing every National Targeting and Analysis  Group and the Commercial Targeting and Analysis Center to learn about  their role in trade enforcement by Priority Trade Issue and to understand  their coordination with other units within CBP. We visited CBP ports and  field offices in Baltimore, Maryland;  Los Angeles/Long Beach, California;  and New York, New York to observe trade enforcement activities and  interviewed CBP officials located at the sea and air ports. We visited an  international mail facility at John F. Kennedy airport to learn about trade  enforcement in the mail environment and observed cargo being inspected  at a DHL facility at the Los Angeles airport. We selected the CBP ports  and field offices to visit based on a number of factors, including the  volume of imports coming through the ports, the number of relevant trade  enforcement-related units at the port, the port environment (locations with  cargo arriving by air, sea, and through international mail), and the  proximity of the port to our location. We interviewed officials at all 10  Centers of Excellence and Expertise and asked questions pertaining to  the Centers\u2019 coordination within and outside of CBP, strategy, and data  collection. We did not visit and observe any land ports of entry because of  limited time frames. However, during our interviews, CBP officials  discussed trade enforcement processing and other activities that occur at  the land borders. We spoke with Immigration and Customs Enforcement  (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officials in Washington,  D.C., and in New York to learn about ICE and HSI\u2019s role in trade  enforcement as well as to understand how HSI coordinates with various  CBP components. We requested copies of CBP\u2019s strategic or annual  plans for each of the seven Priority Trade Issues. We initially received  three plans, one of which was current and two that were outdated but still  being used by CBP. In addition, in February 2017 we received seven  Priority Trade Issue plans, of which one was final and six were still in draft  form. We reviewed and compared all plans we received against leading  practices for managing results, specifically those focused on performance  planning. These leading practices noted that a plan should identify goals  and measures covering each of its program activities and contain targets  to assess progress toward performance goals.", "To examine the extent to which CBP meets its staffing needs for trade  enforcement, we reviewed CBP documents and reports related to trade  enforcement positions and staff levels, such as CBP\u2019s Resource  Optimization Model. We obtained information on trade enforcement  staffing, budgeting, hiring process, and any challenges to hiring trade staff  by interviewing officials from the Office of Trade\u2019s Resource Management  Division, the Office of Field Operations\u2019 Human Capital and Budget  offices, the Enterprise Services\u2019 Finance division, and the Minneapolis  Hiring Center. We also spoke to CBP officials in the field about the impact  of staffing shortfalls and challenges to meeting optimal staffing levels. We  requested copies of CBP staffing plans or strategies related to trade  enforcement positions and discussed with CBP officials whether they had  any hiring plans for trade positions. We reviewed leading practices in  human capital management, which indicated that agencies, through  strategic workforce planning, should address developing  long-term  strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining staff to achieve  programmatic goals.", "We requested staffing data covering fiscal years 2012-2016 for the trade  positions that carry out trade functions identified in CBP\u2019s Resource  Optimization Model. Nine of the 15 trade positions were mandated in the  Homeland Security Act. To identify positions with staffing shortfalls, we  compared actual staffing data for the nine mandated trade positions  against the minimum staffing levels set in the Homeland Security Act. In  addition, we compared actual staffing data for fiscal years 2015 and 2016  to the optimal staffing levels identified in CBP\u2019s Resource Optimization  Model. Although the Homeland Security Act also required CBP to  maintain minimum staffing levels for the associated support staff for the  nine mandated trade positions, we did not assess CBP\u2019s ability to meet  these staffing targets because CBP officials could not provide any  information on these positions or the staffing levels in response to our  request for data. To identify staffing shortfalls for the model\u2019s six  nonmandated trade positions, we compared the actual staffing data CBP  reported for these positions in October 2014 against optimal staffing levels identified in the Resource Optimization Model. While we asked for  the percentage of time spent on trade functions performed by staff in the  six nonmandated trade positions for fiscal years 2012-2016, CBP was  able to report data only for the end of fiscal year 2014 because it does not  track the actual staffing levels for these positions on an annual basis. We  did not independently  assess and validate the optimal staffing models\u2019  ranges. To assess the reliability  of the actual staffing levels reported by  CBP, as of October 2014, for the six nonmandated trade positions we  compared and corroborated staffing information provided in CBP  reporting and spoke to CBP officials regarding the methodology used to  determine the actual staffing levels for these positions. On the basis of  the checks we performed, we determined these data to be sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of indicating the staffing levels for the  nonmandated positions. To assess the reliability of the staffing data for  fiscal years 2012-2016 for the nine mandated trade positions, we  compared and corroborated information provided by CBP with staffing  information in the Congressional Budget Justifications for that time period  and spoke to CBP officials regarding the processes they used to collect  and verify the staffing data. On the basis of the checks we performed, we  determined these data to be sufficiently reliable for the purposes of  comparing actual to mandated staffing levels.", "To provide information on audits related to CBP\u2019s trade enforcement and  the implementation status of any recommendations made in such audits,  we identified audits that (1) were published between fiscal years 2011  and 2016, (2) followed a professional auditing standard such as the  generally accepted government auditing standards (GAGAS), (3)  contained recommendations made to the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) or CBP, and (4) were related to trade enforcement. To  identify these audits, we searched databases such as ProQuest, Lexis  Market and Industry News, and the National Technical Information  Service to include sources representing think tanks, academics, trade  industry, and government. We also searched the Department of  Homeland Security\u2019s Office of Inspector General (DHS OIG)\u2019s external  website and GAO\u2019s internal database, the Engagement Results Phase.  By systematically narrowing down the search results from the DHS OIG  external website and GAO\u2019s Engagement Results Phase, we identified  nine GAO audits and 15 DHS OIG reports that met our criteria. We  corroborated our DHS report searches with the DHS Office of Inspector  General. Based on our searches, we did not find that any other private or  nonprofit entities or government agencies had published trade  enforcement audits between fiscal years 2011 and 2016 that pertained to  trade enforcement, adhered to a professional auditing or inspection  standard, and contained recommendations addressed to CBP or DHS.", "We obtained the status of GAO audit recommendations from GAO\u2019s  external website and GAO\u2019s Engagement Results Phase database, and  the status of DHS OIG audit recommendations from DHS OIG officials.  For both GAO and OIG reports, we only included trade-relevant  recommendations made out to CBP or DHS\u2014136 recommendations out  of a total of 188 (33 out of 46 recommendations for GAO reports, 103 out  of 142 recommendations for OIG reports). The sources of these audits  and inspections varied; the sources for GAO and DHS OIG may have  been work initiated under agency authority, congressional mandates, or  congressional requests. Other sources of DHS OIG audits included  annually conducted independent auditors\u2019 reports on CBP\u2019s consolidated  financial statements or part of a series of audit, inspection, and special  reports prepared as part of DHS OIG\u2019s oversight responsibilities to  promote economy, efficiency, and effectiveness within the department.", "To analyze the content of the recommendations, we coded each  recommendation made in GAO and OIG audits by a topic that reflected  our reporting objectives, information in the Trade Facilitation and Trade  Enforcement Act of 2015 (the Act) related to GAO\u2019s mandate, and/or  recurring themes and pre-existing topics identified in the audit reports. We  identified 13 topics in the recommendations made by the GAO and OIG  audits. Recommendation topics covering both the GAO and OIG audits  included: agriculture as well as targeting and cargo examination.  Recommendation topics unique to GAO audits included: antidumping and  countervailing duties and an \u201cother\u201d category that includes U.S.-Mexico  border wait times. Recommendation topics unique to OIG audits included:  bonds, bonded warehouses and foreign trade zones, drawback, entry  reports, in-bond program, obligations, staffing, and trade compliance  measurement. To ensure the consistency and accuracy of coding the  recommendations according to these topics, an independent verifier  coded some topics independently,  and a supervisor reviewed coding for  other selected recommendations.", "We conducted the performance audit on which this report is based from  May 2016 to April 2017 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
