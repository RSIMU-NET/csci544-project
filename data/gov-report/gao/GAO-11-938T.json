Aviation security remains a daunting challenge with hundreds of airports and thousands of flights daily carrying millions of passengers and pieces of checked baggage. The Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has spent billions of dollars and implemented a wide range of aviation security initiatives. Two key layers of aviation security are (1) TSA's Screening of Passengers by Observation Techniques (SPOT) program designed to identify persons who may pose a security risk; and (2) airport perimeter and access controls security. This testimony provides information on the extent to which TSA has taken actions to validate the scientific basis of SPOT and strengthen airport perimeter security. This statement is based on prior products GAO issued from September 2009 through September 2011 and selected updates in August and September 2011.

In May 2010, GAO reported that TSA deployed this program, which uses behavior observation and analysis techniques to identify potentially high-risk passengers, before determining whether there was a scientifically valid basis for using behavior and appearance indicators as a means for reliably identifying passengers who may pose a risk to the U.S. aviation system. TSA officials said that SPOT was deployed in response to potential threats, such as suicide bombers, and was based on scientific research available at the time. TSA is pilot testing revised program procedures at Boston-Logan airport in which behavior detection officers will engage passengers entering screening in casual conversation to help determine suspicious behaviors. TSA plans to expand this pilot program in the fall of 2011. GAO recommended in May 2010 that DHS, as part of its validation study, assess the methodology to help ensure the validity of the SPOT program. DHS concurred and stated that the study included an independent review with a broad range of agencies and experts. The study found that SPOT was more effective than random screening to varying degrees. However, DHS's study was not designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security risk. The study also noted that additional work was needed to comprehensively validate the program. TSA officials are assessing the actions needed to address the study's recommendations but do not have time frames for completing this work. In September 2009 GAO reported that since 2004 TSA has taken actions to strengthen airport perimeter and access controls security by, among other things, deploying a random worker screening program; however, TSA had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment or developed a national strategy. Specifically, TSA had not conducted vulnerability assessments for 87 percent of the approximately 450 U.S. airports regulated for security by TSA in 2009. GAO recommended that TSA develop (1) a comprehensive risk assessment and evaluate the need to conduct airport vulnerability assessments nationwide and (2) a national strategy to guide efforts to strengthen airport security. DHS concurred and TSA stated that the Transportation Sector Security Risk Assessment, issued in July 2010, was to provide a comprehensive risk assessment of airport security. However, this assessment did not consider the potential vulnerabilities of airports to an insider attack--an attack from an airport worker with authorized access to secure areas. In August 2011, TSA reported that transportation security inspectors conduct vulnerability assessments annually at all commercial airports, including an evaluation of perimeter security. GAO has not yet assessed the extent to which inspectors consistently conduct vulnerability assessments. TSA also updated the Transportation Systems-Sector Specific Plan, which summarizes airport security program activities. However, the extent to which these activities were guided by measurable goals and priorities, among other things, was not clear. Providing such additional information would better address GAO's recommendation."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO has made recommendations in prior work to strengthen TSA's SPOT program and airport perimeter and access control security efforts.

The attempted terrorist bombing of Northwest flight 253 on December 25,  2009, provided a vivid reminder that civil aviation remains an attractive  terrorist target and underscores the need for effective passenger  screening. According to the President\u2019s National Counterterrorism  Strategy released in June 2011, aviation security and screening is an  essential tool in the ability to detect, disrupt, and defeat plots to attack the  homeland.", "Securing commercial aviation operations remain a daunting task\u2014with  hundreds of airports, thousands of aircraft, and thousands of flights daily  carrying millions of passengers and pieces of checked baggage. In the  almost 10 years that have passed since TSA assumed responsibility for  aviation security, TSA has spent billions of dollars and implemented a  wide range of initiatives to strengthen the layers of aviation security. For  fiscal year 2011, TSA had about 54,800 personnel and its budget  authority was about $7.7 billion. However, risks to the aviation system  remain. Earlier this month, we reported on the progress made in securing  the aviation system in the 10 years since the September 11, 2001,  attacks and the work that still remains.", "In addition, while airport operators, not TSA, generally retain direct day- to-day operational responsibility for airport perimeter security and  implementing access controls for secure areas of their airports, TSA has  responsibility for establishing and implementing measures to improve  security in these areas. Criminal incidents involving airport workers using  their access privileges to smuggle weapons and drugs into secure areas  and onto planes have heightened concerns about the risks posed by  workers and the security of airport perimeters and access to secured  areas.", "My statement today discusses the extent to which TSA has taken actions  to (1) validate the scientific basis of its behavior-based passenger  screening program (referred to as SPOT) and (2) strengthen the security  of airport perimeters and access controls.", "This statement is based on our prior products issued from September  2009 through September 2011, and includes selected updates conducted  in August and September 2011 on TSA\u2019s efforts to implement our prior  recommendations regarding SPOT and airport perimeters and access to  secure areas of airports. For our May 2010 report on SPOT, we  reviewed relevant literature on behavior analysis by subject matter  experts. We conducted field site visits to 15 TSA-regulated airports with  SPOT to observe operations and meet with key program personnel. We  also interviewed recognized experts in the field, as well as cognizant  officials from other U.S. government agencies that utilize behavior  analysis in their work. For the updates, we analyzed documentation from  TSA on the actions it has taken to implement the recommendations from  our May 2010 report, including efforts to validate the scientific basis  for  the program. As part of our efforts to update this information, we analyz DHS\u2019s April 2011 SPOT validation study and discussed its findings with  cognizant DHS officials. For our September 2009 report on TSA efforts to  secure airport perimeters and access controls, we examined TSA  documents related to risk assessments, airport security programs, and  risk management. We also interviewed TSA, airport, and industry  association officials and conducted site visits at nine TSA-regulated  airports of varying size. from TSA on actions it has taken to implement recommendations from our  2009 report, including efforts to conduct a comprehensive risk  assessment and evaluate the need to conduct an assessment of security  vulnerabilities at airports nationwide, and to develop a national strategy  for airport perimeters and access controls security that identifies key  elements such as goals and priorities. As part of our efforts to update this  information, we analyzed TSA data on the number of vulnerability  assessments conducted at airports from fiscal year 2004 through July 1,  2011, by airport.

At the 463 TSA- regulated airports in the United States, prior to boarding an aircraft, all  passengers, their accessible property, and their checked baggage are  screened pursuant to TSA-established procedures, which include  passengers passing through security checkpoints where they and their  identification documents are checked by transportation security officers  (TSO) and other TSA employees or by private sector screeners under  TSA\u2019s Screening Partnership Program. Airport operators, however, are  directly responsible for implementing TSA security requirements, such as  those relating to perimeter security and access controls, in accordance  with their approved security programs and other TSA direction.", "TSA relies upon multiple layers of security to deter, detect, and disrupt  persons posing a potential risk to aviation security. These layers include  behavior detection officers (BDO), who examine passenger behaviors  and appearances to identify passengers who might pose a potential  security risk at TSA-regulated airports; TSA has selectively deployed  about 3,000 BDOs to 161 of 463 TSA-regulated airports in the United  States, including Boston-Logan airport where the program was initially  deployed in 2003. Other security layers include travel document  checkers, who examine tickets, passports, and other forms of  identification; TSOs responsible for screening passengers and their carry- on baggage at passenger checkpoints, using x-ray equipment,  magnetometers, Advanced Imaging Technology, and other devices;  random employee screening; and checked baggage screening systems.  Additional layers cited by TSA include, among others, intelligence  gathering and analysis; passenger prescreening against terrorist  watchlists; random canine team searches at airports; federal air marshals,  who provide federal law enforcement presence on selected flights  operated by U.S. air carriers; Visible Intermodal Protection Response  (VIPR) teams; reinforced cockpit doors; the passengers themselves; as  well as other measures both visible and invisible to the public. Figure 1  shows TSA\u2019s layers of aviation security. TSA has also implemented a  variety of programs and protective actions to strengthen airport  perimeters and access to sensitive areas of the airport, including  conducting additional employee background checks and assessing  different biometric-identification technologies. Airport perimeter and  access control security is intended to prevent unauthorized access into  secure areas of an airport\u2014either from outside or within the airport  complex.", "According to TSA, each one of these layers alone is capable of stopping  a terrorist attack. TSA states that the security layers in combination  multiply their value, creating a much stronger system, and that a terrorist  who has to overcome multiple security layers to carry out an attack is  more likely to be pre-empted, deterred, or to fail during the attempt."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Actions To Validate the Science Underlying Its Behavior Detection Program, but More Work Remains", "paragraphs": ["We reported in May 2010 that TSA deployed SPOT nationwide before  first determining whether there was a scientifically valid basis for using  behavior and appearance indicators as a means for reliably identifying  passengers who may pose a risk to the U.S. aviation system. DHS\u2019s  Science and Technology Directorate completed a validation study in April  2011 to determine the extent to which SPOT was more effective than  random screening at identifying security threats and how the program\u2019s  behaviors correlate to identifying high-risk travelers. However, as noted  in the study, the assessment was an initial validation step, but was not  designed to fully validate whether behavior detection can be used to  reliably identify individuals in an airport environment who pose a security  risk. According to DHS, additional work will be needed to  comprehensively validate the program.", "According to TSA, SPOT was deployed before a scientific validation of  the program was completed to help address potential threats to the  aviation system, such as those posed by suicide bombers. TSA also  stated that the program was based upon scientific research available at  the time regarding human behaviors. We reported in May 2010 that  approximately 14,000 passengers were referred to law enforcement  officers under SPOT from May 2004 through August 2008. Of these  passengers, 1,083 were arrested for various reasons, including being  illegal aliens (39 percent), having outstanding warrants (19 percent), and  possessing fraudulent documents (15 percent). The remaining 27 percent  were arrested for other reasons. As noted in our May 2010 report, SPOT  officials told us that it is not known if the SPOT program has resulted in  the arrest of anyone who is a terrorist, or who was planning to engage in  terrorist-related activity. According to TSA, in fiscal year 2010, SPOT  referred about 50,000 passengers for additional screening and about  3,600 referrals to law enforcement officers. The referrals to law  enforcement officers yielded approximately 300 arrests. Of these 300  arrests, TSA stated that 27 percent were illegal aliens, 17 percent were  drug-related, 14 percent were related to fraudulent documents, 12  percent were related to outstanding warrants, and 30 percent were  related to other offenses. DHS has requested about $254 million for fiscal  year 2012 for the SPOT program, which would support an additional 350  (or 175 full-time equivalent) BDOs. If TSA receives its requested  appropriation, TSA will be in a position to have invested about $1 billion in  the SPOT program since fiscal year 2007.", "According to TSA, as of August 2011, TSA is pilot testing revised  procedures for BDOs at Boston-Logan airport to engage passengers  entering screening in casual conversation to help determine suspicious  behaviors. According to TSA, after a passenger\u2019s travel documents are  verified, a BDO will briefly engage each passenger in conversation. If  more information is needed to help determine suspicious behaviors, the  officer will refer the passenger to a second BDO for a more thorough  conversation to determine if additional screening is needed. TSA noted  that these BDOs have received additional training in interviewing  methods. TSA plans to expand this pilot program to additional airports in  the fall of 2011.", "A 2008 report issued by the National Research Council of the National  Academy of Sciences stated that the scientific evidence for behavioral  monitoring is preliminary in nature. The report also noted that an  information-based program, such as a behavior detection program,  should first determine if a scientific foundation exists and use scientifically  valid criteria to evaluate its effectiveness before deployment. The report  added that such programs should have a sound experimental basis and  that the documentation on the program\u2019s effectiveness should be  reviewed by an independent entity capable of evaluating the supporting  scientific evidence. According to the report, a terrorist\u2019s desire to avoid  detection makes information-gathering techniques, such as asking what a  person has done, is doing, or plans to do, highly unreliable. Using these  techniques to elicit information could also have definite privacy  implications. These findings, in particular, may be important as TSA  moves forward with its pilot program to expand BDOs\u2019 use of  conversation and interviews with all passengers entering screening.", "As we reported in May 2010, an independent panel of experts could help  DHS develop a comprehensive methodology to determine if the SPOT  program is based on valid scientific principles that can be effectively  applied in an airport environment for counterterrorism purposes. Thus, we  recommended that the Secretary of Homeland Security convene an  independent panel of experts to review the methodology of the validation  study on the SPOT program being conducted to determine whether the  study\u2019s methodology was sufficiently comprehensive to validate the SPOT  program. We also recommended that this assessment include  appropriate input from other federal agencies with expertise in behavior  detection and relevant subject matter experts. DHS concurred and  stated that its validation study, completed in April 2011, included an  independent review of the study with input from a broad range of federal  agencies and relevant experts, including those from academia.", "DHS\u2019s validation study found that SPOT was more effective than random  screening to varying degrees. For example, the study found that SPOT  was more effective than random screening at identifying individuals who  possessed fraudulent documents and identifying individuals who law  enforcement officers ultimately arrested. However, DHS noted that the  identification of such high-risk passengers was rare in both the SPOT and  random tests. In addition, DHS determined that the base rate, or  frequency, of SPOT behavioral indicators observed by TSA to detect  suspicious passengers was very low and that these observed indicators  were highly varied across the traveling public. Although details about  DHS\u2019s findings related to these indicators are sensitive security  information, the low base rate and high variability of traveler behaviors  highlights the challenge that TSA faces in effectively implementing a  standardized list of SPOT behavioral indicators.", "In addition, DHS outlined several limitations to the study. For example,  the study noted that BDOs were aware of whether individuals they were  screening were referred to them as the result of identified SPOT  indicators or random selection. DHS stated that this had the potential to  introduce bias into the assessment. DHS also noted that SPOT data from  January 2006 through October 2010 were used in its analysis of  behavioral indicators even though questions about the reliability of the  data exist. In May 2010, we reported weaknesses in TSA\u2019s process for  maintaining operational data from the SPOT program database.  Specifically, the SPOT database did not have computerized edit checks  built into the system to review the format, existence, and reasonableness  of data. In another example, BDOs could not input all behaviors observed  in the SPOT database because the database limited entry to eight  behaviors, six signs of deception, and four types of prohibited items per  passenger referred for additional screening. Because of these data- related issues, we reported that meaningful analyses could not be  conducted at that time to determine if there is an association between  certain behaviors and the likelihood that a person displaying certain  behaviors would be referred to a law enforcement officer or whether any  behavior or combination of behaviors could be used to distinguish  deceptive from nondeceptive individuals. In our May 2010 report, we  recommended that TSA establish controls for this SPOT data. DHS  agreed and TSA has established additional data controls as part of its  database upgrade. However, some of DHS\u2019s analysis for this study used  SPOT data recorded prior to these additional controls being implemented.", "The study also noted that it was not designed to comprehensively validate  whether SPOT can be used to reliably identify individuals in an airport  environment who pose a security risk. The DHS study made  recommendations related to strengthening the program and conducting a  more comprehensive validation of whether the science can be used for  counterterrorism purposes in the aviation environment. Some of these  recommendations, such as the need for a comprehensive program  evaluation including a cost-benefit analysis, reiterate recommendations  made in our May 2010 report. TSA is currently reviewing the study\u2019s  findings and assessing the steps needed to address DHS\u2019s  recommendations but does not have time frames for completing this  work. If TSA decides to implement the recommendations in the April 2011  DHS validation study, DHS may be years away from knowing whether  there is a scientifically valid basis for using behavior detection techniques  to help secure the aviation system against terrorist threats given the  broad scope of the additional work and related resources identified by  DHS for addressing the recommendations. Thus, as we reported in March  2011, Congress may wish to consider the study\u2019s results in making future  funding decisions regarding the program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "TSA Has Taken Actions to Strengthen Airport Perimeter and Access Controls Security, but Issues Remain", "paragraphs": ["We reported in September 2009 that TSA has implemented a variety of  programs and actions since 2004 to improve and strengthen airport  perimeter and access controls security, including strengthening worker  screening and improving access control technology. For example, to  better address the risks posed by airport workers, in 2007 TSA  implemented a random worker screening program that was used to  enforce access procedures, such as ensuring workers display appropriate  credentials and do not possess unauthorized items when entering secure  areas. According to TSA officials, this program was developed to help  counteract the potential vulnerability of airports to an insider attack\u2014an  attack from an airport worker with authorized access to secure areas.  TSA has also expanded its requirements for conducting worker  background checks and the population of individuals who are subject to  these checks. For example, in 2007 TSA expanded requirements for  name-based checks to all individuals seeking or holding airport-issued  identification badges and in 2009 began requiring airports to renew all  airport-identification media every 2 years. TSA also reported taking  actions to identify and assess technologies to strengthen airport perimeter  and access controls security, such as assisting the aviation industry and a  federal aviation advisory committee in developing security standards for  biometric access controls.", "However, we reported in September 2009 that while TSA has taken  actions to assess risk with respect to airport perimeter and access  controls security, it had not conducted a comprehensive risk assessment  based on assessments of threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences, as  required by DHS\u2019s National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP). We  further reported that without a full depiction of threats, vulnerabilities, and  consequences, an organization\u2019s ability to establish priorities and make  cost-effective security decisions is limited. We recommended that TSA  develop a comprehensive risk assessment, along with milestones for  completing the assessment. DHS concurred with our recommendation  and said it would include an assessment of airport perimeter and access  control security risks as part of a comprehensive assessment for the  transportation sector\u2014the Transportation Sector Security Risk  Assessment (TSSRA). The TSSRA, published in July 2010, included an  assessment of various risk-based scenarios related to airport perimeter  security but did not consider the potential vulnerabilities of airports to an  insider attack\u2014the insider threat\u2014which it recognized as a significant  issue. In July 2011, TSA officials told us that the agency is developing a  framework for insider risk that is to be included in the next iteration of the  assessment, which TSA expected to be released at the end of calendar  year 2011. Such action, if taken, would meet the intent of our  recommendation.", "We also recommended that, as part of a comprehensive risk assessment  of airport perimeter and access controls security, TSA evaluate the need  to conduct an assessment of security vulnerabilities at airports  nationwide. At the time of our review, TSA told us its primary measures  for assessing the vulnerability of airports to attack were professional  judgment and the collective results of joint vulnerability assessments  (JVA) it conducts with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for  select\u2014usually high-risk\u2014airports. Our analysis of TSA data showed  that from fiscal years 2004 through 2008, TSA conducted JVAs at about  13 percent of the approximately 450 TSA-regulated airports that existed  at that time, thus leaving about 87 percent of airports unassessed. TSA  has characterized U.S. airports as an interdependent system in which the  security of all is affected or disrupted by the security of the weakest link.  However, we reported that TSA officials could not explain to what extent  the collective JVAs of specific airports constituted a reasonable systems- based assessment of vulnerability across airports nationwide. Moreover,  TSA officials said that they did not know to what extent the 87 percent of  commercial airports that had not received a JVA as of September 2009\u2014 most of which were smaller airports\u2014were vulnerable to an intentional  security breach. DHS concurred with our 2009 report recommendation to  assess the need for a vulnerability assessment of airports nationwide,  and TSA officials stated that based on our review they intended to  increase the number of JVAs conducted at Category II, III, and IV airports  and use the resulting data to assist in prioritizing the allocation of limited  resources. Our analysis of TSA data showed that from fiscal year 2004  through July 1, 2011, TSA conducted JVAs at about 17 percent of the  TSA-regulated airports that existed at that time, thus leaving about 83  percent of airports unassessed.", "Since we issued our report in September 2009, TSA had not conducted  JVAs at Category III and IV airports. TSA stated that the TSSRA is to  provide a comprehensive risk assessment of airport security, but could  not tell us to what extent it has studied the need to conduct JVAs of  security vulnerabilities at airports nationwide. Additionally, in August 2011  TSA reported that its national inspection program requires that  transportation security inspectors conduct vulnerability assessments at all  commercial airports, which are based on the joint vulnerability  assessment model. According to TSA, every commercial airport in the  United States receives a security assessment each year, including an  evaluation of perimeter security and access controls. We have not yet  assessed the extent to which transportation security inspectors  consistently conduct vulnerability assessments based on the joint  vulnerability model. Providing additional information on how and to what  extent such security assessments have been performed would more fully  address our recommendation.", "We also reported in September 2009 that TSA\u2019s efforts to enhance the  security of the nation\u2019s airports have not been guided by a national  strategy that identifies key elements, such as goals, priorities,  performance measures, and required resources. To better ensure that  airport stakeholders take a unified approach to airport security, we  recommended that TSA develop a national strategy for airport security  that incorporates key characteristics of effective security strategies, such  as measurable goals and priorities. DHS concurred with this  recommendation and stated that TSA would implement it by updating the  Transportation Systems-Sector Specific Plan (TS-SSP), to be released in  the summer of 2010. TSA provided a copy of the updated plan to  congressional committees in June 2011 and to us in August 2011. We  reviewed this plan and its accompanying aviation model annex and found  that while the plan provided a high-level summary of program activities for  addressing airport security such as the screening of workers, the extent to  which these efforts would be guided by measurable goals and priorities,  among other things, was not clear.
