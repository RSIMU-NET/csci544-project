LANL employees rely on sensitive and classified information and assets that are protected at different levels, depending on the risks posed if they were lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. However, LANL has experienced several significant security breaches during the past decade. This testimony provides GAO's (1) views on physical security at LANL, as discussed in Los Alamos National Laboratory: Long-Term Strategies Needed to Improve Security and Management Oversight, GAO-08-694 (June 13, 2008); (2) preliminary observations on physical security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory; and (3) views on cyber security at LANL as discussed in Information Security: Actions Needed to Better Protect Los Alamos National Laboratory's Unclassified Computer Network, GAO-08-1001 (Sept. 9, 2008). To conduct this work, GAO analyzed data, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed laboratory officials, and conducted site visits to the two laboratories."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Physical security at LANL is in a period of significant improvement, and LANL is implementing over two dozen initiatives to better protect its classified assets. However, while LANL's current initiatives address many physical security problems previously identified in external security evaluations, other significant security problems have received insufficient attention. In addition, the management approaches that LANL and NNSA intend to use to sustain security improvements over the long term are in the early stages of development or contain weaknesses. Furthermore, LANL's ability to sustain its improved physical security posture is unproven because (1) the laboratory appears not to have done so after a significant security incident in 2004, with another significant security breach in 2006, and (2) NNSA's Los Alamos Site Office--which is responsible for overseeing security at LANL--may not have enough staff or the proper training to execute a fully effective security oversight program. GAO's report made recommendations to help further improve physical security at LANL and ensure that these improvements are sustained over the long term. As a result of poor performance on an April 2008 physical security evaluation conducted by the Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of Independent Oversight, GAO is reviewing physical security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (Livermore). GAO's preliminary observations are that Livermore appears to experience difficulties similar to LANL's in sustaining security performance. Furthermore, it appears that NNSA has not always provided effective oversight of Livermore. Specifically, an NNSA security survey conducted only 6 months prior to the April 2008 DOE evaluation gave Livermore the highest possible rating on its security program's performance. These results differ markedly from those documented by DOE's Office of Independent Oversight. LANL has implemented measures to enhance cyber security, but weaknesses remain in protecting information on its unclassified network. This network possesses sensitive information such as unclassified controlled nuclear information, export control information, and personally identifiable information about LANL employees. GAO found vulnerabilities in critical areas, including (1) identifying and authenticating users, (2) encrypting sensitive information, and (3) monitoring and auditing security policy compliance. A key reason for these information security weaknesses is that the laboratory has not fully implemented an information security program to ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained. Furthermore, deficiencies in LANL's policies and procedures raise additional concern, particularly with respect to foreign nationals' accessing the network from the laboratory and remotely. Finally, LANL cyber security officials told GAO that funding to address some of their security concerns with the laboratory's unclassified network has been inadequate. However, NNSA officials asserted that LANL had not adequately justified its requests for additional funds. GAO made 52 recommendations to help strengthen LANL's information security program and controls over the unclassified network."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["We are pleased to be here today to discuss physical and cyber security at  Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). LANL, located in Los Alamos,  New Mexico, has a multibillion dollar annual budget and is one of three  National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) laboratories responsible  for designing and developing a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons  deterrent. In fiscal year 2007, LANL budgeted nearly $200 million to  provide the laboratory with physical and cyber security to protect the  sensitive and classified assets on which laboratory employees rely to  conduct their work. A successful physical or cyber attack on NNSA sites  containing nuclear weapons, the material used in nuclear weapons, or  information pertaining to the people who design and maintain the U.S.  nuclear deterrent could have devastating consequences for the site, its  surrounding communities, and the nation\u2019s security. Because of these  risks, NNSA sites need effective physical and cyber security programs.", "Over the last decade, LANL has experienced a series of high-profile  security incidents in which sensitive assets and classified information  were compromised. In October 2006, during a drug raid on a private  residence, it was discovered that a LANL contract employee had  transferred classified information to a USB \u201cthumb drive\u201d and removed the  thumb drive, as well as a large number of classified documents, from the  laboratory. The Department of Energy\u2019s (DOE) Inspector General reported  that a serious breakdown in core laboratory physical and cyber security  controls contributed to the October 2006 thumb drive incident. More  recently, in April 2008, DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight conducted  an evaluation of security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory  (Livermore). The evaluation included a mock terrorist attack on a  sensitive laboratory facility and concluded that Livermore\u2019s security  program had significant weaknesses, particularly with respect to the  performance of Livermore\u2019s protective force and the physical protection of  classified resources.", "As a result of the October 2006 thumb drive incident and the congressional  hearings that followed, the Committee asked us to review physical and  cyber security at LANL. In addition, in June 2008, this Committee  requested that we review the status of physical security at Livermore. Our  testimony today discusses (1) physical security at LANL, (2) preliminary  observations from ongoing work on physical security at Livermore, and (3)  cyber security at LANL. This statement is primarily based on recently  issued reports on physical and cyber security at LANL. We conducted the  performance audit work that supports this statement in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to produce a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our statements today."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A basic management objective for any organization is to protect the  resources that support its critical operations from unauthorized access,  use, destruction, or disruption. Organizations accomplish this objective by  designing and implementing controls that are intended to, among other  things, prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing  resources, programs, information, and facilities. At LANL, these assets  include Category I special nuclear material, such as plutonium and highly  enriched uranium; thousands of classified nuclear weapons parts and  components; millions of classified documents; thousands of pieces of  classified removable electronic media that contain nuclear weapon design  information; over 100 vaults and vault-type rooms that store classified  assets; and computer networks and the hardware on which these  networks run that protect classified information as well as sensitive  unclassified information.", "LANL is subject to a series of DOE security orders that outline  requirements for implementing effective physical and cyber security  protection strategies. These orders include an assessment of the potential  size and capabilities of terrorist forces that could physically attack a  laboratory and against which a laboratory must be prepared to defend.  The orders further describe different levels of physical protection for  sensitive and classified assets, depending on the risk they would pose if  they were lost, stolen, or otherwise compromised. Appropriate physical  protection safeguards include locks and keys, fences, means to detect  unauthorized entry, perimeter alarms, vehicle barriers, and armed guards.", "In addition, the Congress enacted the Federal Information Security  Management Act (FISMA) in December 2002 to strengthen the security of  information and information systems across the federal government.  FISMA requires each agency to develop, document, and implement an  agencywide information security program that supports the operations  and assets of the agency, including those provided or managed by another  agency or contractor on its behalf. Examples of appropriate information  security controls include user identification and authentication that allow  computer systems to differentiate between users and verify their  identities; cryptography that ensures the confidentiality and integrity of  critical and sensitive information; configuration management that  identifies and manages security features for all hardware, software, and  firmware components of an information system and controls changes to  them; and audit and monitoring controls that help establish individual  accountability and monitor compliance with security policies.", "LANL is managed and operated by a corporate entity, Los Alamos National  Security LLC (LANS). NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos Site Office serves as the  primary federal overseer of laboratory security performance. Annually, the  Site Office determines how much money LANS will earn for its  management of the laboratory according to a maximum available  performance-based fee established in the laboratory\u2019s contract. The Site  Office bases its determination on the laboratory\u2019s success in meeting the  goals laid out in performance evaluation plans. These plans allocate  portions of the maximum available performance award fee to NNSA  performance objectives, including measures related to both physical and  cyber security.", "In addition, two DOE organizations are required to periodically review  physical and cyber security at LANL. NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos Site Office is  required to conduct security surveys annually. These surveys are based on  observations of performance, including compliance with DOE and NNSA  security directives. In fiscal year 2008, the results of this survey are  directly tied to NNSA\u2019s performance evaluation plan, and are therefore a  factor in LANS\u2019 ability to earn the maximum available performance award  fee. DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight also conducts evaluations,  typically every 18 months for facilities that store Category I special nuclear  material. These evaluations identify weaknesses in the laboratories\u2019  security programs and produce findings that laboratory officials must take  action to correct. The reviews overlap substantially, but each is required to  provide a comprehensive assessment of the laboratory\u2019s security  programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "While Physical Security at Los Alamos National Laboratory Has Improved, Management Approaches to Sustain Security Improvements Are in the Early Stages of Development or Contain Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["Physical security at LANL is in a period of significant improvement, and  LANL is implementing over two dozen initiatives to reduce, consolidate,  and better protect its classified assets, as well as reduce the physical  footprint of the laboratory by closing unneeded facilities. LANL officials  believe that these initiatives will reduce the risk of incidents that can  result in the loss of control over classified assets. For example, to reduce  and consolidate classified assets and its physical footprint, as of March  2008, LANL had (1) reduced from nine to one the number of areas  containing Category I special nuclear material; (2) reduced the amount of  accountable classified removable electronic media from 87,000 pieces to  about 4,300 and made information previously accessible on removable  media available only through the laboratory\u2019s classified computer  network; (3) eliminated about 30,000 classified nuclear weapon parts; and  (4) reduced the number of vault-type rooms from 142 to 111. In addition,  during fiscal year 2007, LANL reduced the physical footprint of existing  facilities by over 500,000 square feet. In concert with these actions, LANL  is implementing a series of engineered and administrative controls to  better protect and control classified assets,  such as removing the  functions from classified computers that enable them to create new pieces  of removable electronic media and streamlining physical security  procedures to make them easier to implement across the laboratory.", "We found that DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight and the Los Alamos  Site Office identified significant physical security problems at LANL that  the laboratory had not fully addressed. Specifically, while LANL\u2019s storage  of classified parts in unapproved storage containers and its process for  ensuring that actions to correct identified security deficiencies have been  cited in external security evaluations for years, complete security  solutions in these areas had not yet been implemented at the time of our  review. In addition, external security evaluations had repeatedly identified  concerns about the adequacy of LANL\u2019s assessments of its own security  performance. The security self-assessment program provides LANL with  the opportunity to self-identify security deficiencies and address them  before they can be exploited. External security evaluations found that  LANL\u2019s self-assessments were not comprehensive and did not include  discussions of all internal findings. These evaluations also noted that  findings identified through self-assessments were not always analyzed and  addressed through corrective actions. At the time of our review, Los  Alamos Site Office and DOE Office of Independent Oversight officials  noted that LANL\u2019s self-assessment program was improving.", "LANL officials identified three management approaches that they asserted  would sustain security improvements over the long term. However, these  approaches were either in an early stage of development or contained  important weaknesses that may impair their ability to ensure the  sustainability of security improvements at the laboratory for the  foreseeable future. First, LANL officials identified completing the  management actions required by the Secretary of Energy\u2019s Compliance  Order issued as a result of the October 2006 thumb drive incident as an  approach to ensure that security improvements are sustained, yet the  Compliance Order itself does not provide a mechanism to sustain security  improvements over the long-term. Second, LANL officials told us they  will track the implementation of longer-term actions, including those  required by the Compliance Order, by developing and implementing the  Contractor Assurance System required under the LANS contract.  However, the extent to which LANL can rely on the Contractor Assurance  System to ensure the long-term sustainability of security improvements is  unclear. According to a Los Alamos Site Office official, the Contractor  Assurance System will not be fully completed for 3 to 4 years and, thus,  will not be fully implemented by the time actions under the Compliance  Order are completed. Finally, according to LANL officials, the laboratory  plans to realize security improvements by meeting the security-related  performance incentives in the annual performance evaluation plans NNSA  uses to measure performance and determine an award fee for LANS.  However, the annual performance evaluation plans focus principally on  compliance with DOE requirements and do not sufficiently reward  security program improvement. In that regard, according to a senior NNSA  security official, compliance with current DOE requirements does not  assure that LANL\u2019s security program is functioning effectively. Indeed, we  found that all but $30,000 of the total $1.43 million fiscal year 2008  performance fee allocated to physical security was associated with LANL\u2019s  achievement of compliance-oriented milestones, such as issuing plans,  publishing policies, and completing equipment maintenance requirements.", "The management attention dedicated to improving physical security  following the October 2006 thumb drive incident mirrors the level of  attention that followed LANL\u2019s 2004 shutdown, when over 3,400 safety and  security deficiencies were identified for correction. This shutdown lasted  up to 10 months for some laboratory activities and cost as much as $370  million. Given how quickly LANL\u2019s security performance declined  between the full resumption of laboratory activities in May 2005 and the  discovery of the thumb drive on private property, LANL\u2019s ability to sustain  the improved security posture it has recently achieved is unproven. Strong  federal oversight will help ensure that these improvements are sustained.  However, we reported that the Los Alamos Site Office suffers from a  shortage of security personnel and lacks funding needed for training.  Specifically, as of October 2007, the Los Alamos Site Office employed 13  security staff\u2014enough for 1 person to oversee each of the topical areas  the Site Office had to evaluate. This staffing level, officials said, was  sufficient to cover only 15 percent of LANL\u2019s facilities. In April 2008, a  senior security official at the Site Office said security staffing levels had  decreased since October 2007. Furthermore, while NNSA had identified  the need to train and certify Site Office security personnel in specific  subject matters, according to Site Office officials no specific training funds  had been made available.", "We made three recommendations to the Secretary of Energy and the  Administrator of NNSA that, if effectively implemented, will improve  physical security at LANL and help ensure that improvements LANL has  achieved are sustained over the long term. Specifically, we recommended  that LANL be required to develop a comprehensive strategic plan for  laboratory security that addresses all previously identified security  weaknesses and focuses on improving security program effectiveness.  Furthermore, we recommended that NNSA provide meaningful financial  incentives in future performance evaluation plans for implementation of  this comprehensive strategic plan for laboratory security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Preliminary Observations on Physical Security at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory", "paragraphs": ["In June 2008, the Committee requested that we review the security status  at Livermore. This request came as a result of an evaluation by DOE\u2019s  Office of Independent Oversight in April 2008, in which Livermore  received the lowest possible ratings for protective force performance and  for physical protection of classified resources. The evaluation also  identified issues in other areas, such as security sensors and alarms, and  security program management. We are currently verifying the findings of  the evaluation and Livermore\u2019s actions to correct security deficiencies.  Specifically:    Self-assessment and performance assurance testing programs at  Livermore need improvement. DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight  evaluations and Livermore Site Office security surveys found  shortcomings in Livermore\u2019s fiscal year 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2008 self- assessment programs. In addition, Livermore and NNSA security officials  acknowledged that a lack of comprehensive performance assurance  testing was a significant contributing factor to the poor performance of  Livermore protective forces during their April 2008 exercise. Between  December 2006 and April 2008, Livermore did not hold an integrated  performance assurance test of its protective forces or operationally test  equipment key to the laboratory\u2019s protective strategy. During our visit to  the laboratory 2 weeks ago, Livermore officials told us they are finalizing  corrective action plans to address deficiencies in their performance  assurance and self-assessment programs and have already conducted a  significant number of performance assurance tests with the protective  force and on equipment since the completion of the Office of Independent  Oversight\u2019s 2008 evaluation.", "NNSA and the Livermore Site Office have not always provided effective  security oversight. Six months before the Office of Independent  Oversight\u2019s 2008 evaluation, the 2007 Livermore Site Office\u2019s annual  security survey gave the laboratory a 100-percent satisfactory rating on its  security performance, the highest possible rating. The results of the Office  of Independent Oversight inspection not only differed markedly, but also  found that the Livermore Site Office survey was not comprehensive and  the ratings provided did not reflect what was actually observed. The  Livermore Site Office is currently in the process of fundamentally  rebuilding and restructuring its survey program and has embarked on a  training program for its security personnel.", "Though our observations are preliminary, Livermore appears to be  experiencing difficulties similar to LANL\u2019s in sustaining physical security  performance. For example, in 1999, DOE\u2019s Office of Independent  Oversight identified significant weaknesses in Livermore\u2019s programs to  secure the laboratory\u2019s Category I special nuclear material facility against  a potential terrorist attack. Livermore then embarked on a major program  to improve security and, according to the Office of Independent Oversight,  addressed most issues by 2002. This improved level of security  performance appears to have been sustained through 2006. Between  December 2006\u2014when Livermore\u2019s protective force performed well in an  exercise\u2014and April 2008, security performance at Livermore declined. In  response to the negative results of the 2008 Office of Independent  Oversight evaluation, Livermore appears to be refocusing management  attention on security performance.", "While our work is preliminary, we believe the actions taken by Livermore,  the Livermore Site Office, and NNSA, if and when fully implemented, will  address identified physical security issues. However, just as at LANL,  sustaining attention on physical security performance will continue to be a  challenge."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Los Alamos National Laboratory Has Implemented Measures to Enhance Cyber Security on Its Unclassified Network, but Weaknesses Remain", "paragraphs": ["LANL has implemented measures to enhance its cyber security, but  weaknesses remain in protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of information on its unclassified network. In particular, LANL  has implemented a network security system that is capable of detecting  potential intrusions on the network. However, LANL has vulnerabilities in  several critical areas, including (1) identifying and authenticating users of  the network, (2) encrypting sensitive information, (3) monitoring and  auditing compliance with security policies, (4) controlling and  documenting changes to a computer system\u2019s hardware and software, and  (5) restricting physical access to computing resources. For example,  although LANL had implemented strong authentication measures for  accessing the network, these measures were not always used. Once a user  successfully accessed the network, the user could create a separate,  simple password that would allow alternative access to certain sensitive  information. Furthermore, LANL neither conducted comprehensive  vulnerability scans of the unclassified network nor included sensitive  applications in these scans, thus leaving the network at increased risk of  compromise or disruption. In addition to these weaknesses, LANL\u2019s  computing facilities had physical security weaknesses and could be  vulnerable to intentional disruption. Specifically, we observed lax  restriction of vehicular traffic entering the laboratory and inadequate  fencing.", "A key reason for the information security weaknesses we identified is that  LANL has not yet fully implemented an information security program to  ensure that controls are effectively established and maintained. Although  LANL has implemented a security awareness training program, we  identified a number of shortcomings in its overall information security  management program. For example, (1) its risk assessment was not  comprehensive, (2) specific guidance was missing from policies and  procedures, (3) the network security plan was incomplete, (4) system  testing had shortcomings, (5) remedial action plans were incomplete and  corrective actions were not always timely, and (6) the network  contingency plan was incomplete and inadequately tested. Until LANL  ensures that the information security program associated with its  unclassified network is fully implemented, it will have limited assurance  that sensitive data are adequately protected against unauthorized  disclosure or modification or that network services will not be interrupted.", "Many of LANL\u2019s cyber security deficiencies have been the subject of prior  evaluations conducted by DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight and the  Los Alamos Site Office. The most recent reports, covering fiscal years 2006  and 2007, documented significant weaknesses with LANL\u2019s unclassified  information security program, including foreign nationals\u2019 access to the  laboratory\u2019s unclassified network. As of May 2008, LANL had granted  unclassified network access to 688 foreign nationals, including about 300  from countries identified as sensitive by DOE, such as China, India, and  Russia. In addition, foreign nationals from sensitive countries have been  authorized remote access to LANL\u2019s unclassified network. The number of  foreign nationals who have access to the unclassified network has raised  security concerns among some laboratory and NNSA officials because of  the sensitive information contained on the network. According to LANL,  the percentage of foreign nationals with authorized remote access to the  unclassified network has steadily declined over the last 5 years.", "NNSA and LANL have not agreed on the level of funding necessary for  protecting the unclassified network. From fiscal years 2001 through 2007,  LANL spent $51.4 million to protect and maintain its unclassified network.  Although LANL cyber security officials told us that funding has been  inadequate to address some of their security concerns, NNSA officials  raised questions about the basis for LANL\u2019s funding request for cyber  security. NNSA\u2019s Chief Information Officer told us that LANL has not  adequately justified requests for additional funds to address the  laboratory\u2019s stated shortfalls. In addition, NNSA officials informed us that  LANL\u2019s past budget requests were prepared on an ad hoc basis and were  not based on well-defined threat and risk assessments. In response to  these concerns, in fiscal year 2006, NNSA implemented a more systematic  approach to developing cyber security budgets across the nuclear  weapons complex, including LANL. This effort, however, does not provide  guidance that clearly lays out funding priorities. Furthermore, NNSA does  not consistently document resource allocation decisions and identify how  funding shortfalls affect critical cyber security issues.", "To help strengthen information security controls over LANL\u2019s unclassified  network, we made a series of recommendations to the Secretary of Energy  and the Administrator of NNSA, 11 of which focus on improving LANL\u2019s  information security program and determining resource requirements for  the unclassified network. For example, we recommended that the  Secretary of Energy and the NNSA Administrator require the Director of  LANL to, among other things, (1) ensure that the risk assessment for the  unclassified network evaluates all known vulnerabilities and is revised  periodically and (2) strengthen policies with a view toward further  reducing, as appropriate, foreign nationals\u2019 access to the unclassified  network, particularly those from countries identified as sensitive by DOE.  We made an additional 41 recommendations in a separate report with  limited distribution. These recommendations consist of actions to be taken  to correct the specific information security weaknesses related to  identification and authentication, cryptography, audit and monitoring,  configuration management, and physical security that we identified.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes our prepared statement.
