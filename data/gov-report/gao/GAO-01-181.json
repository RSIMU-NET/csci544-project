The welfare program provides cash assistance to needy families without means of support, while UI provides cash assistance to people temporarily unemployed. In 1996, federal legislation fundamentally changed the welfare program, putting time limits on how long most people can receive cash assistance and generally requiring recipients to engage in work activities to qualify for income support. Since that time, the welfare rolls have dropped dramatically, and large numbers of welfare recipients have started working, many in low-wage jobs. With this radical shift, the UI program is left as a more significant element of the social safety net, particularly for low- income families formerly assisted by the welfare program.", "In contrast to the welfare program, which focuses on assistance to needy families with children, UI is a social insurance program intended to partially replace lost earnings for people with prior work experience who become involuntarily unemployed and who are able, available, and actively seeking work. Premiums are paid in advance by employers as a payroll tax on wages earned by their employees. Although state law varies, this payroll tax is applied to, at a minimum, the first $7,000 of most employees\u2019 annual earnings. State law specifies the factors (for example, minimum earnings or employment period) that qualify a person to collect UI benefits.", "You expressed concerns about the ability of low-wage workers to qualify for UI benefits and asked us to examine the adequacy of the UI system as a safety net for low-wage workers and, in particular, former welfare recipients who lose employment through no fault of their own. In response to your concerns, we addressed four questions: (1) what is the overall trend in usage of the UI program among the unemployed and what are the reasons for this trend; (2) how likely are low-wage workers to receive UI benefits, compared with other workers; (3) what factors might reduce the likelihood that low-wage workers receive UI benefits; and (4) are states restructuring their policies and practices to better ensure that low-wage workers, and former welfare recipients, are included in the safety net of the UI program?", "To conduct our study, we used a combination of methods. To determine the long-term trends in the usage of the UI program, we analyzed data from the Department of Labor. To compare the likelihood that low-wage workers receive UI benefits with that of other workers, we examined data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), a national database maintained by the Bureau of the Census. For our purposes, SIPP data were available only for the 4-year period 1992 through 1995; to extend our analysis through the rest of the decade, we supplemented SIPP data with UI administrative data from the Department of Labor and with data from a national database jointly maintained by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of the Census\u2014the Current Population Survey (CPS). To determine factors that may affect the likelihood a person will receive UI benefits, we reviewed the available literature. We also surveyed UI program directors for the 50 states on eligibility criteria that may affect low-wage workers in general and former welfare recipients in particular. To obtain detailed information on state policies and practices, we talked with officials in the four most populous states\u2014California, Florida, New York, and Texas\u2014as well as collected data on other states nationwide. A fuller description of our methodology is included in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1935, as part of the Social Security Act, Congress established two programs\u2014Aid to Dependent Children and the federal-state system of unemployment insurance\u2014to provide income support to two different groups of unemployed people. Aid to Dependent Children added federal support to state systems of pensions for widows with children. The UI program, on the other hand, aimed to provide workers with partial replacement of wages lost during temporary periods of unemployment due to economic causes. Historically, the majority of people who file for UI benefits have been men.", "As administered in subsequent years (when it became known as Aid to Families With Dependent Children or AFDC), the welfare program evolved into an open-ended entitlement program, providing cash assistance to people with children, usually single parents, who earned little income. Over time, as more women with children joined the labor force, AFDC recipients with older children were expected to look for work. More recently, several states experimented with stricter work requirements (the so-called \u201cwork first\u201d philosophy) and time limits on the receipt of aid. In 1996, federal legislation known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act ended AFDC, alternatively providing block grants to the states as part of a new program called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). The legislation put a maximum 5-year limit on the availability of federal cash assistance under TANFand required adults to work or participate in work-related activities after receiving assistance for 24 months as a condition for continuing to receive benefits. Between August 1996 and December 1999, the number of TANF families declined by approximately 2.1 million, and many new workers entered the labor force.", "Unlike the Aid to Dependent Children program, the UI program has always operated as a social insurance program. It is administered as a federal-state partnership. To finance the program, the states levy and collect payroll taxes from employers. The funds collected are managed in a trust fund administered by the federal government. In almost all industries, federal standards require coverage on all work for employers who pay wages of $1,500 or more in any calendar quarter. Today UI coverage is nearly universal, extending to almost all wage and salaried workers.", "Employers pay the premiums for the UI program through federal and state payroll taxes that are assessed on employers but based on employees\u2019 earnings. Employers pay taxes on wages earned by even the lowest-paid worker. Additionally, if a worker held jobs with two different employers during the year, the wages from each job are taxed separately.", "The federal payroll tax, established by the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA), is currently set at 6.2 percent of the first $7,000 of an employee\u2019s salary. In states with UI programs that meet specified federal guidelines, employers receive a 5.4 percent credit toward their FUTA tax payment, resulting in a net federal tax of 0.8 percent. These federal taxes finance the state and federal administrative costs of the UI program, as well as the federal portion of the Extended Benefit program, advances to states with insolvent trust funds, and other related federal costs.", "The actual rate of the state tax paid by individual employers depends upon the employer\u2019s \u201cexperience rating\u201d\u2014a measure related to the amount of UI benefits collected by a firm\u2019s employees. Depending upon the employer and the state, the state payroll tax may range from 0 to 10 percent. By federal law, state taxes are assessed against at least the first $7,000 of an employee\u2019s salary. However, among the states, the wage base against which state taxes are assessed varies widely, from $7,000 (in 9 states) to $27,500 in Hawaii. The wage base is less than $11,000 in 32 states, thereby requiring the same tax whether, for example, employees earn $11,000 per year or $110,000 per year. Revenues from state UI taxes finance the payment of regular UI benefits and the state portion of the Extended Benefit program.", "Benefit coverage under the UI program is related to an individual\u2019s work history. Generally, state law provides that unemployed workers must fulfill three general conditions: (1) they must have been \u201csubstantially attached\u201d to the labor market; (2) they must have left their prior job involuntarily (such as by employer layoff) or have quit their job for \u201cgood cause\u201d only; and (3) they must be currently \u201cable and available\u201d for work, and, in most states, actively seeking work.

Studies suggest that the steady decline in workers in manufacturing jobs and in union membership has adversely affected the overall participation in the UI program.According to these studies, both the manufacturing industry and unions traditionally have encouraged labor practices that are treated favorably in UI programs. For example, union members are more likely to be laid off than fired\u2014a practice that makes workers eligible for UI benefits. Manufacturing firms tend to have layoffs of large numbers of employees who are handled as a group by UI program officials. Further, both manufacturing workers and union members are more apt to be better informed about UI benefits.", "In the past 5 decades, many states have tightened their UI regulations, increasing limitations on eligibility for UI benefits and thereby decreasing the participation in the UI program. In general, in order to demonstrate that a person is an active member of the labor force, states have a series of tests dealing with a claimant\u2019s recent work history, his or her reasons for termination from the last job, and evidence that the claimant is still available for work. For example, most states require that in order to establish that a person worked a sufficient amount of time to qualify for UI benefits, he or she must have earned a minimum amount of wages over a year\u2019s time (a so-called \u201cbase period\u201d). Over the years, many states have increased these earnings amounts, thereby limiting who can be eligible for UI benefits.", "Other limitations affect program participation as well. For instance, when the UI program was first established, people who quit their jobs for compelling personal reasons, such as pressing family obligations like lack of child care, were not disqualified from receiving UI benefits. Increasingly, however, states have enacted laws that specifically limit the generally acceptable reasons (\u201cgood cause\u201d) for quitting a job to those related to work or to the employer.The number of states with such statutory restrictions grew from 16 in 1948 to 28 in 1979, and by 1995, 38 states restricted \u201cgood cause\u201d for quitting to work-related circumstances. Under these restrictions, states generally allow a worker to collect UI benefits if a worker quit because of actions taken by an employer\u2014if, for example, an employer requires the employee to work a night shift even though the employee had been hired specifically to work only during daytime hours. On the other hand, most states disqualify a claimant for UI if he or she quit a job because of a temporary lack of child care."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Unemployed Low- Wage Workers Were Less Likely to Receive UI Than Other Unemployed Workers in the 1990s", "paragraphs": ["Unemployed low-wage workers were less likely to collect UI benefits than other unemployed workers in the early 1990s, and the most recent evidence suggests that this trend continued throughout the decade.

These two percentages were stable over the entire time period. From these factors, together with the likelihood of a higher rate of unemployment for low-wage workers, we inferred that the UI rate of receipt of low-wage workers remained lower than that of other workers. Between 1992 and 1995, SIPP data showed that the unemployment rate of low-wage workers was twice that of higher-wage workers. Our analysis of these other data showed that as long as the unemployment rate for low-wage workers continued to be substantially higher than that for other workers,the rate of UI receipt for low-wage unemployed workers would still have been lower than that for other unemployed workers in the last half of the 1990s.

The minimum amount for the base period ranges from $130 in Hawaii to $3,400 in Florida.", "As a practice, the use of earnings to measure employment history treats low-wage workers differently from higher-paid workers, even if their participation in the workforce is similar. For example, a worker in Florida earning the minimum wage of $5.15 per hour must work 660 hours to qualify for UI, while a worker earning $10.00 per hour would need to work a little over one-half as long to qualify for benefits. Although the current state earnings requirements appear fairly minimal (a full-time worker earning minimum wage for 40 hours per week would need to work 16.5 weeks to qualify for UI in Florida), they can have a negative impact on workers with a less stable job history.", "In table 7, we compare the effect of state earnings and employment requirements on two unemployed part-time workers who both lost their jobs in 2000\u2014one earned minimum wage and the other earned $10.00 per hour.

In addition, some states require that the claimant be available to take a job for any shift that might be offered.

In most states, a claimant for UI must have worked in two calendar quarters and have state wage records that show earnings in each of the quarters. However, the time it takes to add quarterly employee wage information to the state wage records generally means that the complete wage records will not be available until the next quarter after the information is received.", "Two factors cause delays in processing state wage records, which are compiled from quarterly employee wage reports. First, the wage report is not due to most states until a month after the end of the quarter in which the wages are earned. For example, the wage report for the last calendar quarter of the year (ending on December 31) is due to the state January 31. Second, after the state receives the wage report, it needs time to process it. While many states require that employers with more than 250 employees file wage reports on magnetic media, smaller companies often file on paper documents, which may take 3 to 6 weeks longer to process. Therefore, although some wage data may be available after the first month of the next quarter (February 1 in the example), all wage data may not be available until the beginning of the next quarter (April 1).", "To allow for these processing delays, most states specify that wages that count for UI must have been earned within the first four quarters of the last five completed quarters.

Thus, even if the unemployed worker in our example was eligible to receive benefits, the time it would take to have her wages count would most likely cause delay before she could apply for, and collect, UI benefits. In 1996, nine states had provisionsto allow recent wages to count, even if the wages were earned outside the normal base period, if a claimant needed the earnings to qualify for UI. In 2000, two more states (North Carolina and Wisconsin) had similar provisions.Among the remaining states, however, our survey of UI state directors indicated that it is unlikely much change will occur in the near future. Of the 39 states without provisions to count recent earnings, only one state director said that his state (Alaska) was likely to adopt such a provision, and state directors from 29 states said that their states were either very unlikely or unlikely to adopt this change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Proposals for UI Reform", "paragraphs": ["In the past 5 years, the Advisory Council on Unemployment Compensation and a stakeholder workgroup that includes state UI directors, union representatives, business representatives, and Department of Labor officials have made proposals that would expand the availability of the UI program for low-wage workers, among other reforms. According to Labor, the changing U.S. economy and its labor force have led to the current movement for reform. The UI program was designed over 60 years ago and worked well for a certain type of worker within the U.S. economy at that time. Since then, the U.S. economy and the composition of its labor force have changed, while the UI program has been slow to adapt to these changes. Labor noted that this has resulted in a larger portion of the labor force more closely resembling a category of worker that UI was not designed to assist. More recently, the reform of the welfare system has further increased the number of workers in this category.", "In 1995, the advisory council made a series of proposals regarding low- wage workers as part of a larger set of recommendations about the needs of today\u2019s labor market. Subsequently, the Department of Labor organized a dialogue with state, employer, and union representatives to continue the debate on possible UI reform. As a result of this dialogue, a stakeholder workgroup of federal, state, and private sector officials recently proposed reforms for the UI program. Reform proposals applicable to low-wage workers from these two groups include the following:", "ShortenthelagtimeinqualifyingearningsforUIeligibility. The advisory council recommended that all states use a \u201cmoveable\u201d base period to consider earnings necessary to qualify a claimant for benefits. Under this proposal, the minimum earnings requirement could be met by earnings from the last four completed quarters, rather than from the first four of the last five completed quarters. Although initially the stakeholder workgroup considered a proposal to provide incentive funding to the states for \u201calternative\u201d base periods similar to the advisory council\u2019s moveable base period, ultimately it suggested that states try to use technology advances to process the UI reports faster and, where at all possible, to use the latest wage earnings available for all claimants.", "SetminimumstandardsforUIearningsrequirements. The advisory council recommended that all states set their laws so that required base period earnings do not exceed 800 times the state\u2019s minimum wage. In its dialogue, the Department of Labor asked for comments on a proposal that would set the minimum earnings requirements to 400 times the minimum wage (this figure was selected so that someone who had worked for 20 weeks for 20 hours at minimum wage would be eligible for benefits in every state). However, the final proposals from the stakeholder workgroup did not include any recommendation on this issue.", "Donotdisqualifyclaimantsseekingpart-timework. Both the advisory council and the stakeholder workgroup proposed that states should not reject claimants simply because they are looking for part-time, rather than full-time, work.", "Donotdisqualifyclaimantswhoquitajobtocareforadependent. Although neither group ultimately recommended this proposal, the Department of Labor originally offered it for comment. The proposal would have provided financial incentives to states to pay UI benefits to claimants who had to quit their jobs to care temporarily for a child or other family member.", "State objections to these proposals focus on the expansion of benefits, and the states argue that (1) the costs of the proposals are burdensome and (2) the proposals violate the traditional roles of the federal and state governments in the operation of the UI program. Regarding the first issue, the states point to, for example, the extra costs of obtaining the most recent earnings records for UI claimants. In response to proposed state legislation, Texas estimated the extra administrative costs at $153,000 annually for making special requests to employers for recent wage information. The proposal from the stakeholder workgroup would eliminate the requirement that states make these special requests, instead calling for federal funding of improved technology to accelerate state processing of UI wage records. However, the largest cost cited by states relates to the increased number of claimants receiving UI benefits. If alternative base provisions were implemented, Texas estimated that the annual costs to the unemployment insurance trust fund would be $24 million per year in benefits paid to potential claimants; California officials estimated their costs at $33 million per year.", "From the standpoint of the states, the second objection\u2014changes to the traditional roles of the state and federal governments\u2014raises more difficult problems. While the federal government has imposed some specific requirements, these requirements are viewed as minor conditions only; for example, UI claimants cannot be denied benefits if they refuse work as a union strikebreaker. In contrast, the proposals discussed here\u2014for example, the earnings requirements or allowable reasons for quitting a job\u2014pertain to issues that state officials consider integral to the operation of the state\u2019s UI program that, until now, have been generally under the control of the state."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusion", "paragraphs": ["Despite interest in ensuring that the UI program is meeting the needs of low-wage workers, little action has been taken at the state or federal levels to expand UI availability to this group. In part, this reflects the difficulty of addressing the cost implications of expanded eligibility and balancing states\u2019 autonomy in operating their UI programs. Yet, as a safety net, the UI program continues to offer only minimal protection for low-wage workers. Even though employers in many states pay the same UI payroll taxes for employees earning minimum wage as they pay for employees earning far more than that amount, low-wage workers are much less likely than higher- wage workers to be included in the UI safety net. In the event of an economic downturn, many low-wage workers may find that, unlike higher- wage workers, they will be unable to qualify for UI benefits. While the situation deserves attention on its own merits, the sweeping changes in national welfare policy heighten its importance. A UI program that supports all workers who lose their jobs through no fault of their own during times of economic hardship can play an important role in helping many former welfare recipients maintain their places in the labor force and out of the welfare system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In its review of a draft of this report, the Department of Labor generally agreed with our findings and conclusion.

SIPP records data on a monthly basis. Since it is possible for an individual to be both employed and unemployed in the same month, to address this issue, we consulted with officials at the Bureau of the Census.We considered a person as employed if he or she had a job for the entire month or, if the person missed work during this period, it was not because he or she was laid off and he or she spent no time looking for a job.We considered a person as unemployed if he or she was out of work for the entire month or, if the person did work for part of the month, he or she spent the rest of the time laid off or looking for another job.We did not include those who were out of the labor force.", "Step 3: We \u201clooked back\u201d 27 months for the most recent job.", "To determine the wage level of an unemployed person, we identified the most recent job held by that person. To do this, we reviewed the work history to determine whether the person had had a job during the period covered by the SIPP panel. Starting in March of the last panel year (the month we used to determine unemployment), we looked back on a month- by-month basis to determine the most recent month in which that person was identified as employed. By using March of the last panel year we could, where necessary, look back for a period of 27 months to identify prior employment. In some cases, a respondent did not have a job during the entire 27-month period. If a respondent had not held a job at all during this time, we excluded the person from our sample.", "Step 4: We divided our sample into low-wage and higher-wage workers.", "We divided both the employed and unemployed populations into either low-wage or higher-wage workers on the basis of data from the current job if the person was employed or from the person\u2019s most recent job if unemployed. We defined low-wage as earning $8 per hour or less, based on 1999 dollars. For our analysis, we adjusted the rate for inflation. We determined the $8 level by dividing the annual income for a family of four at the federal poverty level by 2,080 hours (full-year, full-time employment).We determined each person\u2019s hourly earnings in one of two ways: (1) if the data included an hourly wage, we used the reported hourly wage in the most recent month that the person was employed or (2) if there was no reported hourly wage, we constructed an hourly wage using data from the most recent month that the person was employed (reported monthly salary divided by the number of weeks worked in the month multiplied by the number of hours usually worked during the week). In some cases, a respondent who had had a job could not be classified as either low-wage or higher-wage because of missing wage or salary data.

To identify the kinds of industries low-wage and higher-wage unemployed workers had worked, we used the industry code of the most recent job. Our work presents data for nine industry groups: (1) retail trade; (2) manufacturing; (3) finance; (4) mining and construction; (5) agriculture, fishing, and forestry; (6) wholesale trade; (7) transportation and utilities; (8) public administration; and (9) services. We developed these groups by combining detailed CPS industry codes. For example, the services sector combines five types of service industries: business services, personal and entertainment services, medical services, education and social services, and professional services.", "Next, we identified whether the unemployed former worker had been employed full-time or part-time.

After identifying the most recent job in the 15-month period, we counted how many weeks each person had worked during the 12 months before becoming unemployed. We classified the unemployed low-wage and higher-wage workers into three categories: (1) those who had worked more than 35 weeks during the year, (2) those who had worked between 20 and 35 weeks during the year, and (3) those who had worked fewer than 20 weeks during the year.

Also, our analysis excludes those who are self-employed, while the standard rate includes self-employed workers.
