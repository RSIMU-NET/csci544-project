According to FEMA\u2014a component within the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014these disasters affected 47  million people, or about 15 percent of the nation\u2019s population. Once a  major disaster has been declared by the President, federal contracts play  a key role in its immediate aftermath and in long-term community  recovery by providing life-sustaining goods and services to survivors.  FEMA has obligated billions of dollars on contracts in response to the  2017 disasters.", "The Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act (PKEMRA) of  2006 required FEMA, among other things, to establish advance contracts.  Advance contracts are established prior to disasters to quickly provide  life-sustaining goods and services in the immediate aftermath of a  disaster. FEMA may also award new contracts to support disaster  response efforts following a disaster declaration. According to FEMA  officials, these post-disaster contract awards may be required, for  example, if advance contracts reach their capacity, or if goods and  services that are not suitable for advance contracts are needed.  According to our analysis of Federal Procurement Data System-Next  Generation (FPDS-NG) data, federal agencies had obligated about $9.5  billion in response to the three 2017 hurricanes and the California  wildfires as of June 30, 2018\u2014the most recent and complete data  available. FEMA obligated about $2.9 billion of this total through advance  contracts, and roughly an additional $1.6 billion through post-disaster  contracts.", "My statement today addresses key challenges FEMA faced contracting  for goods and services in response to these disasters. This statement is  primarily based on reports we issued in December 2018 and April 2019  on FEMA\u2019s disaster contracting activities in response to the 2017  hurricanes and California wildfires. For the reports cited, among other  methodologies, we reviewed FPDS-NG data through June 30, 2018\u2014the  most recent and complete data available\u2014to identify FEMA contract  obligations for the 2017 disasters.

However, our prior work identified  challenges FEMA faced in its acquisition and workforce planning efforts  for disaster contracting. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR)  requires agencies to perform acquisition planning activities for all  acquisitions to ensure that the government meets its needs in the most  effective, economical, and timely manner possible. In our December  2018 report, we found that FEMA had guidance in place establishing  timeframes for certain FEMA acquisitions following the completion of the  acquisition package. Further, FEMA implemented an acquisition tracking  tool in 2016\u2014the 5-Year Master Acquisition Planning Schedule (MAPS)\u2014 which monitors the status of and provides acquisition planning timeframes  for certain high value and mission-critical acquisitions, including advance  contracts, regardless of dollar value.", "However, we found that FEMA had not established timeframes or  released guidance for the pre-solicitation phase of the acquisition  planning process, when program officials identify a need and develop key  acquisition package documents (see figure 1).", "Not adhering to suggested timeframes can place a burden on contracting  officers and increase the likelihood of not awarding a contract on  schedule. This, in turn, may create a need for FEMA to non-competitively  extend the existing contract\u2014this extension may be considered a bridge  contract. Given the lack of a government-wide definition, we defined  bridge contracts in our prior work as: extensions to an existing contract  beyond its period of performance (including base and options) and new,  short-term contracts awarded on a sole-source basis to an incumbent  contractor to avoid a lapse in service caused by a delay in awarding a  follow-on contract. FEMA officials acknowledged that the use of non- competitive bridge contracts is not an ideal practice as they cannot  ensure the government is paying what it should for goods and services.  However, in December 2018, we found that FEMA used bridge contracts  for at least 10 of its advance contracts used in response to the 2017  disasters\u2014with some of these contracts lasting for several years.", "To decrease dependence on bridge contracts, FEMA established MAPS  to help track and monitor the status of acquisition planning timeframes for  certain acquisitions. However, most of the program office and contracting  officials we spoke with during our December 2018 review had limited  familiarity with the tool. In our December 2018 report, we recommended  that FEMA update and implement existing guidance to identify acquisition  planning timeframes and considerations across the entire acquisition  planning process and clearly communicate the purpose and use of its  acquisition planning tool to relevant personnel. DHS concurred, but in its  response to our report stated it believed existing outreach and training on  MAPS had resolved these challenges. We acknowledged FEMA\u2019s training  in our report, but noted that not all relevant staff we spoke with were  familiar with MAPS, and that there was no formal guidance on the  timeframes for the entirety of the acquisition planning process. Given  these issues, we continue to believe FEMA needs to take additional steps  to implement our recommendation.", "Without planning and guidance on its use of advance contracts, FEMA  lacks reasonable assurance that it is maximizing their use to the extent  practicable and cost-effective to quickly provide goods and services  following a disaster. PKEMRA requires the FEMA Administrator to  develop a contracting strategy that maximizes the use of advance  contracts to the extent practical and cost effective, and FEMA contracting  officials told us that advance contracts should be used before awarding  new contracts. However, in December 2018, we found that FEMA\u2019s  advance contract strategy and guidance did not clearly identify the  objectives of advance contracts or whether and how they should be  prioritized for use in relation to new post-disaster contracts.", "For example, we reported that FEMA\u2019s lack of an updated strategy and  guidance contributed to confusion and challenges with the use of  advance contracts for tarps, used to cover small areas of roof damage.  Although FEMA had awarded advance contracts to provide tarps, a  subsequent modification to these contracts limited the ability to use them  for immediate disaster response needs\u2014one of FEMA\u2019s stated purposes.  Furthermore, we found that FEMA awarded vendors new post-disaster  contracts for tarps before using its existing advance contracts. According  to FEMA officials at that time, neither of the post-disaster contract  vendors was able to provide the required tarps when needed. We  concluded that the timing and use of the existing tarp advance contracts  raised questions about the ability of contracting officers to use these  contracts to provide tarps immediately following disasters. Additionally,  we concluded that an updated advance contracting strategy could have  enabled FEMA to more quickly provide the needed tarps to survivors,  considering the additional time and staff resources needed to award new  post-disaster contracts.", "In our December 2018 report, we recommended that FEMA update its  strategy to clearly define the objectives of advance contracts, how they  contribute to FEMA\u2019s disaster response operations, and whether and how  they should be prioritized in relation to making new, post-disaster contract  awards. We also recommended FEMA update its guidance accordingly.  DHS concurred with these two recommendations and identified actions it  plans to take to address them.", "Our prior work also showed that FEMA\u2019s ability to adequately plan for and  manage its disaster contracts is further complicated by persistent  acquisition workforce challenges, including attrition and staffing  shortages. In April 2019, we found that FEMA had identified workforce  shortages as a continuing challenge for disaster response and recovery.  But FEMA had not assessed its contracting workforce\u2014including regional  contracting workforce needs\u2014since at least 2014. We recommended  FEMA assess its workforce needs to address these shortcomings and  develop a plan, including timelines. DHS agreed, identified steps FEMA  has taken and plans to take to address the recommendation, and  estimated addressing the recommendation by September 2019."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Continued Challenges Coordinating with Federal, State, and Local Partners on Contracting Issues", "paragraphs": ["Our prior reports found that FEMA experienced challenges coordinating  with state, local, and federal partners over disaster preparation and  response efforts. Coordination is critical to ensuring that states and  localities have their own tools in place to facilitate disaster response, and  that contracting needs are clearly communicated and considered among  federal agencies. Yet FEMA faced continued challenges and  inconsistencies in its coordination with states and localities over the use  of advance contracts.", "In January 2017, FEMA updated guidance to include requirements for  coordination with state and local governments on the use of federal  advance contracts. This update was in response to our September 2015  finding that there were inconsistencies in whether and how staff in  FEMA\u2019s regional offices performed state and local outreach on advance  contracting efforts. However, in December 2018, we reported on similar  inconsistencies in state and local outreach. We found that FEMA\u2019s  guidance did not specify how often or what types of advance contract  information should be shared with states and localities, or instruct FEMA  contracting officers to encourage states and localities to establish their  own advance contracts for the types of goods and services needed during  a disaster. As a result, we found that while some FEMA regional officials  regularly performed outreach with states and localities to assist them with  establishing advance contracts for goods and services commonly needed  during a disaster\u2014like security, transportation, and office supplies\u2014other  FEMA regional officials did so less frequently. According to regional  officials, coordinating more frequently with states and localities allows  them to avoid overlap between state and federal contracting efforts, and  helps FEMA officials know what resources the states have in place before  a disaster occurs and how long states are capable of providing those  resources following a disaster. We recommended in our December 2018  report that FEMA update its guidance to provide specific direction for  contracting officers to perform outreach to states and localities on the use  and establishment of advance contracts. DHS concurred and stated it  would update guidance and continue efforts to establish resources for  state and local governments on advance contracts.", "Information on FEMA\u2019s advance contracts can be used to facilitate state  and local coordination over the use and establishment of advance  contracts. However, our work showed that this information was  inconsistent and could further hinder FEMA\u2019s information sharing and  coordination efforts. In December 2018, we reviewed FEMA\u2019s advance  contract list and other resources FEMA contracting officials said they  used to identify advance contracts\u2014like biannual training  documentation\u2014and found differences in the advance contracts  identified. For example, we reported that FEMA officials told us that the  advance contract list available to contracting officers is updated on a  monthly basis. However, our analysis found that 58 advance contracts  identified on the June 2018 advance contract list had not been included in  contracting officers\u2019 May 2018 training documentation. The missing  contracts included those for telecommunications services, generators,  and manufactured housing units.", "Recognizing some of the shortcomings in communicating with state and  local governments following the 2017 disasters, FEMA stated it would  develop a toolkit to provide states and localities with recommendations for  advance contracts, emergency acquisition guidance, and solicitation  templates. However, at the time of our December 2018 review, FEMA  officials were uncertain what information they would share with states and  localities on advance contracts, and said they did not plan to provide the  complete list of the advance contracts FEMA has in place to avoid being  overly prescriptive. Yet without a centralized and up-to-date resource on  advance contracts, FEMA contracting officers and their state and local  counterparts may not be able to effectively communicate about advance  contracts and use them to respond to future disasters. Given FEMA\u2019s  recent emphasis on the importance of states and localities having the  capability to provide their own life-saving goods and services in the  immediate aftermath of a disaster, we concluded that clearly  communicating consistent and up-to-date information on the availability  and limitations of federal advance contracts is imperative to informing  state and local disaster response efforts.", "In our December 2018 report, we recommended that FEMA identify a  single centralized resource listing its advance contracts and ensure that  resource is updated regularly. Further, we recommended that FEMA  should communicate information on advance contracts using that  resource to states and localities to inform their advance contracting  efforts. DHS concurred with these two recommendations and identified  some steps it planned to take, but also stated it believes the existing  advance contract list satisfies our recommendation for a single  centralized resource. However, as our report noted, we found  inconsistencies in this list that FEMA needs to address for advance  contract information to be complete and up-to-date for the contracting  officers who rely on it.", "In addition to challenges coordinating with state and local governments,  we identified coordination and planning concerns between FEMA and  other federal agencies. As the federal disaster coordinator, FEMA obtains  requirements from states and localities. It then tasks the appropriate  federal agencies with specific missions, based on their emergency  support functions. Agencies assigned to specific missions are then  responsible for fulfilling requirements, and may use contracts to do so.  However, we reported in April 2019 that some federal agencies  experienced challenges coordinating with FEMA and state and local  partners. For example, USACE officials reported that, during their debris  removal mission following the California wildfires, local officials believed  that the soil removed would be replaced. However, this was not part of  the mission assignment from USACE to FEMA. In these instances,  agency officials told us they relied on FEMA to communicate information  on their mission assignments to be able to administer contracts.", "According to a FEMA official during our April 2019 review, coordination  and planning concerns related to mission assignments\u2014like contracting  considerations\u2014should be worked out in advance between FEMA and  agencies such as USACE. However, we found that FEMA policy and  guidance lack details on how that coordination should take place. Further,  a FEMA official told us that contracting considerations are not necessarily  built into mission assignments. We recommended in April 2019 that  FEMA revise its mission assignment policy and guidance to better  incorporate consideration of contracting needs and ensure clear  communication of coordination responsibilities related to contracting. DHS  concurred and plans to develop tools and training within the next year to  provide the necessary guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Challenges with Tracking of Contract Use", "paragraphs": ["Limited transparency into disaster contracting obligations further  complicates the challenges noted above. We found in April 2019 that the  full extent of disaster contracting\u2014for both advance and post-disaster  contracts\u2014related to the 2017 disasters was and continues to be  unknown. This was due to changes in the criteria for establishing and  closing a national interest action (NIA) code\u2014a mechanism for  government-wide tracking of emergency or contingency-related  contracting\u2014in FPDS-NG, and DHS\u2019s inconsistent implementation of the  updated criteria for closing codes. Specifically, the codes for Harvey and  Irma closed on June 30, 2018, less than a full year after the hurricanes  hit. The code for Maria is valid through June 15, 2019, about 21 months  after that hurricane made landfall. This is in contrast to prior hurricanes,  for which codes sometimes remained open more than 5 years after the  disaster, with the code for Hurricane Katrina being open for 13 years after  the disaster. The ability to identify disaster contracting for the 2018  hurricanes was similarly limited as the NIA codes for Hurricanes Florence  and Michael expired on March 15, 2019 and April 12, 2019, respectively,  about 6 months after those storms made landfall.", "Based on a memorandum of agreement, the General Services  Administration (GSA), DHS, and the Department of Defense (DOD) are  jointly responsible for determining when a NIA code should be  established and closed. DHS delegated its role, on behalf of civilian  agencies for disaster or emergency events, to its Office of the Chief  Procurement Officer. The agreement outlines criteria DHS should  consider in making determinations to establish and close a NIA code. For  our April 2019 review, we identified changes in these criteria between  June 2012 and June 2018. For example, the updated agreement does not  include the national interest and visibility of an event as criteria for  extending a NIA code, allowing a NIA code to expire regardless of the  high visibility of the event and information needs of key users. DHS  officials reported several rationales to support their decision to close the  NIA codes for the 2017 hurricanes, but these were inconsistent with the  criteria in the agreement and did not consider key user needs or fully  explain the decisions to close the codes.", "Once a NIA code in FPDS-NG is closed, there is no other publicly  available, government-wide system available to comprehensively track  contract obligations for specific events. Our April 2019 report  demonstrated the magnitude of contract dollars that are no longer easily  trackable once a NIA code is closed. For example, using the description  field in FPDS-NG, we found that between July 1 and September 30,  2018\u2014after the NIA codes were closed\u2014agencies obligated at least  $259 million on contracts for Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. However, not  all agencies put event-specific information in the description field, and we  found for the 2017 hurricanes only 35 percent of contract obligations  linked to a NIA code included this information. Moreover, as we have  previously reported, and illustrate in figure 2, it can take years to fully  account for federal contract obligations related to response and recovery  after a hurricane.", "In our April 2019 report, we made two recommendations, including that", "GSA, in coordination with DOD and DHS, assess whether the criteria  in the current NIA code agreement meets the long-term needs for high  visibility events and account for the needs of users, such as FEMA,  other agencies, and Congress; and  in the interim, DHS, in coordination with DOD and GSA, should keep  the existing NIA codes for disasters open, reopen the NIA codes for  Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Florence, and Michael, and request that  agencies retroactively update applicable contract actions to reflect  these codes, to the extent practicable.", "GSA and DOD indicated they would work jointly with DHS to assess the  criteria in the agreement within the year. DHS did not comment on that  recommendation. Given the high visibility and national interest in these  events, assessing the criteria, keeping NIA codes open, and reopening  closed codes for the recent disasters to the extent practicable would help  ensure visibility over federal disaster contracts.", "In conclusion, given the circumstances surrounding the 2017 disasters,  and the importance of preparedness for future disasters, it is critical to  ensure that FEMA is well-positioned to respond through its use of  contracts. Our work has shown that without effective planning on the use  of contracts, FEMA may face challenges in quickly providing critical  goods and services to survivors following a disaster. Further, without  effective coordination, FEMA cannot ensure that local, state, and federal  partners have the tools they need to assist in disaster response.  Moreover, not tracking certain information on a government-wide basis in  FPDS-NG may result in key users lacking the information necessary to  provide oversight of FEMA\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 disaster contract  actions. Implementing our recommendations to update its planning  guidance and advance contract strategy; assess acquisition workforce  needs; improve coordination with state, local, and federal partners; and  improve tracking of disaster contracting actions will help FEMA overcome  key challenges it faces in contracting during a disaster, and improve  future response efforts.", "Chairman Payne, Chairwoman Torres Small, Ranking Members King and  Crenshaw, and members of the subcommittees, this concludes my  statement.
