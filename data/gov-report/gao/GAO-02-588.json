Our review had determined that the District\u2019s fiscal  year 2000 report was of limited usefulness because the District had  introduced new plans, goals, and measures throughout the year, the goals  and measures were in a state of flux due to these changes, and its report  did not cover significant activities, such as the District\u2019s public schools, an  activity that accounted for more than 15 percent of the District\u2019s budget.  In  response, the District concurred with our findings and acknowledged that  additional work was needed to make the District\u2019s performance  management system serve the needs of its citizens and Congress.

In  accordance with requirements contained in P.L. 103-373, we consulted with  a representative of the director of the Office of Management and Budget  concerning our review.  We did not verify the accuracy or reliability of the  performance data included in the District\u2019s report, including information on  the court orders in effect for fiscal year 2001.", "We provided a draft of this report to the mayor of the District of Columbia  for review and comment.

The District included 26  additional agencies in this year\u2019s report, compared with 40 in its prior  report for fiscal year 2000.  Appendix I lists the 66 agencies included in the  District\u2019s 2001 performance accountability report, along with the 2001  actual expenditures for each of these agencies.  However, the absence of  goals and measures related to educational activities remains the most  significant gap.", "The District reports that it is continuing its efforts to include performance  information on its significant activities in its performance accountability  reports.  For example, the 2001 performance accountability report notes  that the District of Columbia Public Schools (DCPS) did not include  performance goals or measures because they were in the early stages of a  long-term strategic planning process initiated by the newly installed school  board.  DCPS accounted for about 14 percent of the District\u2019s fiscal year  2001 actual expenditures, and public charter schools, which also were not  included, accounted for another 2 percent of the District\u2019s 2001  expenditures.  The 2001 report states that in lieu of a formal performance  accountability report for DCPS, the District included a copy of the  Superintendent\u2019s testimony before the Subcommittee on the District of  Columbia, Committee on Government Reform, U.S. House of  Representatives.  The District acknowledged that the inclusion of this  information does not fully comply with the statutory requirement and set  forth a plan to include DCPS performance goals and measures in the fiscal  year 2003 proposed budget and financial plan that will serve as the basis for  the DCPS performance accountability report for fiscal year 2002.", "The 2001 report lists another 10 agencies that were not included, primarily,  according to the report, because they did not publish performance goals  and measures in the fiscal year 2002 proposed budget.  These 10 agencies  accounted for about $330 million in fiscal year 2001 actual expenditures, or  about 6 percent of the District\u2019s total fiscal year 2001 actual expenditures.   These agencies included the Child and Family Services Agency, which was  under receivership until June 15, 2001 (with fiscal year 2001 actual  expenditures of $189 million) and public charter schools (with fiscal year  2001 expenditures of $137 million).  Although it may not be appropriate to  include agency performance information in some cases, the performance  accountability report should provide a rationale for excluding them.  For  example, Advisory Neighborhood Commissions, according to the deputy  mayor, have a wide range of agendas that cannot be captured in a single set  of meaningful measures. Table 3 lists these 10 agencies and their fiscal year  2001 actual expenditures.", "In addition to these 10 agencies, the District also did not specifically  include other areas constituting 11 percent of the District\u2019s fiscal year 2001  actual expenditures.  In view of the District\u2019s interest in tying resources to  results, the District could further improve its performance accountability  reports by linking these budget activities as appropriate to the agencies  that are responsible for these expenditures or provide a rationale for  exclusion.  For example, the Department of Employment Services  administers the unemployment and disability funds (with fiscal year 2001  expenditures totaling about $32 million).  Similarly, the Office of the  Corporation Counsel administers the settlement and judgments fund,  which was set up to settle claims and lawsuits and pay judgments in tort  cases entered against the District (with fiscal year 2001 expenditures of  about $26 million).

Using a  consistent set of goals enhanced the understandability of the report by  demonstrating how performance measured throughout the year  contributed toward achieving the District\u2019s goals.  The District also used  clear criteria for rating performance on a five-point scale and reported that  these ratings were included in the performance evaluations of cabinet  agency directors who had performance contracts with the mayor.  In  addition, according to a District official, the District will be able to provide  information on any future changes made to its performance goals through  its new performance management database.", "The District has made substantial progress in improving its performance  planning and reporting efforts by focusing on measuring progress toward  achieving a consistent set of goals.  In our June 2001 review of the District\u2019s  2000 performance accountability report, we had raised concerns that the  District\u2019s performance management process was in flux, with goals  changing continually throughout the year.  Further, the District did not  discuss the reasons for these changes.  This year, the goals were consistent  and the District provided some information about upcoming changes that  could be anticipated in fiscal year 2002 goals.  In addition, according to the  2001 report, the District has developed a performance measures database  to allow it to document changes to individual goals and measures that are  proposed in the agencies\u2019 fiscal year 2003 budget submissions.", "One of the District\u2019s enhancements to its 2001 performance accountability  report was reporting on a five-point performance rating scale, as compared  to the three-point performance rating scale it used in its fiscal year 2000  report.  The five-point scale was designed to be consistent with the rating  scale used in the District\u2019s Performance Management Program, under  which management supervisory service, excepted service, and selected  career service personnel develop individual performance plans against  which they are evaluated at the end of the year.  The five ratings are:   (1) below expectations, (2) needs improvement, (3) meets expectations,  (4) exceeds expectations, and (5) significantly exceeds expectations.   According to the fiscal year 2001 performance accountability report, this  scale was used to evaluate the performance of cabinet agency directors  who held performance contracts with the mayor.  It stated that 60-percent  of each director\u2019s performance rating was based on the agency-specific  goals included in the agency\u2019s performance accountability report, with the  other 40-percent based on operational support requirements such as  responsiveness to customers, risk management, and local business  contracting.  Our work has found that performance agreements can  become an increasingly vital part of overall efforts to improve  programmatic performance and better achieve results.  We found that the  use of results-oriented performance agreements:  strengthened alignment of results-oriented goals with daily operations,  fostered collaboration across organizational boundaries,  enhanced opportunities to discuss and routinely use performance  information to make program improvements,  provided a results-oriented basis for individual accountability, and  maintained continuity of program goals during leadership transitions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Report Generally Adhered to Statutory Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The District\u2019s fiscal year 2001 performance accountability report reflected  improvement in adhering to the statutory requirements in the Federal  Payment Reauthorization Act.

It included the titles of the District management employee most  directly responsible for the achievement of each of the goals and the title of  that employee\u2019s immediate supervisor, as required by the statute.  We also  found that the names and titles on the performance contracts of the cabinet  level officials we reviewed matched the names in the performance report  as the immediate supervisor for all of the goals.

The 2001 report contains information on the  same 12 court orders involving civil actions against the District reported on  for fiscal years 1999 and 2000.  Among these 12 orders are 2 orders that the  fiscal year 2001 report lists as no longer in effect in 2001.  One of these  court orders involved a receivership that terminated in May 2000.

In the  spirit of building on the progress that the District has made in improving its  performance accountability reports over the last 2 years, there are three  key areas where we believe that improvements in future performance  accountability reports are needed.  First, the District needs to be more  inclusive in reporting on court orders to more fully comply with the act\u2019s  requirements.  Second, as part of the District\u2019s emphasis on expanding its  performance-based budgeting approach, the District needs to validate and  verify the performance data it relies on to measure performance and assess  progress, present this information in its performance accountability  reports, and describe its strategies to address any known data limitations.   Finally, the District needs to continue its efforts to include goals and  measures for its major activities, and it should include related expenditure  information to provide a more complete picture of the resources targeted  toward achieving an agency\u2019s goals and therefore help to enhance  transparency and accountability."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The District Should Be More Inclusive in Reporting on Court Orders", "paragraphs": ["Since this is the third year that the District has had to develop performance  and accountability reports, the District has had sufficient time to determine  how best to present information on the status of any court orders that are  applicable to the District of Columbia during the fiscal year and the steps  taken to comply with those orders.  However, the District has continued to  report on the same 12 court orders for fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001.", "By limiting its presentation to the same 12 court orders, the District\u2019s  current report does not provide assurance that the information in its  performance accountability report reflects court orders applicable during  the fiscal year.  Court orders have an important effect on the District\u2019s  performance, as reflected by the chief financial officer\u2019s statement that the  District\u2019s \u201cunforeseen expenses are often driven by new legislative  imperatives, court-ordered mandates, and suits and settlements.\u201d  As  another indication of their importance, 1 of the 11 general clauses in  performance contracts with agency directors addresses the directors\u2019  responsiveness to court orders.", "To make future reports more useful, the District should include information  on the status of court orders it has not previously reported on as well as  those applicable during the fiscal year, including those that may have been  vacated during the fiscal year and the steps taken to comply with them.    The District should establish objective criteria for determining the types of  court orders for which it will provide specific compliance information for  future performance accountability reports, and it should consider ways to  provide summary information related to any other court orders.  In  establishing objective criteria, the factors could include the cost, time, and  magnitude of effort involved in complying with a court order.

Data verification and validation are key steps in assessing whether  the measures are timely, reliable, and adequately represent actual  performance.

These  guidelines were to be issued in response to an Inspector General\u2019s finding  that the agencies did not maintain records and other supporting  documentation for the accomplishments they reported regarding the fiscal  year 2000 performance contracts.  The District included information in its  fiscal year 2003 budget instructions regarding performance measures  emphasizing the importance of high quality data.

The District plans to  begin developing manuals to document how data for each performance  measure is collected, how the measure is calculated, and who is  responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting the data.  A further step  the District can consider is ensuring that these data are independently  verified and validated.  A District official acknowledged that validating and  verifying performance information is something the District would deal  with in the future.  Credible performance information is essential for  accurately assessing agencies\u2019 progress toward the achievement of their  goals and pinpointing specific solutions to performance shortfalls.   Agencies also need reliable information during their planning efforts to set  realistic goals.", "Decision makers must have reliable and timely performance and financial  information to ensure adequate accountability, manage for results, and  make timely and well-informed judgments.  Data limitations should also be  documented and disclosed.  Without reliable information on costs, for  example, decision makers cannot effectively control and reduce costs,  assess performance, and evaluate programs.

He said that the OIG  conducted spot-check audits of selected scorecard goals in the fiscal year  2000 performance accountability report and although these limited audits  allowed the District to determine the validity of only those particular  measures, this effort provided valuable observations and suggestions on  how District agencies could improve its data collection practices.  He also  said that his office has discussed initiating additional spot-check audits of  selected goals and measures with the OIG during fiscal year 2002.  We agree  that such spot checks would be useful.  The knowledge that the OIG will be  spot-checking some performance data during each fiscal year provides a  good incentive to develop and use accurate, high-quality data.  In our prior  work, we have encouraged federal agencies to use a variety of strategies to  verify and validate their performance information, depending upon the  unique characteristics of their programs, stakeholder concerns,  performance measures, and data resources.  In addition to relying on  inspector general assessments of data systems and performance measures,  the District can use feedback from data users and external stakeholders to  help ensure that measures are valid for their intended use.  Other  approaches can include taking steps to comply with quality standards  established by professional organizations and/or using technical or peer  review panels to ensure that performance data meet quality specifications.   The District can also test the accuracy of its performance data by  comparing it with other sources of similar data, such as data obtained from  external studies, prior research, and program evaluations.", "The deputy mayor said that the District would be making efforts to include  additional agencies and budget activities in future performance reports.   We encourage the District to proceed with these efforts.  Of the 10 agencies  that were not included in the fiscal year 2001 performance report, the  District has already included 3 agencies (the Office of Asian and Pacific  Islander Affairs, the Child and Family Services Agency, and the Office of  Veteran Affairs) in its fiscal year 2002 performance plan issued in March  2002.  In addition, the deputy mayor stated that three additional agencies  (the Office of the Secretary, the Housing Finance Agency, and the National  Capital Revitalization Corporation) would be included in the District\u2019s  consensus budget to be submitted to the Council of the District of  Columbia in June 2002.", "With regard to the budget activities that were not included in the District\u2019s  fiscal year 2001 performance report, the deputy mayor agreed that it would  be appropriate to develop performance measures for six funds, such as  settlements and judgments and administration of the disability  compensation fund.  The deputy mayor acknowledged that establishing  performance measures for administering an additional six funds, such as  the Public Benefit Corporation, would have been appropriate but they no  longer exist.  The deputy mayor said that the District of Columbia  Retirement Board manages two funds that had relevant performance  measures in the District\u2019s 2001 report.  We noted, however, that these two  retirement funds were not specifically identified in the 2001 performance  accountability report.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Honorable Anthony A. Williams,  Mayor of the District of Columbia.  We will make copies available to others  upon request.", "Key contributors to this report were Katherine Cunningham, Steven  Lozano, Sylvia Shanks, and Susan Ragland.
