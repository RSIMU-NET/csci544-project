The nine programs GAO examined illustrate the range of federal fiscal exposures (see figure) and how they can change over time. Also, some programs may have elements of both explicit and implicit exposure. Federal insurance programs, for example, fall across the spectrum: if an event occurs, some payment is legally required--an explicit exposure. However, there may be an expectation that the government will provide assistance beyond the amount legally required--that is an implicit exposure. Prior to 2008, securities issued by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac were explicitly not backed by the U.S. government. However, in response to the financial crisis, the government's agreement to provide temporary assistance to cover their losses up to a set amount created a new explicit exposure. The amount of future spending arising from federal fiscal exposures varies in the degree to which it is known and can be measured.", "For some exposures GAO found that the budget provided incomplete information or potentially misleading signals regarding the full cost of the commitments made today. A uniform across-the-board approach to make fiscal exposures more apparent when making budget decisions may not be appropriate given their varying characteristics. Several factors need to be taken into account in selecting an approach to better recognize fiscal exposures in the budget: the extent of the government's legal commitment; the length of time until the resulting payment is made; and the extent to which the magnitude of the exposure can be reasonably estimated. Expanding the availability and use of supplemental information, including measures that can signal significant changes in the magnitude of fiscal exposures, would be an important first step to enhancing oversight over federal resources and can aid in monitoring the financial condition of programs over the longer term. Incorporating measures of the full cost into primary budget data would provide enhanced control over future spending, which can help both improve the nation's fiscal condition and enhance budgetary flexibility."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making new recommendations but this analysis provides additional support for past recommendations to improve budget recognition of fiscal exposures by, for example, expanding the availability and use of information on expected future spending arising from commitments made today."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Our simulations of the federal government\u2019s long-term fiscal outlook lead  to an overarching conclusion: current fiscal policy is unsustainable over  the long term.

Fiscal  exposures may be explicit in that the government is legally required to  fund the commitment, or implicit in that an exposure arises not from a  legal commitment, but from current policy, past practices, or other factors  that may create the expectation for future spending. Some exposures  present elements of both explicit and implicit exposures. Insurance  programs are a key example. If an event occurs, some payment is legally  required; this represents an explicit exposure.

However, in response to the financial  crisis, the government placed them into conservatorship and agreed to  provide temporary assistance, creating a new explicit exposure.", "The budget does reflect some or all of the cost of the government\u2019s legal  commitment for some exposures. For example, for crop insurance,  budget authority is provided to cover the cost of premium subsidies,  claims payments, and administrative expense subsidies. For military and  civilian pensions, agencies are required to make contributions out of  current budget authority to cover some of the costs of civilian and military  pension benefits earned by current employees. These contributions  reduce the funds available to each agency to fund other activities.  However, the recognition is incomplete because the contributions are not  set to cover the full cost. In addition, we found that the budget provides  incomplete information or potentially misleading signals about today\u2019s  legal commitments for some other exposures as well. Our selected fiscal  exposures generally demonstrate one or more of the following  characteristics:  The full cost of commitments incurred today is not recorded in the  budget until the corresponding outlays are made in the future.

For example, at the time budget  decisions were being made for fiscal year 2013, the budget showed a  positive budget estimate (i.e., net revenues) for PBGC of about $1.6  billion, suggesting that the program would help decrease the federal  budget deficit that year. However, the financial reports available at the  same time showed the program\u2019s net position worsened by about $8  billion from the year before, principally as the result of incurred losses that  are not yet reflected in the budget. These estimates provide significantly  different pictures of the program\u2019s health and its potential draw on future  budget resources. While PBGC can legally only pay claims up to the  amount of resources available in its revolving funds, in the face of major  pension fund failures there might be an expectation that the government  would pass legislation allowing PBGC to cover some or all of the gap.", "Dedicated resources are estimated to be insufficient to pay for the  associated commitment. Some programs set aside amounts out of  current budget authority to cover benefits earned today but payable in the  future. For example, agency contributions and Treasury payments to  cover military pension benefits accrued during the year are deposited in a  budgetary trust fund; however, the trust fund balance is significantly less  than expected future benefits payments, as measured by the accrued  liability (see appendix I, figure 9). As such, the trust fund\u2019s balance can  provide a signaling function of future spending but does not necessarily  represent the full cost of those legal commitments.", "Furthermore, some insurance programs do not have sufficient dedicated  resources to cover expected costs. For example, the NFIP historically  insured many properties at a subsidized rate. In addition, overall flood  insurance premiums were designed to permit the program to cover losses  and expenses in an \u201caverage historical loss year,\u201d but not to cover high- loss years. Instead, the program was given the authority to borrow from  the Treasury in such years, with the expectation that low-loss years would  allow the program to repay any borrowed funds. With the exception of  years involving catastrophes, annual losses and receipts have generally  evened out since 1978, but NFIP has been unable to repay the amounts  borrowed in response to catastrophic events, such as Hurricane Katrina  in 2005. This funding structure is one of the reasons the program was  added to our High Risk List in 2006.", "Increasing amounts of future spending may be required or expected  based both on recent trends and events\u2014and on the government\u2019s  response to those events. For example, weather-related events have  cost the nation tens of billions of dollars in damages over the past  decade.

Improved supplemental reporting in budget documents on fiscal  exposures would make information more accessible to policymakers  without introducing additional complexity and uncertainty directly into the  budget.

Instead, the  supplemental information would be used along with budget data to  identify important signals that could be used to monitor fiscal exposures.  For example, the Appendix Volume in the President\u2019s budget includes a  balance sheet for some federal insurance programs that shows the  program\u2019s net position (assets minus liabilities), providing valuable  information about the program\u2019s affect on future budget resources. For  the Federal Crop Insurance budget account, a supplemental table  includes the cost of the premium subsidy provided by the government. In  2003, we recommended that OMB create an annual report on fiscal  exposures providing a concise list and description of such exposures,  cost estimates (where possible), and an assessment of methodologies  and data used to produce cost estimates for such exposures.

While this time period is helpful for many programs, longer-term  projections would be helpful for those programs\u2014such as federal  employee pensions and retiree health\u2014where the time between the legal  commitment and payments can extend over several decades. Further,  significant changes in expected spending (or differences between actual  and estimated spending) should prompt analysis, including consideration  of the nature and source of the change.", "Identifying meaningful measures that would provide signals about the  changing nature or magnitude of the exposure might offer another means  to focus policymaker attention on fiscal exposures. For example, trust  fund balances can serve as a signaling function for decision makers  about underlying fiscal imbalances in covered programs. A gap between  the projected fund balance and expected spending can signal that the  fund, either by design or because of changes in circumstances, is  collecting insufficient monies to finance future payments. Also, the  repeated use of borrowing authority could be an indicator that the  magnitude of the exposure has changed. Specifically, NFIP was expected  to borrow in \u201cabove-average claim\u201d years and repay that borrowing in  \u201cbelow-average claim\u201d years. In years with extraordinarily high claims  resulting from catastrophes like Superstorm Sandy and Hurricane Katrina,  NFIP has used the borrowing authority repeatedly. The program currently  has an outstanding debt to the Treasury of $24 billion. The program\u2019s  inability to cover claims in excess of premiums led to the passage of  legislation in 2012 that altered the design of the program, including a key  provision that NFIP raise premium rates to reflect true flood risk and make  the program more financially stable.

The  annual growth of the accrued liability, which averaged about $97 billion  from fiscal years 2001 to 2012, reflects increases in the number of  veterans as a result of wars and other conflicts, the aging of the veteran  population, and changes in the benefits and services provided to  veterans. payable for a veteran who, at the time of death, is qualified to receive compensation or  pension, or whose death occurred in a VA facility.  42Burial benefits are also provided and include a burial and plot or internment allowance  43Prior to 2004, the law required that military retired pay be reduced dollar-for-dollar by the  amount of any VA disability compensation received (e.g. an offset).
