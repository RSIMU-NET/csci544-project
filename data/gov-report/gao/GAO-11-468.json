Typically, a recall is voluntarily initiated by the firm that manufactured the device. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), oversees implementation of the recall. FDA classifies recalls based on health risks of using the recalled device--class I recalls present the highest risk (including death), followed by class II and class III. FDA also determines whether a firm has effectively implemented a recall, and when a recall can be terminated. This report identifies (1) the numbers and characteristics of medical device recalls and FDA's use of this information to aid its oversight, and (2) the extent to which the process ensures the effective implementation and termination of the highest-risk recalls. GAO interviewed FDA officials and examined information on medical device recalls initiated and reported from 2005 through 2009, and reviewed FDA's documentation for a sample of 53 (40 percent) of class I recalls initiated during this period."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["From 2005 through 2009, firms initiated 3,510 medical device recalls, an average of just over 700 per year. FDA classified the vast majority--nearly 83 percent--as class II, meaning use of these recalled devices carried a moderate health risk, or that the probability of serious adverse health consequences was remote. Just over 40 percent of the recalls involved cardiovascular, radiological, or orthopedic devices. FDA has used recall data to monitor individual recalls and target firms for inspections. However, it has not routinely analyzed recall data to determine whether there are systemic problems underlying trends in device recalls. Thus, FDA is missing an opportunity to use recall data to proactively identify and address the risks presented by unsafe devices. Several gaps in the medical device recall process limited firms' and FDA's abilities to ensure that the highest-risk recalls were implemented in an effective and timely manner. For many high-risk recalls, firms faced challenges, such as locating specific devices or device users, and thus could not correct or remove all devices. FDA's procedures for overseeing recalls are unclear. As a result, FDA officials examining similar situations sometimes reached opposite conclusions on whether recalls were effective. FDA had also not established criteria, based on the nature or type of devices, for assessing whether firms corrected or removed a sufficient number of recalled devices. Additionally, FDA's decisions to terminate completed recalls--that is, assess whether firms had taken sufficient actions to prevent a recurrence of the problems that led to the recalls--were frequently not made within its prescribed time frames. Finally, FDA did not document its justification for terminating recalls. If unaddressed by FDA, the combined effect of these gaps may increase the risk that unsafe medical devices could remain on the market. To aid its oversight of the medical device recall process, FDA should routinely assess information on device recalls, develop enhanced procedures and criteria for assessing the effectiveness of recalls, and document the agency's basis for terminating individual recalls. HHS agreed with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each day, millions of individual medical devices produced by thousands of  manufacturing establishments in the United States and overseas are used  in hospitals, physicians\u2019 offices, and other health care settings to diagnose,  treat, or prevent illness. For example, in 2007 medical devices were  involved in 45 million inpatient procedures. Also, there were  approximately 117 million visits to hospital emergency departments,   89 million hospital outpatient visits, and 994 million visits to physicians\u2019  offices, which likely all involved the use of one or more medical devices.  Medical devices include those that present little risk\u2014such as tongue  depressors and elastic bandages\u2014and those that are used specifically to  sustain or support life\u2014such as pacemakers and artificial heart valves.  Medical devices are an integral part of patient care. If one proves to be  defective or unsafe once it is in widespread use, the ramifications can be  severe, potentially resulting in permanent injuries or deaths to patients or  providers using the device.", "A recall is an important remedial action that can mitigate the risk of  serious health consequences associated with a defective or unsafe medical  device. Generally, the firm that manufactured the device voluntarily  initiates a recall after it has discovered a problem based on its assessment  of complaints or reports of safety issues it has received. The Food and  Drug Administration (FDA), an agency within the Department of Health  and Human Services (HHS), is responsible for ensuring that medical  products sold in the United States are safe and effective. In some cases,  FDA identifies a problem with a device based on its own oversight, such as  an inspection of an establishment where a device is manufactured. In  response, the firm may voluntarily initiate a recall. Additionally, FDA has  the authority to require that the firm initiate a device recall when there is a  serious risk to public health and the firm has not done so.", "FDA\u2019s role in the voluntary recall process is generally to oversee a firm\u2019s  management of a recall, which includes monitoring the progress of the  recall. FDA has issued guidance to aid firms in conducting such recalls and  has also established internal procedures to govern its oversight of the  recall process. In addition, FDA assigns each recall a classification level\u2014 high, moderate, or low\u2014based on its assessment of the degree of risk that  is posed by the continued use of the device. An effective and timely recall  depends on actions taken by the firm manufacturing the device,  companies distributing the device, users of the device\u2014such as hospitals,  physicians, and patients\u2014and FDA. Recalling firms are responsible for  alerting FDA, their distributors, and users of the device about the recall.  The recalling firm provides instructions on steps to be taken to fix the  device or advises parties to discontinue its use. These parties must follow  the firm\u2019s instructions in order to effectively implement the recall.", "Despite efforts by recalling firms, FDA, and others, there have been  reported incidents where individuals were seriously injured or died due to  continued use of defective devices that had been recalled. You expressed  concern with the effectiveness of the medical device recall process and  asked us to follow up on our 1998 report on FDA\u2019s oversight of medical  device recalls. Our preliminary findings were included in an April 2011  hearing on the reform of the medical device approval process before the  Senate Special Committee on Aging. This report identifies (1) the  numbers and characteristics of medical device recalls initiated from  January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, and the extent to which FDA  uses this information to aid in its oversight of recalls, and (2) the extent to  which the medical device recall process ensures the effective  implementation and termination of those classified as high-risk recalls.", "To identify the numbers and characteristics of voluntary medical device  recalls, we obtained information on all such recalls initiated and reported  to FDA from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009. This  information consisted of the most recent 5-year period of available data at  the time we did our work. The source of this information was FDA\u2019s Recall  Enterprise System (RES), the agency\u2019s central repository of recall  information. FDA provided key information on each recall, including  FDA\u2019s unique recall event number; the status of the recall at the time FDA  provided us with this information (e.g., ongoing or terminated); the  reason for the recall; the specific device being recalled; the recall  classification level assigned based on FDA\u2019s assessment of risk; dates the  recalls were initiated, classified, and terminated; and the medical  specialty\u2014area of use\u2014for each device subject to recall (e.g.,  cardiovascular or orthopedic). We also obtained information identifying  which of FDA\u2019s 19 district offices located throughout the United States  were responsible for the day-to-day monitoring of the recalls. We then  used this information to determine, among other things, the number of  recalls initiated per year; the number of recalls by recall classification  levels, the average length of time from initiation to termination for recalls  that were terminated, and the number and percentage of recalls by  medical specialty of the device being recalled.", "To assess the reliability of the information FDA provided, we reviewed  FDA\u2019s user guide for RES and interviewed officials responsible for  entering and reviewing the information in RES. Additionally, for a sample  of recalls, we compared information from RES on the status and key dates  to the source documents contained in FDA\u2019s recall files. We determined  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of our review. However,  there are some limitations to our analyses. The data FDA provided may  not include all recalls that firms actually initiated over this period. This is  because FDA is dependent on firms self-reporting most recalls. In addition,  FDA did not consistently enter certain data elements into RES over the   5-year period. For example, in certain cases the dates recalls were  terminated were missing, and in many cases the root cause, or problem  creating the need for the recall, was entered inconsistently. Therefore, we  could not conduct certain analyses for all recalls initiated over the study  period.", "In addition to identifying information about the numbers and  characteristics of recalls, we identified the extent to which FDA uses  recall information to aid its oversight of recalls. To accomplish this, we  interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA), which  develops FDA-wide policy on compliance and enforcement matters and  also has primary responsibility for RES, the day-to-day monitoring of  individual recalls, and conducting inspections of firms. We also  interviewed officials from FDA\u2019s Center for Devices and Radiological  Health (CDRH), which regulates medical devices marketed in the United  States and is responsible for classifying recalls and assessing the adequacy  of a firm\u2019s actions to correct problems leading to the most serious recalls.  In addition, we interviewed representatives from two device manufacturer  associations and several device manufacturers to obtain their views about  the recall process.", "To identify the extent to which the medical device recall process ensures  the effective implementation and termination of the highest-risk device  recalls, we reviewed key documentation related to the recalling firms\u2019  management and FDA\u2019s oversight of a sample of the highest-risk recalls.  We identified 131 recalls initiated over the 5-year period to which FDA  assigned its highest-risk classification\u2014recalls for which FDA determined  that there was a reasonable probability that the use of or exposure to the  devices would cause serious adverse health consequence or death. Of  these 131, we selected a sample of 53 recalls for in-depth review by  identifying the four FDA district offices that had the largest number of  available recall files to review. These 53 recalls represented all such recalls  during the 5-year period that were managed by these four offices and for  which there were files available for our review. For these 53 recalls, we  obtained from FDA and reviewed the recall case files that were maintained  by district offices. These files contained key documents such as  information from the firms on the causes of the recalls, the firms\u2019 actions  to prevent recurrence of similar problems, the recall notifications firms  sent out to customers, FDA\u2019s correspondence with firms, and  documentation from RES. As part of our review, we identified actions  recalling firms took to adhere to FDA\u2019s guidance and regulatory  requirements, and the extent to which the firms were able to recall all of  the affected devices. We also identified whether FDA followed its own  procedures for overseeing and terminating the recalls and whether FDA\u2019s  recall process was in conformance with internal control standards for the  federal government. For example, we reviewed the case files to determine  whether or not FDA conducted recall audit checks in which FDA would  contact a percentage of parties affected by the recall to determine whether  they received the recall notice and followed the firms\u2019 instructions for  removing or correcting the device. This included a review of over 2,000  audits check forms FDA completed for the 53 recalls we reviewed.  Between December 2010 and February 2011 we discussed the recalls with  officials from the responsible FDA district office, and determined the  current status of the recalls.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2010 to June 2011, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The recall process generally consists of a  series of steps that we have categorized into broad phases\u2014initiating and  classifying the recall, conducting and overseeing the recall, and  completing and terminating the recall. While the recalling firm has primary  responsibility for ensuring that the recalled devices are corrected or  removed, FDA and other stakeholders each have responsibilities which  they are supposed to undertake in order to effectively implement the  various phases of a recall.

As part of this phase, a firm develops a strategy for implementing the  recall, and FDA reviews and suggests changes to the strategy. In most  cases, a firm arrives at the decision to initiate a recall after discovering a  problem with a device, or a series of similar devices. The firm may then  contact an FDA district office or immediately begin implementing a  recall. A firm may initiate a recall\u2014that is notify stakeholders such as  distributors and device users about the recall\u2014prior to contacting the  FDA district office. However, according to federal regulations, a firm must  provide FDA with a report of correction or removal within 10 working  days of initiating a recall of a product that involves or may involve a risk to  health. As part of its report, the firm is to provide FDA with key  information such as the reason the device is being recalled, the brand  name and model of the device, the lot or serial numbers of the device, the  number of devices subject to correction or removal, and contact  information for its customers and device users who received, used, or  purchased the device. According to FDA\u2019s guidance, the recalling firm is  also asked to develop a recall strategy that takes into account its  assessment of the health hazard associated with the device. The strategy  should contain details on the firm\u2019s plan for ensuring that its customers  and device users correct or remove the device according to the firm\u2019s  instructions, and the need for public warnings about the device.

The district office monitoring the  recall will provide any information it receives from the firm, including the  correction and removal report, to CDRH so it can begin the process of  classifying the recall. For some recalls, the district office may need to  conduct a recall inspection at the establishment where the device is  manufactured in order to obtain additional information needed to classify  the recall. According to FDA\u2019s procedures, when a recall appears to  involve significant health risks, an inspection should be conducted to  determine, among other things, the root causes of the problem and if the  firm is implementing appropriate corrective action. The inspection may be  performed by the FDA district office monitoring the recall or other district  offices, such as those located near the firm\u2019s manufacturing establishment.", "To classify the recall, CDRH is to conduct its own health risk assessment  of the device being recalled. Based on this assessment, CDRH classifies  the recall to indicate the relative degree of health hazard presented by use  of the device. According to CDRH\u2019s procedures, the classification decision  should be completed within 31 calendar days from the time it received the  information from the district office. Recalls are classified into one of  three categories:    class I\u2014reasonable probability that the use of, or exposure to, a device  will cause serious adverse health consequences or death. These are the  most serious recalls.   class II\u2014use of or exposure to a device may cause temporary or medically  reversible adverse health consequences, or the probability of serious  adverse health consequences is remote.    class III\u2014use of, or exposure to, a device is not likely to cause adverse  health consequences.", "Table 1 compares FDA\u2019s classification of medical devices and recalls  according to risk.

The FDA district office bases its assessment of whether the recall has been  effectively completed by reviewing the firm\u2019s status reports and results of  the audit checks. In addition, according to FDA procedures, the final  monitoring step the district office may take is to conduct a limited  postrecall inspection to verify that the recall has been completed.

On average, FDA  took 192 days to terminate a recall after it determined a recall was  completed, more than twice the time specified in its procedures. For class  I recalls, the average was 250 days. FDA could not specifically identify  reasons that explained why it took this amount of time to make  termination decisions. The agency did indicate that termination time  frames are affected by both FDA\u2019s ability to address recalling firms\u2019  termination requests, as well as firms\u2019 ability to provide adequate  information in support of the termination decision.

For example,  officials indicated that if they send out a recall notice that they believe will  be a class II, and after a significant amount of time FDA informs them it is  a class I recall, the firm will have to revise the notice to indicate that the  risks posed by the recall were more severe than they initially anticipated.  The firm will also have to identify additional customers and device users  to contact, in order to meet FDA\u2019s recommendation that they conduct   100 percent effectiveness checks for class I recalls.

Some recalls involved  hundreds of thousands of disposable products, while others involved a  small number of life-sustaining implantable devices.

Our analysis of 2,196 audit check forms associated with these recalls  found that audit checks completed for nearly 90 percent of the recalls  contained a variety of inconsistencies in how the audit checks were  implemented and documented. For each of these recalls we found  inconsistencies in how different investigators determined whether a recall  was effective or ineffective when conducting their audit checks of recalls.  We also identified inconsistencies in the level of detail provided in the  audit check report, and the level of effort undertaken by different  investigators. Specifically, we found the following.", "Some investigators\u2019 audit checks concluded that recalls were effective,  despite noting problems (such as device users not following the firm\u2019s  instructions), while other investigators concluded that similar instances  were ineffective. For example, in 2008 a firm initiated a recall of an  implantable pump because of problems in the connection between a  catheter and the pump, which could result in improper amounts of  medication being delivered to a patient. The firm\u2019s recall notification  alerted physicians to this problem, and provided instructions for  monitoring patients who already had the implanted pump and for revising  future implant procedures. As part of the audit check program for this  recall, FDA\u2019s investigators contacted a sample of physicians to determine  whether they received the notification and followed the instructions. Our  review found that out of 68 audit checks, there were 14 instances where  the investigators noted that physicians either did not receive the recall  notification, or did not remember receiving it, and thus could not have  followed the recall notice instructions. In 8 of these 14 instances,  investigators concluded that the recall was ineffective, noting that the  physicians did not implement the recall instructions. In contrast, in the  other 6 instances they concluded the recall was effective, even though  physicians could not have followed the recall instructions. In some cases  this was because the firm provided evidence that they had notified the  physician, and in others the investigator noted that the physician did not  have any pumps on hand.", "Some investigators determined that device users were not notified of the  recall by the recalling firm, but instead learned of the recall through other  means. In some of these instances, investigators\u2019 audit checks concluded  that recalls were effective, while in other similar cases investigators  concluded the checks were ineffective.", "Some investigators wrote detailed comments on the audit check form as to  why the investigator determined the recall was effective or ineffective,  while others did not. Without comments, it may be difficult for FDA  supervisors and district recall coordinators to verify whether an  investigator correctly determined whether the recall was effective or  ineffective.", "Some investigators noted actions they took when they discovered  problems with recalls, such as providing the device users with a copy of  the recall notice or instructing them on actions to take in order to  implement a recall. In contrast, other investigators did not indicate  whether they made any attempt to help facilitate the recall. For example,  in 2009 a firm initiated a recall of an automated external defibrillator  because of reports that some of these devices failed to discharge sufficient  energy due to problems with batteries. The firm issued a notice that  instructed users to replace batteries and update software for the devices.  As part of the audit checks for this recall, FDA investigators contacted a  sample of users of the device, to check whether they received the recall  notification and followed the firm\u2019s recall instructions. Our review found  that out of 67 audit checks, there were 35 instances where investigators  noted problems with the recall\u2014generally that the user did not receive the  notice or failed to follow recall instructions. In 29 of these cases, the FDA  investigator noted taking actions, including providing the recall notice or  instructing the user to contact the recalling firm so they could obtain  software needed to perform the needed actions. However, in 6 cases we  found no indication that the FDA investigator took actions to ensure the  recall was carried out effectively.", "FDA officials at both ORA and the district offices we contacted  acknowledged that there are no detailed instructions or requirements for  conducting audit checks, and that there can be inconsistencies in the  process. Officials told us that when determining whether or not a check is  effective, investigators should be assessing whether the recalling firm  provided the notice and instructions to the customers or device users, and  whether the customers or users followed instructions. They  acknowledged, however, that some investigators may approach these  checks differently, and that this may be an area where clarification of the  agency\u2019s procedures is needed. During our interviews with officials from  the Detroit, Los Angeles, Minneapolis, and New England district offices,  some officials said that audit checks are typically conducted by new  investigators, and that investigators receive classroom and on-the-job  training on how to conduct such checks. Some district officials also noted  that audit checks are reviewed by a supervisor as well as the recall  coordinator in the district office that is monitoring the recall, and this  serves as a quality control function to ensure consistency. Also, officials  from FDA headquarters and some district offices stated that they have  attempted to institute measures to improve the audit check process.  Specifically, they noted that they recently updated the audit check form to  more precisely reflect what makes a recall ineffective. Also, ORA officials  indicated that they plan to automate the audit check forms, which will  make the forms accessible to officials in FDA\u2019s headquarters. FDA officials  said that they are considering applications for analyzing the automated  data, but have not completed any specific plans.", "In addition to the inconsistencies, we found other gaps in FDA\u2019s oversight  related to the audit checks. First, FDA\u2019s audit checks were often narrow in  scope, in that FDA instructs investigators to contact only a small number  of customers or device users\u2014between 2 percent and 10 percent of those  affected by the recall. Therefore, if there are thousands of customers or  device users, the audit checks provide FDA with a means to contact a  relatively small number of them. For the 45 recalls for which FDA  completed checks, we found the number of audit checks conducted varied  widely, from 2 to 271, with an average of 51 audit checks per recall.  Second, FDA investigators did not always conduct the assigned number of  audit checks. We compared the number of audit checks that should have  been conducted based on the audit check assignments to the numbers of  checks actually completed. We found that for 17 of the 45 recalls   (38 percent) fewer than the assigned number were conducted. Third, even  though most checks were done in person, consistent with FDA\u2019s  procedures, over 22 percent of the checks were done by telephone. In  these cases, the audit check relied extensively on anecdotal information  provided by the customer or device user. According to FDA, the number of  checks it can perform is limited by available resources. Based on our  review of files, we found that if patients or consumers are involved (e.g., if  FDA needed to contact someone with an implantable device), these were  often done by telephone. We also found checks that were done by  telephone for other device users including hospitals, retailers, and doctors\u2019  offices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Gaps in FDA\u2019s Completion and Termination Process Increase the Risk That Unsafe Medical Devices May Continue to Be Used", "paragraphs": ["We found FDA lacks specific criteria for making decisions about whether  recalling firms have adequately completed their recalls\u2014a key oversight  activity of the recall process.

For example, FDA does not have a  benchmark recovery rate or threshold to assess whether firms effectively  completed recalls, although the recovery rates of devices could be  expected to vary, depending on whether a recalled device was a large  piece of hospital equipment or a disposable device, such as a syringe.", "Representatives from medical device firms stated that there are no criteria  or guidance from FDA on the percentage of recalled products that must be  corrected or removed. Further, these firm representatives said that FDA is  generally satisfied with three attempts at communicating with customers  and device users affected by the recall.", "In addition, for a majority of the class I recalls we reviewed, FDA\u2019s actions  to ensure that recalls were complete were inconsistent with its procedures  for overseeing recalls. According to FDA\u2019s procedures, districts should  conduct a limited postrecall inspection to verify that the recall is complete,  and to witness destruction of defective products, if applicable. In 21 of the  40 completed and terminated recalls (53 percent) we found no  documented evidence that FDA took actions besides audit checks to verify  that the recall was complete. In the other 48 percent of recalls, FDA made  an assessment via inspection, witnessing destruction of devices, or  verifying that software corrections were completed.", "Another gap we found in the recall process is that FDA does not maintain  sufficient documentation to justify its termination decisions. Although  FDA may request that firms submit corrective and preventative action  plans for review and approval before a recall can be terminated, we found  little documentation on how FDA assessed whether such plans were  sufficient when it terminated recalls. When we asked to review  documentation justifying the decisions for the terminated recalls in our  sample, FDA officials indicated that they do not maintain extensive  documentation justifying the basis for their termination decisions. They  told us that creating documentation to support concurrence with the  termination recommendation is not part of past or current termination  procedures. This approach is inconsistent with internal control standards  for the federal government, which indicate \u201cthat all transactions and other  significant events need to be clearly documented\u201d and stress the  importance of \u201cthe creation and maintenance of related records which  provide evidence of execution of these activities as well as appropriate  documentation.\u201d Without such documentation, we were unable to assess  the extent to which FDA\u2019s termination process appropriately evaluated  recalling firms\u2019 corrective actions.", "Also, we found that FDA termination decisions were frequently not made  in a timely manner\u2014within 3 months of the completion of the recall\u2014 increasing the risk that unsafe or defective devices remained available for  use. Of the 53 files in our sample, 30 were terminated\u2014meaning FDA  headquarters determined that firms developed sufficient corrective actions  to prevent a recurrence of problems which led to the recalls. For   73 percent of the terminated recalls, FDA did not make its termination  decision within 3 months of the recall\u2019s completion, as indicated by FDA  procedures. Overall, termination decisions took between 10 and 800  business days from completion to termination, with an average of   187 business days. Failure to make termination decisions in a timely  manner increases the risk that patients and healthcare providers may  continue to use unsafe or defective devices. For example, one firm  requested termination from FDA for its recall of a portable external  defibrillator in February 2006. However, FDA did not begin its termination  assessment until May 2010. In this case, officials indicated that, due to  staff turnover in the district office, they were unaware that this recall was  still ongoing until a new recall coordinator searched for ongoing recalls. In  2010, following an FDA inquiry, the firm stated that it had not received  confirmation of a required upgrade from 91 end users and an additional   13 devices could not be located. Because FDA did not follow up on this  recall until 2010, 4 years had elapsed before the agency became aware that  the recalling firm had not corrected or removed a substantial number of  devices subject to the recall. According to FDA officials, their ability to  terminate recalls in a timely manner is affected by resources, and  termination decisions are a lower priority than other issues because the  recalling firm has completed its actions.", "We found at least one instance where FDA\u2019s failure to make a timely  termination assessment allowed for a potentially unsafe product to be  reintroduced into the market and used for surgical procedures. In this  case, based on adverse event reports that screws in its spinal fixation  system were becoming loose postoperatively, the firm decided to recall  the device in December 2005. The firm implemented its recall and removed  all devices. The firm indicated that it developed a corrective action for the  screw problem, and relaunched the device in April 2006. It then requested  termination from FDA in May 2006. FDA followed up on this request by  leaving three voice mail messages with the firm, and received no response.  The agency sent out a request for information a year later, in May 2007. In  June 2007, the company again indicated that the recall was complete, and  requested termination. In September 2007, FDA conducted an inspection  of the company\u2019s manufacturing facility, and found that while the recall  was complete, the corrective action was not adequate. Over the course of  the next 2 years, the firm worked with FDA to get revisions to the device  approved, but eventually agreed to a second recall for the revised device.  This recall was initiated in May 2009. We identified five reports of adverse  events related to continuing problems with the implanted device that were  filed with FDA subsequent to the firm\u2019s relaunch of the device in April  2006. These reports were filed from December 2006 through March 2007,  and revealed that in all cases, patients required surgical intervention to  correct or remove the device."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The medical device recall process is complex, requiring the coordination  and timely action of potentially thousands of parties. It is an important  tool used by firms and FDA to protect the public and mitigate health risks  from unsafe or ineffective devices. While the recall process may not  eliminate 100 percent of health risks associated with recalled devices,  careful implementation and evaluation are critical to minimizing health  risks.", "FDA has a key role in identifying and minimizing the public health risks  presented by defective or unsafe devices. In this regard, FDA has  opportunities to close some of the gaps that currently exist in the medical  device recall process, and enhance its oversight of device recalls. As  currently structured, FDA\u2019s approach to oversight of medical device  recalls is reactive\u2014responding to individual recalls as they occur. Rather  than pursuing a strictly case-by-case approach to overseeing recalls, FDA  could take a more proactive approach to its oversight. The agency has a  plethora of data available on thousands of recalls, but at present, is not  effectively reviewing and analyzing these data in a systematic manner.  More routine analyses of these data could help FDA identify trends in the  numbers and types of devices being recalled, as well as the underlying  causes of device recalls. Such information would provide FDA with a  better understanding of the risks presented by defective or unsafe devices,  which could lead the agency to proactively identify strategies and  measures needed to address systemic problems with the design or  manufacture of individual devices or entire categories of devices. Armed  with the results of these types of analyses, FDA could then be in a position  to help mitigate safety risks before they occur, and thus minimize the need  for recalls. This is particularly important for the devices involved in the  highest-risk recalls, which place the public at risk of serious health  consequences, including death.", "Furthermore, while the agency has devoted substantial resources to  monitoring individual recalls, opportunities for enhancing its oversight of  specific recalls also exist. A key FDA mechanism for overseeing individual  recalls\u2014audit checks of a small portion of customers and device users  involved in the recall\u2014are often implemented inconsistently. This is due  to unclear procedures that investigators are using for implementing and  documenting audit checks and making their final assessments. As a result,  investigators can make inconsistent determinations about whether firms,  customers, and device users have effectively conducted a recall.  Additionally, FDA lacks clear criteria for determining whether firms have  successfully completed recalls, and has failed to maintain important  documentation justifying its decisions to terminate the highest-risk recalls.

To  implement an effective recall, stakeholders need mechanisms to ensure  timely and open communication about the recalls, and a means of locating  devices subject to recall. This appendix describes the recall notification  and tracking systems available to help manage device recalls. It also  provides information on the status of the Food and Drug Administration\u2019s  (FDA) unique device identification (UDI) initiative\u2014which is intended to  enable the identification of a device throughout distribution and use.", "To obtain this information, we interviewed officials from FDA and key  stakeholders, including representatives of firms providing subscription- based recall alert information, manufacturers, distributors, group  purchasing organizations, hospital systems, and patient safety groups.  Through these interviews we obtained information on what these  stakeholders considered to be the key challenges they face in  implementing device recalls. We also obtained information about  mechanisms which, in particular, hospital systems use to help identify  devices subject to recall. Further, we reviewed FDA\u2019s progress in  implementing its UDI initiative. To accomplish this, we examined  published studies on this initiative, reviewed stakeholder comments  submitted for FDA\u2019s public meetings on the UDI, and interviewed FDA  officials responsible for managing the UDI program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Many Stakeholders Use Electronic Recall Notification and Tracking Systems to Help Manage Device Recalls", "paragraphs": ["We learned through stakeholder interviews that instead of relying solely  on notifications from medical device manufacturers, health care providers  and other stakeholders have come to rely on other sources of information  to stay abreast of potential recalls. Furthermore, these electronic  communication technologies are evolving and, over time, stakeholders  have begun recognizing that they can play a role in helping to effectively  implement recalls.", "Our interviews with stakeholders revealed that a number of different  privately developed, subscription-based electronic notification and  tracking systems are available to help identify and process recalls.  Stakeholders indicated that these systems are primarily used by hospitals,  but that the systems are available to others involved in recalls as well.  Available services identify recalls from a number of sources, including  device manufacturers and FDA\u2019s Web site. The services compile lists of  recalls and send electronic messages about recalls to paid subscribers.  These services vary in sophistication and price. One service we learned  about was limited to periodic electronic notification of all recalls at a cost  of about $500 per year. Others include software to help individual  hospitals specifically delegate responsibility within their hospital system  to specific officials who will manage certain aspects of the recalls\u2014such  as removing recalled products from inventory\u2014and for tracking the  progress of the recalls. These systems can cost several thousand dollars  per year. Owners of these systems that we spoke to indicated that  hundreds of hospitals subscribe to their systems (see table 5).", "Stakeholders we interviewed identified several operational benefits of  using recall notification systems. First, they indicated these systems allow  for an increased ability to identify the universe of recalls rather than  simply relying on receiving notices from recalling firms. Second,  stakeholders indicated that quality assurance measures used by the  systems help ensure that the recall notifications contain sufficiently  detailed and accurate information. They indicated that personnel working  for such systems will review the recall notifications they compile prior to  sending them to the subscribers. If needed, those providing the recall alert  services will contact the recalling firm and update the notice for the  subscribers if information is unclear or missing. Third, stakeholders  indicated that such systems can help ensure that recall notifications are  routed to specific personnel within an institution responsible for managing  the recall, reducing the likelihood that implementing the recall is delayed  or overlooked. Officials from some hospitals we spoke with indicated that  manufacturers will frequently notify the department in a hospital that  received the product, which may not be the best point of contact for  ensuring recalled devices are corrected or removed. However, one  hospital system indicated that by using the more sophisticated alert  systems, they are able to automatically forward recall alerts to key  personnel specifically identified by the hospital. This ensures that only the  appropriate departments at the hospital are alerted. Finally, stakeholders  stated that these systems allow hospitals to identify and process recalls  sooner."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Status of UDI Initiative", "paragraphs": ["The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 (FDAAA)  required FDA to develop a UDI system\u2014a major initiative to better track  and identify devices.

FDA is currently working on a proposed rule and intends to publish it and  seek public comments in spring 2011, and issue a final rule 12 to 18  months later. According to FDA\u2019s senior advisor for the UDI, the proposed  rule will include several key decisions that FDA, based on its prior studies,  has reached regarding the UDI.

Manufacturers will  send key information about their devices to FDA, which will maintain a  database containing a device identifier for all devices distributed in the  United States.", "Flexibility to allow manufacturers to decide how to label their devices  using automatic identification and data capture. This could mean using a  linear or two-dimensional bar code, or radio frequency identification.", "In addition, FDA indicated that there are other issues for which they have  not yet made final decisions, and they are still assessing these before they  issue a proposed rule. These include the following.", "The labeling requirements for different devices, for example, riskier  devices may be labeled with a unique identifier individually, while  disposable, low-risk devices may be labeled based on how they are  packaged (e.g., bandages will have their UDI identifier on their box).", "If the UDI should have a phased implementation schedule for  administering the identifiers, for example, class III devices\u2014the most  risky devices, including some that are implantable\u2014may use the UDI  within 1 year of publishing the final rule, while class II and class I devices  might follow meeting the UDI requirement within 3 and 5 years,  respectively.", "Figure 9 presents a timeline of key activities since FDA began  assessing the UDI and its planned implementation schedule.", "An FDA official said that the agency expects that the UDI will provide  benefits beyond increased precision in identifying recalled devices, and  that some benefits of the UDI will be realized immediately after its  implementation. According to the UDI senior advisor, these benefits  include improved tracking of adverse events associated with medical  devices and prevention of device counterfeiting. He also stated that many  manufacturers already use identifiers on their devices and should have  little problem adapting to the new UDI system.", "Despite the potential benefits of the UDI, some stakeholders expressed  concern that the success of UDIs depends on hospitals\u2019 ability to utilize  these identifiers, and that it may be years before the benefits to the recall  process are realized. Manufacturers we contacted stated that many  hospitals do not use the lot and serial numbers currently provided by  manufacturers to track devices, and FDA does not have authority to  require providers to use the UDI. This concern was also reflected in  comments from officials at several hospitals that we contacted. Some  indicated that they do not have inventory systems in place that enable  them to track devices throughout their hospitals. Therefore, they must  manually search their inventory, sometimes at multiple locations. Locating  a recalled device can be particularly difficult because a device may contain  multiple identification numbers assigned by manufacturers and  distributors for their own tracking purposes. Without upgrades to these  hospitals\u2019 systems, officials acknowledged that the UDI will be less  effective in enhancing patient safety. FDA\u2019s UDI senior advisor stated that  larger hospitals might be more eager to adopt the technology necessary to  track devices using the UDI once it is implemented, but acknowledged that  benefits for the recall process are greatly dependent on hospitals\u2019  implementation of the UDI, which could take up to 10 years for many  hospitals, especially smaller ones."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Class I Medical Device Recalls from Our Sample for Which Firms Were Unable to Correct or Remove All Devices", "paragraphs": ["In some instances recalling firms are not able to correct or remove all of  the devices subject to a recall.
