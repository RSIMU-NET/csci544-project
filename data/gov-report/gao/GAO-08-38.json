Effective service can reduce taxpayers' burden of complying with tax laws and, many tax experts believe, may improve compliance.

GAO analyzed IRS performance data, reviewed IRS operations at various locations, and interviewed IRS and paid preparer representatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["IRS improved most filing season services during 2007, continuing a longer-term trend. Tax return processing exceeded last year's performance by most measures. Electronic filing grew at a faster rate than IRS anticipated and continued to generate savings. Access to IRS telephone assistors was comparable to last year, and the accuracy of responses to questions remained at about 90 percent. The performance of IRS's Web site improved in several measures, such as customer satisfaction. Continuing past trends, more taxpayers used volunteer sites, which are less costly than IRS's walk-in sites. Despite these improvements, IRS could reduce the number of paper tax returns processed and also transcribe all lines from the residual paper returns, making that data more available for enforcement. Two options for reducing paper processing are electronic filing mandates, previously suggested by GAO, and bar coding, which could be required for paper returns prepared on computers and reduces processing costs. Currently, because of the cost, IRS does not transcribe all lines from paper returns. Further, IRS policy is to post the same lines from electronic and paper returns to its enforcement databases. As a result, IRS does not use all tax return information in its automated compliance checking programs. However, IRS does not know the actions needed to require software vendors to include bar codes on printed tax returns; the benefits, in terms of processing savings and improved enforcement, of having all return data available electronically; or how much electronic filing would have to increase, either through mandates or bar coding, for the benefits of transcribing all residual paper returns to exceed the costs. Despite more reliance on its volunteer program, IRS has not evaluated its effectiveness at reaching underserved taxpayers. Further, IRS may be missing an opportunity to assess the quality of return preparation assistance at its walk-in sites through contact recording, a system IRS uses to record and assess the quality of other interactions between its employees and taxpayers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The quality of the Internal Revenue Service\u2019s (IRS) filing season service is  important for several reasons. Effective service can reduce the burden for  taxpayers, in terms of time and money, of complying with tax laws.  Further, many tax experts believe that quality service has a positive effect  on compliance, although it is difficult to demonstrate empirically.", "Taxpayer service also matters because IRS allocated over 30 percent of its  $11 billion budget to provide such service for fiscal year 2007. IRS spends  most of this during the filing season when most taxpayers interact with the  agency. Filing season service includes individual income tax return  processing as well as telephone, Web site, and face-to-face assistance. In  past reports and testimonies we said that IRS has made significant  progress improving taxpayer service since the passage of the IRS  Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (RRA 98). In an effort to continue  improving service, IRS recently released, as mandated by the Congress, its  Taxpayer Assistance Blueprint (TAB). TAB is intended to outline a 5-year  comprehensive strategy for improving taxpayer service while minimizing  cost and determining the link between service and compliance.", "In addition to IRS, paid tax return preparers are another important  provider of service to taxpayers during the filing season, preparing over  half of individual income tax returns.

Electronic  filing is faster, which allows taxpayers to receive refunds faster, and is less  error prone\u2014IRS does not have to transcribe electronic tax return  information and built-in checks eliminate many errors that IRS has to  address when processing paper tax returns, such as correcting  computational mistakes and SSNs. In addition, taxpayers below an income  ceiling can access the Free File program offered through IRS\u2019s Web site by  a consortium of 19 tax preparation companies that offer free online tax  preparation and filing services.", "IRS\u2019s Business Systems Modernization (BSM) program, which began eight  years ago, is a high-risk, highly complex effort critical to supporting IRS\u2019s  taxpayer service goals, such as increasing electronic filing and providing  more accurate and timely responses to taxpayer inquiries. To date, IRS has  deployed releases of modernized systems that have delivered  substantial benefits to taxpayers and the agency, including e-Services (a  new Web portal and services for paid preparers) and parts of CADE, which  is the new taxpayer information database that facilitates faster refund  processing and provides IRS with more up-to-date account information.  CADE is intended to eventually replace IRS\u2019s antiquated Individual Master  File legacy processing system, which is the agency\u2019s repository of taxpayer  account information, and therefore, is the BSM program\u2019s cornerstone and  highest priority project.", "IRS also provides a variety of taxpayer services, including tax law  assistance, account resolution, limited return preparation, tax forms and  publications distribution, outreach, and education, mainly through its  telephone operations, Web site, and face-to-face assistance sites.  Taxpayers can call IRS\u2019s toll-free assistance telephone lines with questions  about tax law or their refunds. Depending on how taxpayers respond to  menu choices, questions are answered by an automated message or calls  are routed to telephone assistors located at 24 call sites around the  country. Calls are routed to the next available assistor assigned to answer  specific questions, e.g., tax law, account, or refund questions.", "IRS provides many services through its Web site, including \u201cWhere\u2019s My  Refund,\u201d which enables taxpayers to use the Web site to determine  whether the agency received their tax returns and processed their refunds.  Taxpayers can also download forms, instructions, and publications,  research their own tax law issues through Frequently Asked Questions or  Tax Topics, and receive help with specific tax law questions and  procedural questions via e-mail.", "IRS\u2019s volunteer program has become an increasingly important part of  IRS\u2019s face-to-face assistance. It expanded to 66 national partners that  include financial, social service, corporate, educational, and government  organizations and helps IRS serve traditionally underserved taxpayer  segments, including the elderly, low-income, disabled taxpayers, taxpayers  with limited-English proficiency, Native Americans, and rural taxpayers.  Additionally, IRS has 401 walk-in sites where taxpayers can ask basic tax  law questions, get account information, receive assistance with their  accounts, and have returns prepared if their annual income is $39,000 or  less.", "In April 2007, IRS released its final TAB report, a 5-year plan designed to  assist the agency in providing, evaluating, and improving taxpayer services  at lower costs. As part of its research into the costs of taxpayer services,  IRS developed estimates of the cost-per-service contact for providing  different types of taxpayer services and conducted preliminary research  about the effect of taxpayer service on compliance. We have reported  that IRS lacks quantitative estimates of the impact of taxpayer service and  its enforcement efforts on voluntary compliance; TAB should help IRS  obtain better estimates. We also have long supported IRS\u2019s research  efforts to measure the tax gap, which is the difference between what is  paid voluntarily and on time and what is owed, and help reduce it.", "As we previously reported, despite the 2007 filing season being  characterized as high-risk, in large part because of the Telephone Excise  Tax Refund (TETR), the impact of TETR on taxpayer services has been  much less than IRS anticipated.", "In addition to IRS, paid preparers are a critical part of the nation\u2019s tax  administration system because of the wide variety of services they offer  and their unique relationship with taxpayers. Paid preparers may combine  several taxpayer services, including help understanding tax obligations,  answering tax law questions, and providing tax forms and publications,  return preparation, and electronic filing.

The number of returns filed electronically increased 9  percent over last year, which is greater than last year\u2019s increase and more  than IRS projected. One factor contributing to the growth in electronic  filing is mandates. Thirteen states now mandate electronic filing of state  returns, which has increased electronic filing of both state and federal tax  returns. Despite the overall increase in electronic filing, taxpayer\u2019s use of  the Free File program continued to decline. For example, as of June 21,  IRS processed about 3.8 million returns filed through the Free File  program, 2 percent less than last year. IRS officials attributed this decline  in part to companies offering free electronic online filing separate from the  Free File program.", "Growth in electronic filing generates savings for IRS by reducing staff  needed for labor-intensive paper processing. In 2006, IRS used almost  1,700 (36 percent) fewer staff for processing tax returns than in 1999. IRS  estimates that this saved the agency $78 million in salary, benefits, and  overtime in 2006. In addition, IRS has achieved ancillary space cost  savings from the closing of submission processing centers. IRS estimated  the cost savings as a result of closing the Brookhaven and Memphis paper  processing centers to be $24.9 million in 2007.

According to IRS officials, direct deposit refunds are  issued by CADE 1 to 5 business days faster than the current legacy system,  and paper check refunds are issued 4 to 8 business days faster. Because of  the delays in CADE millions of taxpayer refunds were not issued as fast as  IRS planned.", "Even with the latest version of CADE deployed, last year IRS estimated  that over $500 million more would be required to fully implement the  individual income tax processing part of the system. Moreover, the CADE  setback adversely affected IRS\u2019s ability to deliver the functionality planned  for the next release, such as processing the earned income tax credit  schedule, and has caused IRS to reconsider the functionality of other  future CADE releases. IRS expects future releases of CADE to be linked  with its Account Management System (AMS) releases, requiring increased  attention to issues of synchronization and coordination between the two  systems. According to IRS officials, CADE and AMS working together will  enable IRS to process tax returns and address many taxpayer issues, such  as address changes, in a near real-time manner, which benefits both IRS  and taxpayers.", "Further complicating matters, IRS has additional plans for CADE, such as  processing tax returns claiming the earned income tax credit, during the  2008 filing season.

Furthermore, if all v-coders could be  converted to electronic filing, the number of paper returns remaining and  needing to be transcribed would be greatly reduced.", "Paper returns also limit the effectiveness of IRS\u2019s enforcement programs.  To control costs, IRS does not transcribe all the lines on paper tax returns  into its computer databases, such as taxpayers\u2019 telephone numbers,  limiting the amount of information available electronically for  enforcement purposes. As we previously reported, even small changes in  the amount of information IRS transcribes can consume substantial  resources that might offset some potential savings from electronic filing.  Further, to avoid disadvantaging taxpayers who file electronically, IRS has  a policy of posting the same information from electronic and paper returns  to its databases. Consequently, if a line is not transcribed from paper  returns, it is not posted from electronic returns either. Only information  posted to computer databases is readily available for use in IRS\u2019s  automated compliance checking programs.

Last year we suggested that the Congress mandate electronic filing  by paid preparers meeting certain criteria, such as a threshold number of  returns. Mandating electronic filing would not convert all v-coders,  because it would not apply to taxpayers who prepare their own returns on  a computer. Still, most v-coders use a paid preparer (68 percent in 2006).", "Another option to increase electronic filing is bar coding of all printed  returns prepared using commercial software. IRS has done preliminary  research showing that 100 percent of the information on a return could be  condensed into a bar code, which could be read by hand-held scanners.  Consequently, bar coding produces some of the efficiencies of electronic  filing by replacing the labor-intensive transcription process and  eliminating transcription errors. However, bar coding would still require  some processing of paper such as receiving and opening paper mail.", "Several states already require bar coding on their printed returns and there  is an industry standard among developers and vendors for creating bar  codes. Moreover, many of the largest software providers already support  bar coding.", "IRS\u2019s Wage and Investment Operating Division staff developed a proposal  for bar coding. However, Wage and Investment officials rejected that  proposal in June 2007, in part because it involved upgrading a legacy  system.

For example, IRS requires  paid preparers to identify themselves on all income tax returns they  prepare by entering their SSN or PTIN.  However, IRS does little to  monitor or track basic information about individual paid preparers. For  example, IRS does not collect information on the type of preparers, such  as whether the preparer is an enrolled agent or part of a commercial chain,  or the number or types of returns filed by preparers.

IRS\u2019s current initiative to  monitor the quality of returns at volunteer sites is in its second year of  implementation and includes mystery shopping, site and return reviews.  However, according to IRS officials, volunteer sites had advanced notice  of site and return reviews, but not mystery shopping. Consequently, IRS  acknowledged that the advance notice of these reviews was likely to bias  the results.", "While IRS plans to continue to perform site and return reviews in 2008,  officials said that following a sampling plan that would yield results that  could be generalized to the universe of volunteer sites would be too costly.  Instead, IRS plans to conduct unannounced return reviews, continue site  reviews, and increase the number of mystery shopping visits from the 39  done in 2007 to 100. According to IRS officials, mystery shopping yields  the best evaluative result of the three reviews IRS uses to assess the  quality of volunteer-prepared returns. We agree that having unannounced  visits and increasing the number of mystery shopping visits is likely to  yield a better evaluative result than the potentially biased methods  previously used for monitoring return preparation.

While useful, these measures do not reflect the extent to  which the volunteer program improves taxpayer compliance and  participation in programs such as the earned income tax credit. IRS has  increased its reliance on the volunteer program and plans to commit more  resources. However, as we testified earlier this year, IRS\u2019s budget  submission did not include basic performance information about the  program. More specifically, IRS does not know the extent to which the  program influences the taxpaying behavior of its target populations.", "Regarding IRS\u2019s walk-in sites, IRS recently started implementing contact  recording intended to better measure the accuracy of tax law and account  assistance.

With the exception  of a microphone that sits atop the desk of the walk-in site assistor, contact  recording is similar to the system IRS uses to monitor and assess the  quality of telephone interaction between taxpayers and telephone  assistors. IRS has deployed contact recording at 127 of its 401 walk-in  sites, which represents 46 percent of walk-in site contacts. As of May 26,  2007, IRS data show accuracy rates of 85 percent for accounts assistance  and 80 percent for tax law assistance, and IRS officials expect accuracy  rates to improve as IRS deploys contact recording at more sites.", "Although IRS currently has plans to fully deploy the contact recording  systems to all walk-in sites by 2009, contact recording is not included in its  plans to assess the quality of return preparation assistance. IRS intends  on relying on managerial observation of employee/taxpayer interactions  while providing return assistance. We have previously reported that  employees\u2019 performance could be influenced by the knowledge that they  are being observed by managers, biasing the results. Additionally,  managers were not consistently coding employee performance.  Consequently, without an unbiased method, IRS lacks reliable information  to assess performance, establish obtainable goals, and measure progress  toward goals.", "According to IRS officials, contact recording used to measure the accuracy  of tax law and account assistance could be extended to include return  preparation assistance. For example, the equipment is already at many of  the sites\u2014it is used to measure the accuracy of tax law and account  assistance, but turned off for return assistance. IRS officials said that IRS  had not yet determined the feasibility of using contact recording for return  assistance. IRS officials were concerned that contact recording, as it is  currently configured, might miss some aspects of return preparation  assistance, such as verifying taxpayers\u2019 documents. Further, IRS officials  noted that because it takes longer to prepare a return than answer a tax  law or account question, managerial review of return preparation takes  longer than for tax law or account assistance. However, officials also  noted that managers would be likely to spend the same amount of time  using the manager observation method as with contact recording but  manager observation would not yield reliable results.

One opportunity is to increase electronically filed  returns, either through mandates or bar coding, and transcribing the  remaining lines on residual paper returns. However, IRS does not have the  benefit/cost estimates that would be useful to make decisions about how  to proceed. In particular, IRS does not know the actions needed to require  software vendors to include bar codes on printed individual income tax  returns and the cost of those actions; the benefits, in terms of processing  costs and improved enforcement, of having all information available  electronically; and how much electronic filing would have to increase for  the benefits of transcribing all remaining paper returns to exceed the  costs.
