Defined  benefit pension plans are established or maintained by employers or  employee organizations, or both, and provide for a specific amount of  retirement income with the payment amounts typically based on years of  service and earnings.", "PBGC insures participants for single-employer and multiemployer defined  benefit pension plans. Single-employer plans generally consist of plans that  provide benefits to employees of one employer. Multiemployer plans are  those established through collective bargaining agreements that require  contributions by and provide benefits to workers from more than one  employer. PBGC charges a flat-rate premium or a variable-rate premium to  finance its coverage of amounts needed to guarantee benefit payments of  plans that terminate with insufficient assets to pay promised benefits.  PBGC initiates involuntary terminations for underfunded plans. Once those  plans are terminated, PBGC routinely is appointed as the permanent  trustee. (App. I summarizes the plan termination processes in more detail.)", "As shown in figure 1, PBGC\u2019s major expenditures include benefit payments,  financial assistance payments, and \u201coperational and administrative\u201d  expenses. Under the single-employer program, PBGC makes guaranteed  benefit payments to retirees or their dependents for underfunded  terminated plans. Under the multiemployer program, PBGC provides  financial assistance payments to pension plans that become insolvent. This  allows the plans to continue paying participants their guaranteed benefits.", "PBGC\u2019s operational and administrative expenses include expenses  incurred in carrying out its responsibilities as trustee of plans and its  administrative expenses. PBGC\u2019s expenses as a trustee include the costs of  collecting plan assets; processing, accounting, valuing, and managing  assets; determining eligibility and benefit levels; and paying benefits. PBGC  divides its operational and administrative expenses into two subcategories:  \u201cservices related to terminations\u201d and \u201cadministrative.\u201d PBGC treats all  expenses of \u201cservices related to terminations,\u201d including an allocation of  indirect expenses, as expenses related to its role as trustee of plans. PBGC  charges those expenses to its trust funds. (App. II discusses PBGC\u2019s  revolving and trust funds.) Over the years, PBGC operations have grown  significantly as pension plan terminations have increased. PBGC\u2019s reported  net position increased from a negative $1.3 billion in fiscal year 1985 (total  assets of $1.2 billion against $2.5 billion in recorded liabilities) to   $7.8 billion in fiscal year 2001 (total assets of $22.5 billion against $14.7  billion in recorded liabilities). In fiscal year 2002, PBGC\u2019s net position  decreased to a deficit of $3.5 billion (total assets of $26.4 billion against  $29.9 billion in recorded liabilities). The large decrease in PBGC\u2019s net  position in fiscal year 2002 was due largely to losses associated with  completed and probable pension plan terminations.

The annual appropriations  acts have not defined the types of costs to be included as \u201cadministrative  expenses.\u201d In fiscal years 1989 and 1991, however, the appropriations acts  identified certain PBGC contractual and other expenses to be excluded  from the administrative expense limitation, thus narrowing the activities  and expenses subject to the administrative expense limitation. Over time,  the percentage of PBGC\u2019s administrative expense limitation compared to  the total operational and administrative budget has decreased dramatically,  from 100 percent in fiscal year 1985 to 5.2 percent in fiscal year 2002. (See  fig. 3 and app. III for more details.) This decrease resulted in part from the  1989 and 1991 statutory provisions that narrowed the activities under the  administrative expense limitation. The decrease is also a result of PBGC\u2019s  application of the statutory limitation in its budget process, which is  described in a later section of this report.", "The first limitation on PBGC\u2019s administrative expenses appeared in the  Department of Labor Appropriations Act for fiscal year 1985. Expressing  concern that PBGC had not informed Congress of prior-year commitments  for computer acquisitions, the Senate Committee on Appropriations  recommended to Congress that it cap PBGC\u2019s budget authority for its fiscal  year 1985 \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d at $33.1 million. This limitation applied  to all of PBGC\u2019s operational and administrative expenses for fiscal year  1985, which covered PBGC\u2019s entire operational and administrative budget.  Congress has included a limitation on administrative expenses in each  annual appropriations act since fiscal year 1985.", "However, in subsequent years, Congress excluded expenses from the  \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d that had been included under the original  limitation in fiscal year 1985. For fiscal year 1989, PBGC requested that  Congress exclude certain contractual expenses from the administrative  expense limitation.  PBGC\u2019s Budget Director stated that the request was in  response to several major plan terminations. He stated that PBGC needed  flexibility to react quickly to the sizable cost and the unpredictable nature  of pension plan terminations. The statutory administrative expense  limitation in fiscal year 1989 limited PBGC\u2019s appropriations for  \u201cadministrative expenses\u201d to $44.2 million and allowed PBGC to exclude  from the limitation its \u201ccontractual expenses\u201d for   legal and financial service contracts in connection with the termination   benefits administration services.", "In late fiscal year 1991, PBGC requested that Congress further expand its  operational and administrative budget flexibility because of its rising  workloads. PBGC requested that, for the last 2 months of fiscal year 1991  and thereafter, the exclusions from the expense limitation be expanded to  include all expenses related to termination of pension plans, asset  management, and benefits administration. Congress modified the  administrative expense limitation as requested and has excluded these  expenses from the limitation in subsequent appropriations acts.  Subsequent to fiscal year 1991, PBGC made changes in its approach to  applying the statutory limitations, which resulted in a further reduction in  the proportion of expenses falling under the limitation.", "After we provided a draft of our report to PBGC, the President\u2019s proposed  Budget of the United States Government, Fiscal Year 2004 was released on  February 3, 2003.

As a result, PBGC\u2019s estimate for activities covered by the budget limitation  is not meaningful or reliable.  PBGC\u2019s Budget Director could not  demonstrate that PBGC had conducted any analysis of expense  classifications for PBGC\u2019s operational and administrative budget since  PBGC last reviewed its activities in 1993. We identified flaws in the  concepts supporting PBGC\u2019s budget estimates for expenses subject to the  limitation.  For example, PBGC did not identify any direct costs of activities  falling under the expense limitation, and based its estimated budget only on  the amount of indirect expenses not allocated to activities PBGC attributes  to plan terminations. Based on this flawed concept, PBGC determined that  its estimated budget for administrative expense limitation was   $11.5 million for fiscal year 1995. PBGC has used that amount, with some  minor adjustments, as a basis for all subsequent annual budget proposals,  without subsequent validation.", "To calculate the estimated cost of activities subject to the statutory  limitation based on the new exclusions that PBGC received beginning with  the last 2 months of fiscal year 1991, PBGC\u2019s Budget Director told us that  PBGC conducted reviews in 1991 and 1993 of activities at different  organizational levels. The official told us that based on a 1993 review,  PBGC identified and estimated direct and indirect expenses associated  with PBGC\u2019s different activities, including premium collections and  revolving fund investment services\u2014the major expense activities deemed  by PBGC to remain subject to the administrative expenses limitation. The  PBGC Budget Director was unable to provide us with documentation  supporting the review or the resulting expense allocations among PBGC\u2019s  activities. The PBGC official also did not provide supporting  documentation for the reasons why certain other regulatory and overhead  activities were excluded from the budget estimates for the administrative  expense limitation. Identifying and documenting its activities, along with a  basis for including or excluding those activities from the administrative  expense limitation, would have been PBGC\u2019s logical first step in developing  a cost allocation methodology for identifying total expenses under the  administrative expense limitation.", "However, in its budget proposals for fiscal year 1995, PBGC used a flawed  methodology for estimating costs that was inconsistent with the concept of  assigning direct and indirect costs based on activities performed. Under its  proposed operational and administrative budget, PBGC identified  estimated direct expenses for \u201cservices related to terminations\u201d that it  considered trustee activities. PBGC then placed all other expenses in a  pool it characterized as \u201cindirect,\u201d even though these \u201cindirect\u201d expenses  included direct expenses for premium collection and revolving fund  investment services, the two major activities it deemed to be subject to the  administrative expenses limitation. Further, PBGC estimated its budgeted  amount for the expense limitation based on an allocation of the expenses in  its pool of \u201cindirect\u201d expenses only. PBGC first allocated estimated  \u201cindirect\u201d expenses to its \u201cservices related to terminations\u201d based on the  ratio of estimated direct expenses for trustee activities to PBGC\u2019s total  estimated operational and administrative expenses. PBGC then assigned  the remaining \u201cindirect\u201d expenses to the estimated budget for the limited  administrative expenses, even though no direct expenses had been  assigned to those activities, and even though, by definition, indirect  expenses are generally not allocated to functions that do not have direct  expenses. (See fig. 4.)", "The effect of not considering the direct expenses associated with the  activities falling under the limitation when budgeting for these activities is  to arrive at a total budget estimate for limitation activities that may not be  reasonable. The budget estimate could be overstated or understated  depending on the actual level of direct expenses associated with limitation  activities.", "Based on this flawed approach, PBGC determined its proposed budget for  the expense limitation to be $11.5 million in fiscal year 1995 and has used  this amount as a basis for all subsequent years\u2019 budget proposals.  According to PBGC\u2019s Budget Director, all of PBGC\u2019s subsequent budget  proposals for the statutory limitation on administrative expenses have been  based on the fiscal year 1995 budgeted amount of $11.5 million, with minor  cost adjustments and inflation adjustments.  Therefore, from fiscal year  1995 through 2002, the amount of budgeted expenses falling under the  limited administrative expense category has generally remained constant,  while PBGC\u2019s total budget for operational and administrative expenses has  grown substantially. (See fig. 5.)  PBGC has attributed all growth in  expenses to trust fund activities and pays the increased expenses from the  trust funds, without any verification of the validity of this approach."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PBGC\u2019s Reporting of Expenses Falling under the Administrative Expense Limitation Is Not Meaningful", "paragraphs": ["We found that PBGC does not account for the actual expenses within its  administrative expense limitation.

He explained that the  methodology was created to eliminate judgment calls and any \u201cgray\u201d  distinctions between assigning costs for administrative activities subject to  budget limitations and those not subject to budget limitations. This  methodology, however, does not provide any reliable or meaningful cost  data related to actual activities. Proper budgetary accounting provides a  means to track the status of budget authority to help avoid overexpending  or overobligating appropriations. A methodology for budgeting, allocating,  and reporting costs should be clearly defined, well reasoned, consistently  applied, and properly documented. However, PBGC\u2019s process for  determining annual proposed and reported actual costs of activities subject  to the statutory limitation on administrative expenses is neither reasonable  nor reliable.", "As discussed in our executive guide on best practices in financial  management, to effectively evaluate and improve the value derived from  government programs and spending, Congress and other decision makers  need accurate and reliable financial information on program cost and  performance. We also note that financial information is meaningful when it  is useful, relevant, timely, and reliable. Cost accounting principles call for  direct costs to be assigned to an activity wherever feasible and  economically practical, and indirect costs to be allocated on a reasonable  and consistent basis. Such practices would require that PBGC periodically  evaluate its methodology for assigning the direct costs of activities and the  allocation of related indirect costs. Further, agencies administering  appropriation and fund accounts are responsible for ensuring that the  amounts obligated and expended do not exceed the legally imposed  limitations. Thus, when obligating or expending amounts for its expenses  under the administrative limitations, PBGC is required to separately track  those amounts, including whether they were actually disbursed, so that it  can determine by expense category whether its obligations and  expenditures are proper in amount and purpose."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["PBGC\u2019s budget proposals for its administrative expense limitation, along  with its reporting of the amounts spent under the expense limitation, are  not based on actual data and thus are not meaningful or effective in  controlling administrative costs.

The plan termination date generally is reached when  agreed to by PBGC or when ordered by a federal court pursuant to the  applicable termination procedure. On the plan termination date, benefits  cease to accrue to plan participants, the plan is generally removed from  coverage under Title I of ERISA, and the plan can be processed for  liquidation. The termination date is used by PBGC to make and issue  determinations on the value of (1) vested benefits, (2) unfunded vested  benefits, (3) employer liability for unfunded amounts, and (4) PBGC\u2019s  liability for its insured amounts.", "Terminated plans under \u201cPBGC-initiated terminations\u201d are \u201cclosed-out\u201d  when PBGC issues final determinations of benefits payable to plan  participants, resolves participants\u2019 appeals from the determinations, and  places the plans in administrative status. Under the administrative status,  PBGC contracts with plan administrators and other service contractors for  subsequent investment of plan assets, payment of benefits due, and  maintenance of participant data. The average age of benefit determinations  issued in fiscal year 2002 was 3.3 years after the date PBGC was appointed  as trustee. The average age of unissued benefit determinations at fiscal  year end was 0.9 years. Under \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cdistress terminations,\u201d  plans are liquidated when PBGC receives a certificate of distribution of  plan assets from a plan administrator (certifying that the administrator  purchased annuities or paid participants a lump sum).
