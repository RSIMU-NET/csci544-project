With reported net income of over $1 billion and increasing on-time delivery scores for First-Class Mail, the Service has shown that it can maintain a high income level while providing its customers with improved service. Also, in some management areas, such as automation of mail processes and labor-management relations, GAO acknowledges that some progress has been made. For example, the Service has overcome many of the initial obstacles it encountered in its efforts to automate letter sequencing and is making substantial progress toward accomplishing its goals in that area. In addition, the Service has also recently made some progress in addressing its labor-management relations problems and has made a good start in developing its strategic and 1999 annual performance plans required under the Government Performance and Results Act (Results Act).", "However, challenges remain for the Service to sustain performance and continue on a progressive path toward accomplishing established goals and objectives and improving operations.

For the third year in a row, the Service has reported increases in net income, certain mail delivery services, overall mail volume, and revenue. Net income for fiscal year 1997 was about $1.3 billion, which marks the third straight year that the Service has reported net income in excess of $1 billion per year. In fiscal year 1997, the overall delivery score for the on-time delivery of overnight mail reached a 3-year high of 92 percent, and total mail volume increased to about 191 billion pieces. This volume helped generate more than $58 billion in revenue during fiscal year 1997, the highest revenue figure reported by the Service in the most recent 3 fiscal years.", "Although such performance results appear to be encouraging, other information suggests that some areas of concern and challenges remain. For example, the delivery scores of 2-day and 3-day mail for fiscal year 1997\u2014reported by the Service to be 76 and 77 percent, respectively\u2014were less than the score for overnight mail. In addition, the fiscal year 1997 scores for delivering 2-day and 3-day mail had declined from levels previously reported for fiscal years 1995 and 1996. Such declines may reinforce concerns previously expressed by some postal customers that the Service\u2019s emphasis on overnight mail delivery has been at the expense of 2-day and 3-day mail delivery efforts. participation in delivering some types of mail has declined or suffered slow growth. For instance, the Service\u2019s delivery of Express Mail packages has declined due, in part, to its inability to offer volume discounts to large business mailers and its poor coverage of Zoning Improvement Plan (ZIP) codes for next-day delivery. In addition, the Service reported that the increased use of electronic alternatives to First-Class Mail, such as electronic mail and banking functions, has contributed to a lower growth rate than expected for this type of mail\u2014around 1.5 percent for fiscal year 1997\u2014rather than the 2.5 percent initially anticipated. The Service expects that this trend will continue in future years and will result in significant losses in First-Class Mail revenues. In addition, continued aggressive efforts by various competitors have challenged the Service\u2019s ability to participate in the international mail market, participation that the Service acknowledged has declined in recent years.", "Also, in light of the Service\u2019s reported net income of over $1 billion in each of the last 3 fiscal years, questions have been raised concerning the appropriateness of the Service\u2019s recently approved request for increases in various postage rates. Questions have also been raised about the means by which the Service determines the need for such increases, including the use of specific data to justify the rate increase request."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Our Completed Work Related to Key Management Issues", "paragraphs": ["I would now like to highlight for you some of the work that we completed during the past year, in which we reported on topics involving key management issues that have received a great deal of attention from Congress and various postal stakeholders. The topics we addressed included (1) labor-management relations; (2) automated letter sequencing, also known as Delivery Point Sequencing (DPS); and (3) the Service\u2019s plans prepared in response to the Government Performance and Results Act (Results Act)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor-Management Relations", "paragraphs": ["have been made in improving relations among the Service and three of its four major postal labor unions. We reported that although some improvement efforts, known as initiatives, had been established, difficulties existed in reporting on the initiatives\u2019 results because, in some cases, initiatives had only recently been implemented or had been discontinued. Also, disagreements among the parties prevented the full implementation of some initiatives. In our 1997 report, we included various indicators, such as a growing number of employee grievances, which showed that problems on the workroom floor of various postal locations appeared to have continued since 1994 when we initially reported on the existence of these problems. In the 1994 report, we mentioned that in many instances, labor-management relations problems resulted from autocratic management styles; the sometimes adversarial attitudes of employees, unions, and postal management; and an inappropriate and inadequate performance management system.", "Subsequent to the issuance of our 1997 report, we have seen some progress in the parties\u2019 efforts to address such problems. For example, in late October 1997, Service officials along with representatives from the four major postal labor unions, the three management associations, and officials from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service (FMCS) began convening summit meetings, one of the initiatives that we had discussed in our 1997 report. According to FMCS, which helped facilitate the summits, progress has been made and continues to be made in addressing labor-management relations problems that have plagued the Service for years, including issues related to employee grievances. We are encouraged by the recent reported progress as well as the new Postmaster General\u2019s emphasis on the importance of addressing labor-management relations problems. We support the parties\u2019 use of summit meetings as an opportunity to try to reach agreement on approaches to solving long-standing labor-management relations problems. However, the underlying problems that have hampered good relationships between the Service and most of its labor unions remain and pose significant challenges to the Service and its unions.", "This year, events are scheduled that may affect the state of labor-management relations within the Service. For example, elections for officers in the two largest of the four major postal labor unions\u2014APWU and NALC\u2014are set to occur in the summer of 1998. Such officers can play an important part in the overall relationship that the organizations have with the Service. In addition, collective bargaining negotiations are expected to begin in August 1998, shortly after the elections of new union officers for these two unions. Also, the newly appointed Postal Service Vice President for Labor Relations should become involved with the negotiations. In the past, negotiations between the Service and three of the four major postal labor unions have sometimes been marked by controversy and disagreements that have in some cases required arbitration. The conduct of the negotiations and the extent to which settlements can be agreed upon instead of relying on arbitration can be highly dependent on the attitudes and approaches that Service officials and union representatives bring to the bargaining table."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Automated Letter Sequencing", "paragraphs": ["In April 1998, we reported on the implementation of the process known as DPS, the final phase of the Service\u2019s letter automation program. As part of the overall automation program, DPS, which began in 1993, entails the automated sorting of letters that have been barcoded by either business customers or the Service. DPS was designed to provide letter carriers with letters already sequenced into delivery order, so that carriers would spend less time in the office manually sorting letters and more time on the street delivering mail. In doing so, DPS was expected to save letter carrier workhours, thus reducing overtime costs and improving productivity.", "The Service has made substantial progress in implementing DPS, despite initial obstacles. For instance, DPS implementation, which was initially scheduled for completion by the end of fiscal year 1995, fell behind schedule due to delays in procuring automated equipment and a shortfall in the volume of barcoded letters. The Service acknowledged that it had been overly optimistic in its DPS expectations. Subsequently, it revised goals and benchmarks for the implementation of DPS to be completed by the end of fiscal year 1998. The progress that the Service has made toward achieving these goals and benchmarks included the deployment of all the automated equipment needed to support DPS, the implementation of DPS in more delivery zones than expected, and annual increases in carrier workhour savings.", "Although the Service achieved carrier workhour savings through DPS implementation, part of these savings was offset by a nationwide decline in city carrier street efficiency, which involves the number of deliveries carriers made per hour. On DPS routes, the Service believed that the decline was greater than it had anticipated from DPS work methods and was due in part to route adjustments that were less timely and accurate than expected. NALC believed that much of the decline in efficiency was caused by DPS work methods, such as the additional time carriers needed to handle and prepare some DPS letters on the street, work that was formerly done by carriers in the office. The Service is working to improve city carrier efficiency through various efforts. For example, the Service has made additional funds available so that inspections can be made prior to implementing DPS on specific routes, and routes can be adjusted to capture DPS savings. Also, the Service is working to improve supervision of city carriers\u2019 street operations and is testing both alternative delivery methods and new city carrier performance standards.", "Although the Service has achieved some success in addressing operational issues, it has been less successful in resolving disagreements about DPS implementation with NALC, the postal labor union that represents about 234,000 city carriers. Such disagreements generated the filing of many grievances. Most of the grievances were resolved through settlement while several had to be resolved through national arbitration. In many cases, the grievances involved employee concerns about specific DPS implementation procedures that were established in various memoranda signed by the Service and NALC. Although many city carriers we spoke with said that they saw benefits to DPS, they also said that they were concerned about its effects on their daily work, particularly their ability to serve customers efficiently."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strategic and Performance Plans", "paragraphs": ["quantitative performance indicators to measure progress toward these goals.", "The plan generally addressed the six major components required by the Results Act, including a mission statement, general goals and objectives, strategies to achieve the goals and objectives, and performance measures of the goals and objectives. In doing so, the plan provided useful information on the Service\u2019s vision of its future and how the Service planned to achieve its desired results. However, we believed that for some of the components, such as the Service\u2019s mission statement, the information could have been strengthened so that it could have been more complete and more clearly conveyed. When the Service\u2019s final strategic plan was issued at the end of September 1997, we found that improvements had been included in the plan that made it a clearer and more complete document.", "In its 1997 Comprehensive Statement on Postal Operations, the Service included a preliminary version of the Annual Performance Plan for fiscal year 1999. The plan is intended to provide a yearly update of and more detailed information on the goals and targets to be achieved and establish performance indicators to be used in determining how progress is being made toward achieving the goals and targets. We are currently reviewing the plan and are finding that, overall, it did an effective job of articulating performance goals that defined expected performance and were quantifiable and results-oriented. Also, the plan did a good job of discussing how the Service plans to measure and review results, and it recognizes the role of management and some stakeholders, such as the Inspector General, in reviewing and evaluating programs. However, although the plan broadly discussed the strategies and resources necessary to achieve its goals, we believe that the plan could better link particular strategies and resources with particular performance goals.

The Service implemented procedures aimed at reducing the likelihood of cost overruns occurring in similar future capital investment projects, including earlier notification of problems to the Board of Governors and more Postal Inspection Service involvement with review of facilities construction. Also, we were asked to review mail service performance data on Chicago\u2019s Graceland postal station, which had been the focus of constituent complaints. We compared performance data from the Graceland station with another postal station\u2014Boston\u2019s Brookline station\u2014that had achieved higher data results and yet functioned in an environment similar to the Graceland station.

However, according to the Secretary for the Board of Governors, the decision to move forward to implement the program was not based on anticipated savings but on the need to comply with existing memoranda of understanding with postal labor unions. The memoranda anticipated that, through centralized purchasing, employees would be supplied with a greater number of uniform items of a higher quality with an overall reduction in costs to the Service.

However, as you may recall, Mr. Chairman, you believed that more information was needed on this topic before changes to this law could reasonably be considered.", "To provide you with additional information on the mailbox restriction, among other things, we obtained the views of over 1,000 randomly selected adults in the continental United States and other postal stakeholders, including the Service and the seven major postal labor unions and management associations. We reported that the vast majority of the adults were opposed to allowing just anyone to put mail into their mailboxes. However, their views differed regarding the desirability of mailbox access for particular companies or particular items. For example, about 60 percent of the adults favored allowing express companies, such as Federal Express and United Parcel Service, to put packages into mailboxes. But less than 50 percent of the adults favored allowing companies to leave other types of items in mailboxes, such as utility bills, magazines or newspapers, and catalogs, coupons, or ads. seven major postal labor unions and management associations, and a contractors\u2019 association believed that the mailbox restriction was needed generally to protect postal revenue, facilitate efficient and secure delivery of mail, and promote the privacy of postal customers. Other stakeholders, including the Justice Department and the Postal Inspection Service, opposed any relaxation of the mailbox restriction law because, among other things, it helped deter mail theft by limiting mailbox access and made it easier to detect, investigate, and resolve cases of mail theft. However, Service competitors generally believed that the law should be repealed or changed because it was unnecessary, impeded competition, and infringed on private property. Also, none of the eight foreign postal administrations we surveyed said that they needed a law restricting mailbox access and none of these countries had ever had such a restriction.

We determined that little of the First-Class Mail volumes that are currently protected by the postal monopoly would become subject to competition. In addition, we said a variety of other factors, such as a reduction in First-Class Mail volume due to increased use of electronic media along with costs, inflation, and service quality, could in the long run, in combination with any change in the scope of the postal monopoly, have an impact on the Service\u2019s ability to provide affordable universal service."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Ongoing GAO Work Related to Competition and Diversity Issues", "paragraphs": ["I would now like to discuss our ongoing work, most of which has been initiated at your request, Mr. Chairman, or at the request of members of your Subcommittee, in which we are focusing on various postal activities that in large part relate to the issues of competition and diversity.
