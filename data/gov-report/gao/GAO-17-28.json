States can offer these services through one or more programs under which home- and community-based services can be provided, each with different federal requirements. The provision of personal care in beneficiaries' homes can pose risks to safety, and these services have a high rate of improper payments, including instances where services for which the state was billed were not provided. In recent years Congress has directed HHS to improve coordination of these programs, which could harmonize requirements\u2014that is, implement a more consistent administration of policies and procedures\u2014and enhance oversight.", "GAO was asked to review oversight of Medicaid personal care services. GAO examined: (1) how selected states ensure that beneficiaries receiving services are safe from harm and that billed services are provided; and (2) steps CMS has taken since 2010 to improve oversight and harmonize requirements across programs. GAO reviewed policies in four states with varied programs; reviewed laws, guidance and documents; and interviewed CMS officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Four states that GAO reviewed varied in how they implemented safeguards to protect beneficiaries receiving in-home personal care services from harm and in their methods to help ensure billed services were actually provided. For example, to help keep beneficiaries safe, the four selected states\u2014California, Maryland, Oregon, and Texas\u2014reported that they monitored beneficiaries by having case managers or nurses periodically check in with beneficiaries, but the frequency and means, such as in-person or by phone, varied among the states and in some cases across programs within a state. The four states also reported using different methods to help ensure that billed services were actually provided. For example, to track attendants' work time, two states required beneficiaries to sign paper timesheets for the attendants, and two states used electronic visit verification timekeeping systems for some or all programs.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has taken several steps to improve oversight of states' personal care service programs and harmonize requirements but has not collected required state reports or addressed significant differences in program requirements. Since 2010, CMS steps to improve oversight of states' programs include enhancing guidance and conducting webinars to help states address improper payments. To manage risk inherent in the provision of these services, and in keeping with statutory direction to improve coordination of these programs, CMS has taken steps to better harmonize requirements across programs including directing states to follow agency guidance issued for one type of program when implementing a similar type of program. However:", "CMS has not systematically collected required states' reports on personal care services provided under two programs, although CMS stated that guidance for states to submit the reports is under development. Collecting these reports could improve oversight by providing CMS and Congress with information on programs' effects on beneficiaries' health and welfare.", "CMS harmonization efforts have not addressed the significant differences across federal program requirements specific to beneficiary safety and ensuring that billed services are provided. Consequently, the safeguards and level of assurance that CMS has regarding states' beneficiary protections and oversight of billed services can vary by program. For example, one reviewed state requires quarterly or biannual beneficiary monitoring for most programs; but one program monitors annually as federal requirements do not require more frequent monitoring. Similarly, requirements to help ensure billed services are actually provided vary widely among states and programs, contributing to uneven assurances and oversight across programs.", "Home- and community-based services, including personal care services, are growing in significance and in demand. A more consistent administration of policies and procedures across programs could help the federal government and states better manage risks to beneficiaries and protect the integrity of the program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Acting Administrator of CMS (1) collect and analyze required state reports on personal care services and (2) take steps to further harmonize federal program requirements, as appropriate, across programs providing these services. HHS concurred with both recommendations"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid, a federal-state health financing program for low-income and  medically needy individuals, is the nation\u2019s primary payer of long-term  care services and supports for people with disabilities and aged  individuals. Medicaid spending on long-term care services and supports is  significant, representing about one quarter of Medicaid spending  annually. The majority of Medicaid long term care spending is for home  and community-based services (HCBS)\u2014that is, services and assistance  provided to beneficiaries in their homes or communities rather than in  institutional settings such as nursing homes. Personal care services  (PCS) are a significant component of HCBS. PCS provide assistance to  beneficiaries who have limited ability to care for themselves because of  physical, developmental, or intellectual disabilities or conditions. These  nonmedical services assist beneficiaries with activities of daily living such  as bathing, dressing, and toileting. Such assistance can enable people  with disabilities and aged beneficiaries to remain in their homes, maintain  their independence, and participate in community life to the fullest extent  possible. In calendar year 2015, reported federal and state Medicaid  expenditures for fee-for-service PCS\u2014those not provided through  managed care delivery systems\u2014totaled about $15 billion. Expenditures  associated with PCS provided in managed care delivery systems are  unknown. The demand for PCS is expected to increase as a result of the  aging of the nation\u2019s population, increased life expectancy, and increased  opportunities for aged and individuals with disabilities to live in their  homes instead of institutions. The federal cost of long-term services and  supports is estimated to increase from $75 billion in 2015 to $111 billion  in 2026.", "Although PCS are an important support for Medicaid beneficiaries that  can enable them to remain in their homes and communities, provision of  PCS is not without risk, both for beneficiary safety and for improper  Medicaid payments. Regarding safety, beneficiaries receiving PCS  include aged individuals and individuals with physical, developmental, or  intellectual disabilities, some of whom can be vulnerable. Also, when PCS  is provided in a private home, other providers or community members  may not be present to help discourage or report on questionable  activities. Moreover, depending on the state and the PCS program,  personal care attendants (attendants) who provide PCS may not be  required to have a credential from an organization that trains workers for  certain qualifications. The provision of PCS is also at high risk for  Medicaid improper payments. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), estimated that about 6 percent of all states\u2019  payments for PCS in 2014 were improper and that the projected dollar  amount of payment errors was over $2 billion, the third highest of all types  of Medicaid services. The HHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) has  also identified $582 million in questioned PCS costs in seven states from  2009 through 2012, such as instances in which PCS providers received  payments from state Medicaid agencies for services that were not  provided. While ensuring that billed services are provided protects against  Medicaid fraud, it also protects health and welfare by making sure  beneficiaries receive the services they need to remain safely in their  homes and communities.", "PCS are one of the many types of services states may provide under their  Medicaid programs, which are administered by states and overseen by  the federal government. CMS is responsible for broad oversight of  Medicaid. To implement various provisions of federal law, CMS issues  program requirements in the form of regulations and guidance, approves  changes to states\u2019 Medicaid plans, provides technical assistance to  states, collects and reviews required information and data from states  and, in some cases, reviews individual state programs. Under broad  federal requirements, states are responsible for the day-to-day  administration of their Medicaid programs. States have considerable  flexibility to establish multiple Medicaid PCS programs under different  provisions of federal law that authorize different types of PCS programs.  These different types of programs were enacted at different times and  offer states different options for serving beneficiaries; for example, some  types of programs allow states to limit services to only beneficiaries who  need an institutional level of care. The different types of programs have  different requirements under federal statute, regulation, and guidance.  States are responsible for establishing state policies and procedures in  accordance with these requirements. The Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act directed HHS to take steps to improve the  coordination among, and the regulation of, all providers of home- and  community-based services. PCS programs have different statutory  requirements that CMS lacks authority to alter. However, harmonization  of requirements across programs can improve coordination of program  services and potentially facilitate improved oversight to better ensure  beneficiary health and safety and that billed services are actually  provided. Harmonization does not entail complete consistency but a more  consistent administration of policies and procedures across programs in  relation to the provision of such services. Given the projected increase in  the volume and costs of PCS, the potential vulnerability of program  beneficiaries, the risk of improper payments, and the challenge of  overseeing different PCS programs with different federal requirements,  you asked us for information on federal and state policies administering  PCS. This report examines:  1.  how selected states ensure that beneficiaries receiving PCS are safe  from harm and that billed services are provided; and  2.  recent steps CMS has taken, if any, to improve oversight of states\u2019  PCS programs and to harmonize requirements across the programs.", "To examine how selected states ensure that beneficiaries receiving PCS  are safe from harm and that billed services are provided, we selected a  nongeneralizable sample of four states to review the policies and  procedures they used to administer and oversee their Medicaid PCS  programs: California, Maryland, Oregon, and Texas. We selected states  that offer PCS under more than one type of Medicaid PCS program;  states that provide PCS under the Community First Choice option (the  newest type of program that states can use to provide PCS); and states  that provided geographic diversity. In each state and for each PCS  program reviewed, we administered a structured questionnaire and  reviewed the responses and documentation on state oversight  requirements, such as laws, policies, and procedures. We also  interviewed state Medicaid officials who administer PCS programs and  other state and local officials, such as officials from Adult Protective  Services agencies. In each state, we reviewed PCS programs  administered under a fee-for-service basis and did not review programs  administered on a managed care basis. We excluded managed care  arrangements because we limited our scope to PCS programs in which  the state was directly responsible for administering the programs. Further,  we limited our scope to reporting on state practices as reported by states  but did not verify implementation of these practices or assess CMS\u2019s  oversight of these practices or their compliance with any applicable  federal requirements. In addition, we interviewed officials from four private  entities that provide PCS or administer long term care programs that  reimburse participants for PCS. In addition to one private entity that  administers a national long term care program, we chose three entities  suggested by national HCBS experts that operated within our selected  states. We asked officials at these entities about the policies and  procedures they use to keep clients safe in their homes and to ensure  that services for which states were billed were actually provided.", "To examine recent steps CMS has taken, if any, to improve oversight of  states\u2019 PCS programs and to harmonize requirements across PCS  programs, we reviewed applicable federal laws, regulations, and  guidance specific to Medicaid PCS programs, including reporting  requirements. We also obtained reports by CMS and HHS OIG, and we  interviewed officials with CMS. We focused our review on steps taken  since 2010, the year in which the Patient Protection and Affordable Care  Act was enacted and added a new PCS program option for states, the  Community First Choice program. In addition, we reviewed relevant  standards for internal control in the federal government and risk  management standards published by an international standard-setting  organization.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2015 to November 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

States administer their  Medicaid programs within broad federal rules and according to a state  plan approved by CMS, the federal agency that oversees Medicaid. In  addition to providing PCS under their state plans, states can also seek  permission from CMS to provide PCS under waivers of traditional  Medicaid requirements, for example, in order to provide services to a  segment of the state\u2019s eligible population.

Factors driving  these changes may include the desire and  increased ability of beneficiaries who are aged  and disabled to live in their homes and  communities and the Supreme Court\u2019s 1999  Olmstead decision, which held that states  must serve individuals with disabilities in  community-based settings under certain  circumstances.

In fiscal year 2014 (the most recent year for  which data are available), total Medicaid spending for long-term services  and supports was estimated at $152 billion. Long-term services and  supports represent a broad range of health and health-related services  and non-medical supports for individuals of all ages that these individuals  need over an extended period of time. Long-term services and supports  are generally provided in two settings: institutional facilities, such as  nursing homes; and home and community settings, such as individuals\u2019  homes or assisted living facilities. Although states\u2019 Medicaid coverage of  long-term care services provided in nursing homes is generally  mandatory and coverage of these services in home and community  settings is generally optional, spending on these services in the home and  community setting has increased and now exceeds spending on these  services in institutions (see fig. 1). All 50 states and the District of  Columbia provide long-term care services to some Medicaid beneficiaries  in home and community settings, according to a report produced under  contract with CMS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Medicaid Personal Care Services", "paragraphs": ["Medicaid PCS are a key component of Medicaid long-term services and  supports and include assistance with activities of daily living, such as  bathing and dressing, and in some cases instrumental activities of daily  living, such as preparing meals and housekeeping. PCS are typically non- medical services provided by attendants\u2014home-care workers who may  or may not have specialized training, depending on specific state and  federal requirements. Attendants may be employed by a provider agency  or self-employed. In some cases, they are friends or family members of  the beneficiary and, under certain types of Medicaid PCS programs, can  be spouses, parents, or other legally responsible relatives.", "States can use different delivery models to provide PCS to beneficiaries.  Under an agency-directed model, a provider agency employs attendants.  The provider agency hires, fires, pays, and trains the attendant to provide  PCS services to Medicaid beneficiaries. Under a participant-directed  model, beneficiaries or their representatives have more choice and  control over the PCS the beneficiary receives and have the authority to  manage PCS services by selecting, hiring, firing, and training attendants  themselves. States can implement hybrid forms of these models as well;  for example, by using an attendant from a provider agency but allowing  the beneficiary to be involved in directly managing the attendant by doing  such things as scheduling services, providing training on the beneficiary\u2019s  specific needs, and, if needed, discharging the attendant.", "With approval from CMS, states can choose to provide PCS under one or  more types of programs authorized over the past 41 years under different  sections of the Social Security Act. The various types of programs provide  states with options for permitting participant direction and choices about  how to limit services, among other things. For example, two types of PCS  programs (HCBS Waiver and Community First Choice programs) only  serve beneficiaries who are eligible for an institutional level of care; that  is, beneficiaries must have needs that rise to the level of care usually  provided in a nursing facility, hospital, or other institution. Some types of  PCS programs require the state to provide PCS to all Medicaid  beneficiaries who are eligible (PCS State Plan and Community First  Choice programs), while other programs (HCBS waivers and State Plan  HCBS programs) allow the state to target certain beneficiary populations  (see table 1). Appendix I provides more details on the PCS programs  offered by the selected states included in our review.", "Some beneficiaries receiving PCS can be at risk for unintentional harm as  well as potential neglect, abuse, and exploitation by their attendants  because of their underlying conditions. In October 2016, the HHS OIG  reported cases of beneficiaries being abused or neglected by their  attendants. For example, one beneficiary was hospitalized for  dehydration and malnourishment after her attendant neglected her care.  In 2010, the HHS OIG reported that of 55 PCS beneficiaries or their  family members interviewed in New York, there were 11 reports of a  beneficiary being subject to theft, 5 reports of physical abuse or threats,  and 2 reported that they were abandoned by their attendant.  Beneficiaries may also be at risk of unintentional physical harm from  falling, particularly when the attendant cannot safely transfer clients  effectively from a bed to a chair. Some beneficiaries receive care from a  friend or family member, but these relationships may not always protect  vulnerable beneficiaries from abuse. In addition, beneficiaries may be at  risk for self-neglect or other health challenges if their attendants do not  show up to provide services when scheduled or are not trained to identify  signs of diminished health. A beneficiary\u2019s capacity to manage finances  and secure possessions may decline with age, onset of dementia, or  other cognitive disabilities, and put them at risk of theft or financial  exploitation from unscrupulous attendants for example, the unauthorized  use of a beneficiary\u2019s credit cards by an attendant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Program Requirements for Maintaining Beneficiary Safety and Ensuring That Billed Services Are Provided", "paragraphs": ["The federal Medicaid program requirements governing the provision of  PCS derives from statutes enacted at different times in Medicaid\u2019s history  (see table 1).

Guidance can include letters to  state Medicaid directors, program manuals, and templates to help states  apply for CMS approval to provide certain services like PCS. Together  with federal statutes, the regulations and guidance issued by CMS  establish a broad federal framework for the provision of PCS. States are  responsible for establishing and administering specific policies and  programs within the federal parameters laid out in this framework.  Medicaid program requirements vary by the type of PCS program, but  may include the following types of protections depending on the type of  program:  screening attendants to see if they are excluded as Medicaid  providers; developing minimum qualification standards for attendants; establishing quality assurance processes to ensure the services  provided protect the health and welfare of beneficiaries;  identifying and reporting cases of potential abuse, neglect, or other  events that harm, or could result in harm to beneficiaries; establishing policies and processes to ensure that services for which  the state has been billed were actually provided; and  reporting on the health and welfare of beneficiaries to CMS on a  regular basis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States\u2019 Implementation of Personal Care Services", "paragraphs": ["The Social Security Act requires each state to designate a single state  agency to administer or supervise its Medicaid program. States may  designate other state and local agencies to administer and oversee the  entirety of their PCS programs, or certain functions, including beneficiary  enrollment or beneficiary case management. States may administer  different PCS programs because the programs were designed for certain  types of beneficiaries. For example, one state administers one PCS  program for beneficiaries with developmental disabilities and another  PCS program for those with physical disabilities. Sometimes county or  other local governments provide certain Medicaid services under state  Medicaid agency oversight. For example, many Medicaid programs  employ county case managers who help beneficiaries gain access to  needed services, including PCS. Other state or local government  programs may be involved with Medicaid PCS beneficiaries, but do not  directly participate in a Medicaid program. For example, almost all states  have Adult or Child Protective Services, agencies that investigate and  take action when allegations of maltreatment are reported. Generally,  Adult Protective Service officials may work with both Medicaid  beneficiaries and non-Medicaid clients, but are generally not located  within a state\u2019s Medicaid office according to an expert.", "In fee-for-service arrangements, attendants receive payment by  submitting claims to state Medicaid agencies for the PCS they provided.  Independent attendants\u2014those who do not work for a provider agency\u2014 submit claims directly to a state Medicaid agency. Attendants who work  for a provider agency typically give that agency information on the  services rendered, and then the provider agency submits claims on behalf  of the attendant. Both types of claims submitted to state Medicaid  agencies generally identify the dates of the service, the types of services  provided, and the Medicaid beneficiaries who received the services.  Claims for PCS are often paid based on the duration of care.", "States must seek approval from CMS to implement one or more types of  PCS programs by submitting proposals to CMS that explain how the state  will comply with federal requirements. Upon CMS\u2019s approval and  consistent with any applicable federal requirements, states may impose  additional state requirements to implement the programs. While states\u2019  policies and procedures for providing PCS can vary across states and  within a state across different PCS programs, several key steps are  generally involved. As illustrated in figure 2, for Medicaid beneficiaries,  states must determine beneficiaries\u2019 eligibility for PCS, arrange for the  development of a plan of service, and help connect beneficiaries to an  attendant who is authorized to provide services.

The four states  also reported using different methods to help ensure billed services were  provided (see Appendix I for the types of PCS programs reviewed in each  state).", "All four selected states reported employing safeguards in three common  areas to help ensure Medicaid beneficiaries receiving PCS in their homes  are safe from harm: (1) attendant screening and training; (2) beneficiary  monitoring; and (3) addressing unusual incidents. However, states\u2019  specific safeguard implementation methods and requirements varied by  state and, in some cases, varied within a state across PCS programs.  According to state Medicaid officials, many factors may affect the  methods states choose to implement beneficiary safeguards, such as  beneficiary risk levels, the extent to which beneficiaries are responsible  for managing their own services, how state Medicaid programs are  structured, input from stakeholders such as consumer advocacy groups,  and state and federal requirements."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Attendant Screening and Training", "paragraphs": ["All four selected states reported that attendants are required to undergo  some form of background screening in all their PCS programs, but the  specific background information checked varied by state. Background  screenings could entail, for example, a criminal background check or a  determination of whether the individual was listed on certain federal or  state lists or registries, such as the HHS OIG list of excluded providers or  a state\u2019s list of excluded providers. All four selected states reported that  attendants in all PCS programs are required to undergo a criminal  background check. Three of the four states also required checking  attendants against HHS\u2019s OIG list of excluded providers in all state PCS  programs; under Oregon\u2019s Participant-Directed Option, the beneficiary or  a representative is responsible for screenings beyond the criminal  background check. Each of the four selected states also required some  additional background screenings in all or most PCS programs, including  checking other federal databases, and three states required checks  against state administered provider lists and registries (see table 2). With  the exception of the Community First Choice Option, federal PCS  program requirements generally leave it to the states to establish specific  attendant screening requirements.", "The four selected states varied as to how they used the results of criminal  background checks. Beneficiaries under California\u2019s PCS program can  hire their preferred attendant in some cases if the attendant has been  convicted of certain types of felonies, such as fraud against a social  services program. Oregon Medicaid officials reported that they exclude  attendants convicted of certain crimes, such as murder, robbery, and  rape. The state has a weighing process for some crimes, such as theft or  financial crimes, to determine whether or not the attendant should be  excluded from providing services, according to officials. Texas Medicaid  officials reported that under all state PCS programs, the state bars  employment of attendants convicted of certain crimes, such as homicide  and arson. Maryland Medicaid officials reported that under all state PCS  programs, provider agencies decide if they want to hire a particular  attendant.", "Balancing Attendant Qualifications with  Supply of Attendants  In deciding what, if any, training to require of  attendants, states may balance making sure  attendants are qualified to provide care with  the need for an adequate supply of attendants  to support the demand for in-home PCS.  While more training can be beneficial for  beneficiaries, training requirements can pose  a barrier to participation for some attendants  and diminish the supply of attendants.", "Regarding attendant training, each of the four selected states reported  requiring that attendants receive initial training or complete an orientation  for all or most state PCS programs, but specific requirements varied by  state and in some cases within a state by PCS program. Under four PCS  program types (State Plan PCS, HCBS Waivers, State Plan HCBS, and  Community First Choice programs delivering PCS through provider  agencies) states may define qualifications for attendants. The Participant- Directed Option program and Community First Choice program permit the  beneficiary to train their attendants in their specific areas of personal  assistance needs. Some of the selected states may require attendants to  complete an orientation, but do not consider to be training. For example,  California officials reported that while they require attendants in all  programs to complete an orientation, they do not have initial training  requirements. Oregon officials also reported that while they have no initial  training requirements, they do require attendants to complete an  orientation. Attendants may be required to receive additional training if  they are going to provide certain healthcare services to beneficiaries,  such as medication administration. All four selected states reported that  attendants are permitted to perform such services in at least some  programs but generally only after they are trained by nurses or other  health professionals to perform the specific task. In three selected states  this was done through nurse delegation, which allows nurses to delegate  specific tasks to unlicensed individuals, accompanied by concomitant  training and supervision. California does not permit nurse delegation, but does allow a licensed nurse or other healthcare professional to train  an attendant to provide certain services, such as medication  administration. All four selected states reported that in all or most PCS  programs attendants were required to be trained in, or receive information  on, their responsibilities regarding critical incidents, such as whether they  are mandated to report incidents and how to recognize and report critical  incidents. Critical incidents are events or situations that cause or may  cause harm to a beneficiary\u2019s health or welfare, such as abuse, neglect,  or exploitation. Texas required attendants to undergo periodic renewal or  refresher training in some programs, although requirements vary by  program. For example, under the State Plan PCS program provided to  beneficiaries under age 21, provider agencies must ensure a continuing  systematic training program for all attendants. In addition, Maryland  requires attendants to receive training on cardiopulmonary resuscitation  every two years. Table 3 shows the type of training or orientation  requirements in selected states.", "All four selected states reported that beneficiaries\u2019 health and welfare is  monitored in part by having case managers or nurses periodically check  in with beneficiaries, but the frequency and means, such as in-person  versus by phone or electronic message, varied among the four states and  in some cases within states across PCS programs. States generally  have flexibility on how they monitor beneficiaries, as Medicaid PCS  program monitoring requirements are broad and do not prescribe specific  frequencies or means for checking in with beneficiaries beyond  requirements for annual reassessments or annual reviews of beneficiary  plans of care (see table 4).", "State beneficiary monitoring requirements may be based on such factors  as federal Medicaid PCS program requirements, as well as on state goals  for balancing beneficiaries\u2019 safety with respecting beneficiaries\u2019  autonomy. Some selected states based the frequency of beneficiary  monitoring on the risk level of the beneficiaries. For example, according to  officials, Oregon\u2019s State Plan PCS program serves beneficiaries who do  not need an institutional level of care, and Oregon state officials  determined that certain beneficiaries receiving services under this  program could be safe with less monitoring than beneficiaries in PCS  programs that serve those with greater health needs.", "When beneficiaries need healthcare services, such as medication  administration, attendants may be allowed to provide these services;  doing so may result in additional beneficiary monitoring in some states.  Three of our four selected states permitted nurse delegation under all or  some PCS programs. These three states\u2014Maryland, Oregon, and  Texas\u2014required post-delegation follow-up by a nurse in these cases. For  example, if an attendant administers medication to a beneficiary under  nurse delegation in Maryland, a nurse must conduct an in-home visit at  least every 45 days (see table 5).", "California does not permit nurse delegation, which places ongoing  responsibilities on the nurse, such as monitoring.

Unusual incidents are events that  adversely affect or have the potential to adversely affect beneficiary  health and safety, such as an attendant missing an appointment, as well  as critical incidents. In general, a back-up plan is part of a customized  service plan designed to ensure that an individual beneficiary receives the  services and supports they need to remain safely in their homes. The  plan identifies situations that could jeopardize a beneficiary\u2019s safety and  establishes a strategy to prevent or manage such situations. A back-up  plan typically identifies individuals who may be called if an attendant does  not show up as scheduled. Critical incidents include abuse, neglect, or  other events that harm, or could result in the harm of, beneficiaries.", "All four selected states reported requiring individualized provider back-up  plans for beneficiaries in all or most of the PCS programs they administer.  California and Maryland require provider back-up plans for beneficiaries  in all state PCS programs. Oregon requires provider back-up plans under  the Participant-Directed Option and Community First Choice, but not  under State Plan PCS. Oregon Medicaid officials explained that this is  because the majority of beneficiaries receiving services under State Plan  PCS receive a small number of hours\u2014typically 20 hours or less\u2014of  services per month. Texas requires provider back-up plans under all state  PCS programs delivered under the agency-provider model. Under  programs operating under Texas\u2019s participant-directed model, according  to officials, the beneficiary or beneficiary representative must develop a  provider back-up plan under some circumstances, such as when having a  back-up plan is required by the rules of the program.", "All four selected states reported that the state tracked information about  critical incidents involving Medicaid beneficiaries receiving PCS; however,  what information they tracked and the type of data system or systems  varied by state and in some cases within states by PCS program. With  the exception of State Plan PCS, states are required to implement  processes or systems to address critical incidents in PCS programs.  One way states can attempt to assure that beneficiary safeguards are  working is by tracking information such as the frequency and type of  reported incidents. Tracking incident information can also promote  beneficiary safety by making it easier for states to identify trends or  patterns that can lead to improved program safety.", "All four selected states reported that they tracked information on incidents  that they define as critical, and all four states\u2019 definitions of critical  incidents included, at a minimum, beneficiary abuse and neglect.  California, Maryland, and some programs in Oregon and Texas, however,  added other types of incidents to their definitions of critical incidents, such  as accidental injuries. Two states, Oregon and Texas, defined critical  incidents differently under different types of PCS programs. For example,  Oregon operates PCS programs through separate departments that serve  different beneficiary populations. The department that serves  beneficiaries who are aged or those with physical disabilities includes  abuse, neglect, and exploitation. The department serving individuals who  have intellectual or developmental disabilities includes additional  incidents such as serious illness or accidents. Three states\u2014Maryland,  Oregon, and Texas\u2014identified and tracked in their data systems the type  of critical incident that occurred. How states tracked information also  varied by state, with two of the four states (California and Maryland) using  a single statewide case management data system to track critical  incidents, and the other two states (Oregon and Texas) using multiple  systems (see table 6).", "Critical incidents involving Medicaid PCS beneficiaries can be reported to  and investigated by entities other than state Medicaid agencies, such as  Adult Protective Services for adult beneficiaries. Adult Protective Services  officials are generally not located within a state\u2019s Medicaid office; as a  result, Medicaid staff may not learn of incidents involving Medicaid PCS  beneficiaries that are reported directly to Adult Protective Services unless  Adult Protective Services staff share this information. We asked Medicaid  officials in each of the four selected states about the extent to which state  Adult Protective Services staff share information with state Medicaid staff  when Adult Protective Services investigates a case involving a Medicaid  PCS beneficiary. California officials reported that while there is no policy  requiring Adult Protective Services to share such information, such  communication is allowed. Maryland officials reported that there is no  statewide policy requiring Adult Protective Services to communicate  information and findings to Medicaid case managers, but that they can  generally find out whether an allegation is substantiated or not. Oregon  officials told us that there can be an ongoing dialog between Adult  Protective Services and case managers about beneficiaries, and it is  expected that Adult Protective Services will notify a beneficiary\u2019s case  manager when there is a substantiated finding against the beneficiary\u2019s  attendant. The case manager then notifies the Medicaid program to take  action against the attendant. In Texas, Adult Protective Services reports  the results of its investigations to Medicaid officials at the originating state  agency, according to state officials.", "Medicaid officials in each of the four selected states described whether  they permitted the state Medicaid agency to terminate an attendant if the  attendant poses a risk to the beneficiary yet has not been convicted of a  crime.

For example,  for at least some PCS programs, two states required beneficiaries to sign  timesheets, two states used electronic visit verification timekeeping  systems, and all four states performed quality assurance reviews for  some PCS programs to ensure billed services are received. Among our  four selected states, Maryland and Texas used electronic verification  systems in at least some programs, Oregon is in the process of acquiring  a system, and California does not use such a system (see table 7).", "Electronic visit verification timekeeping systems are newer, technology- based systems that electronically record when attendants begin and end  providing services to a beneficiary. Such systems may include features  to verify the attendant\u2019s location and make sure the attendant is in the  beneficiary\u2019s home. These systems require a device like a phone,  computer, or other device to track attendants\u2019 start and stop times. For  example, HHS reported on one electronic visit verification system. The  system relied on attendants clocking in and out via a telephone in the  beneficiary\u2019s home, and if the attendant did not clock in within 15 minutes  of the scheduled visit, an electronic alert was sent to the provider  agency.", "Private Sector Use of Electronic Visit  Verification Systems  Three out of the four private entities we spoke  with cited electronic visit verification, among  other safeguards, as a key practice that helps  both to keep clients safe and to ensure that  billed serviced are provided. Some private  sector entities we spoke with said they used  electronic visit verification to track and verify  attendants\u2019 check-in and check-out times to  help ensure that they are showing up to  deliver services. For example, the systems  allowed one entity to compare hours billed to  those worked, and another entity to review  daily log notes, such as the tasks performed,  to gather details on specific shifts. An  electronic visit verification system can  generate alerts when an attendant\u2019s time-in or  time-out recordings fail to match a client\u2019s  schedule or the scheduled duration of  services, when an attendant records visit  information in a location other than a client\u2019s  home, or when the tasks performed do not  match the signed authorization. One private  entity we spoke with uses a system that has  more sophisticated capabilities; for example,  attendants can use the system to report  clients\u2019 changes in health condition\u2014such as  a decline in the client\u2019s ability to perform an  activity of daily living\u2014and can send  messages to a third party, such as the client\u2019s  case manager, when further assistance or  consultation is needed.  One private sector entity reported that  electronic visit verification decreased costs.  An official from this entity stated that the  technology helped reduce costs related to  travel time by 10 percent because the system  resulted in more accurate time and travel  reporting. The official stated that the  technology creates efficiencies; for example, it  streamlines processes, allowing  administrative staff to focus on quality rather  than on paperwork. In addition to direct  financial savings, this official believed that  electronic visit verification may deter people  with nefarious intentions from seeking home  care employment because of the level of  monitoring these systems add.", "Medicaid officials from Maryland and Texas described the benefits they  found using electronic verification systems:", "Maryland Medicaid officials cited four benefits of electronic visit  verification: (1) more accurate and valid reporting of time; (2) realizing  cost savings because the state is only paying for services when the  attendant has verified through the system that they are in the  beneficiary\u2019s home; (3) collecting data, which allows the state to more  easily review trends and identify potential service issues; and (4)  absolving beneficiaries from the responsibility for verifying that an  attendant\u2019s timesheets are correct.", "Texas Medicaid officials reported they were motivated to use  electronic visit verification because fraud is a concern, noting that the  system captures when attendants actually start and stop providing  services. Officials explained that attendants could easily record on  paper timesheets the times they were supposed to provide services  instead of the times they actually provided services. Officials reported  that the use of an electronic visit verification system has saved the  state money.", "Oregon Medicaid officials reported that the state is in the process of  acquiring an electronic visit verification system and anticipate that the  system will be able to track attendants\u2019 time more accurately than paper  timesheets. California Medicaid officials reported that they have no  current plans to use electronic visit verification. California officials  explained that they do not think this is an effective option because a high  percentage of attendants in the state\u2019s PCS program are friends or family  members, some of whom live with the beneficiary.", "Three of the four private-sector entities we interviewed named electronic  visit verification systems as a key practice for ensuring billed services are  provided (see Text Box, \u201cPrivate Sector Use of Electronic Visit Verification  Systems\u201d). Other practices used by these entities include: communicating  with clients and their families, conducting unannounced monitoring visits,  training attendants, and conducting attendant background checks.

CMS has not  issued the guidance directing states to use HCBS Waiver guidance as  of August 2016, but rather, CMS regional office staff communicate the  requirements for HCBS Waivers to those states requesting approval  for State Plan HCBS programs, according to CMS officials.", "However, we found that CMS\u2019s efforts have not addressed the significant  differences across federal program requirements specific to PCS related  to beneficiary safety and ensuring that billed services are provided. For  example, states implementing an HCBS Waiver program or a State Plan  HCBS program must describe to CMS how the state Medicaid agency will  determine that it is assuring the health and welfare of beneficiaries. To do  so, states must describe: the activities or processes related to assessing  or evaluating the program; which entity will conduct the activities; the  entity responsible for reviewing the results; and the frequency at which activities are conducted. In contrast, this level of detail on the evaluation  process is not required for states implementing a State Plan PCS  program or a Community First Choice program.", "Similarly, states implementing an HCBS Waiver program or a State Plan  HCBS program must demonstrate that an incident management system is  in place, which requires states to document and provide the following  details to CMS:  indicate whether the state operates a critical incident reporting and  management process;  list and define critical incidents;  identify entities or individuals who must report critical incidents and  the reporting method (for example, phone or web-based reporting  system);  specify the timeframe within which critical incidents must be reported  and the entity to which reports are made for each type of incident;  identify the entities responsible for evaluating reports of critical  incidents and how the incidents are evaluated;  identify the entity responsible for following up on investigations of  critical incidents and the time frame for completing an investigation;  and explain the process and time frames for informing the beneficiary and  other relevant parties of the results of an investigation.", "In contrast, states implementing a State Plan PCS program or a  Community First Choice program are not required to provide similar  information on their critical incident management process but, more  generally, are required to describe their \u201cprocess for the mandatory  reporting, investigating and resolution of allegations of neglect, abuse, or  exploitation.\u201d The State Plan PCS program does not have incident  management reporting requirements. Other significant differences among  PCS program requirements relate to ensuring that billed services are  provided. States implementing HCBS Waiver programs and State Plan  HCBS programs are required to provide evidence that the state is only  paying claims when services are actually rendered, while the State Plan  PCS and Community First Choice programs are not required to do so.", "See table 8 for state Medicaid program requirements for ensuring the  health and welfare of PCS beneficiaries and that billed services are  provided.", "Based on numerous reviews of state PCS programs, the HHS OIG  recommended that CMS issue regulations to reduce the significant  variation in states\u2019 PCS requirements for documenting claims for payment  for services, supervision of attendants, and attendant qualification  standards. Harmonizing requirements across similar programs is also consistent with federal internal control standards. These standards state  that agencies should establish control activities that appropriately cover  the objectives and risks of an entity\u2019s operations. Further, risk  management standards published by an international standard-setting  organization suggest that a consistent process and comprehensive  framework can help to ensure that risk is managed effectively, efficiently,  and coherently. In the case of PCS, a consistent internal control process  could include having policies and processes in place that would provide  comparable assurances for protecting Medicaid beneficiaries from harm  and ensuring that state and federal funds are paid only when services are  actually provided, regardless of the program in which beneficiaries are  enrolled.", "In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act directed HHS  to take steps to improve the coordination among and regulation of all  providers of home- and community-based services\u2014which includes PCS  provided under different federal authorities\u2014to achieve a more consistent  administration of policies and procedures across programs. Our prior  review of selected states\u2019 implementation of HCBS options also suggests  that states could benefit from more harmonization of HCBS guidance, as  officials in selected states noted the complexity of operating multiple  programs. In that review, officials from one state reported that the  complexity resulted in a siloed approach, with different enrollment,  oversight, and reporting requirements for each program. The  administration and understanding of the programs available to  beneficiaries is difficult for state staff and beneficiaries, according to  officials in another state. The officials indicated that they would prefer  CMS issue guidance on how states could operate the different HCBS  program types together, rather than issuing guidance on each program  separately.", "CMS officials told us the agency is not currently taking additional steps to  harmonize requirements\u2014within the limits of the various statutes\u2014in response to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, but may  make federal guidance more similar in the future. First, officials said that  they want to provide states with flexibility to implement programs that  meet each state\u2019s needs. Second, CMS officials said that the statutes  authorizing the programs are different. CMS officials also stated that in  the future, where the statute and regulations are similar across programs,  they will work on making federal policy the same or similar. In addition,  officials stated that when CMS identifies a good oversight policy or  practice being used by a state for one type of PCS program, CMS can  discuss best practices that may be applicable to other authorities, but  CMS cannot suggest that such best practices are required.", "In addition to creating complexities for states and others in understanding  federal requirements governing different types of HCBS programs,  including PCS, the differing federal requirements across the different  types of PCS programs may result in significant differences in beneficiary  safeguards and fiscal oversight:", "Beneficiaries may experience different health and welfare safeguards  depending on the program in which they are enrolled. For example, in  one state we reviewed, the state requires quarterly or biannual  monitoring of beneficiaries for most of its PCS programs. For a State  Plan PCS program, the state requires only annual monitoring  contacts. Officials told us that the reason for this difference was due to  the lack of a requirement that states provide assurances to CMS that  they will safeguard beneficiaries\u2019 health and welfare. CMS may also  have fewer assurances that similar beneficiaries\u2019 safety is protected.  Three of the four states we reviewed\u2014Maryland, Oregon, and  Texas\u2014transitioned coverage of PCS for beneficiaries who need an  institutional level of care from PCS programs with relatively more  stringent federal beneficiary safety requirements to programs with  relatively less stringent requirements. Specifically, the states  transitioned PCS from HCBS Waiver programs to Community First  Choice programs. In doing so, state officials in the three states  reported that the state chose to apply the same quality assurance  measures to services received under both the HCBS Waiver program  and the Community First Choice program. Officials in two of the states  said that maintaining the processes was the best way to ensure safety  for beneficiaries. The states were not required to apply the same  quality measures across programs, and CMS has no assurance that  states that transition PCS from HCBS Waivers to Community First  Choice in the future will make the same decisions.", "States can use different processes for each PCS program to ensure  that billed services are actually provided, and some programs may not  be subject to federal PCS requirements explicitly in this regard. For  example, in one state we reviewed, steps taken to ensure billed  services are provided under some types of PCS programs are not  required in another of the state\u2019s programs. The state reported that it  used its quality assurance process in some of its PCS programs to  meet with and verify service delivery with the beneficiary in an effort to  ensure that billed services are provided. For example, in one PCS  program, a supervisor must visit the beneficiary and document  whether the attendant is delivering the authorized PCS tasks. In  training materials, CMS recommended states take such an approach  to detect fraud in PCS programs.

CMS has not collected  information states are required to prepare on two PCS programs that  would inform the agency of the effects that certain PCS programs are  having on beneficiaries\u2019 well-being.

The programs are operated within different  departments of the Texas\u2019s Health and Human Services Commission,  which operates one of two State Plan PCS programs, while one of its  operating departments, the Department of Aging and Disability Services,  operates another State Plan PCS program, Community First Choice, and  the 1929(b) program.", "Texas\u2019s PCS programs deliver PCS both through provider agencies and  through a participant-directed model. Participants in each PCS program  who wish to exercise more control over their services may operate under  a set of requirements known as the consumer-directed services option.  According to officials, many of the PCS services in Texas are now being  provided by a managed care company (We excluded this type of  arrangement from our study).", "Texas is the most recent state to adopt the Community First Choice  program, as of April 2016. The state transitioned all PCS out of five of its  HCBS Waivers into Community First Choice. In so doing, Texas  maintained certain features of four of the five programs, including  retaining the same service providers, such as attendants. For example,  Texas transitioned the PCS in its HCBS Waiver program called the  Community Living Assistance and Support Services into Community First  Choice. This HCBS Waiver had served beneficiaries who have  developmental disabilities. After the transition to Community First Choice,  beneficiaries receive generally the same services through the same  providers, and the claims for the services are attributed to Community  First Choice."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the Department of Health & Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact name above, Tim Bushfield, Assistant Director;  Anna Bonelli, Analyst-in-Charge; Christine Davis; Barbara Hansen; Laurie  Pachter; Vikki Porter; Bryant Torres; and Jennifer Whitworth also made  key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": ["Personal care attendants help older and disabled Americans with daily tasks\u2014such as bathing or eating.

We recommended reducing that variation."]}
