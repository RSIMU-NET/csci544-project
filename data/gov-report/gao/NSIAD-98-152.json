The last production aircraft was delivered in November 1997, and all aircraft are scheduled to be updated to the latest defined (block 30) configuration by July 2000. This report discusses deficiencies that must be corrected to achieve Air Force objectives for the B-2A, additional costs to correct the deficiencies, and the B-2A modification schedule."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force began development of the B-2A in 1981 and reported on June 30, 1997, after 16 years, that the development and the initial operational test and evaluation had been completed. The Air Force reports of the initial operational tests were completed in November 1997.", "In 1986, the Air Force estimated that B-2A development could be completed for $14.5 billion, including a 4-year, 3,600-hour flight test program scheduled at that time to end in 1993. The flight test program ended June 30, 1997, and the estimated cost of the development program had grown to over $24 billion and the flight test program to about  5,000 flight test hours over 8 years. The development and testing programs were extended because of Air Force changes in the B-2 requirements and various technical problems.", "Major changes and problems contributing to the delays included (1) making the B-2A\u2019s primary mission conventional rather than nuclear; (2) redesigning the aircraft to satisfy an added requirement to penetrate adversary air space at low altitudes; (3) difficulty in manufacturing test aircraft, resulting in late delivery of partially complete test aircraft; (4) difficulties achieving acceptable radar cross-section readings on test aircraft, which resulted in significant redesigning and retesting of certain components; and (5) correction of deficiencies in the aft deck structure because of the unanticipated effects of engine exhaust.", "Even though numerous problems hindered the scheduled completion of B-2A development, production began with no flight testing having been completed. This resulted in substantial overlap of development and production. Test and production aircraft were delivered that did not fully meet the Air Force requirements, and a 5-year post-delivery modification program was initiated to update all aircraft to the block 30 configuration. Since production began in 1986, the planned number of B-2As was reduced from 133 to 21 aircraft and both the total development and the average unit procurement costs increased. Table 1 shows the change in estimated total and unit cost from 1986 to 1998.", "The last two of the 21 B-2As were delivered to the Air Force in the  block 30 configuration. The major effort remaining in the B-2A acquisition program is modification of the other 19 B-2As to the block 30 configuration, scheduled for completion in July 2000. Through April 1998, six B-2As have been delivered in, or modified to, the block 30 configuration and were operational at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri. Ultimately, the Air Force plans to have 21 B-2As, of which 16 will be available for missions (2 squadrons of 8 aircraft), and 5 will be in various maintenance and repair cycles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Deficiencies Must Be Corrected to Achieve Air Force Objectives", "paragraphs": ["To test the operational performance of the B-2A, the Air Force measured B-2A performance against five broad operational objectives that were derived from documented Air Force operational requirements and concepts related to nuclear and conventional missions. Figure 1 identifies these operational objectives and the key elements of each that were included in the operational testing.", "Although test results indicate that B-2As generally met operational objectives, four deficiencies were identified during testing that will limit or, under some circumstances, change the planned concepts for using the B-2As and slow its operational pace. These relate to mission planning, defensive avionics, low observable materials, and deployment.", "As the B-2A matures, numerous minor problems identified in the test reports are scheduled to be corrected or improved based on their relative priorities. These include corrections of minor software and hardware deficiencies, improvements to make crew operations easier or faster, improvements of selected radar modes, and relocation of certain buttons or displays. The corrections and improvements involve flight operation as well as maintenance and support of the aircraft."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Mission Planning System Still in Development", "paragraphs": ["Ground mission planning, which is still in development, is important to the successful employment of the B-2A because very precise mission routes must be planned to maximize the benefits of the aircraft\u2019s low observable features. Mission planning for the B-2A, done with the automated Air Force Mission Support System (AFMSS), currently takes more time than planned. This will limit the Air Force\u2019s ability to rapidly strike targets and sustain operations.", "The goal of the AFMSS development program is to produce a mission planning system that can provide specific B-2A mission plans in 8 hours. Testing as of June 30, 1997, concluded that the system frequently malfunctioned, was not flexible or user friendly, and was complex and time consuming to use. Air Force operators at Whiteman Air Force Base told us that the developmental version of AFMSS had so many failures that they estimated it would take 60 hours to plan a conventional mission and 192 hours to plan a nuclear mission.", "AFMSS is an acquisition program separate from the B-2A and is being developed to support all Air Force combat aircraft. Interface of AFMSS with the B-2A began in 1994. According to the operational test report, AFMSS is a complex system made up of separate subsystems developed by different contractors. The Air Force has received various developmental versions of AFMSS subsystems, and additional upgrades to software and hardware are planned in fiscal years 1998 and 1999. The Air Force expects these upgrades to support preparation of mission plans in 8 hours by the third quarter of fiscal year 1999."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Defensive Avionics Do Not Work as Planned", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force spent over $740 million to develop the defensive system for the B-2A; however, test reports concluded that this system is unsatisfactory. The lack of an effective defensive avionics system could affect the B-2A\u2019s survivability in selected situations because it is supposed to provide B-2A crews with information on the location of threats, both known and unknown that they may encounter during a mission. Limited funds and time are available to correct all the deficiencies in the defensive system. The Air Force plans some software upgrades that are intended to provide the defensive system with a limited but useful capability.", "Air Force officials said the cost of making the defensive system meet originally planned capability is unaffordable at this time. Air Force officials told us that all the functions originally planned for the system are not required to successfully carry out the planned B-2A missions. The operational test report further stated that, although the defensive system is rated unsatisfactory, the system\u2019s deficiencies do not prevent planning and executing B-2A missions. The test report indicated that the B-2A\u2019s low observability to adversary threat systems permits use of other effective tactics that could ensure its effective employment.", "The defensive system is supposed to provide the crew information on enemy threat systems to enhance B-2A survivability. Known threat locations are included in computer files prior to the mission. The system is to correlate these with the actual threats as the B-2A flies its mission, but it is also to identify and locate unknown threats that pop-up during a mission. However, this system does not work as planned, limiting the utility of information provided the crew during critical portions of expected B-2 missions. For example, test reports indicate that the defensive system provided inaccurate or cluttered information to the crew and had unacceptably high workloads for the operators.", "The number and significance of problems with the defensive system were not identified until near the end of the flight test program, leaving Air Force program managers little time to correct problems. Flight testing, where most of the problems were discovered, did not begin for the defensive system until February 1993, almost 4 years after the flight test program started in July 1989 and almost 2 years after other avionics began flight testing in June 1991. According to Air Force officials and an independent review team, several issues contributed to the deficiencies and their discovery late in the developmental and test processes. These reasons included (1) development and testing began late, (2) successful early laboratory tests could not be repeated in flight tests, (3) test results from flight tests were not completely analyzed before tests were continued, (4) the contract provided incentives to move ahead with development rather than correct problems, (5) there was too much confidence that upgrades to computer software would solve the problems, and (6) there were inadequate engineering controls to prevent the overoptimistic view and approach to this development effort.", "The Air Force\u2019s cost estimate does not include the cost of correcting all deficiencies but does cover some improvements in the defensive system. The Air Force plans to develop software changes that are scheduled to be available for use by 2000, if tests demonstrate the changes are effective in providing a useful capability. Air Force officials indicated some changes have been tested by operational crews with good success. These software changes are intended to provide capabilities that are useful but less than were expected in the original defensive system design. The Air Force believes these changes will meet their requirements. To achieve the original design would require more costly upgrades, including new computer processors. Expensive hardware upgrades are not included in current Air Force plans to enhance the B-2A.", "Historically, defensive avionics have experienced significant problems during development. The B-1B bomber had serious deficiencies with its defensive avionics and the Air Force is still working to provide an effective defensive capability for the B-1B. Other defensive avionics programs, like the Air Force\u2019s ALQ-135 jammer and the Navy\u2019s Airborne Self-Protection Jammer, also experienced costly development problems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Reliability and Maintainability of Low Observable Materials", "paragraphs": ["Low observable materials and features on the B-2A frequently fail, requiring high amounts of maintenance. They also have time-consuming and environmentally controlled repair processes and long cure times for the materials repaired. This reduces the time aircraft are available for operational use, which keeps mission capable rates below the Air Force requirement. These problems increase the amount of time it takes to prepare a B-2A for its next combat flight, potentially reducing the number of sorties that could be flown in a given period of time.", "During operational testing, low observable materials and features accounted for 40 percent of unscheduled maintenance and 31 percent of the maintenance hours to repair the aircraft. Aircraft operating at Whiteman Air Force Base experienced results similar to those in the operational test. During a visit to Whiteman Air Force Base, we observed a block 20 B-2A aircraft after a 10-hour flight. The aircraft had damaged tape, caulk, paint, and heat tiles, all low observable materials. In addition, we observed hydraulic fluid leaks beneath the aircraft that further damaged tape and caulk. The Air Force is incorporating some new low observable tape materials into the block 30 aircraft, which should reduce some maintenance; however, according to Air Force officials, this improvement will not be adequate to achieve the operational pace currently planned for the aircraft.", "In addition to the frequent failure of these materials, the processes to repair them are time consuming and require an environmentally controlled repair facility. Cure times on some of the low observable tapes and caulks, items that most frequently fail, can be as long as 72 hours, but most materials require 24 or more hours.", "The poor durability and extensive maintenance required of low observable materials is an important factor keeping the B-2As from achieving desired mission capable rates\u2014the Air Force measure of an aircraft fleet\u2019s availability to perform its assigned missions. At maturity, the Air Force goal for a mission capable rate is 77 percent. On average, the mission capable rate in calendar year 1997, when including the effects of low observable features, was 36 percent, less than half the goal.", "The Air Force has prepared a comprehensive plan to develop, test, and install new and improved low observable materials, and to improve repair processes, reduce cure times, and develop new diagnostic tools that should allow the B-2A to meet operational requirements. The plan extends through 2005 and shows that funds required for research and development, procurement, and operations and maintenance could total about $190 million, of which $144 million is not in the current cost estimate."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Environmental Shelters for Deployment", "paragraphs": ["The operational test report states that the block 30 B-2A aircraft must be sheltered to protect it from weather and provide a suitable environment in which to maintain low observables. The Air Force is studying options for providing shelters, including the purchase of portable shelters and use of existing facilities.", "The Air Force plans to buy a portable deployment shelter as a test article to determine if the portable shelters will be adequate to protect and maintain the B-2A\u2019s low observable features. If the Air Force buys the shelters, at a minimum it will require 17\u20141 training shelter and 1 operational shelter for each of the 16 primary mission aircraft.", "Air Force officials stated they are dedicated to buying the deployment shelters but have not determined how many shelters are needed to support B-2A deployments or the shelter configuration. In addition, they said funding sources have not been identified, but the shelters will likely cost a total of between $15 and $25 million, depending upon the quantity purchased.", "Air Force officials said they have begun to practice deploying the B-2A and it is likely additional requirements will be identified when this happens. The Air Force completed one exercise, deploying two B-2As to Guam, in March 1998, and plans two more in 1998. Air Force officials advised us that the B-2As performed well in the March 1998 deployment, but an official report has not been issued on the results as of April 1998."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Additional Funds Will Be Required to Complete the Program", "paragraphs": ["The fiscal year 1999 B-2A cost estimate indicates it will cost $44.3 billion then-year dollars to complete development, procurement, and modification.

Both the Air Force and Northrop Grumman were trying to complete modifications based on schedules that were 3 to 6 months ahead of the contract schedule. Because of delays and problems, these accelerated schedules have been discarded. As of April 1998, Northrop Grumman had delivered three modified aircraft later than, and one modified aircraft earlier than, the contract schedule. The Air Force is assessing schedule performance and studying the funding implications of a schedule slip. At this time, the Air Force believes adequate funds are available to complete the modifications.", "The Air Force is also assessing a planned schedule change that could significantly delay the modification program for one aircraft. This change would be to accommodate the need to provide an aircraft for flight testing planned upgrades. Until the assessment is complete, Air Force officials said it is not possible to determine if there will be a cost impact on the modification program.", "All four block 30 aircraft delivered from the modification line have a significant number of deficiencies. Air Force officials stated that some of these deficiencies are not operationally critical and will be corrected during regular scheduled maintenance activities. They said a team will be located at Whiteman Air Force Base, Missouri, to correct some of the deficiencies, and others will be corrected during normal aircraft maintenance cycles to maintain the aircraft in active operational service.

DOD stated the B-2A is projected to meet full operational capability by the third quarter of fiscal year 1999 as a \u201cbaseline program\u201d within currently programmed funding. DOD, therefore, states no additional reporting is required on baseline requirements. DOD defines the baseline program as being a block 30 aircraft. The DOD position assumes all operational problems discussed in this report will be resolved without additional cost, but, until these deficiencies have been proven to be corrected, some cost uncertainty remains. In addition, as this report points out, the Air Force has accepted the block 30 aircraft with less performance in some areas than originally planned in the baseline program.", "DOD agreed there is a need to identify to Congress future efforts and funding requirements to upgrade current B-2As. DOD said it is developing a long-range plan for upgrades to the bomber force and that funding requirements will be included in the normal budgeting process.
