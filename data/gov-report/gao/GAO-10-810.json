The Children's Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009 required GAO to examine the extent to which states' rates are actuarially sound. GAO assessed CMS oversight of states' compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements and efforts to ensure the quality of data used to set rates.

Variation in CMS regional office practices contributed to this inconsistency in oversight. For example, GAO found significant gaps in CMS's oversight of two states. 1) First, the agency had not reviewed Tennessee's rate setting for multiple years and only determined that the state was not in compliance with the requirements through the course of GAO's work. According to CMS officials, Tennessee received approximately $5 billion a year in federal funds for rates that GAO determined had not been certified by an actuary, which is a regulatory requirement. 2) Second, CMS had not completed a full review of Nebraska's rate setting since the actuarial soundness requirements became effective, and therefore may have provided federal funds for rates that were not in compliance with all of the requirements. Variation in a number of CMS regional office practices contributed to these gaps and other inconsistencies in the agency's oversight of states' rate setting. For example, regional offices varied in the extent to which they tracked state compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements, their interpretations of how extensive a review of a state's rate setting was needed, and their determinations regarding sufficient evidence for meeting the actuarial soundness requirements. As a result of our review, CMS took a number of steps that may address some of the variation that contributed to inconsistent oversight, such as requiring regional office officials to use a detailed checklist when reviewing states' rate setting. However, additional steps are necessary to prevent further gaps in oversight and additional federal funds from being paid for rates that are not in compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements. CMS's efforts to ensure the quality of the data used to set rates were generally limited to requiring assurances from states and health plans--efforts that did not provide the agency with enough information to ensure the quality of the data used. CMS's regulations do not include standards for the type, amount, or age of the data used to set rates, and states are not required to report to CMS on the quality of the data. When reviewing states' descriptions of the data used to set rates, CMS officials focused primarily on the appropriateness of the data rather than their reliability. With limited information on data quality, CMS cannot ensure that states' managed care rates are appropriate, which places billions of federal and state dollars at risk for misspending. States and other sources have information on the quality of data used for rate setting--information that CMS could obtain. In addition, CMS could conduct or require periodic audits of data used to set rates; CMS is required to conduct such audits for the Medicare managed care program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS implement a mechanism to track state compliance with the requirements, clarify guidance on rate-setting reviews, and make use of information on data quality in overseeing states' rate setting.

Moreover, Medicaid\u2014a joint federal-state program that finances health  care for certain categories of low-income individuals\u2014is expanding. With  the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) in  March 2010, states will expand coverage under the Medicaid program to  an estimated 18 million additional people. Expansions of Medicaid are  likely to increase the number of people enrolled in and amount of  spending for managed care, making effective federal oversight of this large  and complex component of the Medicaid program particularly critical.", "The potential benefits and risks of Medicaid managed care are substantial.  Managed care is designed to ensure the provision of appropriate health  care services in a cost-efficient manner. However, capitation payments,  which are made prospectively to health plans to provide or arrange for  services for Medicaid enrollees, can create an incentive to underserve or  deny access to needed care. Thus, appropriate safeguards are needed to  ensure access to care and appropriate payment in Medicaid managed care.  One such safeguard included in federal law is the requirement that states\u2019  capitation rates be actuarially sound. In 2002, the Centers for Medicare &  Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency within the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS) that oversees states\u2019 Medicaid programs, issued  regulations defining actuarially sound rates as those that are (1) developed  in accordance with generally accepted actuarial principles and practices;  (2) appropriate for the populations to be covered and the services to be  furnished; and (3) certified as meeting applicable regulatory requirements  by qualified actuaries. The regulations also specify the documentation  states are required to submit to CMS regional offices to demonstrate  compliance with the requirements, including a description of their rate- setting methodology and the data used to set rates. In 2003, CMS finalized  a detailed checklist that its regional office staff could use in their reviews  of states\u2019 rate setting and for states and states\u2019 actuaries to consider in  setting rates.", "The Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009  directed us to examine the extent to which state Medicaid managed care  payment rates are actuarially sound.

These offices were  responsible for reviewing rate setting and approving rates for 26 of the   34 states with comprehensive managed care programs, were  geographically diverse, and oversaw states with programs that ranged in  size and accounted for about 85 percent of national managed care  enrollment. Our review of CMS\u2019s oversight efforts included completing a  structured review of 28 CMS files documenting rate-setting reviews  completed as of October 31, 2009. (See app. I for a summary of the  criteria we used to select the 6 CMS regional offices and the methodology  for our review of CMS files.) To supplement our review, we interviewed  officials in CMS\u2019s central office and the 6 selected CMS regional offices to  obtain information regarding steps taken by CMS to ensure the actuarial  soundness of rates; and we reviewed regional office standard operating  procedures. We also interviewed Medicaid officials from 11 of the states  overseen by the 6 selected CMS regional offices to obtain their views of,  and experiences with, CMS\u2019s oversight of state compliance with the  actuarial soundness requirements. These states were geographically  diverse and had managed care programs that varied in size.

In addition, in  interviews with officials from CMS\u2019s central office and the selected  regional offices, we asked about steps CMS takes to ensure data quality,  including what information CMS requires states to include in their rate- setting submissions to demonstrate the appropriateness and reliability of  the data used to set rates and whether any audits or studies of rate setting  had been performed. We also assessed, as part of our review of CMS files,  the information provided in states\u2019 rate-setting submissions about steps  taken to ensure data quality, including statements made by states\u2019  actuaries. In interviews with state Medicaid officials, we asked about their  processes to ensure data quality and their experiences with CMS oversight  of data quality. We also reviewed relevant audit findings from the  Washington State Auditor\u2019s Office.

States\u2019 processes for developing rates may vary in a number of  ways, including the type and time frames of data they use as the basis for  setting rates, referred to as the base-year data, and what approach they  use to negotiate rates with health plans. After rates are developed, an  actuary certifies the rates as actuarially sound for a defined period of time,  typically 1 year. In order to receive federal funds for its managed care  program, a state is required to submit its rate-setting methodology and  rates to CMS for review and approval.

In addition,  the regulations include a requirement that when states use data from  health plans as the basis for rates they must have plan executives certify the accuracy and completeness of their data. The regulations do not   include standards for the type, amount, or age of the data that states mayuse in setting rates. The regulations also do not include standards for the reasonableness or adequacy of rates. In the preamble to the final rule, CMS noted that health plans were better able to determine the reasonableness  and adequacy of rates when deciding whether to contr act with a state.", "In July 2003, CMS finalized a detailed checklist that regional office staff  could use when reviewing states\u2019 rate-setting submissions for compliance  with the actuarial soundness requirements and that states and states\u2019  actuaries could use when developing rates. The checklist includes  citations to, and a description of, each regulatory requirement; guidance  on what constitutes state compliance with the requirement; and spaces for  the CMS official to check whether each requirement was met and cite  evidence from the state\u2019s submission for compliance with the requirement.  The checklist also provides guidance on the level of review that should  occur for different types of rate changes. When the state is developing a  new rate, or using new actuarial techniques or data to change previously  approved rates, the checklist indicates a full review should be done, which  entails reviewing the state\u2019s submission for compliance with all of the  requirements covered in the checklist. For adjustments to rates that were  previously approved as meeting the regulations, the checklist indicates a  partial review should be done; a partial review focuses on a few key  requirements in the checklist, such as ensuring that the state has included  a certification of rates from a qualified actuary. As of June 2010, CMS was  in the process of revising the checklist. One of the planned changes was to  emphasize the need for more complete encounter data because CMS  officials indicated that the agency has determined that encounter data that  do not include pricing information are not sufficient for setting rates. CMS  expects to complete the checklist revisions by November 2010. (See   table 1 for a summary of the sections in CMS\u2019s checklist.)", "According to CMS officials, the regional officials responsible for  conducting rate-setting reviews may have a financial background, but are  not actuaries. Officials also noted that CMS\u2019s OACT, which provides  actuarial advice to other offices within CMS, is generally not involved with  Medicaid rate-setting reviews.

First, CMS had not reviewed one state\u2019s (Tennessee) rate  setting for compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements or  approved the state\u2019s rates. In 2007, Tennessee began transitioning its  managed care program, which included all of the state\u2019s approximately   1 million Medicaid enrollees, to risk contracts that were subject to the  actuarial soundness requirements. Since moving to risk contracts, the  state submitted at least two actuarial reports to CMS\u2019s Atlanta regional  office indicating the program change, but these documents did not trigger  a CMS review. These reports did not include actuarial certifications, and  Tennessee officials confirmed that the state\u2019s rates had not been certified  by an actuary, which is a regulatory requirement. As a result, according  to CMS officials, Tennessee received, and is continuing to receive,  approximately $5 billion a year in federal funds for rates that we  determined had not been certified by an actuary or assessed by CMS for  compliance with the requirements. Based on issues we raised during our  review, CMS determined that Tennessee was not in compliance with the  actuarial soundness requirements and, as of June 2010, was working to  bring the state into compliance.", "Second, while CMS officials said that all states should have had a full  review of rate setting after the actuarial soundness requirements became  effective in August 2002, it appeared that CMS officials had not completed  a full rate-setting review for Nebraska. CMS had no documentation of its  last full review of Nebraska\u2019s rate setting, but officials believed that the  last full review was completed in 2002. According to Nebraska officials,  the state last made significant changes to its rate setting for the state fiscal  year beginning in 2001, which according to criteria in CMS\u2019s checklist  would have triggered a full CMS review. Based on what CMS and Nebraska  officials told us, CMS\u2019s last full review was likely done before the actuarial  requirements became effective. As a result, Nebraska received federal  funds for more than 7 years for rates that may not have been in  compliance with all of the actuarial soundness requirements.", "In addition to these gaps in oversight, we found inconsistencies in the  reviews CMS completed. In instances when CMS did a full rate-setting  review, it was unclear whether CMS consistently ensured that states met  all of the actuarial soundness requirements. We found evidence that the  rates in all 28 of the CMS files we reviewed were certified by a member of  the American Academy of Actuaries, as is required by the regulations.  However, the extent to which CMS ensured state compliance with other  aspects of the actuarial soundness requirements\u2014such as the requirement  that rates be based only on services covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid  plan or costs related to providing these services\u2014was unclear. For  example, in nearly a third of the files we reviewed, or 8 of 28 files, CMS  officials did not use the rate-setting checklist to document their review;  therefore we could not determine whether CMS ensured that states were  in compliance with all of the requirements. In 17 of the 20 remaining files  where the CMS official used the checklist, the official cited evidence of the  state\u2019s compliance for some requirements, but not others.", "When officials did cite evidence, the evidence did not always appear to  meet the requirements. For example, one of the requirements in the  regulations is that states provide an assurance that rates are based only on  services covered under the state\u2019s Medicaid plan or costs related to  providing these services. Of the 19 files where CMS officials cited evidence  of such an assurance, we were unable to locate the assurance in 2 of the  files. Another requirement is that states include a comparison of  expenditures under the previous year\u2019s rates to those projected under the  proposed rates. In the 15 files where CMS cited evidence of the  comparison of expenditures, we did not find a comparison that appeared  to meet the requirement in 2 of the files. See table 2 for more information  on the extent to which evidence was cited in the CMS files we reviewed.", "Finally, CMS did not consistently review states\u2019 rate setting for compliance  with the actuarial soundness requirements prior to the new rates being  implemented. In 20 of 28 files we reviewed, we found that CMS completed  its review of rate setting after the state had begun implementing the  proposed rates; that is, after the effective date of the proposed rates. CMS  officials told us that a variety of factors could delay the approval of rates,  including states submitting a request for approval after implementing the  rates. CMS officials further explained that they did not consider a state to  be out of compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements until the  end of the federal fiscal year quarter in which the state implemented the  unapproved rates. Of the 20 files where CMS approved rates after the  state implemented them, 13 had rates that were approved more than   3 months after the state implemented the rates, which means that the rates  were approved after the end of the quarter in which they were  implemented. CMS officials confirmed that the agency generally  continued to provide federal funds for the states\u2019 managed care contracts  even in cases where the rates were not approved by the end of the quarter.  According to CMS officials, if the state failed to gain CMS approval or had  to lower the rates to achieve approval, then CMS would reduce future  federal reimbursement to account for federal funds paid to states for rates  that had not been approved. However, CMS reviewing states\u2019 rate setting  after states have begun implementing rates may result in changes to states\u2019  rate-setting methodology; this could lead to retroactive changes, including  reductions, in health plans\u2019 rates. The possibility of rates being decreased  retroactively may make it difficult for health plans to assess the  reasonableness and adequacy of rates when contracting with states, an  assessment that CMS relies on as a check of states\u2019 rate setting."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Variation in Practices among CMS Regional Offices Contributed to Inconsistent Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Variation in a number of regional office practices contributed to the  inconsistency in CMS\u2019s oversight of states\u2019 rate setting. Regional offices  varied in the extent to which they tracked state compliance with the  requirements, the extent to which they withheld federal funds, their  criteria for doing full and partial reviews of rate setting, and what they  considered to be sufficient evidence for meeting the requirements.", "Tracking compliance. Officials from all of the regional offices we spoke  with told us that they tracked basic information regarding the status of the  CMS review process, such as when a state\u2019s submission was received and  when CMS\u2019s approval letter was issued. However, based on our interviews  with CMS regional officials, we found that four of the six regional offices  did not track information that would allow them to identify states that  were not in compliance with actuarial soundness requirements, such as  the beginning and end dates of the rates specified by the actuary in the  certification. Officials from the remaining two regional offices, Kansas City  and San Francisco, told us they tracked the effective dates of approved  rates.", "Withholding funds. There was also variation among regional offices in  the conditions that had to be met in order for states to receive federal  funds. For example, officials from the San Francisco regional office told us  that they did not release federal funds to states until the states\u2019 managed  care contract and rates had been approved. Officials said that the office  had withheld funds in several cases until the state demonstrated  compliance with the requirements. For example, from October 2008  through April 2010, the San Francisco regional office reported withholding  a total of $302.7 million in federal funding for Hawaii because the state\u2019s  contracts and rates did not meet the actuarial soundness requirements. In  contrast, officials we interviewed from the Atlanta regional office said that  the office would release federal funds to a state even if the state\u2019s rates  had not yet been approved by CMS.", "Criteria for full and partial reviews. CMS regional officials had  different interpretations of when full versus partial reviews of rate setting  were necessary. For example, officials from the New York regional office  told us that they completed a full review for each rate-setting submission  received, regardless of the changes made to rates or rate setting. In  contrast, a Kansas City regional office official told us that she completed a  partial review in cases where the state adjusted the rates but had not  changed the data used as the basis for rates.", "Sufficient evidence for compliance. Regional office officials varied in  how they determined sufficient evidence for state compliance with certain  requirements. For example, for the requirement that rates are for  Medicaid-eligible individuals covered under the contract, officials from the  San Francisco regional office told us that, while they had verified  information provided by states on the populations covered under the rates,  they mainly looked for an assurance from the state that rates were for  eligible populations. In contrast, a Kansas City regional office official  explained that an assurance from the state alone would not be sufficient.  Rather, the official would require evidence of the eligible populations  included in, and excluded from, the rate-setting methodology.", "Other variations. Variations in other regional office practices may also  have contributed to the inconsistency in CMS oversight. For example,  management oversight of rate-setting reviews in regional offices varied. A  Kansas City regional official who reviews states\u2019 rate setting told us that,  prior to approving states\u2019 rates, she submitted memoranda outlining the  impact of states\u2019 proposed rate changes and the rationale for  recommending approval of the package to her regional office managers. In  contrast, officials from the New York regional office told us that most  officials responsible for reviewing and approving states\u2019 rate setting  worked independently and managers did not review a completed  checklist. Other variations in practices that may have had an effect on  CMS oversight included differences in training and standard procedures  for conducting and documenting reviews.", "As a result of our review, CMS took a number of steps that may address  some of the variation in regional office practices. For example:    officials from two regional offices told us that their offices were  implementing new standard procedures to address inconsistencies in  reviews identified through the course of GAO\u2019s work; and in December 2009, CMS began requiring that regional offices use the  checklist in reviewing all states\u2019 rate-setting submissions and assure  central office of its use before approving a state\u2019s rates.", "However, as we reported above, variations existed even when the  checklist was used, such as in the extent to which CMS officials using the  checklist cited evidence of compliance for each of the actuarial soundness  requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS\u2019s Limited Efforts Do Not Ensure the Quality of the Data Used to Set Rates", "paragraphs": ["CMS\u2019s efforts to ensure the quality of the data used to set rates were  generally limited to requiring assurances from states and health plans,  which did not provide the agency with sufficient information to ensure  data quality.

The regulations also specify that  states using data submitted by the health plans as the basis for rates must  require executives from the health plans to attest that the data are  accurate, complete, and truthful. The regulations do not include  requirements for the type, amount, or age of data or standards for the  reasonableness or adequacy of rates. Additionally, CMS does not require  states to submit documentation about the quality of the data used to set  rates. In our interviews with regional office officials, we found that, when  reviewing states\u2019 descriptions of the data used for rate setting, CMS  officials focused primarily on ensuring the appropriateness of the data  used by states to set rates rather than their reliability. This included  reviewing the specific services and populations included in the base-year  data or checking for assurances of appropriateness from the states\u2019  actuaries. CMS officials noted that if they had concerns with the quality  of a state\u2019s data they would ask the state questions.

Actuarial certification  does not ensure that the data used to set rates are reliable. In particular,   9 of the 28 files we reviewed included a disclaimer in the actuary\u2019s  certification that if the data used were incomplete or inaccurate then the  rates would need to be revised. Additionally, in more than half of the   28 files we reviewed, the actuaries noted that they did not audit or  independently verify the data and relied on the state or health plans to  ensure that the data were accurate and complete. Officials from three of  the five health plans we spoke with raised concerns about the  completeness of the encounter data used by states to set rates.  Additionally, state auditors in Washington have raised concerns about the  lack of monitoring of the accuracy of data used for rate setting. The  auditors found that the state did not verify the accuracy of the data used as  the basis for Medicaid managed care rates in fiscal years 2003 through  2007. The state auditor\u2019s report from fiscal year 2007 concluded that the  risk of paying health plans inflated rates increased when the accuracy of  data used to establish rates could not be reasonably assumed to be  correct.", "States have information on the quality of data used for rate setting\u2014 information that CMS could obtain. State officials we spoke with reported  having information on, and efforts intended to ensure, the quality of the  data used to set rates. For example, New Jersey officials told us that the  state tested the reliability and accuracy of the health plan financial data  used to set rates against encounter data and required health plans to have  an independent auditor review selected portions of the financial data.  Additionally, Arizona officials indicated that the state periodically  completes validation studies of the state\u2019s encounter data in which they  traced a sample of the encounters back to individuals\u2019 medical records.  State officials indicated that CMS used to require the state to submit  results of these studies as a condition of operating its managed care  program. However, given the state\u2019s extensive experience with managed  care, CMS no longer requires the state to submit these studies for all  participating health plans. (See app. III for a summary of selected states\u2019  efforts intended to ensure data quality.) Without requiring and reviewing  information on states\u2019 data quality efforts, CMS cannot ensure that these  data are of sufficient quality to be used for setting rates.", "In addition to information from states, CMS conducts audits that could  have provided CMS officials relevant information about the quality of the  data used to set rates. For example, when describing the state\u2019s efforts to  ensure the quality of data used to set rates, officials from South Carolina  noted that CMS periodically reviews the state\u2019s FFS data through the  Payment Error Rate Measurement (PERM) program. Error rates  calculated using FFS and encounter data through the PERM program  could provide CMS with insights regarding the quality of the data that  some states use to set rates. In CMS\u2019s rate-setting review file for South  Carolina, however, there was no discussion of PERM results by either the  state or CMS. CMS central office officials confirmed that regional office  staff do not consider the results of data studies, such as state validation or  PERM program reports, when reviewing states\u2019 rate-setting submissions.", "CMS also could have conducted or required periodic audits of the data  used to set rates. In Medicare Advantage, which is Medicare\u2019s managed  care program, CMS is required to conduct annual audits of the financial  records of at least one-third of the organizations participating in the  program. For Medicaid, however, CMS had not conducted any recent  audits or studies of states\u2019 rate setting, including the quality of data used.  Specifically, officials in all six of the regional offices we spoke with told us  that they had not performed any audits or special studies of states\u2019 rate  setting. Officials from CMS\u2019s central office were also not aware of any  recent audits or studies done by the four other regional offices. In  addition, officials from CMS\u2019s central office told us that they could only  recall one instance, in the nearly 8 years since the regulations were issued,  where OACT arranged for an independent assessment of a state\u2019s rate  setting; that assessment was done more than 2 years ago."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The statutory and regulatory requirements for actuarially sound rates are  key safeguards in efforts to ensure that federal spending for Medicaid  managed care programs is appropriate, which could help avoid significant  overpayments and reduce incentives to underserve or deny enrollees\u2019  access to needed care. CMS, however, has been inconsistent in ensuring  that states are complying with the actuarial soundness requirements and  does not have sufficient efforts in place to ensure that states are using  reliable data to set rates. During the course of our work, CMS took steps to  address some of the variation in regional office practices that contributed  to inconsistencies in overseeing state compliance, such as requiring  regional office officials to use the checklist in reviewing all states\u2019 rate- setting submissions. While these are positive steps, they do not address all  of the variations in regional office practices that contributed to  inconsistencies in CMS\u2019s oversight of rate setting. For example, these  steps do not address variations in tracking state compliance, which may  have led to CMS\u2019s failure to review Tennessee\u2019s rates for compliance with  the actuarial soundness requirements. Additionally, the steps taken do not  address the variation in what evidence CMS officials considered sufficient  for compliance, how officials used the checklist to document their  reviews, and what conditions were necessary for federal funds to be  released. CMS also does not have sufficient efforts in place to ensure the  quality of the data states used to set rates, relying on assurances from  states without considering any other available information on the quality  of the data used. By relying on assurances alone, the agency risks  reimbursing states for rates that may be inflated or inadequate.", "As a result of the weaknesses in CMS\u2019s oversight, billions of dollars in  federal funds were paid to one state for rates that were not certified by an  actuary, and billions more may be at risk of being paid to other states for  rates that are not in compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements  or are based on inappropriate and unreliable data. Given the complexity of  overseeing states\u2019 unique and varied Medicaid programs, it is appropriate  that CMS would allow for flexibility in states\u2019 rate setting and would  expect states to have the primary responsibility for ensuring the quality of  the data used to set rates. However, CMS needs to ensure that all states\u2019  rate setting complies with all of the actuarial soundness requirements and  needs to have safeguards in place to ensure that states\u2019 data quality efforts  are sufficient. Improvements to CMS\u2019s oversight of states\u2019 rate setting will  become increasingly important as coverage under Medicaid expands to  new populations for which states may not have experience serving, and  may have no data on which to base rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve oversight of states\u2019 Medicaid managed care rate setting, we  recommend that the Administrator of CMS take three actions.", "To improve consistency in the oversight of states\u2019 compliance with the  Medicaid managed care actuarial soundness requirements, we recommend  that the Administrator of CMS:  implement a mechanism for tracking state compliance, including tracking  the effective dates of approved rates; and   clarify guidance for CMS officials on conducting rate-setting reviews.", "Areas for clarification could include identifying what evidence is sufficient  to demonstrate state compliance with the requirements, the conditions  necessary for federal funds to be released, and how officials should  document their reviews.", "To better ensure the quality of the data states use in setting Medicaid  managed care rates, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS make  use of information on data quality in overseeing states\u2019 rate setting. CMS  could, among other things, require states to provide CMS with a  description of the actions taken to ensure the quality of the data used in  setting rates and the results of those actions; consider relevant audits and  studies of data quality done by others when reviewing rate setting; and  conduct or require periodic audits or studies of the data states use to set  rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for its review and comment.  HHS concurred with all three of our recommendations, and commented  that it appreciated our efforts to highlight improvements that CMS can  make in its oversight of states\u2019 compliance with Medicaid managed care  actuarial soundness requirements, as well as its focus on the quality of  data used to set managed care rates. Moreover, HHS noted that CMS has  identified many of the same issues. (See app. IV for a copy of HHS\u2019s  comments.)", "HHS agreed with our two recommendations related to improving the  consistency of CMS\u2019s oversight, namely that CMS implement a mechanism  for tracking state compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements  and clarify guidance for CMS officials on conducting rate-setting reviews.  HHS noted that CMS has established a managed care oversight team to  develop and implement a number of improvements in its managed care  oversight, some of which will address our recommendations. These  improvements included CMS\u2019s plans to develop standard operating  protocols for the review and approval of Medicaid managed care rates and  provide comprehensive training to CMS staff on all aspects of the new  process and requirements. As CMS implements efforts aimed at improving  its oversight, we reiterate the need to implement a mechanism for tracking  state compliance with actuarial soundness requirements, including the  effective dates of rates.", "HHS also agreed with our recommendation that CMS make use of  information on data quality in overseeing states\u2019 rate setting. In  commenting on our finding related to CMS\u2019s limited efforts to ensure data  quality, HHS noted that a number of requirements within PPACA will give  CMS additional authority and responsibility for acquiring and utilizing  Medicaid program data. In response to our recommendation, HHS noted  that, as part of a broader effort to redesign how it collects Medicaid data,  CMS will be setting standards for the type and frequency of managed care  data submissions by states. HHS commented that with more complete data  at its disposal, CMS will be able to better assess the underlying quality of  data submissions and, thus, better execute its oversight and monitoring  responsibilities. CMS should use these assessments and other available  information when overseeing states\u2019 rate setting. Finally, HHS provided  technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Administrator of CMS and  other interested parties.

We selected CMS regional offices that:  represented at least 5 of the 10 CMS regional offices,   collectively had oversight responsibility for at least 65 percent of the   34 states with comprehensive Medicaid managed care programs, and    were geographically diverse and oversaw states with Medicaid managed  care programs ranging in size.", "The six regional offices that we selected for our review had oversight  responsibility for 26 of the 34 states (or 76 percent) with comprehensive  Medicaid managed care programs. According to information from CMS,  these 26 states accounted for about 85 percent of Medicaid managed care  enrollment nationally in 2008 and state program size ranged from   8 percent of Medicaid enrollees in Illinois to 100 percent in Tennessee.  (See table 3.)", "We conducted a structured review of a selection of files from the six CMS  regional offices. Specifically, we reviewed the files for CMS\u2019s rate-setting  reviews of the most recently approved contract for each state\u2019s  comprehensive managed care program, or, for states with multiyear  contracts, the file for the most recent full review of rate setting completed  as of October 31, 2009. Several states in the selected regions had multiple  comprehensive managed care programs that had separate contracts and  rate-setting processes each subject to CMS review and approval. For states  that had two programs, we selected the file for the program CMS officials  indicated was the largest, as defined by the number of enrollees and  estimated expenditures. For the states that had more than two programs,  we selected the files for the two largest programs. For 2 of the 26 states  overseen by the six regional offices (Nebraska and Tennessee), CMS had  not done a review that met our criteria, so we did not review a file for  those states. In total, we reviewed 28 files, which covered 24 states, 4 of  which had two or more programs for which CMS did separate reviews.  (See table 4.)", "As part of our file review, we assessed the degree to which CMS  documented its review. Specifically, we determined whether the CMS  official completed CMS\u2019s checklist\u2014a tool CMS developed for regional  office staff to use when reviewing states\u2019 rate-setting submissions for  compliance with the actuarial soundness requirements. For those files  where the CMS official did not complete the checklist and provided no  other documentation of the review, we did no further assessment of CMS\u2019s  review. For the files where the CMS official completed the checklist, we  assessed the extent to which CMS ensured that the state complied with the  actuarial soundness requirements. To do this, we identified several  requirements of the regulations, including that rates were certified by a  qualified actuary, that rates were based on covered services for eligible  individuals, and that the state documented any adjustments to the base  year data. For these requirements, we assessed whether (1) CMS  documented that the state met the requirement, (2) CMS cited evidence for  the assessment that the state was in compliance, and (3) the cited  evidence was consistent with the guidance in CMS\u2019s checklist.  Additionally, as part of our review, we summarized descriptive elements of  states\u2019 rate setting and rates. For example, we documented the types of  data used as the basis for rates and how the state\u2019s rates changed from the  prior year.
