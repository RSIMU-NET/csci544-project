The four countries have experienced either rising trade surpluses or falling trade deficits with the United States since their financial crises began, due primarily to a large decline in U.S. exports to them. Even before their crises began, however, the U.S. government had been concerned about a number of these countries\u2019 trade policies. Prior to the crises, much of the executive branch\u2019s attention had been focused on import policies that affected U.S. exports to the four countries, especially in Korea. Import policies of concern in the four countries have included Korean barriers to imports and distribution of beef, automobiles, and distilled spirits, government procurement procedures in airport construction, and import clearance procedures; restrictions on automobile imports in Brazil and Thailand; and inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, especially in Indonesia. Export policies that the executive branch has been concerned about include Korean government support to its steel and semiconductor industries, and Indonesian government subsidies to its automobile industry.

The crises that began in 1997 dramatically reduced incomes and demand for domestic as well as imported goods. The value of these nations\u2019 currencies declined, with each of the countries\u2019 currencies depreciating by 30-50 percent or more relative to the U.S. dollar in real (inflation-adjusted) terms. The depreciations reduced the purchasing power of local currencies, making it hard for these countries to buy U.S. exports. The depreciations also made the affected nation\u2019s exports more competitive on world markets. World prices for key commodities fell, particularly for oil, agricultural goods, and electronic products. Outflows of foreign capital and domestic credit crunches reduced output and stalled commerce, with direct implications for trade accounts.", "Even without policy changes, such macroeconomic disturbances have a major influence on overall trade levels and balances. Since their crises erupted in 1997, Indonesia and Thailand have widened their trade surpluses with other countries, Korea\u2019s trade balance went from a deficit to a surplus, and Brazil\u2019s deficit has fallen. Most of the shift was caused by a decline in these nations\u2019 imports from abroad, rather than by increases in their exports to other countries. Even though the volume of their exports rose at a double-digit rate, the dollar value of exports from these nations was actually lower in 1998 than it was in 1997 because dollar prices for many of their goods were falling dramatically. The United States, meanwhile, has seen a worsening of its trade deficit with all countries worldwide, not only in absolute terms but also relative to the size of its economy. From 1997 to 1998, the U.S. trade surplus with Brazil fell; for Korea, a U.S. surplus changed to a deficit; and for Indonesia and Thailand, U.S. deficits grew larger.", "According to a March 1999 USTR report, U.S. government trade policy in 1999 remains centered on assuring recovery in the nations in financial crisis. Stabilization and growth are necessary before customers in Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand can resume buying U.S. exports at levels at or above those in the past. Healthy economies will also absorb more of the output of local producers, easing pressures on U.S. firms competing with these nations\u2019 suppliers. Economists also suggest that the U.S. economy will suffer more if crisis countries are unable to export as they recover. For example, a 1998 Brookings Institution paper that analyzed the impact of the Asian financial crisis on trade and capital flows reached this conclusion. In essence, a downward spiral of falling production, consumption, and imports would ensue, hurting both these four countries and the United States.", "At the same time, U.S. efforts to address trade policies of concern continue. Items being actively pursued with Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand include long-standing import market access and export subsidy issues, and the need to improve protection of intellectual property rights. Since the crisis unfolded, two additional types of issues have been added to the U.S. agenda: (1) ensuring that the countries do not reverse the liberalization accomplished in prior years; and (2) more vigorously addressing governmental and industry practices that the U.S. government and industry believe may have contributed to the crisis, such as directed credit and other privileges for industries deemed by these nations\u2019 governments to be important for economic development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Concerns About Trade Policies Have Focused on the Four Countries\u2019 Import Barriers", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. government has focused considerable attention in the last 3 years on eliminating or modifying certain import policies in Brazil, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand that had restricted U.S. exports to those countries.

The United States ran a $7.4-billion merchandise trade deficit with Korea in 1998, compared to a $1.9 billion surplus in 1997. The trade deficit resulted from a 34 percent drop in U.S. merchandise exports to Korea, from $25.1 billion in 1997 to $16.5 billion in 1998, and a 3.4 percent increase in Korean merchandise exports to the United States, from $23.2 billion in 1997 to $23.9 billion in 1998. Major Korean exports to the United States in 1998 included machinery and transport equipment, steel, manufactured goods, and chemicals and related products.", "Over the last 30 years, Korea has pursued a strongly export-oriented economic development model with considerable government involvement. Under this model, the Korean government has worked closely with Korean financial institutions and large corporate conglomerates to promote exports in targeted sectors, such as heavy and chemical industries, consumer electronics, and automobiles. The overinvestment in certain sectors and excessive corporate debt that this development strategy eventually produced contributed to Korea\u2019s recent financial crisis. Government assistance to exporters has consisted of providing a range of industry-specific subsidies, tax benefits, export financing, export marketing assistance, government-influenced lending, and research and development assistance.  In recent years, the United States has been concerned over Korean subsidies and other export policies.", "Korean Subsidies and Internal Supports\u2014U.S.-initiated WTO Disputes and Countervailing Duty Cases: In February 1999, the United States invoked WTO dispute settlement procedures against Korean beef industry policies. The United States alleged that Korean regulations discriminated against and constrained opportunities for the sale of imported beef in Korea and that Korea provided domestic support to its cattle industry in amounts that exceeded its WTO tariff reduction schedule. The United States and Korea engaged in formal consultations over this matter in mid-March, and a panel to consider the matter was formed on May 26, 1999. Also, within the last 5 years, the Commerce Department has determined that a number of Korean subsidies to its steel industry were countervailable under U.S. trade law. The three cases have involved stainless steel plate in coils; stainless steel sheet and strip in coils; and certain cut-to-length, carbon- quality steel plate. (App. II provides more details concerning U.S. countervailing duty law, WTO subsidies rules, and these specific cases.)", "U.S. Concerns About Other Korean Policies: In addition to policies that the U.S. government has formally raised in the WTO or found to be countervailable under U.S. trade law, the executive branch has been concerned about other Korean export and subsidy polices in the last 3 years. These policies have involved government-directed lending, government  involvement in and support to the Korean steel industry, restructuring of corporate conglomerates (particularly in the automobile, steel, shipbuilding, and semiconductor industries), and semiconductors.", "Government-directed Lending: The Commerce Department has reported that it is monitoring whether the Korean government may be influencing commercial banks to lend funds at preferential rates to targeted industries\u2014particularly to Korea\u2019s steel and semiconductor industries. The U.S. government has raised this issue with Korean government and industry officials on numerous occasions. In addition, Korea\u2019s IMF and World Bank programs contain reforms to Korea\u2019s financial system and corporate sector that help to curtail the government\u2019s ability to direct bank lending on noncommercial terms. As previously mentioned, Commerce has examined potential subsidies resulting from alleged government-directed lending to the Korean steel industry in three recent countervailing duty investigations of certain Korean steel products.", "Steel Industry: The U.S. government and U.S. steel industry have been concerned for some time about Korean government involvement in and support for its steel industry, such as below-market-interest-rate loans extended by government-owned banks to steel producers. Several actions have taken place in addition to the countervailing duty cases previously discussed. In June 1995, the U.S. Committee on Pipe and Tube Imports filed a Section 301 petition alleging that Korea restricted exports of domestically produced steel sheet, controlled domestic prices below world prices, and diverted exports of pipe and tube products from the EU to the U.S. market. The Committee withdrew its petition in July 1995 when Korea agreed to establish a consultative mechanism with the United States to provide information about Korea\u2019s steel sheet, pipe, and tube production and exports. The Korean government also agreed to notify the United States of any measure to control steel production, pricing, or exports, and to not interfere in steel pricing or production. Although the consultative mechanism was extended for another year, and bilateral consultations were held in 1996 and 1997, the United States continued to raise concerns about Korean government influence over private-sector decisions concerning steel. In 1997 and 1998, for example, the United States asked the Korean government to respond to specific questions concerning Hanbo (Korea\u2019s second largest steel producer), which collapsed financially and is now being sold. The United States was concerned that the Korean government may have provided subsidies to Hanbo and directed Korean banks to extend credit to the company\u2014actions that may have contributed to prices that undercut competitors and displaced U.S. steel exports to Korea and other countries.", "As a result of a 30 percent surge in steel imports into the United States during the first 10 months of 1998 compared to the same period in 1997, of which about 6 percentage points came from Korea (Japan and Russia were other important suppliers), the United States initiated an extensive dialogue with the Korean government to ensure that its steel sector would operate on a market-driven basis rather than with Korean government help. In 1998, the Korean government provided written assurances that it would not support, or direct others to support, Hanbo and that the sale of the company would be market based and managed by a reputable international financial company. In addition, Hanbo temporarily shut down production at one of its plants that was of particular concern to the U.S. steel industry.", "The Korean government also announced its intention to privatize Korea\u2019s largest and the world\u2019s second largest steel producer, Pohang Iron and Steel Company (POSCO). Since December 1998, the Korean government has reduced its 33 percent stake in POSCO to 20.8 percent. The full privatization of POSCO would serve to remove the Korean government\u2019s influence from the company\u2019s pricing, production, and other business decisions. In addition to monitoring POSCO\u2019s privatization, the U.S. government is continuing to monitor steel import trends and any potential Korean government support to other steel companies. In addition, the U.S. government believes that, if faithfully implemented, Korea\u2019s financial and corporate restructuring efforts\u2014particularly those involving bank oversight and lending limits\u2014should help guarantee that Korea\u2019s steel corporations operate on a market-oriented basis.", "Restructuring of Corporate Conglomerates: As part of Korea\u2019s financial arrangements with the IMF, the Korean government is trying to restructure the five largest Korean industrial conglomerates, or \u201cchaebol,\u201d to make them more commercially oriented and to reduce their debt levels. These chaebol are swapping certain assets and subsidiaries, as part of the so- called \u201cBig Deal.\u201d The World Bank is taking the lead in assisting Korea with its corporate sector restructuring. The U.S. government has flagged corporate restructuring as a systemic change that could not only help the Korean economy regain and sustain its stability but also enhance market access.  The U.S. government has submitted questions to the Korean government on the specifics of certain restructuring efforts, including in the semiconductor sector, and emphasized that as a whole the restructuring should (1) yield more efficient, market-driven Korean firms without uneconomic business lines that contribute to excess capacity; and (2) be carried out in a manner that is consistent with Korea\u2019s international obligations, particularly under the WTO Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures.  The Commerce Department has reported that it is monitoring whether the Korean government might provide certain subsidies\u2014such as tax breaks or drastic debt relief\u2014as incentives to the companies to participate in the restructuring.", "In addition to these practices, the U.S. government in 1998 reported that Korea uses various tax-related measures that benefit Korean exporters or foreign investors in Korea. These include tax reserves for export losses and overseas market development, exemptions or reductions in duties on imported capital equipment to be used in exports, reductions in duties for imported aircraft and vessel parts, tax concessions to encourage foreign investment, tax concessions for overseas business losses, tax exemptions for overseas business development, and tax credits for investment in facilities. The Commerce Department also reported on Korean subsidy practices that benefit specific industry sectors. These sectoral practices include incentives to sustain steel companies; tax exemptions or credits for firms in designated manufacturing industries (machinery, electronics, aviation, defense, fine chemicals, genetic engineering, new basic materials, and antipollution technologies); tax incentives for multinational corporations in computer software and telecommunications; expense deductions for firms in traditional industries; support to miners when mines are closed; incentives to the stone industry; and assistance to small and medium-sized enterprises."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Brazil: U.S. Focus Has Been on Three Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["Brazil was the U.S.\u2019 11th largest export market in 1998.

The United States invoked WTO dispute settlement procedures and held consultations with Brazil regarding various aspects of its automotive regime in August 1996, including provisions in its WTO-notified subsidy program for automobiles. In March 1998, the United States and Brazil signed an agreement settling the dispute. (See app. I for more details on this case.) The other WTO dispute was brought by Canada and involved PROEX, a Brazilian government export financing program. The United States reserved its rights as a third party in the dispute. In April 1999, a WTO dispute resolution panel found that PROEX\u2019s interest equalization program was a prohibited export subsidy and that, because Brazil did not meet the conditions that allow developing countries more time than developed countries to remove prohibited export subsidies, the program must be withdrawn immediately. In addition to these WTO cases, in the last 3 years the U.S. government has found one Brazilian subsidy to manufacturers of certain hot-rolled flat-rolled carbon-quality steel products to be countervailable.

Exporters enjoy exemptions from withholding tax for remittances sent overseas for loan payments and marketing, as well as from the financial operations tax for deposit receipts on export products. Exporters are also eligible for a rebate on social contribution taxes paid on locally acquired production inputs.

In Thailand, U.S. priorities have included high import duties on certain agricultural and food products, high automobile tariffs, inadequate protection of intellectual property rights, and inefficient customs operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Korean Import Policies", "paragraphs": ["Korea has historically been considered one of the most difficult export markets in the world because of its many market access barriers. Even before its 1997 financial crisis and the establishment of financial arrangements with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), however, Korea had already begun to address some of its trade barriers because of its growing international trade links. These links, which implied a stronger reliance on international trade rules and principles, have gradually encouraged a more active role for Korea in international trading organizations that require greater market openness and trade liberalization among their members, particularly the WTO and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which Korea joined in 1996.", "The United States has identified a wide range and number of barriers that impede the import of U.S. goods and services into Korea. Within the last 3 years, U.S. government agencies have been particularly active in reporting on and trying to address Korean import barriers related to the following practices: Pharmaceuticals: Korea\u2019s treatment of foreign, research-based pharmaceuticals is one of the top priorities on the U.S. trade agenda with Korea.  The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) named pharmaceuticals trade issues as a bilateral trade expansion priority in a 1999 report to Congress. Under its national health insurance system, Korea does not give national treatment to imported drugs in terms of listing and pricing on the system\u2019s reimbursement schedule. The current system discourages medical providers from dispensing imported drugs by allowing them a higher profit margin from reimbursement for domestic drugs and by requiring additional administrative procedures for reimbursement from imported drugs.  According to USTR, U.S. pharmaceutical producers also face nonscience-based requirements for clinical testing, inadequate and ineffective protection of test data against unfair commercial use, and lack of coordination between Korean health and IPR authorities that allows patent infringement.  In response to high- level bilateral consultations and correspondence, the Korean government has indicated that it is taking steps to address some of the U.S. government\u2019s and industry\u2019s concerns. According to a U.S. Commerce Department official, Korea has also agreed to reimburse medical providers for imported drugs in the near future. The executive branch is continuing to work with the Korean government to address concerns related to trade in pharmaceuticals.", "Beef Market Access: Korea restricts the quantity, distribution, and display of imported beef through a variety of measures, including requirements that imported beef be sold in separate retail establishments and be imported by certain designated entities. Since 1990, the U.S. government has negotiated several agreements with Korea that provide for annually increasing market access levels for beef imports; guarantee direct commercial relations between foreign suppliers and Korean retailers and distributors; and ensure that increasing volumes of beef would be sold through commercial channels instead of through a quasi-government agency. Korea has also pledged to remove all nontariff barriers on beef by 2001. In 1997 and 1998, however, Korea did not meet its quota commitments on the importation of foreign beef. In February 1999, after failing to reach agreement with Korea on reforming its beef importation practices, the United States initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures alleging that Korean regulations discriminate against and constrain opportunities for the sale of imported beef in Korea. The United States also alleged that Korea imposes sale markups on imported beef, limits import authority to certain groups, and provides domestic support to the Korean cattle industry in amounts that cause Korea to exceed its aggregate measure of support as reflected in Korea\u2019s WTO tariff reduction schedule. A panel to consider the matter was established in May 1999. Australia also initiated WTO dispute resolution procedures against Korean beef practices on April 13, 1999.", "Airport Procurement Procedures: Foreign companies had traditionally been limited in their opportunities to bid on government procurement contracts until Korea became a signatory to the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). During negotiations over Korea\u2019s accession to this agreement, the U.S. government reportedly received a commitment from Korea that entities responsible for airport construction would be subject to GPA disciplines. However, soon after negotiations were concluded, Korea created another entity--the Korea Airport Construction Authority--to manage procurement for the new Inchon international airport, one of the largest public works projects in Asia.  The Korean government has subsequently changed the construction authority to the Inchon International Airport Corporation. Korea now asserts that, because neither the airport construction authority nor the airport corporation are expressly listed as covered entities in its GPA schedule of concessions, procurement for the Inchon international airport is not covered by the GPA.  USTR reports that U.S. firms have repeatedly faced discriminatory tendering practices that hamper their ability to compete effectively for related procurement practices in the airport project. In February 1999, the United States requested consultations with Korea under WTO dispute settlement procedures. In May, the United States requested the establishment of a WTO dispute settlement panel on Korea\u2019s procurement practices after WTO consultations held on March 17 failed to resolve the issue.", "Anti-import Activities: Over the years, the U.S. government has reported that frugality campaigns by Korean civic groups and media organizations have encouraged Koreans to avoid imported products and services and that the campaigns may have involved some Korean government support. In addition, the U.S. government has identified some Korean government practices that have specifically targeted imports. For example, in the past, the Korean government selected Korean lessors of imported automobiles for tax audits. Since the spring of 1997, the Korean government has publicly announced that it does not support anti-import activities and has promulgated guidelines to its officials on ensuring nondiscrimination against imports. In addition, the Korean president has urged Koreans to base their purchasing decisions on price and quality, rather than on the country of origin of the goods, and a 1998 U.S.-Korean auto memorandum of understanding states that the Korean government will effectively and expeditiously address all instances of anti-import activity associated with motor vehicles. The U.S. government, however, continues to watch for reports of anti-import activity, and raises instances of such activity with the Korean government.", "Motor Vehicles: As a result of market access barriers in the automotive sector, foreign automobiles comprised less than 1 percent of the Korean motor vehicle market in 1998, compared to about 6 percent in Japan, over 25 percent in the European Union (EU), and about 30 percent in the United States. In an October 1997 report to the Congress, the United States identified Korean barriers to motor vehicles as a priority foreign country practice, the elimination of which is likely to have the most significant potential to increase U.S. exports. Although the United States and Korea had already signed a memorandum of understanding on improving market access for foreign motor vehicles in September 1995, the United States had subsequently failed to reach agreement with Korea over remaining market access concerns. The concerns involved tariff and tax disincentives on imports, onerous and costly auto standards and certification procedures, automobile financing restrictions, and a pervasive anti-import climate for imported vehicles. After a U.S. Section 301 investigation  and bilateral negotiations over these concerns, the United States and Korea concluded a memorandum of understanding in October 1998 to improve market access for foreign motor vehicles in Korea. Under the agreement, Korea agreed to broaden coverage of the 1995 memorandum of understanding to include minivans and sport utility vehicles; streamline Korean standards and certification procedures and adopt self-certification procedures by 2002, lower and/or eliminate taxes on automobiles, bind Korean tariffs on vehicles in the WTO at 8 percent (formerly, Korea\u2019s tariff was 80 percent), introduce secured automobile financing, and implement a program to improve public perceptions of foreign automobiles. The executive branch is monitoring Korea\u2019s compliance with the agreement.", "Distilled Spirits Taxes: Korea applies lower taxes to its domestically produced distilled spirit, called \u201csoju,\u201d than to imported alcoholic beverages. As a result of various Korean taxes and tariffs on foreign distilled spirits, the tax burden on imported liquor is higher than that for soju. In fact, according to the U.S. government, the tax burden on U.S. whiskey in Korea is more than four times greater than that on soju. In 1997, the United States and the EU brought the matter to the WTO, arguing that Korea levied discriminatory taxes against imported distilled spirits.", "Both the WTO dispute settlement panel in July 1998 and the WTO appellate body in January 1999 ruled in favor of the United States and the EU in the case. In March 1999, Korea informed the WTO that it was considering options for implementing the WTO\u2019s recommendations. In April 1999, the United States and Korea requested that the period of time for Korea to implement these recommendations be determined by arbitration.  Korea requested 15 months, which the United States and the EU opposed. The arbitrator subsequently determined that Korea had 11.5 months to comply with its WTO commitments in this case.", "Movie Screen Quotas: By requiring Korean movie theaters to show domestic Korean films at least 106 or 146 days each year, Korea in effect imposes a quota on foreign films, thereby deterring trade in films and cinema construction and the expansion of theatrical distribution in Korea. The U.S. government has repeatedly raised this issue with the Korean government, including during a March 1999 trade mission to Korea. Currently, this issue is under discussion in negotiations over a bilateral investment treaty.", "Intellectual Property Rights: IPR-related concerns in Korea have involved limited retroactive copyright protection, incomplete trademark laws; inconsistent interpretation and implementation of patent laws; software piracy; production and export of counterfeit goods; and deficient laws on countering unfair competition and protecting trade secrets. Although Korea remained on the U.S. government\u2019s Special 301 \u201cwatch list\u201d in 1997, 1998, and 1999, the U.S. government acknowledges that Korea has made significant efforts to strengthen its IPR laws and enforcement. For example, pursuant to its obligations under the WTO Agreement on Trade- Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS), Korea passed four acts on patents, utility models, designs, and trademarks in 1995 and implemented new copyright, computer software, and customs laws in 1996. In March 1998, Korea\u2019s revised trademark law became effective and a new patent court was established. Nevertheless, in negotiations over a bilateral investment treaty, the U.S. government has asked Korea to resolve some remaining inconsistencies involving its TRIPS obligations.", "For example, according to USTR, Korea still does not provide full retroactive protection to existing copyrighted works. Similarly, Korea\u2019s trademark law still does not protect some famous U.S. cartoon characters because they have not been registered with Korean authorities.  Also, the U.S. government has raised Korea\u2019s failure to provide TRIPS-consistent data protection and full coordination between Korea\u2019s IPR and health authorities to preclude patent infringements.", "Telecommunications: U.S. equipment and services companies have traditionally encountered a range of market barriers in the Korean telecommunications sector. The United States first cited Korea in 1989 as a priority foreign country for trade barriers in the telecommunications field involving discriminatory procurement practices, \u201cbuy local\u201d policies, lack of transparency (openness), and inadequate trade secret protection. Despite a 1992 bilateral agreement and a 1993 exchange of letters addressing Korea\u2019s telecommunications trade barriers, in July 1996 the United States designated Korea as a \u201cpriority foreign country\u201d under Section 1374 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Subsequent bilateral negotiations resulted in a July 1997 agreement in which Korea agreed to implement a range of policies to address remaining U.S. concerns and enhance U.S. market access. These policies included national treatment for foreign companies; government nonintervention in private sector procurement; increased transparency in criteria and procedures relating to services licensing, equipment certification, and type approval; increased foreign ownership in domestic service providers; enhanced protection of intellectual property and proprietary information; clear guidelines for technology transfer; transparent procedures for satellite services authorization; procompetitive regulatory measures; and an enhanced independent regulatory role for the Korean Communication Commission. Korea also agreed to eliminate tariffs on information technology products and to increase limits on foreign ownership of domestic telecommunications services companies. As a result of the agreement, the United States revoked Korea\u2019s priority foreign country designation as of August 1997. The United States is continuing to monitor Korea\u2019s implementation of the agreement as well as U.S. industry concerns over possible Korean government involvement in promoting the consolidation of private cellular telecommunications operators and wire- line companies under current conglomerate restructuring plans.", "Financial Services: Korea has traditionally restricted foreign participation and involvement in its insurance, banking, and securities sectors. However, Korea has been liberalizing many of these restrictions in recent years, particularly in the context of its WTO, OECD, and IMF commitments. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, under its IMF financing arrangements, Korea has agreed to a fundamental overhaul of its weak and noncompetitive financial system. The prudential regulatory framework is being strengthened and restructured, and banks and other financial institutions are now expected to operate in a more transparent and financially sound manner. Additionally, Korea committed to the IMF to make its OECD commitments on financial services liberalization part of its WTO commitments, which would make them subject to the WTO\u2019s binding dispute settlement mechanism. For the insurance industry, Korea included expanded market access and national treatment of foreign insurers in its WTO schedule of liberalization measures as part of the 1997 WTO financial services agreement. Similarly, in consultation with the IMF and the World Bank, Korea is implementing considerable structural reform in its banking sector to ensure that it operates on a fully commercial basis. The Korean government has also committed to the IMF to refrain from interfering in bank lending or managing decisions, to open its capital markets significantly to foreign participation, to permit foreign financial institutions to participate in mergers and acquisitions of Korean financial institutions, to allow foreign banks to establish subsidiaries or branches in Korea, and to liberalize foreign exchange controls. Under its IMF financial arrangements, Korea is also implementing considerable liberalization of its securities market by removing or lifting ceilings on foreign investment in Korean stocks, bonds, or commercial paper.", "Import Clearance Procedures: The U.S. government reports that Korea\u2019s import clearance procedures often delay entry of U.S. imports into Korea. For example, certain sanitary and phytosanitary barriers frequently delay some U.S. agricultural and food exports from entering Korea for 2 to 4 weeks, and sometimes up to 2 months, except for perishable fruits and vegetables, which take a maximum of 5 days. Problems with import clearance procedures involve Korea\u2019s ingredient listing requirements, sanitary and phytosanitary rules, standards and conformity assessment procedures, and arbitrary actions by Korean inspectors. Korea has addressed some of these issues in response to U.S.-initiated WTO dispute settlement procedures. Specifically, Korea agreed to expedite clearance procedures for fresh fruits and vegetables, to use the concept of scientific risk assessment in developing a quarantine pest list and setting fumigation requirements, to revise some of its food additive standards to bring them closer to international standards, and to eliminate sorting requirements and requirements on ingredients listing by percentage for all ingredients. Under its IMF financial arrangements, Korea also presented a plan in August 1998 to streamline various import certification procedures and bring them in line with international practices.", "Cosmetics: The U.S. government has identified several impediments to the entry and distribution of foreign cosmetic products in Korea. These include requirements for the Korean Food and Drug Administration to approve imports of the same cosmetic products if they have different countries of origin, the Korean government\u2019s delegation of authority to the domestic industry association to screen advertising and information brochures, the mandatory provision of proprietary information on imported cosmetics to Korean competitors, redundant testing, restrictions on sales promotions involving gifts with purchases, and burdensome import authorization and tracking requirements. The executive branch cited Korea\u2019s cosmetics-related trade barriers as a bilateral priority in a 1997 report to the Congress because the Korean government had not fully addressed U.S. concerns despite consultations between the two governments. In January 1998, the Korean Food and Drug Administration abolished the annual testing requirement for imported cosmetics and authorized importers to perform the required self-testing. Nevertheless, significant delays still remain for final government approval for the local sale of products developed outside of Korea, and cosmetics are still subject to the same rigorous and time-consuming approval process as pharmaceuticals and nutritional supplements.

Alongside its liberalization efforts, Brazil has pursued further economic integration through MERCOSUL (South America\u2019s common market) and negotiations to establish the Free Trade Area of the Americas. The 5-year-old Real Plan, introduced after nearly a decade of economic stagnation and periods of hyperinflation, was the key element underpinning Brazil\u2019s efforts to stabilize its economy.", "Access to Brazilian markets in a significant number of sectors is characterized as generally good\u2014with competition and participation by foreign firms through imports, local production, and joint ventures.", "However, some key liberalization measures introduced by the government of Brazil since 1995 have not been fully implemented\u2014including some measures to eliminate government monopolies and to remove the distinction between foreign and national investors. In addition, the Brazilian government implemented temporary restrictive measures during 1996-98 to slow increasing trade deficits. Since 1990, Brazil has relied primarily on tariffs to regulate imports, rather than on nontariff barriers. Although Brazil\u2019s average import tariff increased from about 12 percent in 1996 to about 15 percent in1998, it remained significantly below the 1990 level of 32 percent.", "Within the last 3 years, U.S. government agencies have been particularly active in reporting on and addressing trade barriers related to Brazilian protection of IPR, import financing restrictions, phytosanitary restrictions on wheat, discriminatory automobile policies, and customs valuation practices and import licensing system.", "Intellectual Property Rights: In April 1993, USTR identified Brazil as a priority foreign country under \u201cSpecial 301\u201d because Brazil failed to provide adequate and effective intellectual property rights protections. Later that year (May 1993), USTR initiated a Section 301 investigation of Brazil\u2019s IPR regime and requested consultations. As a result of Brazil\u2019s commitment to improve the protection of intellectual property and provide greater market access for intellectual property products, USTR terminated its investigation in early 1994 and removed Brazil\u2019s designation as a priority foreign country. However, because of Brazil\u2019s lack of progress in implementing changes to its IPR regime, Brazil was placed on the priority watch list in April 1995. Subsequent improvements in IPR protection resulted in Brazil being first moved down to the watch list in 1996 and eventually being removed from the list entirely in 1997, when a series of IPR laws was promulgated.", "While the new laws represent progress in Brazil\u2019s IPR regime, deficiencies in the TRIPS-consistency and enforcement of some of these laws resulted in Brazil being placed back on the watch list in 1999. Specifically, USTR has identified problems with Brazil\u2019s Industrial Property Law, which includes a domestic working requirement for patents that is not consistent with TRIPS. In addition, USTR reported that Brazil\u2019s uneven enforcement of copyright laws is a serious and growing concern. Deficiencies in the Brazilian government\u2019s efforts to improve copyright enforcement have contributed to increasing piracy rates. Problems were particularly acute with respect to sound recordings and videocassettes\u2014with virtually all audiocassettes sold in 1998 being pirated copies. Overall, the sound recording industry saw its piracy losses double in 1998. The U.S. government contends that the Brazilian government\u2019s efforts to patrol its border and ports have been inconsistent (a significant amount of the pirated material enters Brazil through Paraguay) and that the Brazilian government has not provided police the tools or training to enforce the laws. Furthermore, proposed legal changes that could reduce criminal penalties for intellectual property crimes and remove police authority to initiate some searches and seizures have become a particular concern for the U.S. government. According to USTR, Brazil\u2019s generally inefficient courts and judicial system have complicated the enforcement of intellectual property rights. The U.S. executive branch believes that Brazil should increase fines so as to create a true deterrent to copyright infringement, increase the effectiveness of the criminal enforcement system, and decrease delays in the judicial process.", "Import Financing Restrictions: In April 1997, Brazil-imposed requirements effectively prohibited import financing for less than 180 days on purchases from non-MERCOSUL countries and raised costs for any import financing of less than 1 year. Specifically, Brazil required importers to purchase foreign exchange for financing purposes at least 180 days in advance of the due date for short-term supplier credit (that is, less than 360 days in duration). Brazil also prevented export credit agencies such as the U.S. Export-Import Bank from offering short-term credits for certain categories of purchases (for example, raw materials, spare parts, and others). According to a Commerce Department official, these restrictions were implemented as a reaction to Brazil\u2019s burgeoning trade deficit and to combat currency speculation. It is estimated that these measures added 3 to 5 percent to the cost of affected imports. The U.S. government raised its concerns bilaterally with the Brazilian government regarding the WTO- consistency of this policy and joined as a third-party observer in the March 1998 WTO dispute settlement consultation between Brazil and the EU. The EU requested consultations with Brazil in January 1998. Although WTO consultations are still pending, Brazil eliminated its import finance restrictions in March 1999 for most practical purposes, according to the Commerce Department.", "Phytosanitary Restrictions on Wheat: The access of U.S. wheat to the Brazilian market was removed in September 1996, when the government of Brazil effectively banned U.S. wheat imports due to concerns about the wheat fungus Tilletia controversa Kuhn. Prior to 1996, U.S growers exported about 750,000 tons of wheat to Brazil\u2014a leading importer of wheat. However, the United States and Brazil reached agreements on U.S. hard red winter wheat after Brazil eliminated its phytosanitary restrictions on this type of wheat in April 1998. Brazil\u2019s decision was based on strong scientific evidence presented in a pest risk assessment. Although Brazil\u2019s government published an executive order to allow entry of U.S. hard red winter wheat into Brazil in November 1998, the United States has not made any wheat sales to Brazil since the executive order was signed. The United States continues to work bilaterally with Brazil to resolve outstanding issues that restrict market access for other types of wheat as well as other U.S. exports such as poultry.", "Automobile Program: In December 1995, Brazil enacted an auto program that offers automobile manufacturers reduced import duties on automobiles and automobile parts, and other benefits if they export certain quantities of parts and vehicles and meet local content targets in their Brazilian plants. This program adversely affects U.S. exports of autos and auto parts to Brazil by distorting investment, sourcing, and production decisions. The United States also believes that the program violates the WTO\u2019s provisions on trade-related investment measures. As a result, the United States requested WTO dispute settlement consultations with Brazil on these measures in August 1996. In October 1996, USTR initiated a Section 301 investigation of Brazil\u2019s practices. In January 1997, USTR requested additional consultations with Brazil in the WTO, focusing specifically on new aspects of its auto regime that were introduced following the earlier consultations. These included tariff rate quotas for Korea, Japan, and the EU, and incentives to establish production facilities in specific regions of Brazil.", "The United States and Brazil signed an agreement settling the dispute in March 1998, and USTR terminated its investigation. In this regard, Brazil committed to eliminate the trade- and investment-distorting measures in its auto regime by December 31, 1999, and agreed not to extend the WTO trade-related investment measures to MERCOSUL partners when they unify their auto regimes in the year 2000. Currently, USTR is monitoring Brazil\u2019s implementation of the March 1998 agreement, and Brazil is negotiating with its MERCOSUL partners to establish a new auto regime.

According to USTR, as of January 1, 1999, the system charged a fee of Real$30 per import statement and Real$10 per product added to the statement.  An increasing number of products are exempt from automatic licensing.  In addition, beginning in October 1998, Brazil issued a series of administrative measures that required additional sanitary and phytosanitary, quality, and safety approvals from various Brazilian government entities for products subject to nonautomatic licenses.  The October measures and the use of minimum price lists in conjunction with licensing have been characterized by Brazil as a deepening of its existing import licensing regime and as part of a larger strategy to prevent under-invoicing.  However, according to USTR, the use of minimum price lists raises questions about whether Brazil\u2019s regime is consistent with its obligations under the WTO, and these practices have proven to be a barrier to U.S. exports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Indonesia", "paragraphs": ["According to U.S. government and WTO sources, in recent years Indonesia has liberalized its foreign trade and investment systems and has taken a number of important steps to reduce protection.

However, the report noted that the pace of trade and investment liberalization had slowed during 1994-96.

In recent years, Indonesian barriers to imports included high tariffs on certain items; quantitative restrictions on some agricultural and other goods; and barriers to service imports, including restrictions on wholesale and retail distribution. Barriers to foreign investment have included restrictions and prohibitions in certain sectors, such as film and video distribution and forest concessions. Since 1996, the most prominent import barrier issue between the United States and Indonesia has concerned Indonesia\u2019s IPR protection. Since April 1996, Indonesia has been on the U.S. government\u2019s priority watch list for inadequate intellectual property protection. The U.S. executive branch has cited the following reasons for this designation: (1) trademark infringement, including software, book, video, videocassette disk, drug, and apparel piracy; (2) audiovisual market access barriers; (3) inconsistent enforcement and ineffective legal system; and (4) amendments to the copyright, patent, and trademark laws that the U.S. government believes are not fully consistent with Indonesia\u2019s obligations under the WTO TRIPS agreement. In June 1998 the U.S. executive branch presented to the Indonesian government a plan for improving IPR protection that could result in Indonesia\u2019s removal from the priority watch list.

Generally, the Thai government has continued to lower tariff rates pursuant to goals established in 1994. However, USTR and other U.S. government agencies have identified several of Thailand\u2019s trade policies and practices that affect U.S. exports to Thailand, such as weak IPR enforcement. These barriers include the following: Inadequate Protection of Intellectual Property Rights: This is the leading trade issue between the United States and Thailand. In this regard, USTR initiated Section 301 investigations in 1990 and 1991 regarding Thailand\u2019s lack of adequate protections over intellectual property. Both investigations found Thailand\u2019s copyright and patent protections to be unreasonable and burdensome to U.S. commerce. Thailand made significant improvements to its IPR legal regime and enforcement efforts in the 1990s. Despite this progress, Thailand has remained on the U.S.\u2019 Special 301 \u201cwatch list\u201d since November 1994 because of long-standing IPR enforcement weaknesses. According to USTR\u2019s 1999 National Trade Estimate report, the U.S. copyright industry estimates it lost nearly $200 million from intellectual property rights infringements in Thailand. In response to these concerns, the Thai government implemented a series of legal reform initiatives, established a special Intellectual Property and International Trade Court, and concluded an intellectual property enforcement action plan with the United States. However, U.S. government officials maintain that significant enforcement problems remain, piracy rates continue to climb, and monetary penalties or jail sentences are rarely imposed to deter such crimes. In February 1999, a new enforcement strategy was implemented, but at the time of our report no information regarding the success of this effort was available.", "High Tariffs on Automobiles: In addition to currently applied domestic auto sector protections (local content restrictions), which must be removed by January 1, 2000, pursuant to Thailand\u2019s commitments under the WTO agreement on trade-related investment measures, Thailand imposes significantly high tariffs on automobiles. While Thailand\u2019s overall average tariff rate is relatively low when compared with its ASEAN neighbors, its tariffs on automobiles remain high at 80 percent. However, Thailand\u2019s automobile tariffs have never risen to an actionable level, in part because Thailand\u2019s tariffs are bound in the WTO, and Thailand actually applies lower tariffs ranging from 42.5 to 68.5 percent. Furthermore, some U.S. car manufacturers assemble automobiles in Thailand, thus avoiding the higher tariffs. These manufacturers, however, pay tariffs up to 35 percent on automotive parts imports. Thailand recently announced its latest plans to bring its national car policy into conformity with its agreement on trade-related investment measures obligations as required by January 1, 2000. The plans are being studied by U.S. government officials.", "Inefficient Customs Operations: USTR and the State Department report that Thailand\u2019s customs clearance processes are arbitrary, irregular, and inefficient. In 1997, the United States and nine other chambers of commerce, including Japan\u2019s, vigorously and publicly complained about Thailand\u2019s customs procedures. The U.S. government is concerned about excessive paperwork and formalities, lack of coordination between customs and other import-related agencies, and lack of modern computerized processes. However, Thailand has made progress in reforming some areas of its customs operations, such as express shipment handling, payment procedures, and document simplification.

As a signatory to the WTO, Thailand committed to reduce tariffs and began to do so in 1995. However, by the end of the tariff reduction phase-in period in 2004, duties will still be in the 30 to 40 percent range for most consumer-oriented food products, with the notable exception of apples and raw tree nuts. In addition to high tariffs, time-consuming and cumbersome licensing and registration procedures can delay the entry of new products into the Thai domestic market.", "Investment Restrictions: Thailand\u2019s agreement with the IMF contains a commitment to accelerate privatization of state holdings in the areas of energy, public utilities, telecommunications, and transportation.

This, in turn, is expected to increase opportunities for U.S. investors to gain market access to those service sectors.
