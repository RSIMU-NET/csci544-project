The Year 2000 plan was updated in October 1996 and revised in January 1998. The Project Office had conducted six Army-wide data calls to accumulate important Year 2000 information from its components. Early in the awareness phase, it had also established a baseline system inventory that was used to develop and populate the Army\u2019s current Year 2000 system inventory database. The Project Office\u2019s establishment of an Army Year 2000 home page enables Army components to access systems inventory information.

Of the 143 mission-critical systems requiring repair at the time of the October 1997 quarterly report, 45 percent had costs entered by system managers and 52 percent had no costs entered into the Army\u2019s inventory database.

However, for the 52 percent of the systems where costs had not been entered into the Army\u2019s inventory database by system managers, Year 2000 Project Office staff computed the costs using the Gartner Group formula. This formula recommends multiplying the number of lines of code to be converted by $1.10 for automated information systems and by $8.00 for weapon systems. DOD recommended that components use this formula early in their Year 2000 effort to make a rough estimate of costs. However, this rough estimate was to be refined by conducting a detailed cost analysis based on more than 30 cost factors as the component progressed through the assessment phase and more was learned about its systems and the resources that would be required to fix them. These include such factors as the age of systems; skill and expertise of in-house programmers; the strategy that the agency is pursuing (strategies that involve keeping the two-digit code, for example, may be much less expensive than those that involve changing the two-digit code to a four-digit code); the clarity and completeness of documentation on systems; the availability of source code; and the programming language used.", "The difference between an estimate based on a reliable analysis of data collected during the assessment phase and an estimate based on the Gartner formula can be significant.

Further, over a year ago, in January 1997, Army Year 2000 Project Office staff recognized that there may be competition for testing resources and agreed to evaluate the issue. However, as of February 1998, the Army Year 2000 Project Office had not yet assessed the situation even though all its mission-critical systems had completed the assessment phase.

In view of these problems, the Army has supplemented its efforts with AAA, the Army Inspector General, and contractor services. However, these initiatives are designed to identify systemic Year 2000 issues and assess the progress made toward resolving them based on data provided, and do not preclude the need for the Army Year 2000 Project Office to effectively and efficiently determine whether system managers are providing complete and accurate information and to ensure that they do. Also, until the Army provides increased oversight of components\u2019 efforts to plan for contingencies, prepare interface agreements, and acquire needed testing facilities, it cannot be assured that its mission-critical operations will not be severely degraded or disabled as a result of the Year 2000 problem."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of the Army direct the Army CIO to do the following:", "Require by July 30, 1998, that all Army components (1) correct their inventory databases, ensuring that they are accurate and complete, (2) certify all claims of Year 2000 compliance and submit completed certification checklists to the Army Year 2000 Project Office, (3) provide reliable Year 2000 cost estimates that are based on a comprehensive inventory and completed assessments of all mission-critical and major systems so that priorities can be established and informed resource trade-off decisions can be made, (4) prepare contingency plans that include specific actions for ensuring the continuity of the Army\u2019s critical operations at the Year 2000, (5) prepare memorandums of agreement for all identified interfaces, and (6) develop test plans and identify the need for additional testing resources.", "Require by July 30, 1998, that the Army Year 2000 Project Office ensure that the Army Year 2000 inventory database contains complete, accurate, and current information on Year 2000 status.
