For example, OMB established the Office of E-Government, designated its Assistant Director for Information Technology (IT) and E-Government as the office's Administrator in April 2003, and published guidance to federal agencies on implementing the act in August 2003. In most cases, OMB and federal agencies have taken action to address the act's requirements within stipulated time frames. For example, OMB established the Interagency Committee on Government Information in June 2003, within the deadline prescribed by the act. The committee is to develop recommendations on the categorization of government information and public access to electronic information. Even when deadlines have not yet passed, in all but one case OMB and agencies have taken action to implement the act. For example, federal courts have established informational Web sites in advance of the April 2005 deadline specified by the act, and court officials are taking steps to ensure that the Web sites fully meet the criteria stipulated by the act. Similarly, in most cases where deadlines are not specified, OMB and federal agencies have either fully implemented the provisions or demonstrated positive action toward implementation. For example, in May 2003, the E-Government Administrator issued a memorandum detailing procedures for requesting funds from the E-Government Fund, although the act did not specify a deadline for this action. Although the government has made progress in implementing the act, the act's requirements have not always been fully addressed. Specifically, OMB has not ensured that a study on using IT to enhance crisis preparedness and response has been conducted that addresses the content specified by the act, established a required program to encourage contractor innovation and excellence in facilitating the development and enhancement of electronic government services and processes, or ensured the development and maintenance of a required repository and Web site of information about research and development funded by the federal government. Further, GSA has not contracted with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a required study on disparities in Internet access for online government services. In the first three cases, OMB has either taken actions that are related to the act's provisions but do not fully address them (in the first and second cases) or has not yet made key decisions that would allow actions to take place (in the third case). In the last case, GSA is seeking funding for the required study in fiscal year 2006. Until these issues are addressed, the government may be at risk of not fully achieving the objective of the E-Government Act to promote better use of the Internet and other information technologies to improve government services and enhance opportunities for citizen participation in government."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The E-Government Act (E-Gov Act) of 2002 was enacted with the general  purpose of promoting better use of the Internet and other information  technologies to improve government services for citizens, internal  government operations, and opportunities for citizen participation in  government.

In April 2003, OMB established the Office of  E-Government (also known as the Office of E-Government and Information  Technology) and designated its Assistant Director for IT and E-Government  as its Administrator. Also in April 2003, OMB issued its second  E-Government Strategy, which laid out its approach to implementing the  E-Gov Act. In August 2003, OMB issued guidance to agencies on  implementing the act, and in March 2004, it issued its first annual report to  Congress on implementation of the act. In its report to Congress, OMB  summarized individual agency e-gov reports, described actions taken to  address the act\u2019s provisions, and provided details of the operation of the  E-Government Fund.", "As shown in table 1, OMB and designated federal agencies have taken steps  to implement the provisions of most of the major sections of Titles I and II  of the E-Gov Act that we reviewed. Specifically, apart from general  requirements applicable to all agencies, OMB and designated agencies have  already implemented the provisions of 7 of the 18 major sections, have  actions in progress to address provisions of another 7 sections, and have  not fully addressed provisions of the remaining 4 sections. Each of these 18  sections includes many specific provisions, such as developing and issuing  guidance and policies, conducting studies, initiating pilot projects, and  establishing specific programs and working groups. Appendix III contains  details of the specific provisions in each of these sections and their current  implementation status.", "OMB and designated federal agencies are taking actions to implement the  provisions of the act in most cases; however, the act\u2019s requirements have  not always been fully addressed.

For  example, OMB established the Interagency Committee on Government  Information in June 2003, within the deadline prescribed by the act. The  committee is to develop recommendations on the categorization of  government information and public access to electronic information. In  another example, as required by section 211, GSA developed and issued  procedures for the acquisition of IT by state and local governments through  Federal Supply Schedules, which previously had been available only to  federal agencies. Although the act required that the procedures be issued  by January 17, 2003, GSA did not finalize the new procedures until May  2004. The agency had issued a proposed rule to implement the procedures  on January 23, 2003, and an interim rule on May 7, 2003.", "In one case, OMB has not taken fully responsive action to address the  requirements of the act. Specifically, OMB did not ensure that a study on  using IT to enhance crisis preparedness and response was conducted that  addresses the content specified by the act. Section 214 of the act required,  within 90 days of enactment, that OMB ensure that this study is conducted,  and it specifies the content of the study. For example, the study was  required to address a research and implementation strategy for the  effective use of IT in crisis response and consequence management. OMB  was further required to report on findings and recommendations from this  study within 2 years of the study\u2019s initiation. According to DHS officials, a  study conducted by the MITRE Corporation for Project SAFECOM fulfills  this requirement. However, the MITRE study\u2014which was chiefly an  assessment of a Web tool for disseminating information about solutions to  the problem of interoperability among first responders\u2019 communications  systems\u2014did not address the content specified by the act. For example,  the study did not include research regarding use of IT to enhance crisis  preparedness, nor did it include a research and implementation strategy for  more effective use of IT in crisis response and consequence management.  Until the required elements of the study are addressed, OMB may not be  able to make a fully informed response to the act\u2019s requirement that it  report on findings and recommendations for improving the use of IT in  coordinating and facilitating information on disaster preparedness,  response, and recovery.", "In another case, GSA has not taken fully responsive action to address the  requirements of the act. Specifically, Section 215 required the  Administrator of GSA to contract with NAS by March 17, 2003, to conduct a  study on disparities in Internet access for online government services. GSA  was to submit a report to Congress on the findings, conclusions, and  recommendations of the study by December 2004. GSA officials reported  that they were unable to request funds as part of the fiscal year 2003 or  2004 budget cycles because the act passed in December 2002, after fiscal  year 2003 had begun and the deadline for fiscal year 2004 agency budget  submissions (August 2002) had passed. Although GSA officials did not  provide any information regarding their actions for fiscal year 2005, they  reported that the agency had requested the funds authorized in the act for  the fiscal year 2006 budget cycle and was working on compiling an interim  study based on existing research on disparities in access to the Internet.  This compilation report is expected to be completed by December 2004 and  submitted to Congress in OMB\u2019s annual report on implementation of the  act.", "For those provisions with future deadlines, OMB and agencies have taken  action to implement the act.

The committee structure, work plans, and interim products show  progress toward meeting this deadline. As another example, under section  205 of the act, federal courts are required to establish Web sites by April  2005 that provide information such as location, contact information, and  local and individual rules. By April 2007, these sites must also provide  access to documents that are filed electronically. In June 2004, officials  from the Administrative Office of the Courts reported that all 198 federal  courts had established Web sites, 10 months before the April 2005 deadline.

DHS officials  stated that the study addresses the section 214 requirement to conduct a  study on enhancement of crisis response. However, our analysis indicates  that the study in general did not address the use of IT to enhance crisis  preparedness, response, and consequence management of natural and  man-made disasters, as required by section 214. Specifically, the study did  not include a research and implementation strategy for effective use of IT  in crisis response and consequence management. The act states that this  strategy should include the more effective use of technologies;  management of IT research initiatives; and incorporation of research  advances into the information communication systems of FEMA and other  federal, state, and local agencies responsible for crisis preparedness,  response, and consequence management. Furthermore, the study did not  discuss opportunities for research and development on enhanced  technologies for potential improvement as determined during the course of  the study. OMB officials agreed that the study conducted by Project  SAFECOM did not address the requirements of the act. OMB officials  stated that a new study would be conducted to meet these requirements.  Until the required elements of the study are addressed, OMB may not be  able to make a fully informed response to the act\u2019s requirement that it  report on findings and recommendations for improving the use of IT in  coordinating and facilitating information on disaster preparedness,  response, and recovery.", "According to OMB officials, pilot projects expected to enhance the goal of  maximizing the use of IT are not planned. Instead, the focus of OMB\u2019s  efforts has been on other activities, such as the Disaster Management and  SAFECOM programs, which work with industry communities to improve  the requirements and develop standards for information sharing and  coordination of responsiveness. OMB officials stated that they would  determine at a future time whether initiation of pilot projects is necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disparities in Access to the Internet: Title II, Section 215", "paragraphs": ["Section 215 of the E-Government Act requires the GSA Administrator to  contract with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study  on disparities in Internet access for online government services. GSA is to  submit a report to Congress on the findings, conclusions, and  recommendations of the study by December 2004. The report is required to  address (1) how disparities in Internet access influence the effectiveness of  online government services, (2) how the increase in online government  services is influencing the disparities in Internet access and how  technology development or diffusion trends may offset such adverse  influences, and (3) related societal effects arising from the interplay of  disparities in Internet access and the increase in online government  services. Table 18 summarizes the actions required by this provision.", "GSA has not fully addressed the requirements of this section, because it has  not yet commissioned the required NAS study on disparities in Internet  access for online government services. Although the act authorizes  $950,000 to be spent on the study and report, a GSA official stated that no  money had yet been appropriated. GSA officials reported that they were  unable to request funds as part of the fiscal year 2003 or 2004 budget cycles  because the act passed in December 2002, after fiscal year 2003 had begun  and the deadline for fiscal year 2004 agency budget submissions (August  2002) had passed. Although GSA officials did not provide any information  regarding their actions for fiscal year 2005, they reported that the agency  had requested the funds authorized in the act for the fiscal year 2006 budget  cycle. Pending appropriation of the requested funds, GSA plans to enter  into a contract with NAS for the study, but notes that the report on the  study will not be completed within the statutory deadline of December  2004.", "In keeping with the purpose of this section, GSA officials and the  Interagency Committee on Government Information\u2019s E-Gov Act Access  working group are working on compiling an interim study based on  existing research on disparities in access to the Internet. The existing  research includes, for example, Hart-Teeter poll results and Pew Internet  and American Life Project studies.

According to OMB, the interagency group referred to in  the act is the Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC), which was  organized in 1990 under OMB Circular A-16. The FGDC is intended to  promote the coordinated use, sharing, and dissemination of geospatial data  on a national basis. The FGDC is chaired by the Secretary of the  Department of Interior, with the Deputy Director for Management at OMB  serving as Vice-Chair, and is made up of representatives from 19 cabinet- level and independent federal agencies.", "OMB also established the Geospatial One-Stop initiative in 2002 to  facilitate the development of common protocols for geographic  information systems by bringing together various stakeholders to  coordinate effective and efficient ways to align geographic information. In  addition, the purpose of the Geospatial One-Stop is to make it faster, easier,  and less expensive for all levels of government to obtain necessary  geospatial data in order to make programmatic decisions.", "Actions taken by FGDC to promote collaboration include creating a  standards working group made up of federal and state agencies, academia,  and the private sector. The working group has developed, and FGDC has  endorsed, a number of different geospatial standards, including metadata  standards, and it is currently developing additional standards.
