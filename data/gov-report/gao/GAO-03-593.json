DOE's main strategy for treating high-level waste continues to include separating and concentrating much of the radioactivity into a smaller volume for disposal in a geologic repository. Under the initiative, DOE sites are evaluating other approaches, such as disposing of more waste on site. DOE's current savings estimate for these approaches is $29 billion, but the estimate may not be reliable or complete. For example, the savings estimate does not adequately reflect uncertainties or take into account the timing of when savings will be realized. DOE faces significant legal and technical challenges to realize these savings. A key legal challenge involves DOE's authority to decide that some waste with relatively low concentrations of radioactivity can be disposed of on site. This authority is being challenged in court, and a prolonged challenge or an adverse decision could seriously hamper DOE's ability to meet its accelerated schedules. A key technical challenge is that DOE's approach relies on laboratory testing to confirm separation of the waste into high-level and low-activity portions. At the Hanford Site in Washington State, DOE plans to build a facility before integrated testing of the separation technology--an approach that has failed on other projects in the past, resulting in significant cost increases and schedule delays. DOE is exploring proposals, such as increasing the amount of high-level waste in each disposal canister, which if successful could result in billions of dollars in additional savings. However, considerable evaluation remains to be done.

As of 2003, one  major aspect of this effort, DOE\u2019s high-level waste cleanup program,  was estimated to cost nearly $105 billion and take decades to complete.  High-level waste contains radioactive elements, such as plutonium and  uranium, in concentrations sufficient to require long-term isolation from  the environment. DOE\u2019s high-level waste results from the process of  dissolving used (or \u201cspent\u201d) nuclear fuel to remove plutonium, uranium,  and other useful materials. During some of the processing, solvents and  other materials can be introduced, creating waste that is both radioactive  and chemically hazardous. About 94 million gallons of untreated high-level  waste is stored at DOE facilities at Hanford, Washington; Savannah River,  South Carolina; and near Idaho Falls, Idaho\u2014primarily in underground  tanks. This waste would fill an area the size of a football field to a depth of  about 260 feet. Since the 1980s, DOE has been actively working on ways  to prepare this waste for permanent disposal. These plans center on  eventually placing high-level waste in an underground repository where  it can be safely stored for thousands of years.", "After investing more than 20 years and about $18 billion, DOE  acknowledged that the program to clean up its high-level waste was  far behind schedule, far over budget, and in need of major change. In  February 2002, DOE began an initiative to accelerate the schedule and  reduce the costs of cleaning up high-level and other radioactive and  hazardous waste, while focusing its resources on reducing risks to  human health and the environment at its sites. Although this initiative  covers DOE\u2019s entire cleanup program, it may have the most significant  impact on DOE\u2019s plans for high-level waste, which is the highest  cost component of DOE\u2019s cleanup program. In this context, you asked  us to (1) describe the components of DOE\u2019s high-level waste and the  process involved in preparing the waste for permanent disposal,  (2) discuss DOE\u2019s initiative for accelerating its high-level waste  cleanup and assess the reliability of the associated potential cost  savings, (3) identify the legal and technical challenges DOE faces  regarding this initiative, and (4) determine any additional opportunities  to reduce the costs, as well as opportunities to improve the management  of its high-level waste program.", "This report is based largely on our detailed work at DOE sites where  high-level waste is currently stored and our analysis of cost information  and legal documents pertaining to the high-level waste program. We  obtained the assistance of a physicist with extensive experience in the  nuclear field to evaluate the technical aspects of DOE\u2019s high-level waste  program. A detailed discussion of our scope and methodology is included  in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["High-level waste contains radioactive components that emit dangerously  intense radiation. Radiation is generated through a decay process in which  the atoms of a radioactive component (also known as a radionuclide)  lose their radioactivity by spontaneously releasing energy in the form of  subatomic particles or rays similar to X-rays. Even short but extremely  intense exposure to radiation can cause almost immediate health  problems such as radiation sickness, burns, and, in severe cases, death.  Excessive exposure to these particles or rays damages cells in living  tissue and is believed to cause long-term health problems such as genetic  mutations and an increased risk of cancer. Because of the intense  radiation emitted from high-level waste, the waste must be isolated and  handled remotely behind heavy shielding such as a layer of concrete in  order to protect humans and the environment. In addition to the intense  radioactivity, some of the radioactive components can be very mobile in  the environment and may migrate quickly to contaminate the soil and  groundwater if not immobilized. Besides radioactive components, DOE  high-level waste also generally contains hazardous components added  during the process of dissolving used nuclear fuel to remove plutonium  and other nuclear materials. These hazardous components include  solvents, acids, caustic sodas, and toxic heavy metals such as chromium  and lead. Radioactive waste components, when combined with hazardous  components, are referred to as \u201cmixed wastes.\u201d", "DOE has a vast complex of sites across the nation dedicated to the nuclear  weapons program, but the high-level waste stemming from reprocessing  spent fuel to produce weapons material such as plutonium and uranium  has been limited mainly to three sites\u2014Hanford, Washington; the Idaho  National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (\u201cIdaho National  Laboratory\u201d) near Idaho Falls, Idaho; and Savannah River, South Carolina.  DOE largely ceased production of plutonium and enriched uranium by  1992, but the waste remains. Most of the tanks in which it is stored have  already exceeded their design life. For example, many of Hanford\u2019s and  Savannah River\u2019s tanks were built in the 1940s to 1960s and were designed  to last 10-40 years. (Figure 1 shows waste storage tanks being constructed  at the Hanford Site.) These tanks, most of which are underground, are  used to store high-level waste. Leaks from some of these tanks were first  detected at Hanford in 1956 and at Savannah River in 1959. Given the age  and deteriorating condition of some of the tanks, there is concern that  some of them will leak additional waste into the soil, where it may migrate  to the water table.", "Treatment and disposal of high-level waste produced at DOE facilities  are governed by a number of federal laws, including laws that define the  roles of DOE and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in waste  management. The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA) and the Energy  Reorganization Act of 1974 established responsibility for the regulatory  control of radioactive materials including DOE\u2019s high-level wastes. The  Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 assigned the NRC the function of  licensing facilities that are expressly authorized for long-term storage of  high-level radioactive waste generated by DOE and others. The Nuclear  Waste Policy Act of 1982, as amended, defines high-level radioactive waste  as \u201cthe highly radioactive material resulting from the reprocessing of spent  nuclear fuel, including liquid waste produced directly in reprocessing and  any solid material derived from such liquid waste that contains fission  products in sufficient concentrations, and\u2026other highly radioactive  material that the \u2026determines\u2026requires permanent isolation.\u201d  The act also established a process for developing and siting a geologic  repository (a permanent deep disposal system) for the disposal of  high-level waste and spent fuel. Regarding DOE\u2019s high-level waste, the act  provided that unless the President determined that a separate repository  was required for such waste, DOE should arrange for the use of  commercial repositories developed under the act for disposal of its  defense waste. In 1985, President Reagan decided that a separate  repository for defense waste was not needed. Under amendments the  Federal Facility Compliance Act of 1992 made to the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (RCRA), DOE generally must  develop waste treatment plans for its sites that contain mixed wastes.  These plans are approved by states that the Environmental Protection  Agency (EPA) has authorized to administer RCRA or by EPA in states that  have not been so authorized.", "DOE carries out its high-level waste cleanup program under the leadership  of the Assistant Secretary for Environmental Management and in  consultation with a variety of stakeholders. In addition to the EPA and  state environmental agencies that have regulatory authority in states  where the sites are located, stakeholders include county and local  governmental agencies, citizen groups, advisory groups, and Native  American tribes. These stakeholders advocate their views through  various public involvement processes including site-specific advisory  boards. Over the years, much of the cleanup activity has been  implemented under compliance agreements between DOE and the  regulatory agencies. These compliance agreements provide for  establishing legally enforceable schedule milestones that govern the  work to be done."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOE\u2019s High-Level Waste Is a Complex Mixture That Requires a Multi-Step Process to Prepare for Disposal", "paragraphs": ["The waste in the tanks at Hanford, Savannah River, and the Idaho  National Laboratory is a complex mixture of radioactive and hazardous  components, and DOE\u2019s process for preparing it for disposal is designed to  separate much of the radioactive material from other waste components.  In the tanks, this mixture has transformed into a variety of liquid and  semisolid forms. The radioactive components are of many different types;  some remain dangerous for millions of years, while others lose much of  their radioactivity in relatively short periods of time. Because most of the  radioactive components decay relatively rapidly, over 90 percent of the  current radioactivity will dissipate within 100 years. DOE plans to isolate  the radioactive components and prepare the waste for disposal through  the use of an extensive and sequential multi-step treatment process. To  fulfill its current commitment to federal and state regulators, DOE  expects this process to concentrate at least 90 percent of the radioactivity  into a much smaller volume that can be permanently isolated for at  least 10,000 years in a geologic repository.

In addition, a small portion  of the waste volume is also in solid form and is stored in facilities other  than tanks. At the Idaho National Laboratory, some waste is stored in  stainless steel bins, enclosed in concrete vaults, after having undergone a  thermal process that converted the liquid into a solid granular substance  called calcine. At Hanford, some high-level waste was retrieved from the  tanks, dried, and stored as solid material in stainless steel capsules.", "The various layers of waste in the tanks are not uniformly distributed and  often differ from tank to tank and even from place to place within a tank.  Depending on how the waste was generated and whether it was mixed or  transferred from one tank to another, the layers of waste within any given  tank may be unevenly distributed and liquid is interspersed between  layers of saltcake. Some tanks contain all three main waste forms\u2014sludge,  saltcake, and liquid\u2014while others contain only one or two forms. Tank  contents also vary among sites. For example, at the Idaho National  Laboratory most tanks contain primarily liquid waste because the waste  was kept in an acidic form, while at Hanford and Savannah River, most  tanks contain waste in two or three physical forms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Much of the Radioactivity Declines Relatively Quickly", "paragraphs": ["The radioactive components of the high-level waste vary greatly in terms  of how long they remain radioactive, with the vast majority losing their  radioactivity within years or decades. Each radioactive component, or  radionuclide, in high-level waste loses its radioactivity at a rate that differs  for each component. This rate of decay, which cannot be changed, is  measured in \u201chalf-lives\u201d\u2014that is, the time required for half of the  unstable atoms to decay and release their radiation. The half-lives of  major radionuclides in the high-level waste range from 2.6 minutes for  barium-137m to 24,131 years for plutonium-239. To illustrate, for any  given number of radioactive barium-137m atoms, half will lose their  radioactivity within 2.6 minutes. After another 2.6 minutes, half of the  remaining unstable atoms will lose their radioactivity, leaving only one- fourth of the original number of unstable atoms still radioactive. The  process is the same, but the half-life intervals much longer, for long-lived  radionuclides, such as plutonium-239 atoms. For radioactive plutonium- 239 atoms, half will lose their radioactivity within 24,131 years, and half of  the remainder will lose their radioactivity after another 24,131 years.", "Currently, nearly all of the radioactivity in DOE\u2019s high-level waste  originates from radionuclides with half-lives of about 30 years or less. As  table 1 shows, about 98 percent of the radioactivity of the high-level waste  comes from four radionuclides: barium-137m, cesium-137, strontium-90,  and yttrium-90. Of these, cesium-137 is the longest lived, with a half-life of  30.17 years.", "The relatively short half-lives of most of the radionuclides in the waste  means that much of the total current radioactivity will decay within  100 years. For example, within 30 years, about 50 percent of the current  radioactivity in DOE\u2019s wastes will have decayed away, and within  100 years, this figure will rise to more than 90 percent. Figure 3 shows the  pattern of decay, using 2002 to 2102 as the 100-year period. Extending the  analysis beyond the 100-year period shown in the figure, in 300 years,  99.8 percent of the radioactivity will have decayed, leaving 0.2 percent of  the current radioactivity remaining.", "Despite the relatively rapid decay of the current radioactivity in high-level  waste, a variety of long-lived radionuclides will remain radioactive for  a very long time and must be isolated from the environment.

Once the  radionuclides with relatively short half-lives have decayed away, the  longer-lived radionuclides will be the primary source of radioactivity in the  waste. Some of these long-lived radionuclides, such as technetium-99, are  potentially very mobile in the environment and therefore must remain  permanently isolated.

Contaminated water currently represents 54 percent of the  total waste by volume across the DOE complex. In overview, DOE\u2019s  process generally involves separating the waste into two main streams.  One, the high-level portion, will contain at least 90 percent of the  radioactivity and a small portion of the waste volume. The other stream,  the low-activity portion, will contain 10 percent or less of the total  radioactivity but most of the waste volume.", "DOE\u2019s plans for treating the waste currently call for a set of steps to be  applied to the waste at each site.

At West Valley, separation of  the low-activity portion from the high-level portion of the waste reduced  by 90 percent the quantity of waste requiring permanent isolation and  disposal at a geologic repository. The high-level portion was stabilized in a  glass material (vitrified) and remains stored at the site pending completion  of the high-level waste geologic repository and resolution of other issues  associated with disposal costs.

Based on these strategies, DOE set a goal  of achieving up to $34 billion in savings at its three high-level waste sites  and reducing the waste cleanup schedule by about 20 to 35 years  compared to the existing program baseline. As of April 2003, DOE\u2019s  strategies were still under development, and DOE had revised the  savings estimate to $29 billion. However, even the $29 billion estimate may  not be reliable.

The initiative came as a result of an internal  review of the cleanup program, which identified numerous problems  and recommended a number of corrective actions. Among other  things, the review noted that the cleanup program was not based on a  comprehensive, coherent, technically supported risk prioritization; was  not focused on accelerating risk reduction; and was not addressing the  challenges of uncontrolled cost and schedule growth. A main focus of the  initiative is high-level waste, including both the technical approach to  treating the waste and improving how DOE manages the contracts and  project activities.", "DOE developed strategies to speed the cleanup and reduce risk at all  three sites.

However, the savings do not  account for uncertainties, such as whether alternatives to vitrification  will succeed and at what cost. Rather than reflecting uncertainties by  providing a range of savings, DOE\u2019s savings estimate is a single point  estimate of $7 billion.", "Regarding nonbudgetary impacts, DOE\u2019s savings estimates generally  did not fully assess the value of potential nonbudgetary impacts, such  as a change in the level of risk to workers or potential effects on the  environment. OMB guidelines recommend identification and, where  possible, quantification of other expected benefits and costs to society  when evaluating alternative plans. An example where nonbudgetary  impacts were partially, but not fully, considered is the Idaho National  Laboratory. The Idaho National Laboratory\u2019s accelerated plan notes that  its proposal not to vitrify its calcined high-level waste significantly reduces  risk to workers and the environment by eliminating the exposure that  would have been incurred in cleaning up and decommissioning the  vitrification facility once waste treatment had been completed. While site  officials told us such analyses are currently underway, the impact has not  yet been reflected in the savings estimate. However, the proposal does not  assess potential increases in environmental risk, if any, from disposing of  the waste without stabilizing it into a vitrified form.

Focusing on the radioactivity and constituents would allow DOE to use  less costly and less complicated treatment approaches for the majority of  what is now managed as high-level waste.", "DOE has developed a process for deciding when waste in the tanks should  not be considered high-level waste. In July1999, DOE issued Order 435.1  setting forth procedures for the management of its radioactive wastes.  Under this order, DOE formalized its process for determining which waste  is incidental to reprocessing (\u201cincidental waste\u201d), not high level waste,  and therefore will not be sent to a geological repository for high-level  waste disposal.

The criteria were  developed in conjunction with the NRC, the governmental entity with  regulatory authority over disposal facilities for high-level waste. The  criteria generally are that the waste (1) has been or will be processed to  remove key radioactive components to the maximum extent technically  and economically practical; (2) will be disposed of in conformance  with the safety requirements for low-activity waste as laid out in NRC  regulations; and (3) will be put in a solid physical form and will not exceed  radioactivity levels set by the NRC for the most radioactive category of  low-level waste, referred to as \u201cClass C standard.\u201d DOE must first satisfy  itself internally that these requirements have been met for waste it wants  to determine is waste incidental to reprocessing and therefore not  high-level waste. DOE then obtains a technical review of its determination  from the NRC, which provides a concurrence that DOE has met its  criteria.

For  example, DOE plans to use its incidental waste process to manage about  90 percent of its 54 million gallons of tank waste at Hanford as low-level  waste, rather than process it through a high-level waste vitrification  facility. Using that approach, most of the waste would be eligible for  treatment and disposal on-site. Such an approach would be less expensive  than treating all of the waste as high-level waste and sending it for disposal  in a high-level waste geologic repository. DOE has no current estimate  of the cost increase if all 94 million gallons of tank wastes had to be  treated in a high-level waste vitrification facility and stored at a geological  repository. However, a 1996 environmental impact statement at the  Hanford Site estimated such an alternative for the Hanford Site alone  would add about $29 billion to $37 billion (in 1995 dollars), nearly doubling  project costs at that site alone, primarily due to increased disposal costs at  the repository. Furthermore, there would probably not be enough space at  the high-level waste repository to dispose of all of this waste.", "Hanford is not the only site affected; as of April 2003, DOE had developed  incidental waste determinations for waste at all four of its high-level waste  sites. In all, DOE had used its authority to designate some of its tank  waste as low-level or transuranic waste in seven separate incidental waste  determinations (see table 5). Although two of these determinations were  approved prior to the issuance of Order 435.1, DOE essentially followed  the same criteria found in the subsequent order. DOE is planning to  initiate further incidental waste determinations as it removes the waste  from additional tanks.", "DOE is currently involved in a lawsuit focused on its authority to make  incidental waste determinations. In March 2002, the Natural Resources  Defense Council and others filed a lawsuit challenging DOE\u2019s authority  to manage its wastes through its incidental waste process. A primary  concern of the plaintiffs is that DOE will use its incidental waste process  to permanently leave intensely radioactive waste sediments in the tanks  with only minimal treatment. The lawsuit alleges that DOE\u2019s incidental  waste process improperly allows DOE to reclassify high-level waste as  incidental waste that does not need to be treated in the same way as  high-level waste. According to the plaintiffs, the Nuclear Waste Policy  Act defines all waste originating from a given source\u2014that is, from  reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel\u2014as high-level waste and requires  that such waste be managed as high-level waste, yet DOE has chosen to  differentiate its wastes according to the level of radioactivity and manage  them accordingly.", "This is not the first legal action that resulted from DOE\u2019s process for  determining which part of its waste can be designated as incidental to  reprocessing and will not be managed as high-level waste. For example,  in 1993, the NRC denied a formal petition from the states of Washington  and Oregon requesting that NRC establish the process and criteria for  determining what part of DOE\u2019s radioactive waste could be managed as  other than high-level waste. The states\u2019 request stemmed from concerns  that the criteria DOE was applying to wastes had not been formally  established by regulation and thus had not been given public scrutiny.  The NRC, in its ruling, concluded that DOE\u2019s process for determining  what waste was incidental to reprocessing was appropriate for making  individual tank-by-tank incidental waste determinations, and that the NRC  had no jurisdiction. Later, in 1998, the Natural Resources Defense Council  petitioned the NRC to assume immediate licensing authority over the  51 tanks at the Savannah River Site, arguing that DOE invented the term  \u201cincidental waste\u201d as a means of circumventing NRC\u2019s authority and  oversight and, furthermore, that waste to be left in the bottom of the tanks  at Savannah River did not meet DOE\u2019s own definition of incidental waste.", "The NRC concluded it did not have regulatory authority over high-level or  residual wastes at Savannah River."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Uncertainty about DOE\u2019s Authority Could Delay Implementing New Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The current legal challenge, as well as any future challenges, could  affect DOE\u2019s efforts to implement its accelerated treatment and disposal  strategies.

DOE is  concerned that moving forward to implement such determinations could  create a risk that the court could place a general ban on making any  decisions about the waste until the legal challenge is resolved. In addition,  final resolution of the challenge could be further delayed if either party  appeals the decision.", "A lengthy legal process could result in delays in moving forward  with treatment plans for this waste and delays in closing tanks on an  accelerated schedule. For example, the Idaho National Laboratory plans  to begin closing tanks in the spring of 2003, but approval for the incidental  waste determination to close the tanks by managing tank waste residuals  as low-level waste is still pending. A DOE official at the Idaho National  Laboratory told us that while a delay of several months in obtaining  incidental waste approval would not present an immediate threat to  schedule dates, a delay beyond 24 months would seriously impact the  site\u2019s ability to meet its accelerated 2012 date to close all of the tanks.  Savannah River also plans to begin closing additional tanks starting in  early 2004. A DOE official at the Savannah River Site said that if the  lawsuit continues, the site may miss a legally binding date agreed to with  regulators to begin closing the tanks.", "If the court invalidated DOE\u2019s incidental waste determination process,  DOE may need to find an alternative solution for treating and managing  its wastes that would allow it to treat waste with lower concentrations of  radioactivity less expensively. In that case, DOE could begin experiencing  delays affecting progress at all three of the high-level waste sites that rely  on incidental waste determinations. For example, as one of its savings  strategies, DOE plans to manage about 12.3 million gallons of its waste  at Savannah River as low-level waste and treat this waste through a  grout facility. DOE estimates it could begin treating this waste as  early as August 2003. Although DOE has approved an incidental waste  determination for this waste, the grout treatment facility must receive an  operating permit from state regulators. To date, the state has withheld  approval for the permit, pending resolution of the lawsuit. A site official  said without the permit, DOE cannot go forward with its plans to  accelerate treatment of the waste.", "At this point, the department does not appear to have a strategy in  place to avoid the potential effects of challenges to its incidental waste  determination authority, either from the current lawsuit or future  challenges. In a December 2002 internal memorandum, the Assistant  Secretary for Environmental Management issued guidelines for proceeding  with making incidental waste determinations as necessary to meet cleanup  commitments and requirements. However, these guidelines only include  ensuring that such determinations meet the legal requirements of  Order 435.1; the guidelines do not include any alternative strategies  for dealing with the waste. DOE officials told us that they believe the  department will prevail in the legal challenge. Because the outcome of the  lawsuit is so uncertain, DOE believes it would be premature to explore  alternative strategies to overcome potentially significant delays to the  program that could result from a protracted legal conflict or from an  adverse decision. As of April 2003, DOE had just begun to look at potential  delays that could result from a lengthy legal challenge, but had developed  no formal strategy to deal with those delays.

Doing so would require a much larger repository  than currently planned and drive up disposal costs by billions of dollars.

The  laboratory testing includes a combination of pilot-scale testing of major  individual processes and use of operational data for certain of those  processes for which DOE officials said they had extensive experience.

In addition  to this order, DOE has drafted supplementary project management  guidance.

In an effort to resolve this uncertainty,  DOE\u2019s construction contractor has asked the manufacturer to  expand resin production capability, and in April 2003, DOE signed a  contract modification that allows alternative resins to be used in the  separation process.", "Given these and other uncertainties, Hanford\u2019s construction  contractor and outside experts have seen Hanford\u2019s approach as  having high technical risk and have recommended integrated testing  during project development.", "In April 2002, concerned about the potential for operational problems  with the waste separation processes, Hanford\u2019s construction contractor  proposed building an integrated testing facility to confirm that Hanford\u2019s  processes will work at a significantly larger scale than has been tested to  date. The contractor proposed conducting fully integrated tests in a pilot  facility using simulated waste before full-scale separation facilities are  completed. The contractor estimated the cost of the pilot facility at  between $6 million and $12 million.  In October 2002, an independent peer review group of industry experts  concluded that an integrated pilot plant for interim testing to confirm the  technical processes was a preferred approach.

While laboratory tests of this process were viewed as  successful, DOE did not conduct adequate testing of the components  until it started full-scale operations in the newly constructed facility. DOE  followed this approach, in part, because the technology was commercially  available. When DOE started full-scale operations, major problems  occurred. Benzene, a dangerously flammable byproduct, was produced in  large quantities. Operations were stopped after DOE spent about  $500 million because experts could not explain how or why benzene was  being produced and could not determine how to economically reconfigure  the facility to minimize it. Consequences of this technology failure  included significant cost increases, schedule delays, a full-scale facility  that did not work, and a less-than-optimum waste treatment operation  without a viable separation process. Savannah River is now taking steps to  develop and implement a new separation technology at an additional cost  of about $1.8 billion and a delay of about 7 years.", "Subsequent assessments of the problems that developed at Savannah  River found that DOE (1) relied on laboratory-scale tests to demonstrate  separation processes, (2) believed that technical problems could be  resolved later during facility construction and startup, and (3) decided to  scale up the technology from lab tests to full-scale without the benefit of  using additional testing facilities to confirm that processes would work at  a larger scale. Officials at Hanford are following this same approach.

These factors affect the percentage  of waste than can be placed in each canister because they indicate the  likelihood that radioactive constituents could leach out of the  immobilizing glass medium and into the environment.

Similarly, the Office of Management and  Budget guidance states that agencies should validate earlier planning  decisions with updated information before finalizing decisions to  construct facilities. This validation is particularly important where early  cost comparisons are susceptible to uncertainties and change.", "However, DOE does not always follow this guidance. Proceeding without  rigorous review has been a recurring cause of many of the problems we  have identified in past DOE projects. For example, regarding the need to  validate planning decisions with updated information before finalizing  decisions, the decision at Hanford to construct a vitrification plant to  treat Hanford\u2019s low-activity waste has not undergone such a validation.  Hanford\u2019s analysis justifying the cost of this approach was prepared in  1999 and was based on technical performance data, disposal assumptions,  and cost data developed in the early to mid-1990s\u2014conditions that are no  longer applicable. For example, the 1999 analysis compared DOE\u2019s  low-activity vitrification approach with a disposal approach developed  in the early 1990s that involved large underground grout vaults with  elaborate environmental controls. Although this grout approach was  abandoned in 1994, DOE still used these disposal assumptions for the 1999  comparison and analysis. Since that time other conditions have changed,  including the performance capabilities of alternative technologies such as  grout, the relative costs of different technologies, and the amount of waste  DOE actually intends to process through a vitrification plant. These  changes suggest that earlier planning decisions need to be validated with  updated information to ensure that the current approach is reasonable and  appropriate. DOE\u2019s high-level waste project team also recognized that the  DOE officials at Hanford had not performed a current, rigorous analysis  of low-activity waste treatment options including the use of grout as an  alternative to vitrification, and encouraged the Hanford site to update  its analysis based on current waste treatment and disposal assumptions.  Hanford officials responded in April 2003 by developing life-cycle  cost estimates that compared the cost of alternate low-activity waste  approaches. However, they did not fully reassess the decision to vitrify  low-activity waste. DOE officials at Hanford told us they do not plan to  reassess the decision to construct a low-activity vitrification facility  because their compliance agreement with the state of Washington calls for  vitrification of this waste.

Between the time  that DOE decided to develop on-site disposal facilities at these three sites  and the time that construction actually began, conditions changed that  affected the usefulness of earlier cost estimates.

We reported in July 1999 that the maturity of a technology  at the start of a project is an important determinant of success. As  technology develops from preconceptual design through preliminary  design and testing, the maturity of the technology increases and the risks  associated with incorporating that design into a project decrease. Waiting  until technology is well-developed and tested before integrating it into a  project will greatly increase the chances of meeting cost, schedule, and  technical baselines. On the other hand, integrating technology that is  not fully mature into a project greatly increases the risk of having cost  increases and schedule delays. According to industry experts, correcting  problems after a project has begun can cost 10 times as much as resolving  technology problems beforehand.", "DOE\u2019s project management guidance issued in October 2000 is consistent  with these best practices. The guidance discusses technology development  and sets out suggested steps to ensure that new technology is brought  to a sufficient level of maturity at each decision point in a project. For  example, during the conceptual design phase of a project, \u201cproof of  concept\u201d testing should be performed before approval to proceed to the  preliminary design phase. Furthermore, the guidance states that projects  that attempt to concurrently develop the technology and design the facility  proceed with ill-defined risks to all three baselines\u2014cost, schedule,  and technical.", "Nevertheless, as we discussed earlier in this report, DOE sites continue  to integrate immature technologies into their projects. For example, at  Hanford, DOE is constructing a facility to separate high-level waste  components, although integrated testing of the many steps in the  separations process has not occurred and will not occur until after the  facility is completed. DOE, trying to keep the project on schedule and  within budget, has decided the risks associated with this approach are  acceptable. However, there are many projects in which this approach  created schedule delays and unexpected costs. The continued reliance on  this approach in the face of so many past problems is a signal of an area  that needs careful attention as DOE proceeds with its management reform  efforts.

Both DOE guidance and external reviews stress the importance of  adequate upfront planning before beginning project construction. DOE\u2019s  project management guidance identifies a series of well-defined steps  before construction begins and suggests that complex projects with  treatment processes that have never before been combined into a facility  do not lend themselves to being expedited. However, DOE guidance  does not explicitly prohibit a fast-track\u2014or concurrent design and  construction\u2014approach to complex, one-of-a-kind projects, and DOE  often follows this approach. For example, at the Hanford Site, DOE is  concurrently designing and constructing facilities for the largest, most  complex environmental cleanup project in the United States. Problems  are already surfacing. Only 24 months after the contract was awarded, the  project was 10 months behind schedule dates, construction activities have  outpaced design work causing inefficient work sequencing, and DOE has  withheld performance fee from the design/construction contractor  because of these problems.", "DOE experienced similar problems in concurrent design and construction  activities on other waste treatment facilities. Both the spent nuclear fuel  project at Hanford and the waste separations facility at the Savannah River  Site encountered schedule delays and cost increases in part because the  concurrent approach led to mistakes and rework, and required extra time  and money to address the problems. In its 2001 follow-up report on DOE  project management, the National Research Council noted that inadequate  pre-construction planning and definition of project scope led to cost and  schedule overruns on DOE\u2019s cleanup projects. The Council reported that  research studies suggest that inadequate project definition accounts for  50 percent of the cost increases for environmental remediation projects.", "Again, no team is specifically examining the \u201cfast-track\u201d approach, yet  it frequently contributed to past problems and DOE continues to use  this approach."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOE\u2019s efforts to improve its high-level waste cleanup program and to rein  in the uncontrolled growth in project costs and schedules are important  and necessary. The accelerated cleanup initiative represents at least the  hope of treating and disposing of the waste in a more economical and  timely way, although the actual savings are unknown at this time.  Furthermore, specific components of this initiative face key legal and  technical challenges. Much of the potential for success rests on DOE\u2019s  continued ability to dispose of large quantities of waste with relatively low  concentrations of radioactivity on-site by applying its incidental waste  process. DOE\u2019s authority in this regard has been challenged in a lawsuit  that is still pending. Much of the success also rests on DOE\u2019s ability to  obtain successful technical performance from its as-yet unproven waste  separation processes. Any technical problems with these processes will  likely result in costly delays. At DOE\u2019s Hanford Site, we believe the  potential for such problems warrants reconsidering the need for more  thorough testing of the processes.", "DOE\u2019s accelerated cleanup initiative should mark the beginning, not  the end, of DOE\u2019s efforts to identify other opportunities to improve the  program by accomplishing the work more quickly, more effectively, or at  less cost.

DOE cited its recent initiative to accelerate cleanup and  reduce environmental risks as its response to those challenges. DOE  agreed to consider our recommendation to seek clarification from the  Congress regarding DOE\u2019s authority to determine what waste is incidental  to reprocessing, if legal challenges to DOE\u2019s authority to make such  determinations have a significant effect on implementing proposed  cost-saving and risk-reduction initiatives. However, DOE disagreed with  our recommendation that it conduct integrated pilot testing of its waste  separation processes at Hanford while constructing a full-scale facility. In  addition, regarding opportunities to improve program management, DOE  said that at the Hanford project it was already effectively conducting  rigorous analyses to support decision-making, incorporating new  technologies into the project consistent with best practices and agency  guidelines, and using a fast-track approach of concurrently designing and  building complex nuclear facilities.", "Regarding our recommendation that DOE pursue integrated, pilot-scale  testing of the waste separations facility at Hanford, DOE believes that  its current approach is adequate to manage the risks associated with  designing and constructing the facility. DOE said that it does not intend to  pursue an integrated pilot test facility that we believe would increase the  chances of success with the full-scale facility. DOE\u2019s position is based on  two main arguments. DOE believes that (1) the technologies planned for  the separations facility are commercially available and thus are mature  technologies having low technical risk and (2) relying on pilot testing of  individual components of the separation processes in the laboratory  provides adequate mitigation of the risks involved.", "We disagree with DOE\u2019s view that the separations approach planned for  the Hanford Site is low risk. DOE has experience with the individual  technologies, but does not have experience in operating an integrated  separations process that incorporates all of the operations required for  Hanford\u2019s unique and complex waste. Furthermore, DOE has experienced  problems with another separation facility where adequate testing was not  done until the facility was fully constructed\u2014the in-tank precipitation  facility at Savannah River. In that case, the separations process failed  after DOE spent about $500 million trying to make it work properly.  And the primary technologies used at Savannah River were also in use  commercially, but had not been fully adapted to the unique Savannah  River wastes.", "We also disagree that DOE\u2019s plan to conduct extensive testing in the  laboratory to mitigate the technology risks involved with the separation  processes will provide adequate assurance that the full-scale separations  facility will perform effectively. Numerous experts and DOE\u2019s contractor  have proposed constructing and operating an integrated pilot-scale facility.  They made the proposals while knowing about DOE\u2019s intention to conduct  extensive laboratory testing of separation processes. The contractor as  well as outside experts view the separations facility as having significant  project risk, in contrast to DOE\u2019s statement that the separation processes  pose low project risk. Given the risks associated with fully constructing  the separations facility before conducting integrated testing and the  cost of any delays associated with having significant problems with the  separation processes once the facility is fully constructed, we continue  to believe that conducting integrated pilot-scale testing is an important  risk- and schedule-management tool and that DOE should reconsider its  use for the Hanford project. DOE officials at Hanford acknowledged that  the pilot facility could be included in the project without extending the  project\u2019s schedule.", "Regarding management improvement issues, DOE said that we  inadequately portrayed the progress it has made in the three areas in  which we recommended management improvements. However, our report  addresses the three management issues from the broader context of DOE\u2019s  project activities over several years and at a number of sites. Our past  work has clearly linked these weaknesses to problems on cleanup  projects. Because DOE did not take issue with that broader context in  this report, but did assert improved performance on the Hanford project,  the following comments are limited to needed improvements to the  Hanford project.", "Regarding DOE\u2019s view that it performed current and rigorous analyses  of risks, cost, and benefits for the Hanford waste treatment project, our  report illustrates our concerns about the analysis DOE performed to  support its decision to vitrify a portion of Hanford\u2019s low-activity waste.  DOE stated that this decision, originally made in 1994, has been revisited  numerous times using rigorous analysis and provided us with three studies  that specifically compared the cost of low-activity waste vitrification with  other approaches, such as grout, to support its decision. None of these  studies included a current and rigorous analysis of risks, costs, and  benefits, as called for in OMB guidance. For example, even the most  recent study, completed in 2003, was primarily based on technical  performance, disposal assumptions, and cost data developed in the early  1990s. The team leader of the high-level waste project team confirmed that  these analyses were not a full and rigorous assessment of the risks, cost,  and benefits of vitrifying low-activity waste. Thus, we continue to believe  that additional efforts are needed in this area.", "Regarding our recommendation to follow best practices and DOE  guidance when incorporating new technology into cleanup projects, DOE  commented that it was continuing to consider opportunities to improve  the Hanford project and that the contractor was using a risk-based  management process to address technical and programmatic project  risks. We agree that a risk-based management process is appropriate on  the project. However, we continue to believe that DOE\u2019s approach to  incorporating the separation technologies planned for the Hanford project  is not fully consistent with best practices and DOE guidance because the  approach involves incorporating technologies into the project before  they have been fully tested as an integrated process. This testing of the  integrated process in an operational mode is needed to demonstrate  that the technologies are sufficiently mature to ensure their effective  performance when deployed on the project.", "Concerning the appropriateness of using a \u201cfast-track\u201d construction  approach to design and construct complex nuclear facilities for the  Hanford project, DOE said that our report incorrectly portrays the  overall strategy for the Hanford project.

We agree and have modified the final report to clarify that the  low-activity portion of the separated tank waste would be immobilized  and disposed of permanently on-site, or at other designated locations.  2.  We agree and have modified the final report to clarify that DOE\u2019s  approach generally involves separating the waste into two main  streams.  3.  We modified the final report to clarify that the intentional discharges  from the tanks were only at the Hanford Site. We do not agree with  DOE\u2019s statement that the tank wastes discharged into the soil  contained relatively low-levels of radioactivity. According to DOE\u2019s  records, the tank waste discharged into the soil at the Hanford Site  contained radioactive components with long half-lives, such as  technetium-99. The available records show that, as of December 1989,  decades after the waste was discharged into the soil, the 121 million  gallons still contained more than 65,000 curies of radioactivity.   4.  We agree and have modified the final report accordingly.  5.  We believe that using the term \u201ccontaminated water\u201d when referring to  water from the tanks that may include radioactive and hazardous  components is more accurate. The use of the term \u201cwater\u201d by itself  could be misleading for the general reader.  6.  We agree and have modified the final report to clarify that the use of  process knowledge is a central part of the characterization step.  7.  Although DOE may use constant dollars to report the department\u2019s  environmental liabilities under its Government Results and Reporting  Act requirements, it has not done so in its savings estimates or public  disclosures for its accelerated cleanup initiative. In addition, to  correctly compare costs of alternatives with different timing, DOE  should compare \u201cpresent values\u201d of costs and not merely the constant  dollars. Therefore, we made no change to the final report.  8.  We agree and have modified the final report to include the cost  contingency as a factor in the cost growth for the Hanford high-level  waste treatment facility.  9.  We believe that this comment reinforces the message in the  draft report that some of the proposed savings may be based on  incomplete estimates of the costs for the accelerated proposals. DOE  commented that the range of costs for the alternative technologies for  the sodium-bearing waste in the tanks\u2014from $150-400 million\u2014was  less than the $1 billion estimated cost of vitrifying the waste, and  therefore was not included in the savings estimate. We continue to  believe that the savings estimates in the accelerated plan should have  reflected all associated costs, including the difference between the  costs for the alternative technologies and the costs for vitrification. We  disagree that the $7 billion in estimated savings is solely attributable to  the differences in strategy for treating calcine waste. The July 2002  accelerated plan for the Idaho National Laboratory specifically states  that the $7 billion will be saved by the new cleanup approach for both  calcine and sodium-bearing waste that eliminates the need for a  vitrification facility.   10.  We believe that this comment reinforces the message in the report that  the use of a single point estimate does not reflect uncertainties. We  disagree that including a section in the accelerated plan that catalogs  the government furnished services and items is the same or similar to  accounting for uncertainties by providing a range of savings estimates.  11.  While the accelerated plan for the Idaho National Laboratory  briefly discusses reductions in risk to workers from less intrusive  characterization and sampling techniques and elimination of a  vitrification facility, it does not fully describe the advantages and  disadvantages to workers and the environment. Therefore, we  continue to believe that the savings estimates do not fully discuss the  nonbudgetary impacts such as environmental risks.  12.  We believe this section of the report, including the summary  paragraph, adequately describes DOE\u2019s management of waste  processing activities.  13.  Although section 114 of the Nuclear Waste Policy Act limits the  amount of nuclear waste that can be deposited in the repository, this  limitation is not relevant to the point in this paragraph. Therefore, we  made no change to the final report.  14.  We believe the report adequately conveys this information.  15.  We address these comments in the Agency Comments section of the  report.  16.
