Two primary parts of the submission--the IT budget summary report and the detailed Capital Investment Reports on each IT initiative--are inconsistent. In particular, 15 initiatives that appear in the budget summary do not appear in the Capital Investment Reports, and discrepancies exist between the two types of reports in the amounts requested for 73 major initiatives. These discrepancies total about $1.6 billion. Major initiatives do not consistently use the same type of appropriations to fund the same activities. That is, to fund the same types of activities, some DOD organizations used the Research, Development, Test, and Evaluation appropriations and others used the Operation and Maintenance appropriations. The IT budget summary does not include all the costs of the IT initiatives, which is contrary to federal guidance. For example, the IT budget reports do not always include the costs of military personnel working on the initiatives. These problems are largely attributable to insufficient management attention and limitations in departmental policies and procedures, such as guidance in DOD's Financial Management Regulation, and to shortcomings in systems that support budget-related activities. The result is that OMB and the Congress are constrained in their ability to make informed IT funding decisions and conduct effective oversight and control, which could cause decision makers to approve or deny funding for programs that they might otherwise have treated differently, as well as increasing the chances of funds in an appropriation not being sufficient to cover obligations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["To make informed funding decisions among competing demands for  federal funds, the Congress and the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) need federal departments and agencies to provide consistent,  accurate, and complete budget information.

The  roughly $28 billion included about $17.4 billion for operating and  maintaining existing systems and infrastructure and about $10.5 billion for  modernizing systems and infrastructure. Examples of major initiatives  included in this budget submission are the following:   the Global Command and Control System, a joint program intended to  provide the information resources needed by warfighters to accomplish  their command and control missions;  the Defense Information System Network, a communications  infrastructure initiative that is intended to connect DOD\u2019s mission  support and armed forces using a combination of government and  private infrastructure; and   the Defense Integrated Military Human Resources System, a military  personnel and pay system that is expected to integrate personnel and  pay functions for all military services.", "DOD\u2019s IT budget submission consists of three basic reports: Capital Investment Reports, also called Exhibit 300s, which are used by  OMB to determine whether an IT initiative meets budgetary guidelines  for funding.

Moreover,  inconsistency in how DOD uses appropriation accounts reduces  congressional and departmental oversight and control of how the  department uses the accounts.

The same official  told us that another was omitted because after preparing the IT-1  spreadsheet, senior DOD officials decided not to fund the initiative.  However, the root cause of these omissions is that DOD does not provide  sufficient management attention to IT budget submission reliability.  Additionally, DOD does not have the management processes (e.g., policies  and procedures) and support systems needed to ensure that the two  reports are consistent.", "Significant discrepancies also appear in the total dollar amounts reported  in the Exhibit 300s and the IT-1 spreadsheet for the 176 major initiatives  that were included in both reports. Specifically, DOD\u2019s IT-1 spreadsheet  totals about $14.5 billion for these initiatives. For the same major IT  initiatives on DOD\u2019s Exhibit 300s, the total dollar amount is about $14.8  billion, about a $300 million difference. This discrepancy can be traced to  73 of the 176 initiatives (41 percent), of which 44 (25 percent) had  differences over $1 million, and 4 had differences of more than $100  million.

Of the 73 initiatives that account for these  differences, the Army and the Department of the Air Force each had 12, and  the Department of the Navy had 6. The Navy accounts for the largest share  of the total dollar difference, followed by the Air Force.

For example, the DOD CIO  official who is responsible for compiling the IT budget submission said that  the department does not have support systems that allow funding  information to be input once and then used to create both the IT-1  spreadsheet and Exhibit 300s. Rather, DOD\u2019s budgeting systems require  that similar, but not identical, information be input into multiple databases,  in different formats. According to program offices, this practice contributes  to inaccuracies and inconsistencies in the budget submission.", "Additionally, DOD does not have management processes to ensure the  accuracy of changes made to the exhibits by component- and department- level officials after the exhibits are prepared by program offices. For  example, officials from two of the six program offices that provided  information about this matter told us that information that they reported on  the Exhibit 300s was changed when it was incorporated into the IT-1  spreadsheet by their component CIO offices, and that program offices were  not consulted to ensure that the changes were accurate.

According to this circular, Exhibit 300s must  summarize funding data by life cycle phase: that is, planning, acquisition, or  maintenance. OMB officials stated that this information is used to  determine whether IT initiatives have an appropriate balance of planning,  acquisition, and maintenance activities. However, of the 197 DOD Exhibit  300s for fiscal year 2004 (representing 179 initiatives), 20 exhibits did not  classify the funds by life cycle phase.", "Second, the total dollar amount reported on 45 Exhibit 300s does not equal  the sum of their respective line items. As shown in table 5, the Navy  accounts for the majority of these cases\u2014about 69 percent of the 45  exhibits and almost all of the total dollar difference. The discrepancies can  be traced to a variety of causes.

That is, the numeral  \u201c2004\u201d was incorrectly treated as a line of funding in the summary of  spending. These 13 errors account for about $26 billion of the Navy\u2019s  approximately $39 billion difference.", "Third, although OMB requires an Exhibit 300 for each major initiative and  specifies a defined format to use to present funding information for each  initiative, DOD components did not consistently adhere to this format. For  example, the Defense Information Systems Agency combined the funding  information for seven initiatives in a format that did not clearly provide  OMB and congressional decision makers with the funding amounts for  each initiative.

Moreover, OMB officials stated that using the  proper budget category is also important because it triggers the  appropriate OMB review process for an initiative. If  development/modernization activities are miscategorized as current  services, the required OMB review process will not be invoked.", "DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2004 IT budget submission incorrectly categorized the  funding reported for some initiatives\u2019 planning and acquisition activities as  current services, rather than as development/modernization. This incorrect  categorization affected both DOD\u2019s Operation and Maintenance (O&M) and  its Military Personnel appropriation accounts. For example, the budget  submission for the department\u2019s new integrated personnel and pay system  included about $14 million to fund program office costs from the O&M  appropriation and categorized these costs as current services. However,  because DOD intends to perform planning and acquisition activities for this  program during fiscal year 2004, a portion of the funding should have been  categorized as development/modernization. This means that the  development/modernization funding amount for this initiative is  understated and the current services amount is overstated. As another  example, the IT-1 spreadsheet shows that every major initiative that  included funding from the Military Personnel appropriation categorized the  amount as current services, regardless of the activities the military  personnel were to perform. The DOD CIO official who is responsible for  compiling the IT budget submission acknowledged that such  miscategorization occurs, but stated that information is not readily  available to determine the total number of initiatives and the associated  amount of funding that is miscategorized departmentwide.", "Officials representing the Navy CIO office stated that the Navy categorizes  all IT funding from the O&M appropriation as current services, even if the  funding is to be used for development/modernization activities. This  miscategorization occurs, in part, because the FMR does not provide clear  guidance on categorizing activities as either development/modernization or  current services. Specifically, the FMR states that budgeted costs funded  from the O&M and Military Personnel appropriations are to be considered  expenses, and it defines expenses similarly to current services, in that both  refer to the costs of operating and maintaining systems. However, Circular  A-11 states that funding for activities that occur during either the planning  or acquisition phases of a new IT initiative must be classified as  development/modernization. This means that costs budgeted for planning  or acquisition activities should be classified as  development/modernization, regardless of whether the O&M, Military  Personnel, or another appropriation is used to fund the activities. Further, a  DOD Comptroller official who is responsible for advising components on  IT budgeting told us that if appropriations are used to fund the planning or  acquisition of a system, the costs should be classified as  development/modernization, rather than current services.", "Our analysis of the FMR confirmed that it does not clearly distinguish  between development/modernization and current services costs. More  specifically, it defines the two terms as follows:   development/modernization costs are those for \u201cnew applications and  infrastructure capabilities\u201d and for \u201cany change or modification to an  existing  program, and/or initiative that results in  improved capability or performance of the baseline activity,\u201d and the  definition includes \u201cpersonnel costs for Project Management\u201d and  current services costs are those required to maintain \u201coperations at a  current capability and performance level\u201d and include \u201ccertain overhead  costs associated with PM  offices.\u201d", "The FMR definitions are confusing regarding the classification of project  management costs because current services costs include \u201ccertain  overhead costs associated with PM  offices,\u201d and  development/modernization includes \u201cpersonnel costs for Project  Management.\u201d Also, the definitions do not clearly state that for new IT  initiatives, all funding for planning or acquisition activities should be  classified as development/modernization. Furthermore, for modifications  of existing systems, the definitions do not provide sufficient criteria for  determining whether modifications will result in \u201cimproved capability or  performance\u201d (development/modernization) or will maintain \u201coperations at  a current capability and performance level\u201d (current services).", "OSD and Navy CIO officials stated that decisions regarding the amounts  that should be categorized as development/modernization or current  services for an individual initiative are complicated by the practical fact  that the same personnel and equipment are sometimes used to perform  both development/modernization and current services activities for the  initiative. This occurs because DOD uses a generally accepted system life  cycle management practice that involves sequentially developing and  deploying subsystems, rather than waiting until the system is completely  developed to deploy it. As a result, at various points in the system\u2019s life  cycle, some subsystems may be in the maintenance phase while others are  in the planning or acquisition phases. In these cases, these officials stated  that most DOD program offices do not have process controls and  supporting systems to enable them to accurately estimate the amount that  should be budgeted for development/modernization and current services  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "IT Budget Submission Does Not Use Appropriation Accounts Consistently", "paragraphs": ["\u201cCross-Service and Agency consistency is important\u2026.

According to officials representing 7 of the 10 major initiatives that  provided information on this topic, their respective budget reports  included funding from the O&M appropriation for civilian personnel costs  and other costs for performing or managing development/modernization  activities, while according to officials representing 3 other initiatives, their  budget reports included funding for these activities from the RDT&E  appropriation. Officials from the DOD Comptroller\u2019s office stated that the  O&M appropriation is the correct one to fund these costs, but that research  and development organizations are allowed to use RDT&E appropriations  for these costs, because such organizations do not receive O&M  appropriations. However, according to a representative of the Army CIO\u2019s  office, two of the three organizations that used RDT&E appropriations  were not research and development organizations (both were Army  programs) and, according to the DOD Comptroller official, should have  used O&M appropriations. \u201cThe RDT&E funds are typically used for developing new capability.

For example, we  reported that the Navy incorrectly purchased component parts for IT  systems with the O&M appropriation account rather than with the  Procurement appropriation. Subsequent actions to correct the improper  use of the O&M appropriation account resulted in an overobligation of the  amount that had been apportioned from Procurement appropriations,  thereby violating the Anti-deficiency Act.

At a minimum, we recommend that revisions to policies,  procedures, and supporting systems ensure that  Exhibit 300s and IT-1 spreadsheets are consistent in terms of (1) the  major initiatives that are included in each report (unless otherwise  explained) and (2) the funding reported for each of these initiatives;  Exhibit 300s are complete, accurate, and internally consistent, in that  (1) funding information is provided for each life cycle phase for each  initiative; (2) total amounts reported for each initiative equal the sum of  the individual line items for the initiative; and (3) the format used to  display the funding information clearly shows the total funding amount  for each initiative;  amounts are properly categorized as development/modernization or  current services in the IT budget submission, so that OMB and  congressional decision makers are provided with accurate information  on the funding required to (1) develop new systems or significantly  improve existing systems and (2) operate and maintain existing  systems;  budget submissions are consistent in the costs that are funded with the  RDT&E appropriation and those that are funded with the O&M  appropriation; and  budget submissions fully account for all relevant costs, including  military personnel costs and indirect costs, to the extent that these costs  can be identified and properly allocated to each initiative, so that OMB  and congressional decision makers are provided with complete budget  information for each initiative.", "We further recommend that the OSD and component CIO offices, in  consultation with the OSD and component Comptroller offices,   assess the costs and benefits of alternative approaches for establishing  cost accounting systems or cost estimating processes to determine the  amount of indirect costs attributable to each IT initiative and the  amounts that should be categorized as development/modernization and  current services, and implement the more cost-effective approach;   assess approaches to reduce or eliminate requirements for duplicative  manual entry of information by program offices and components into  systems supporting the preparation of the IT budget reports; and  review the IT budget submission for fiscal year 2004 and the IT budget  submission for fiscal year 2005 from the O&M and RDT&E  appropriations and transfer, as necessary, the amounts for civilian  personnel and other costs associated with IT planning or acquisition  activities to the proper appropriation account, to ensure consistent use  of these accounts, provide for congressional and departmental oversight  of DOD\u2019s use of appropriations accounts, and reduce the risk of  violations of the Anti-deficiency Act."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and GAO Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["DOD provided what it termed \u201cofficial oral comments\u201d on a draft of this  report from the CIO, OSD, who is also the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Networks and Information Integration. In commenting, DOD either  agreed or partially agreed with our recommendations and described  actions that it plans to take to establish the appropriate controls and  systems needed to correct many of the weaknesses described in this  report, including revising the FMR. Examples of DOD\u2019s planned actions  include  providing the Congress with a list of initiatives for which Exhibit 300s  were provided to OMB, but not to the Congress, along with explanations  for differences;  negotiating with OMB a later submission date for DOD\u2019s exhibits, to  provide additional time to ensure that exhibits are reliable;   establishing a common, consistent data source to use in producing  Exhibit 300s and the IT-1 spreadsheets;  modifying the process for producing Exhibit 300s to ensure that correct  funding amounts are captured;   using a standardized format for Exhibit 300s;  working with OMB to ensure the use of consistent definitions of and  terminology for development/modernization and current services;   updating the FMR to clarify areas of concern or inconsistencies in (1)  the information presented in Exhibit 300s, (2) the use of  development/modernization and current services categories, and (3) the  categorization of costs as RDT&E or O&M;  assessing, on a departmentwide basis, the establishment of a cost   evaluating approaches to reduce or eliminate duplicative data entry; and  considering appropriations realignments during the fiscal year 2006  budget cycle.", "Notwithstanding DOD\u2019s agreement with our recommendations, as well as  its planned actions to improve its submissions\u2019 consistency, accuracy, and  completeness, DOD also provided mitigating reasons for the discrepancies  and problems that we reported. For example, DOD stated that Exhibit 300s  and IT-1 spreadsheets are not consistent in terms of the major initiatives  included in each report because DOD does not necessarily report all major  initiatives in the Exhibit 300s. Instead, DOD and OMB agree as to which  major initiatives are to be reported in the Exhibit 300s based on a goal of  reporting a dollar percentage of all initiatives. Similarly, DOD stated that its  IT-1 spreadsheet does not include all relevant costs, such as military  personnel costs and indirect costs, because the spreadsheet is an extract of  the budget justification documents and does not include full life cycle costs  or total cost of ownership. Nevertheless, DOD added that it will assess its  guidance on reporting the cost of military personnel and other relevant  costs.", "While we do not question the information that DOD provided to explain the  discrepancies and problems discussed in our report, this information does  not eliminate the need to provide congressional decision makers with  reliable information upon which to make informed decisions. Thus, for  DOD to fully respond to our recommendations, it will need to take  additional actions beyond those provided in its comments. For example, it  will need to provide the Congress with a list of major initiatives included in  the IT-1 spreadsheet that are not included in Exhibit 300 (with an  explanation of these differences).  Also, beyond modifying the FMR, it will  need to revise related guidance and implement controls to ensure that  costs are correctly categorized as (1) development/modernization or  current services and (2) RDT&E or O&M.", "We are sending copies of this report to other interested congressional  committees and the other Members of the Senate and House Committees  on Armed Services; the House and Senate Committees on Appropriations,  Subcommittees on Defense; the Director, Office of Management and  Budget; the Secretary of Defense; the Assistant Secretary of Defense  (Networks and Information Integration)/Chief Information Officer; the  Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller); and the Under Secretary of  Defense (Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics).

To do so, we assessed the funding information in DOD\u2019s primary  IT budget reports to determine whether the information reported was  consistent between reports, whether the reports included all the funding  information that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) requires,  whether the correct budget categories and consistent appropriation types  were used to fund the initiatives, and whether the submission included all  costs of the initiatives.", "We reviewed OMB Circular A-11 to obtain requirements and guidelines for  preparing budget submissions and confirmed our understanding of the  guidelines through interviews with OMB officials. We also assessed DOD\u2019s  Financial Management Regulation (FMR) and its budget submission  guidance, and we interviewed DOD departmental and component officials  to determine DOD\u2019s criteria for budget submissions. Finally, we reviewed  federal accounting standards to determine additional guidance for budget  preparation.", "To identify inconsistencies between the reports, we assessed the Exhibit  300 Capital Investment Reports and the IT-1 budget summary spreadsheet.  We compared the Exhibit 300s with the IT-1 spreadsheet and not with the  Exhibit 53 because the Exhibit 53 presents essentially the same  information as the IT-1 spreadsheet, but in less detail. We counted the  number of major initiatives that appeared in both reports, as well as the  number appearing in only one of the reports. We also calculated the  differences in the funding amounts between the Exhibit 300s and the IT-1  spreadsheet and made comparisons among the initiatives and components,  as well as between totals, for each report. We interviewed departmental,  component, and program officials to determine causes for the  inconsistencies.", "To select which program officials to contact, we chose a cross section of  DOD\u2019s organizations, including the Office of the Secretary of Defense; the  Departments of the Air Force, Army, and Navy; and seven agencies and  activities (the American Forces Information Service, Defense Contract  Management Agency, Defense Human Resources Activity, Defense  Information Systems Agency, Defense Security Service, TRICARE, and  Washington Headquarters Service). From each program office, we obtained  explanations of its funding submission related to one or more of the  following issues: inconsistencies between the reports, omissions and errors  in Exhibit 300s, improper categorization of development/modernization  activities, inconsistent use of appropriations, and costs that were not  included in the submission.", "To determine whether the reports included all information required by  OMB, we analyzed the Exhibit 300 Capital Investment Reports to identify  omissions and inconsistencies in the information for each initiative. We  tallied the number of initiatives that omitted life cycle information. We also  identified initiatives with total funding amounts that were not equal to the  sum of the amounts reported for individual line items and calculated the  totals by component. To determine causes for these inconsistencies, we  interviewed departmental, component, and program officials.", "To determine whether the correct budget categories were used to fund the  initiatives, we examined programs that included activities for development  and modernization and determined how their funding amounts were  categorized. We interviewed program officials to determine what activities  were planned and then assessed whether the budget categories were  consistent with OMB criteria. We also interviewed component and  departmental officials to determine the guidance they were providing to  program officials, and we assessed DOD\u2019s FMR to determine whether its  guidance was clear and consistent with OMB guidelines.", "To determine whether consistent appropriation types were used to fund  initiatives, we determined what appropriation types were included for  funding development and modernization activities. We identified three  program offices that were using the Research, Development, Test, and  Evaluation appropriation for these purposes and seven that were using the  Operation and Maintenance appropriation, and contacted them to  determine the reasons that they selected these appropriations. We  reviewed DOD\u2019s prior actions to correct similar inconsistencies. We also  analyzed the language in the FMR for its clarity on these issues.", "To determine whether the submission included all costs of the initiatives,  we assessed the appropriation activities reflected in the IT-1 spreadsheet.  From this assessment and interviews with program officials, we  determined that many programs did not include funding for military  personnel. To confirm that such costs should be included, we interviewed  officials representing OMB, the DOD Comptroller, and the DOD Chief  Information Officer, and we reviewed the FMR and budgeting guidance in  the Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standard Number 4,  \u201cManagerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal  Government.\u201d We also interviewed program officials to determine why they  did not include funding for military personnel costs in their budget reports.  We used Defense Manpower Data Center information to estimate the  potential amount that military personnel costs are understated in the fiscal  year 2004 IT budget submission. To do this, we calculated the difference  between the cost of military personnel performing IT functions and the  amount of funding in DOD\u2019s IT budget submission that was to be funded  using the Military Personnel appropriations. To estimate the cost of IT  military personnel, we used Defense Manpower Data Center information  on the number of military personnel performing IT work in each of the four  services\u2014Air Force, Army, Navy, and the U.S. Marine Corps\u2014and  multiplied the number at each rank for each service by the respective  average annual pay and benefits. We included only active military  personnel in IT duty positions in our estimate.
