GAO defined customer service as including ease of program access, courtesy, timeliness, and accuracy, as well as responsiveness to customer needs and expectations. Some participants in all six focus groups reported experiencing long call wait times and difficulties using automated phone systems. In addition, in two of the states visited, representatives of advocacy groups reported that special populations, including individuals with limited English proficiency, had difficulty accessing the UI program.

Specifically, more than half the states GAO surveyed reported insufficient staffing, outdated Information Technology (IT) systems, and funding constraints, all of which could play a role in claimant challenges. Many states also reported that they have taken or are planning to take some actions to improve customer service. For example, 45 states reported taking action to provide self-service options, and 42 states reported taking action to provide customer service training to program representatives.", "The Department of Labor's (DOL) Employment and Training Administration (ETA) provides states with monitoring and assistance on some aspects of customer service. ETA monitors and measures state performance on the timeliness of benefit payments and appeals decisions. ETA also monitors and measures the accuracy of states' non-monetary eligibility determinations, such as whether states accurately assess reasons for claimants' separation from employment. In addition, ETA provides states with various technical assistance. ETA has provided states with assistance on IT modernization, staffing issues, and program access for special populations. UI program officials in the three states GAO visited said they could benefit from more information on other states' successful customer service practices, including practices for addressing continuing staffing and IT challenges. ETA plans to share these practices on an ongoing basis, officials said. For example, officials said ETA plans to share successful practices\u2014including those related to staffing\u2014obtained from its national study of call center operations through its online community of practice.

After Congress  appropriates funds, DOL uses a formula to allocate the funding to states  and considers state workloads estimates, as well as other information  provided by states, such as cost accounting information. Since funding is  calculated in part based on claims-related workloads, the federal funding  available to states is generally sensitive to changes in total claims, with  more funding available when claims increase and less when they  decrease. States may also receive additional federal administrative  funding above base levels on a quarterly basis when claims-related  workloads exceed base funding levels.

Officials in one state we visited explained that as the  state has made it easier for claimants to manage their own claims, calls to  the state UI program, including claimant calls directed from American Job  Centers, are becoming more complex and may take longer to address.  Officials in that state told us that call handling times remain challenging  because program representatives have to balance the competing goals of  completing calls quickly and meeting customer needs. In addition, 13 of  39 states (33 percent) reported continuing challenges related to calls  abandoned by callers, and 8 of 39 states (21 percent) reported continuing  challenges with calls dropped by the automated phone system, to at least  a moderate extent.", "In addition, some states described challenges related to claims  processing delays or backlogs. For example, 16 of 48 states (33 percent)  cited delays or backlogs in claims processing during the last 12 months  as a challenge to a large or moderate extent, while these issues were  challenges for 34 states (71 percent) during the recession. Although claim  volumes have generally declined, since federal administrative funding is  tied, in part, to the volume of claims, some states may face challenges in  this area. In one state we visited, for example, officials said they feel  understaffed despite having a lower workload, particularly when there are  unexpected spikes in claim volumes due to seasonal unemployment  fluctuations or changes in economic conditions, for example."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Many States Reported Providing or Planning to Provide Self-Service and Other Practices to Ease Customers Claims Filing Experiences", "paragraphs": ["Many states reported that they took or are planning to take some actions  to improve customer service, such as providing self-service options on  state UI program websites and implementing automated telephone  systems (see fig. 6). For example, almost all of the 48 states responding  to our survey reported having provided self-service options on the state  UI program website (94 percent) or implementing an automated  telephone system (88 percent), both of which are designed to allow  claimants to file their own claims with little or no staff assistance. Other  commonly-reported practices included posting \u201cFrequently Asked  Questions\u201d on state UI program websites (94 percent) and providing  customer service training to call center staff (77 percent).", "Other practices, though potentially helpful, have not been implemented as  frequently. For example, 22 states reported having implemented virtual  hold or courtesy call back on their phone lines, which allows claimants to  opt out of holding and instead receive a call back, and an additional 9  states said they planned to do so.", "Several states have also undertaken efforts to streamline program  processes to improve efficiency. For example, officials in California cross- trained program staff so that all staff could answer incoming calls, and  reduced call center hours from a full business day to a half day. Prior to  this change, some call center staff answered calls while others worked on  eligibility or payment issues throughout the day. As more staff are cross- trained in all functions, their competencies to answer all types of calls are  enhanced, according to officials. Officials told us that these changes  allowed them to answer more calls than with their previous staffing model  in which staff specialized in different tasks. Officials described the  changes as helping to create additional capacity in an environment of  constrained resources.

Under the federal-state partnership, ETA sets overall program policy and  monitors state performance, and states provide customer service to  claimants. ETA sets acceptable levels of performance and monitors  states on a total of 15 core measures within the following categories: 1)  benefits, 2) program integrity, 3) appeals, 4) tax, and 5) reemployment.  (For a comprehensive list of core performance measures, see appendix  II.) According to ETA officials, while most of these measures indirectly  address customer service issues, four of them directly address certain  aspects of customer service. Specifically, ETA measures the timeliness of  first payments to eligible claimants and of appeals decisions and  assesses the accuracy of two types of non-monetary eligibility  determinations. Officials told us they consider these measures to be  important indicators of customer service (see table 2).", "ETA provides states with technical assistance for the UI program overall,  and provides technical assistance on customer service under certain  circumstances. According to ETA officials, ETA\u2019s six regional offices  monitor state performance on a quarterly basis and provide technical  assistance\u2014which may address customer service\u2014if states fail to meet  acceptable levels of performance over a prolonged period of time. For  example, if a state fails to pay benefits to claimants in a timely manner,  ETA officials said they may review the state\u2019s call center operations and  provide related assistance. Officials told us they have also provided  technical assistance when states have faced major customer service  challenges that are not addressed in the performance measures, such as  significant delays in answering calls. In addition, ETA provides ongoing  technical assistance to states on program administration, which has  occasionally addressed customer service issues. For example, officials  said they have developed training, hosted webinars, provided  supplemental funding, and maintained an online community of practice  through which states can share information. According to officials, ETA is  currently piloting an effort to ensure states are routinely assessing  program operations and processes, complying with applicable laws, and  effectively administering their UI programs. As part of this effort, officials  expect that beginning in fiscal year 2017, states will conduct annual self- assessments of their benefit processes\u2014including reviews of their call  center operations and supporting IT infrastructure\u2014and ETA will provide  related assistance, such as sharing best practices for areas in which  states are experiencing challenges.", "ETA has also provided states with technical assistance or guidance on IT  modernization, staffing issues, and program access, which were reported  as customer service challenges by states and advocacy groups. ETA  provides states with technical assistance on IT modernization by funding  and overseeing the Information Technology Support Center (ITSC), which  is operated by the National Association of State Workforce Agencies  (NASWA). For example, in March 2015, ETA and ITSC issued a  checklist to help states prepare to launch modernized UI IT systems.  ITSC has also developed a comprehensive guide for UI IT modernization  projects, among other resources. In addition, ETA has provided states  with supplemental funding to establish consortia in which states work  together to develop and share a common, modernized IT system. With  respect to staffing issues, ETA officials said they have provided technical  assistance under certain circumstances, such as when states have been  unable to adequately staff their call centers due to high volumes of claims  during the recent recession or the implementation of modernized IT  systems.

In one of these states, officials explained that it can be challenging for  staff to monitor the online community of practice on a regular basis and  respond to other states\u2019 requests for information in a timely manner. In a  third state, officials said that they have contacted other states directly  because officials are more willing to openly share challenges and lessons  learned in private discussions. In addition, officials told us that NASWA  has helped them gather information about other states\u2019 UI programs.
