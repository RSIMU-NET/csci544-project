Although  cocaine production is illegal in Bolivia, coca farming is permitted in  some parts of the country.  \uf0b7  Colombia. Colombia, within 3 hours flying time from Florida,  produces 90 percent of the cocaine entering the United States and  much of the heroin in the eastern United States. Several terrorist  organizations in Colombia, which commit wide-scale violence and  human rights abuses, engage in drug trafficking as a source of  income.  \uf0b7  Ecuador. Ecuador is a major transit route for cocaine produced  primarily in neighboring Colombia and Peru. Since it uses the U.S.  dollar as its currency, Ecuador is also an attractive venue for money  laundering by individuals and organizations engaged in criminal  activities.  \uf0b7  Peru. Peru is the world\u2019s second largest producer of cocaine. Drug  trafficking also generates a significant amount of money laundering in  Peru.  \uf0b7  Venezuela. Venezuela is one of the major drug transit countries in the  Western Hemisphere.

State manages and funds eradication, interdiction, and law  enforcement assistance, including programs implemented by a variety  of other U.S. agencies. State also funds security assistance programs  generally implemented by DOD, including Foreign Military Financing  and International Military Education and Training programs, which are  intended to strengthen the overall capacity of foreign forces to  address security threats such as the narcotics trade. In addition to  these activities, State provides limited funding to the Department of  Homeland Security (DHS) to implement counternarcotics assistance  in the Andean region. DHS components that implement this  assistance include Customs and Border Protection (CBP),  Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the U.S. Coast  Guard (USCG). State also provides funding for the Department of  Justice\u2019s (DOJ) International Criminal Investigative Training and  Assistance Program (ICITAP), which supports prosecution of  members of paramilitary groups in Colombia.  \uf0b7  USAID. USAID supports the U.S. counternarcotics effort through its  rule-of-law and alternative development programs in several of the  Andean countries.  \uf0b7  DOD. DOD, primarily through its Office of the Deputy Assistant  Secretary of Defense for Counternarcotics and Global Threats  (DASD-CN>), provides oversight and funds for counternarcotics  activities in the Andean region.  \uf0b7  DEA.

To identify counternarcotics  assistance activities, we reviewed funding amounts reported to us by  agencies, congressional budget submissions, agency annual reports, and  other program documents. We also interviewed officials from the  Department of State (State), the Department of Defense (DOD), the U.S.  Agency for International Development (USAID), and the Drug  Enforcement Administration (DEA).", "To describe the U.S. strategic approaches to counternarcotics assistance  in the five Andean countries, we examined multiple U.S. government  documents and interviewed U.S. government officials. Specifically, we  obtained and analyzed State\u2019s mission and bureau performance plans to  understand U.S. foreign policy and security goals and priorities and the  executive branch\u2019s approach to formulating those goals. We also  obtained State\u2019s and USAID\u2019s joint strategic 5-year plan, DOD\u2019s  Counternarcotics and Global Threats strategy, and DEA\u2019s agency  strategic plan. We interviewed officials from State, USAID, DOD, and  DEA in Washington, D.C., who are responsible for administering and  implementing the assistance programs to the five Andean countries. We  reviewed department and agency planning, reporting, and budgeting  documents and obtained and reviewed the various strategy documents  produced by the United States that are the basis for overall drug control  efforts, such as the Office of National Drug Control Policy\u2019s (ONDCP)  annual National Drug Control Strategy and the U.S. embassy\u2019s mission  strategic resource plans for fiscal years 2007 through 2011.", "We defined \u201ccounternarcotics assistance\u201d as all funding provided primarily  for the purpose of eradicating drug crop cultivation, interdicting trafficked  narcotics, supporting alternative livelihoods and alternative crop  cultivation, or training and equipping military and law enforcement for  counternarcotics operations. In addition, we included small amounts of  funding for assistance efforts in the region intended to support U.S.  counternarcotics goals in the region, such as legal sector reform and drug  demand reduction programs in Andean countries. The funding information  presented in this report is based on allotment data. We used GAO\u2019s  definition of \u201callotment\u201d as funds authorized by the head of an agency to  be used for obligations. Each agency provided their funding amounts  using internal, agency-specific budget terminology. This terminology  varied among agencies; for example, some agencies referred to their  funding amounts as \u2018budget levels\u2019 where other agencies referred to their  funding amounts as \u2018allocations.\u2019 We discussed our definition of the term  \u201callotment\u201d with cognizant officials at each agency. At each agency, those  officials stated that the funding amounts they provided could be  characterized using our definition of allotment and thus could be  presented in this report as funds available for obligation in support of  counternarcotics efforts in each of the Andean countries.", "To identify the amounts of U.S. government funding allotted for  counternarcotics, we requested funding data for counternarcotics  assistance in the Andean region for fiscal years 2006 through 2011. We  also interviewed cognizant agency officials and examined past GAO  reports and congressional budget submissions, including State\u2019s Bureau  of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (State/INL)  program and budget guides for fiscal years 2006 through 2011. In  addition, we obtained technical comments from DHS to confirm that all  DHS counternarcotics efforts in the region are implemented using funds  from other U.S. agencies and international organizations. We collected  data for fiscal years 2006 through fiscal year 2011 to show trends in  counternarcotics assistance funding in the region. Each agency provided  funding data organized by country (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and  Venezuela) and by fiscal year (2006-2011). Based on our review of the  data and discussions with agency officials, we determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for a broad estimate of U.S. government  counternarcotics program allotments the Andean region, and to provide  an indication of general trends over time as well as differences in funding  provided by country and agency.", "The agencies took different steps and queried different systems to  provide the funding data we requested.", "State. Officials from State\u2019s Office of the Director of Foreign  Assistance provided data from the Foreign Assistance Coordination  and Tracking System (FACTS) database, which houses funding data  on U.S. foreign assistance programs. The FACTS funding data  included amounts from fiscal year 2006 through 2011 from the  following foreign assistance accounts: Andean Counterdrug Initiative  (ACI); Foreign Military Financing (FMF); International Military  Education and Training (IMET); International Narcotics Control and  Law Enforcement (INCLE); and Nonproliferation, Anti-terrorism,  Demining and Related Programs (NADR). We requested the funding  amounts for these accounts after determining, through discussions  with State officials, that these accounts were the most relevant to our  scope. In addition, we requested specific amounts allotted for security  sector reform and combating transnational crime in the region from  the Development Assistance (DA) and Economic Support Fund (ESF)  accounts. In addition, State\u2019s Bureau of International Narcotics and  Law Enforcement (INL) provided records on appropriations,  allotments, obligations, expenditures, and other budget categories.  We used these records to provide data on funding allotted for  assistance in Ecuador through DOD\u2019s Section 1207 Assistance  program; we did not obtain any additional data on 1207 program  funding in the region.", "USAID. USAID\u2019s Office of Latin America and the Caribbean consulted  internal records and submitted a spreadsheet that combined (1)  amounts of ACI assistance provided in fiscal years 2006 and 2007,  which were not included in the State/F data and (2) data pulled by a  query of the FACTS database to provide amounts allotted for  counternarcotics assistance through the DA and ESF accounts for  fiscal years 2008 through 2011.", "DOD. DOD\u2019s Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for  Counternarcotics and Global Threats (DASD-CN>) provided a  document with funding data from the CTA for Counternarcotics.  DASD-CN> provides oversight of CTA funding through a Web- based database. DASD-CN> compiled funding data from this  database\u2014 which tracks funds by project code\u2014 and then asked  knowledgeable officials to provide estimated amounts of funds used in  support of each Andean country.", "DEA. DEA reviewed interagency agreement documents with State to  obtain data on allotments for DEA\u2019s SIU program. DEA provided a  spreadsheet with detail from those agreements on funding provided in  support of the program.", "We combined the funding data provided by State, USAID, DOD, and DEA  to obtain total estimated U.S. government funds allotted. These amounts  are estimates because, according to agency officials, funding databases  may have imperfect or incomplete information, and some agencies relied  on manual estimates or manual review of agency documentation rather  than a central data management system to provide funding information.  Because State\u2019s FACTS database was in the process of being created  and launched in fiscal years 2006 and 2007, some data may be missing  for those years. In addition, State officials told us that although assistance  provided through the FMF and IMET accounts is often used for  counternarcotics purposes, the main intent of these accounts is to provide  assistance to partner nation militaries. Some of the FMF and IMET  assistance included in this report may not have provided direct support to  counternarcotics efforts of Andean countries. In addition, State/INL\u2019s  records on the allotments for the 1207 program may not be complete,  because the program was originally managed by DOD; authority for the  1207 program expired on September 30, 2010. According to State,  because State does not maintain separate records for the uses of funds  in the ACI account, State was not able to provide complete data specific  to this account. According to USAID, USAID\u2019s Office for Latin America  and the Caribbean relied on internal records that had been maintained by  the staff since 2006 to provide GAO with data on ACI funding amounts  allotted by USAID in each country for counternarcotics programs.  Similarly, DOD provided manual estimates of amounts by country,  because according to DOD, the department tracks CTA funding by project  code\u2014which indicates the general purpose of the funding\u2014rather than by  country. According to DOD, there is no standard procedure for estimating  these amounts by country. Unlike funding data provided by other  agencies, DEA amounts were obtained by a manual review of agency  documentation, not pulled by query from a data management system,  according to DEA officials.", "To assess State, USAID, DOD, and DEA reporting on their performance  of counternarcotics activities in the Andean countries, we reviewed  agency planning and reporting documents related to counternarcotics  performance measures and targets. We also met with State, USAID,  DOD, and DOJ officials to identify the most significant performance  measures for their counternarcotics activities in the Andean countries. For  the focus of our review, we selected two key measures for each agency  that were identified by agency officials as significant indicators of the  results of their counternarcotics activities, included in the agencies\u2019  annual performance reports to ONDCP, and consistently reported to  ONDCP over the past 5 years for all Andean countries. We assessed the  reliability of agency performance data for these key measures by  interviewing cognizant agency officials about the methods used to gather  and verify this data. We also reviewed related documents, such as  independent data quality assessments and statements from agency  Inspector Generals (IG) attesting to the reliability of agency performance  data. We found limitations with some of the performance data for these  key measures, including (1) lack of available State and USAID data in  Venezuela, and of DEA data in Bolivia, due to limited U.S. presence in  these countries; (2) reliance on partner nations and third parties for  collection and reporting of certain performance data; and (3) lack of IG  authentication of DOD\u2019s reported performance data. We used these data  to describe each agency\u2019s counternarcotics performance measures and  the results related to these measures, as reported by the agencies, in  relation to their counternarcotics performance targets. With the exception  of DOD\u2019s performance data, we determined that the performance data  provided by the agencies were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 through July 2012  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our work objectives.", "Each U.S. agency involved in CSDI has a designated area of  responsibility.  State focuses on eradication, USAID focuses on land  reform and restitution, and DOD focuses on anti-insurgency support.  DEA\u2019s SIU program is not part of CSDI but provides training and  equipment to a vetted unit within the Colombian National Police (CNP).  State, USAID, DOD, and DEA coordinate counternarcotics efforts in  country.", "DOD  In fiscal years 2006 through 2011,  DOD allotted about $752 million for  counternarcotics-related security  assistance in Colombia (see fig. 8).  DOD has provided training and  equipment for the Regional  Helicopter Training Center and pilot  training program in Melgar. DOD has  also provided rotary-wing aircraft  support to the Colombian Joint Task  Force-Omega, which is the main  Colombian task force charged with  confronting the Revolutionary Armed  Forces of Colombia (known by its  Spanish acronym, FARC). DOD  counternarcotics funds have also  developed maritime interdiction  capacity through the purchase of  boats and construction of related  infrastructure in Santa Marta,  Cartagena and other locations.", "Some counternarcotics programs and assets are being transferred to  Colombian control. For example, State\u2019s Plan Colombia Helicopter  Program, initiated in 2002, provides rotary-wing aircraft to develop  Colombian Army aviation. State officials estimated that the last aircraft  provided by the program would be transferred to the government of  Colombia by the end of 2012. Similarly, State\u2019s Colombian National  Police Aviation program has nationalized the cost of fuel to the CNP and  plans for the nationalization of rotary-wing aircraft in 2012. The CNP also  plans to assume financial responsibility for the purchase, transport, and  mixing of glyphosate, the chemical used in aerial eradication, in 2011 and  2012.", "Bolivia  State supports manual eradication efforts in Bolivia by providing training  and equipment to military and police and through aviation programs that  provide aircraft with related training and maintenance to support  transportation and logistics. State also makes aviation assets available  for interdiction purposes, transporting manual eradication teams,  supplies, and equipment to otherwise inaccessible regions of the country.", "State Department: Eradication  and Interdiction   State leads drug crop eradication  efforts in Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru  and supports law enforcement in  each of these countries with training  and equipment to enhance drug  interdiction capacity. State\u2019s primary  effort in Ecuador supports training  and equipment for Ecuador\u2019s  counternarcotics police. State  provided limited assistance In  Venezuela in fiscal years 2006  through 2011. However, State has  used recently reprogrammed funds  for administrative costs associated  with closing its counternarcotics  programs in Venezuela.", "Colombia  State supports aerial and manual eradication in Colombia and provides  assistance to enhance the country\u2019s interdiction capacity. State supports  aerial eradication primarily by hiring a private U.S. contractor to aerially  spread herbicide over areas of coca cultivation. State supports manual  eradication, planned by the Colombian government, by providing  protective equipment for manual eradicators. State has also provided  helicopters and related training and equipment to both the Colombian  Army and the Colombian National Police to enhance the eradication and  interdiction capabilities of those institutions.", "Ecuador  Because Ecuador is a major transit route for narcotics passing from  Colombia and Peru to the United States, State\u2019s counternarcotics  assistance in Ecuador focuses on interdiction efforts and law enforcement  training. State supports programs to improve the institutional capabilities of  Ecuador\u2019s military, police, and judicial sectors to combat narcotics  trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational crimes.", "Peru does not allow aerial eradication.", "The funding allotted by State,  USAID, DOD, and DEA in the  Andean countries primarily  supported, respectively, eradication  and interdiction, alternative  development, military assistance,  and law enforcement capacity  building in Andean countries in fiscal  years 2006 through 2011.", "Bolivia  USAID works with the government of Bolivia to diversify the economies of  coca-growing regions, strengthen productive capacities, improve access to  essential social services, and improve rural road infrastructure. USAID\u2019s  alternative development program provides opportunities for farmers to  transition from production of coca to other viable productive activities.", "USAID: Alternative  Development   USAID focuses on alternative  development in Bolivia, Ecuador,  and Peru and leads stabilization and  alternative development programs in  Colombia. Alternative development  programs provide assistance to  individuals and communities to  facilitate the transition away from  drug crop cultivation as a source of  income. CSDI, the stabilization  program in Colombia, supports the  counternarcotics efforts of the  government of that country. USAID  reported that it did not provide  assistance in Venezuela in fiscal  years 2006 to 2011.", "Colombia   In Colombia, USAID\u2019s primary focus is supporting the stabilization efforts of  the Colombian government to establish and reinforce the government\u2019s  credibility and legitimacy in regions where illegal armed narcotics-trafficking  organizations are active. At the U.S. embassy in Bogot\u00e1, USAID leads CSDI,  which coordinates U.S. programs in Colombia to support the Colombian  government in establishing control over high-priority areas of the country that  have been affected by drug-related conflict. This effort includes providing  support to improve the management of Colombian institutions, such as the  land-titling system.", "Ecuador  In Ecuador, USAID\u2019s counternarcotics effort includes a local business  development program to generate licit employment and increase income for  families along Ecuador\u2019s northern and southern borders by supporting a  market-driven expansion of private enterprises linked to rural producer  groups and associations. Through local business development projects,  USAID provides technical assistance, training, and small grants to stimulate  investment in agribusinesses that are linked to both small producers and  larger markets.", "Peru  USAID supports efforts to help communities to transition from growing coca  to cultivating licit crops. According to USAID, approximately 1 to 3 months  after eradication of illicit crops in an area, communities are offered the  opportunity to sign agreements with the government of Peru, in which the  communities commit to remaining coca free. USAID and DEVIDA, the  Peruvian drug control agency, commit to support the coca-free communities  with a package of assistance tailored to each community\u2019s priorities and  needs. This assistance includes planting new crops, increasing farmers\u2019  access to financial services, and strengthening producer associations and  cooperatives to facilitate access to local and international markets.", "The funding allotted by State,  USAID, DOD, and DEA in the  Andean countries primarily  supported, respectively, eradication  and interdiction, alternative  development, military assistance,  and law enforcement capacity  building in Andean countries in fiscal  years 2006 through 2011.", "DOD reported providing minimal counternarcotics-related military  support to members of the Bolivian armed forces since 2006.
