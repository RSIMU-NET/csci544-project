These positions carry out support and other noncombat-related activities as well as training functions and are essential to the development of officers. However, the overall number of these positions that require a RPA pilot is about one-tenth of the combined number of those requiring other pilots. For example, in fiscal year 2018, 83 non-operational staff positions required RPA pilots compared to 330 requiring fighter pilots. Air Force officials stated that the small number of RPA positions is because the career field is new.", "The Air Force has not reviewed its oversight process to ensure that it is efficiently managing its non-operational staff positions that require aviator expertise. Air Force officials explained that over the last 10 years, the Air Force reduced the number of squadrons but had not reviewed the number of non-operational staff positions. Similarly, the Air Force has had no widely accessible oversight process to monitor whether it had established an accurate number of non-operational staff positions required to support the new RPA career field. In August 2018, the Air Force identified 513 non-operational staff positions (out of 2,783) as needing further review because they lacked adequate justification of the need for aviator expertise. Officials described the process for managing these positions as time and labor intensive, which can cause delays in obtaining reliable information needed to inform decision-making.

Additionally, we found that RPA pilot promotion rates were lower  than those for other career fields. The Air Force generally concurred with  our seven recommendations in that report to address these issues and  subsequently has fully implemented all but one recommendation to  analyze the career field effect of being an RPA pilot to determine whether  and how being an RPA pilot is related to promotions. Further, in January  2017, we found, among other things, that the Air Force could improve its  strategic human capital planning, and we made three recommendations  to the Air Force and two to the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  for Personnel and Readiness to which they generally concurred. As of  July 2018, the Air Force had taken some action, but has not fully  implemented these recommendations.

Therefore, the Air Force assignment  rate for staff positions requiring fighter pilots is significantly lower than the  rate for staff positions requiring other types of pilots. For example, in fiscal  year 2017, the Air Force assignment rate for staff positions requiring a  fighter pilot was 18 percent, which was less than a quarter of the rate for  staff positions requiring an RPA pilot, as shown in table 3."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Has Not Reviewed Its Oversight Process to Manage Its Non- operational Staff Positions That Require Aviator Expertise", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has not reviewed its oversight process to ensure that it is  effectively and efficiently managing its review of non-operational staff  positions that require aviator expertise, such as RPA pilots. Air Force  officials explained that its oversight process for managing these positions  requiring pilot expertise consists of a time-consuming, labor-intensive  process of exchanging emails and spreadsheets with 57 organizations,  such as various Air Force Major commands like the Air Combat  Command, the Air Force Special Operations Command, and the National  Guard Bureau. According to these officials, this process consists of the  maintenance and exchange of spreadsheets and briefing slides with  information about every position found throughout the Air Force and in  various other entities that are required to be reviewed and validated  annually. Additionally, this process is maintained by one official within the  Headquarters Air Force who must exchange the spreadsheets via email  approximately twice a year with officials from each of the organizations  that are responsible for annually justifying their continued need for non- operational staff positions requiring aviator expertise. Air Force officials  stated that this process does not always produce complete and accurate  information in a timely manner as in some instances the information  produced is not relevant by the time a complete review of the positions is  accomplished.", "Headquarters Air Force officials familiar with its oversight responsibilities  stated that using a different system would more efficiently and effectively  support their ability to manipulate, analyze and share information among  the applicable organizations and make informed decisions. For example,  these officials explained that over the last 10 years, the Air Force drew  down the number of squadrons, but did not do a good job of cross  checking that reduced number of squadrons with a revised number of  staff positions required for support. Therefore, the number of non- operational staff positions was not adjusted and are now artificially high in  some career fields and others may have fewer non-operational staff  positions than needed. These officials added that as the new RPA pilot  career field has developed, there has been no timely and widely  accessible system of checks and balances to establish an accurate  number of non-operational staff positions required to support the career  field. Further, they said that using a different system that allows them to  have more timely and quality information would enhance their ability to  manage and make decisions regarding the appropriate mix of expensive  pilots and others with aviator expertise between operational line positions  and non-operational staff position needs. They said this would better  ensure that there is a reasonable range of non-operational staff positions  required for each career field, such as for the growing RPA pilot career  field.", "An October 2017 memorandum from the Air Force Chief of Staff stated  that the number of non-operational staff positions which require aviation  expertise must be brought into balance with the Air Force\u2019s ability to  produce the appropriate number of officers with aviator expertise. The  memorandum also stated that organizations were strongly encouraged to  change their current requirements to meet the available current force  levels including converting chronically unfilled non-operational staff  positions requiring aviator expertise to positions specifically designated  for RPA pilots. As a result of two separate reviews, Air Force officials  identified hundreds of these positions that lacked adequate justification or  qualifications to support the positions\u2019 requirement to be filled by officers  with aviator expertise. For example, in August 2018, out of 2,783 non- operational staff positions, the Air Force found that 513 of these positions  were evaluated as lacking adequate justification or mission qualifications  to support the need for aviator expertise and 61 positions were eliminated  after further review.", "Prior to 2010, according to officials, the Headquarters Air Force  maintained a web-based management oversight system to review and  approve the justifications for its non-operational staff positions requiring  aviator expertise that allowed for wide access to and manipulation and  timely analyses of information. Additionally, this former system provided  multilevel coordination among Headquarters Air Force and its major  commands for reviewing the justifications of all of the positions. According  to Headquarters Air Force officials, the use of this management oversight  system was discontinued in 2010 due to a decision to no longer fund the  contractor maintaining the system. In October 2018, officials from one of  the Air Force\u2019s Major Commands confirmed that the current oversight  system in use is time-consuming, does not readily support information  analysis and that plans to integrate it with another existing management  system had not happened.", "The Headquarters Air Force official in charge of managing this process  told us that he had submitted multiple requests over the last 3 years to  integrate the information being managed with spreadsheets and emails  into an existing personnel management system to improve the efficiency  of the process. However, according to this official, higher priorities and funding issues have precluded the information from being integrated into  another existing system. In September, 2018, another Air Force official  told us that the Program Management Office that manages a system into  which the information could be integrated was behind schedule in  implementing several other system updates. Because of these delays, the  official acknowledged that no review has yet been done of what is needed  to provide the most efficient management oversight process of the  information currently being managed via the spreadsheet process. The  official said that before any actions could take place, a review of  requirements and priorities would be needed in order to make a  determination as to what changes could be made. Therefore, he said that  there are no decisions or timelines available for reviewing a process that  would provide the validation information for non-operational staff positions  in a timelier and widely accessible manner.", "Air Force instructions state that major commands are required to perform  annual aircrew requirements reviews including review and revalidation of  all aircrew positions, except for rank of colonel or higher, to ensure aviator  expertise is required, and report the results to the Headquarters Air Force  Operations Training Division. Further, the Headquarters Air Force  Operations Training Division has the responsibility to ensure a  management process is in place to provide efficient and effective  oversight of the major commands\u2019 annual review and revalidation of the  aircrew position requirements process. Additionally, Standards for Internal  Control in the Federal Government states that management should  identify needed information, obtain the relevant information from reliable  sources in a timely manner, and process the information into quality data  to make informed decisions and evaluate its performance in achieving  key objectives and addressing risks.", "By reviewing its oversight process, the Air Force may be able to identify a  more efficient manner to manage its non-operational staff positions that  require aviator expertise. A management oversight process that provides  timely and widely accessible position justification information may help  ensure that the proper type of aviator expertise needed in these positions  is up to date. In turn, this could result in a more efficient use of the Air  Force\u2019s short supply of expensive pilot resources, particularly fighter  pilots, and could potentially improve its ability to assign and develop  effective leaders, such as those within the growing RPA career field."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force continues to expand the use of RPAs in its varied missions  of intelligence gathering, surveillance and reconnaissance, and combat  operations. While the overall number of eligible RPA pilots is much  smaller compared to other pilots, over the last 5 years RPA pilots have  achieved promotions and nominations to attend developmental education  programs at rates that were generally similar in comparison to pilots in  other career fields. Additionally, non-operational staff positions requiring  RPA pilots have been assigned to entities at high rates since 2013, but  the number of positions available to them is smaller than the number that  require fighter, bomber, and mobility pilots because the career field is still  growing.", "Air Force officials have noted problems with the current oversight process  which may be hindering its ability to efficiently and effectively manage  these non-operational staff positions as required by Air Force policy. For  example, the Air Force has recently identified that a large number of  these positions designated as requiring officers with aviator expertise  lacked adequate justification for that requirement. By reviewing the  efficiency and effectiveness of its management oversight process that  provides information in a timelier and more widely accessible manner, the  Air Force could better ensure that it makes informed decisions regarding  the need for pilots in certain non-operational staff positions and is in  compliance with policy. It also could help ensure that the Air Force more  efficiently uses its short supply of expensive pilot resources.

In its comments, DOD stated that it agrees the current oversight process  is time-consuming and could be more efficient. However, it believes this  process is effective because the Air Force was able to validate the need  for having pilots fill a majority of its non-operational staff positions during  a recent congressionally-mandated review of these positions. As we  reported, this review of all staff positions requiring aviator expertise  across the Air Force and other defense entities discovered more than 500  of approximately 2,800 positions that were initially found to be lacking  adequate justifications, and 61 positions eventually were eliminated. We  believe the Air Force\u2019s results from this one-time review is an example of  how the current process is not consistently yielding up-to-date validations  of positions. Further, DOD also stated that while a move to automating  the process again has been considered, current funding shortfalls prevent  the Air Force from establishing an automated system to increase the  process\u2019s efficiency. We continue to believe that the Air Force should  review its current process in order to identify any viable means to  increase its efficiency and effectiveness.
