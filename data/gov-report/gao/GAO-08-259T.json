The award of the fourth contract, originally scheduled for 2005, was awarded in September 2007. In addition, one project had incurred cost overruns and increases to its projected life-cycle cost. As a result of the schedule changes, the full complement of systems and functionality that were originally planned will not be available for upcoming Dress Rehearsal operational testing. This limitation increases the importance of further system testing to ensure that the decennial systems work as intended. The Bureau's project teams for each of the four IT acquisitions had performed many practices associated with establishing sound and capable risk management processes, but critical weaknesses remained. Three project teams had developed a risk management strategy that identified the scope of the risk management effort. However, not all project teams had identified risks, established mitigation plans, or reported risks to executive-level officials. For example, one project team did not adequately identify risks associated with performance issues experienced by handheld mobile computing devices, even though Census field staff reported slow and inconsistent data transmissions with the device during the spring Dress Rehearsal operations. The magnitude of these difficulties is not clear, and the Bureau has not fully specified how it plans to measure the performance of the devices.

However, the process of  developing detailed requirements from high-level functional requirements  does not inevitably lead to cost increases if the functional requirements  were initially well-defined.", "The FDCA schedule changes have increased the likelihood that the  systems testing at the Dress Rehearsal will not be as comprehensive as  planned.

The  computers are designed to automate operations for field staff and  eliminate the need to print millions of paper questionnaires and maps used  by temporary field staff to conduct address canvassing and nonresponse  follow-up. Automating operations may allow the Bureau to reduce the cost  of operations; thus, it is critical that the risks surrounding the use of the  handheld computers be closely monitored and effectively managed to  ensure their success. However, the Bureau has not identified or  documented risks associated with a variety of handheld computers  performance problems that we identified through field work conducted at  your request. Specifically, we found that during Dress Rehearsal activities  between May 2007 and June 2007, as the Bureau tested a prototype of the  handheld computers, field staff experienced multiple problems. For  example, the field staff told us that they experienced slow and inconsistent  data transmissions from the handheld computers to the central data  processing center. The field staff reported the device was slow to process  addresses that were a part of a large assignment area. Bureau staff  reported similar problems with the handheld computers in observation  reports, help desk calls, and debriefing reports. In addition, our own  analysis of Bureau documentation revealed problems with the handheld  computers:    Bureau observation reports revealed that the Bureau most frequently  observed problems with slow processing of addresses, large  assignment areas, and transmission.", "The help desk call log revealed that field staff most frequently reported  issues with transmission, the device freezing, mapspotting and  assignment areas.", "Debriefing reports illustrated the impact of the handheld mobile  computing problems on address canvassing. For example, one  participant commented that the field staff struggled to find solutions to  problems and wasted precious time in replacing the devices.", "A time-and-motion study conducted by the Census Bureau indicated  that field staff reported significant downtime in two test locations\u2014 about 23 percent in one location and about 27 percent in another  location. The study, which is a draft that is subject to change, also  described occurrences of failed transmissions and field staff attempts  to resolve transmission problems.", "Collectively, the observation reports, help desk calls, debriefing reports,  and time-and-motion study raised serious questions about the  performance of the handheld computers during the address canvassing  operation. According to the Bureau, the contractor has used these  indicators to identify and address underlying problems during the Dress  Rehearsal. Still, the magnitude of handheld computers performance issues  throughout the Dress Rehearsal remains unclear. For example, the Bureau  received analyses from the contractor on average transmission times.  However, the contractor has not provided analyses that show the full  range of transmission times, nor how this may have changed throughout  the entire operation.", "In addition, the Bureau has not fully specified how it will measure  performance of the handheld computers, even though the FDCA contract  anticipates the Bureau\u2019s need for data on the performance of the handheld  computers. The FDCA contract outlines the type of data the contractor  will provide the Bureau on the performance of the handheld computers.  Specifically, sections of the FDCA contract require the handheld  computers to have a transmission log with what was transmitted, the date,  time, user, destination, content/data type, and the outcome status. Another  section of the Bureau\u2019s FDCA contract states that the FDCA contractor  shall provide near real time reporting and monitoring of performance  metrics and a \u201ccontrol panel/dash board\u201d application to visually report  those metrics from any Internet enabled PC. However, the contractor and  the Bureau are not using a dashboard for Dress Rehearsal activities.  Rather, during the Dress Rehearsal, the Bureau plans to identify what data  and performance they would need for tracking the performance of the  handheld computers in 2010 operations.", "In order for the Bureau to ensure that the FDCA handheld computers are  ready for full scale operations, it will have to identify risks on a tight time  frame. We recommended in a report on the Bureau\u2019s earlier version of the  handheld computers that the Bureau define specific, measurable  performance requirements for the handheld computer and other census- taking activities that address such important measures as productivity,  cost savings, reliability, durability, and that the Bureau test the device\u2019s  ability to meet those requirements in 2006.We also recommended in a  March 2006 testimony that the Bureau validate and approve FDCA  baseline requirements. The Bureau is working within a compressed time  frame. By law, the decennial census must occur on April 1, 2010, and the  results must be submitted to the President in December 2010. These dates  cannot be altered, even if preparations are delayed. Access to real-time  performance metrics via a \u201ccontrol panel/dash board\u201d would assist Bureau  management in assessing the handheld computer\u2019s performance and  maximize the amount of time the Bureau and the contractor would have to  remedy any problems identified during operations. Further, the Bureau\u2019s  tight 2010 Decennial Operations Schedule allows little time for fixing  problems with the device, raising the importance of the Bureau\u2019s access to  these performance indicators. Such data would help fully inform  stakeholders of the risks associated with the handheld computer, and  allow project teams to develop mitigation activities to help avoid, reduce,  and control the probability of these risks occurring.", "Finally, the FDCA and DADSII project teams did not provide evidence that  specific system interface risks are being adequately identified to ensure  that risk handling activities will be invoked should the systems fail during  2010 Census. For example, although the DADS II will not be available for  the Dress Rehearsal, the project team did not identify any significant  interface risks associated with this system.", "One reason for these weaknesses, as mentioned earlier, is the lack of  Bureau policies for managing major acquisitions.

First, to ensure that the Bureau\u2019s decennial systems are fully tested, we  recommended that the Secretary of Commerce require the Director of the  Census Bureau to direct the Decennial Management Division and  Geography Division to plan for and perform end-to-end testing so that the  full complement of systems are tested in a census-like environment.", "In written comments on a draft of our final report, the department  disagreed with our findings that a full complement of systems would not  be tested, stating it plans to do so during the Dress Rehearsal or later.  Nonetheless, the Bureau\u2019s test plans have not been finalized, and it  remains unclear whether testing will address all interrelated systems and  functionality in a census-like environment, as would be provided by end- to-end testing. Consistent with our recommendation following up with  documented test plans to do end-to-end testing will help ensure that  decennial systems will work as intended.", "Further, we recommended that the Secretary direct the Director of the  Census Bureau to ensure that project teams strengthen risk management  activities associated with risk identification, mitigation, and oversight. The  department agreed to examine additional ways to manage risks and is  working on an action plan to strengthen risk management activities.", "In summary, the IT acquisitions planned for 2010 Census will require  continued oversight to ensure that they are achieved on schedule and at  planned cost levels. Although, as of October 2007, the MTAIP and DRIS  acquisitions were currently meeting cost estimates, FDCA was not. In  addition, while the Bureau was making progress developing systems for  the Dress Rehearsal, it was deferring certain functionality, with the result  that the Dress Rehearsal operational testing would address less than a full  complement of systems. Delaying functionality increases the importance  of later development and testing activities, which will have to occur closer  to the census date. It also raises the risk of cost increases, given the  immovable deadline for conducting the 2010 Census.", "Further, the Bureau\u2019s project teams for each of the four acquisitions had  implemented many practices associated with establishing sound and  capable risk management processes, but they were not always consistent:  the teams had not always identified risks, developed complete risk  mitigation plans, or briefed senior-level officials on risks and mitigation  plans. At this stage, we are particularly concerned about managing the  risks associated with the handheld mobile computing devices, the  numerous systems interfaces, and the remaining systems testing.  Regarding the handheld mobile computing devices, it is critical that  performance of these devices is clearly specified, measured, and that  deficiencies in performance is effectively addressed. Until the project  teams and the Decennial Management Division implement appropriate risk  management activities, they face an increased probability that decennial  systems will not be delivered on schedule and within budget or perform as  expected.", "Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, this concludes our  statement.
