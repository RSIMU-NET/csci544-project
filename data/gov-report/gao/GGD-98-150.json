For returns filed on paper, staff in IRS\u2019 service centers are to enter tax return and Schedule EIC data into computers that check for math errors. If a math error that affects EIC eligibility or the size of the EIC claim is found, IRS is to reduce or deny the EIC accordingly. IRS is to then send a notice to the taxpayer explaining the change to his or her tax liability and refund. Taxpayers have 60 days to protest IRS\u2019 actions, either in writing or by telephone, and to provide additional data supporting their original claims.

IRS\u2019 primary effort to identify fraudulent refund claims, including those involving the EIC, is the Questionable Refund Program (QRP), established in the 1970s and run by IRS\u2019 Criminal Investigation Division. Using a scoring system based on known noncompliance patterns, an IRS computer program analyzes all incoming returns to identify those that are potentially fraudulent. Then, questionable refund detection teams in the 10 service centers are to perform more in-depth reviews and, if a return is considered fraudulent, stop any refund before it is issued.", "IRS\u2019 examination units in service centers and district offices review other potentially erroneous EIC claims that do not meet the criteria for inclusion in the math error or questionable refund programs. Service center staff review cases that do not require face-to-face contact with the taxpayer. Cases requiring face-to-face contact are done by district offices. Questionable refund detection teams are to refer cases with EIC errors that are not considered fraudulent to the examination units. Examination staff may also review cases included in special enforcement or compliance research projects. When examination staff determine that an EIC claim is erroneous, they are to notify the taxpayer of that finding and advise the taxpayer of his or her appeal rights.

To learn more about EIC compliance, IRS conducted a broader study of tax year 1994 returns filed both electronically and on paper. The results of that study, released in April 1997, are the subject of this report. In 1996, IRS began a third study involving tax year 1995 returns.

In doing so, we considered the following questions:", "Does the study population appear to represent the population of all EIC filers during the period from January 15 through April 21, 1995?", "Was the sample drawn in accordance with probability selection principles?", "Were sufficient data verifying compliance with all EIC eligibility requirements collected from the EIC claimant and other sources?", "Were IRS staff collecting the data knowledgeable of how to apply EIC eligibility rules?", "Did the data collection procedures include controls to help ensure consistency in the evaluation of cases?", "Was data entry into the final database verified?", "Was the database checked for internal consistency, outliers, and invalid codes?", "How precise were the reported overclaim estimates?", "We also reviewed available data on IRS\u2019 design of the tax year 1997 EIC compliance study to see how, if at all, that study addressed problems we identified with the tax year 1994 study.", "To determine the primary sources of EIC noncompliance on tax year 1994 returns, we analyzed the tax year 1994 study dataset as provided by IRS and modified through OTA editing programs.

For returns filed with an EIC claim, the tax year 1994 study was designed to evaluate taxpayers\u2019 compliance with each EIC eligibility filing requirement, to produce an overall estimate of EIC amounts claimed in error, and to identify the sources of error. The study was not designed to detect or quantify EIC claims that taxpayers could have made, but did not. For example, the $4.4 billion overclaim estimate includes about $780 million in overclaims associated with errors in applying the AGI tiebreaker rule. That rule provides that if a child meets the conditions to be a qualifying child of more than one person, only the person who had the highest AGI may treat that child as a qualifying child. As the 1994 study was designed, if IRS determined under the AGI tiebreaker rules that a person claiming the EIC was not entitled to it because there was another person in the household with a higher income, IRS would disallow the claim and include it as an overclaim in computing the study results. However, because these overclaims are not offset by any claim that could have been made by the other person involved in the tiebreaker, the ultimate savings to the government could be less than $780 million.", "With this basic limitation in mind, we found that overall, IRS\u2019 study was designed and conducted in such a way that it produced a reasonably accurate estimate of noncompliance on returns filed with an EIC claim. Although some issues with the study design affected the precision of the results, our analysis showed that these limitations did not affect the study\u2019s major message or its usefulness in designing compliance approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IRS\u2019 Study Methodology Supported the Reported Findings", "paragraphs": ["IRS\u2019 study is representative of taxpayers filing an EIC claim on a tax year 1994 return filed between January 15 and April 21, 1995. We found that IRS used an appropriate statistical sampling procedure to select the 2,046 returns included in the study, and the sample appears to represent taxpayers who filed an EIC claim during that period. As an indicator of whether the EIC study sample was representative of EIC returns filed during the study time frame, we assumed that study returns should have characteristics similar to EIC returns filed during the entire year, as measured in IRS\u2019 SOI sample of tax year 1994 returns filed throughout 1995. IRS\u2019 April 1997 compliance study report compared weighted data on the distribution of claimants by paper or electronic filing, filing status, number of qualifying children, AGI range, and source of income for the study sample and the full tax year 1994 SOI sample. With the exception of the percentage of EIC claimants reporting self-employment income (6.3 percent among taxpayers in the compliance study compared to 15.3 percent of taxpayers in the SOI sample), weighted compliance study data closely paralleled data based on the SOI sample. The apparent underrepresentation of claimants reporting self-employment income is discussed in more detail later.", "In evaluating how IRS collected data on the accuracy of taxpayers\u2019 EIC claims, we considered the following criteria: (1) whether IRS collected sufficient data to verify each aspect of EIC eligibility, (2) whether field agents and case reviewers knew how EIC rules were to be applied, and (3) whether the study procedures included controls designed to ensure consistency among cases. After reviewing study documentation and selected case files, we concluded that overall, IRS\u2019 study methodology met these criteria.", "IRS\u2019 data collection proceeded in two stages: initial taxpayer interviews and supplemental data collection in the field and a final review of complete case files at the Cincinnati Service Center. For each taxpayer in the study, IRS built a case file including transcripts of prior years\u2019 returns, the tax year 1994 return, associated information reports (W-2s and 1099s), information on duplicate use of or invalid qualifying child SSNs, and dates of birth for filers and their children. Field agents were given initial case files containing data available at the time, written instructions on the information required to verify the claim, and checksheets to record findings. These instructions and checksheets covered all aspects of EIC eligibility. Field agents were required to contact, in person, the taxpayer; employers; the transmitter of the electronically filed return, if any; and the paid preparer, if any. If additional information was needed to verify the claim, the agents were to contact neighbors, schools, or state agencies as appropriate. This type of face-to-face contact with the taxpayer was necessary to verify the claim because eligibility of qualifying children is self-determined; and, other than SSNs, IRS does not have third-party information that can be used to verify the children\u2019s eligibility. Data collection by the field agents was followed by a \u201cbest and final\u201d review at the Cincinnati Service Center. These reviewers had access to additional information, primarily third-party income reports, that was not available at the time the field agents contacted the taxpayers. Using this additional information, the reviewers made final decisions regarding disposition of the claim.", "Most of the taxpayer interviews and other field data collection were done by IRS special agents from the Criminal Investigation Division or revenue agents from the Examination Division. The service center reviewers were Criminal Investigation Division tax examiners. On the basis of our prior work, we consider these staff generally to be adequately trained in audit techniques and how to apply EIC rules.", "IRS\u2019 study methodology included controls designed to ensure consistency among cases. IRS used standard data collection checksheets and written instructions as one means to ensure consistent data collection. In addition, after completing an investigation, the field agents were instructed to call a study coordinator at IRS\u2019 Cincinnati Service Center to discuss the case. This study coordinator was to review the findings to ensure completeness and consistency with other cases before the case was sent to the Cincinnati Service Center for final review. In spite of these controls, we found one consistency-related issue, regarding the corrected filing status for married taxpayers who erroneously filed as head of household, that may have systematically affected the study findings. This issue is discussed in more detail later.", "In reviewing IRS\u2019 procedures for ensuring the quality of final study data used, we considered whether IRS (1) verified data entry into the final database; and (2) checked for internal consistency, outliers, and invalid codes. We found that OTA staff did a comprehensive review of the database to find and correct internal consistency and data transcription errors. This review of the data was necessary because IRS did not verify data entry or check for internal consistency within case records as the database was created. We verified data entry of key variables for the 122 cases included in our case file review and found no data errors. We used the OTA-corrected data for our analysis.", "IRS and OTA used the data to estimate the total amount of EIC overclaimed by the population represented by the sample of taxpayers filing EIC claims from January 15 to April 21, 1995. We replicated this analysis and arrived at the same totals. Data from the study are estimates based on the sample of EIC returns. To indicate the precision of these estimates, we calculated confidence intervals at the 95 percent confidence level. For example, as shown in table 2, IRS determined that taxpayers overclaimed a total of $4,448 million in EIC. The 95 percent confidence interval for this estimate is  $412 million (\u2013  9.3 percent of $4,448 million). This indicates that we are 95-percent confident that the actual overclaim amount is between $4,036 million and $4,860 million. The confidence interval for the 25.8 percent overclaim rate ranges from 23.4 percent to 28.2 percent.", "As shown in table 2, taxpayers with no qualifying children accounted for only a small portion of the EIC dollars claimed for tax year 1994 and $81 million of the overclaim total. The 95 percent confidence interval is $24 million to $138 million.", "Besides the overclaim estimate in table 2, IRS included in its report an estimate of total underclaims by taxpayers filing a tax year 1994 return with an EIC claim. That estimate was $293 million and has a confidence interval of $129 million to $457 million, or \u2013  56.0 percent of the point estimate. The sample of taxpayers with underclaimed EIC is too small to allow IRS to make reliable estimates by number of qualifying children."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Minor Methodology Problems Affected the Precision of IRS\u2019 Study Results", "paragraphs": ["Through our review of IRS\u2019 study methodology, we identified two issues that affected the final study results. These issues are (1) apparent underrepresentation in the sample of claimants reporting self-employment income on a Schedule C and (2) apparent inconsistencies in correcting the filing status of married taxpayers who erroneously filed as head of household. Although we were not able to precisely quantify their net impact, our analysis showed that neither of these issues was large enough in scale to alter the major study findings.", "Filers who report self-employment income on a Schedule C appear to be underrepresented in the tax year 1994 EIC study sample. SOI data for all taxpayers who filed in 1995 show that 15.3 percent of EIC claimants reported Schedule C income. In contrast, 6.3 percent of claimants in the EIC compliance study filed a Schedule C. Self-employment income is often not subject to third-party information reporting; consequently, IRS has found that Schedule C filers in general are more likely to misreport their income than are taxpayers with wage income. A change in income, however, will often result in an incremental change in the EIC rather than a full denial. The impact of underrepresenting Schedule C filers in the tax year 1994 study is unknown and depends on how the filers left out of the sample might differ from those included. IRS\u2019 ongoing compliance study of tax year 1997 EIC returns includes specific sampling of Schedule C returns and will sample through May; that study should be more representative of Schedule C EIC filers.", "Inconsistencies in determining the correct filing status for married taxpayers who erroneously filed as head of household also may have affected the final overclaim estimate. Taxpayers who use a filing status of married filing separately are ineligible for the EIC. Married taxpayers filing a joint return can claim the EIC if their joint income is within the eligible income range and they meet other qualifying criteria. When a taxpayer erroneously claimed head of household and was living with his or her spouse, the data collection instructions for the tax year 1994 study specifically directed field agents to use the filing status most advantageous to the taxpayer, usually married filing jointly (with appropriate changes to income, dependents, exemptions, etc.).", "We, and OTA staff who also reviewed case files, found instances in which field agents did not follow these instructions. The $4.4 billion overclaim estimate included $631 million accounted for by taxpayers whose filing status was changed by IRS to married filing separately in the absence of qualifying child errors and whose EIC was denied completely. It appears that some of these taxpayers may have been eligible for the EIC had IRS prepared a joint return; and, to the extent that their joint income would have allowed an EIC claim, the $631 million may be overstated. Although this filing status issue reduces the precision of the study findings, particularly in terms of identifying sources of noncompliance, we believe its impact to be relatively minor given the size of the total overclaim estimate. IRS data collection instructions for the tax year 1997 study state that field agents should attempt to obtain a copy of the spouse\u2019s 1997 return to insert into the case file when filing status is changed to married filing jointly or married filing separately. However, the instructions did not specifically state that married filing jointly should be the presumptive filing status."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Largest Source of EIC Overclaims for Tax Year 1994 Was Nonqualifying Children", "paragraphs": ["The largest source of noncompliance found in the tax year 1994 study relates to the EIC requirements most difficult for IRS to verify\u2014those related to the eligibility of qualifying children.

This rule does not apply if the other person is the taxpayer\u2019s spouse and they are filing a joint return. For example, if a child meets conditions to be a qualifying child for both a parent and grandparent who share a household and the grandparent has a higher AGI, the grandparent must claim the child.

Together, these two types of qualifying child errors accounted for about half of the $4.4 billion overclaim total. As noted earlier, however, IRS\u2019 study did not offset overclaims by claims that could have been made by other taxpayers. For example, in AGI tiebreaker cases, it is possible that the taxpayer with the higher AGI might have been able to claim an EIC. It is also possible in residency cases that a taxpayer in the household where the child actually lives could make an EIC claim for the child in question.

Both field agents and Cincinnati Service Center case reviewers were to classify taxpayers\u2019 errors as intentional (e.g., the taxpayer knew that a child did not meet EIC qualifying child tests); or unintentional (e.g., the taxpayer did not understand the eligibility rules or EIC instructions). We found that field agents had not made determinations of intent in about 40 percent of the final overclaim cases. In almost all of these instances, however, Cincinnati reviewers made a determination of intent as part of their best and final review. Based on best and final case data, about one-half of the 4.7 million returns with an EIC overclaim and two-thirds of the total amount overclaimed were considered to be the result of intentional errors.

Unlike income transfer programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Food Stamps, the EIC is designed to be administered through the tax system rather than through other state or federal agencies. This choice generally should result in lower administrative costs and higher participation rates and emphasizes that the credit is for working taxpayers. The trade-off, however, is higher noncompliance. EIC eligibility, particularly related to qualifying children, is difficult for IRS to verify through traditional enforcement procedures, such as matching return data to third-party information reports. Correctly applying the residency test and AGI tiebreaker rules, for example, often involves understanding complex living arrangements and child custody issues. Organizations that administer programs like Food Stamps are set up to investigate and verify this type of eligibility before payment is made; IRS is not. Thoroughly verifying qualifying child eligibility basically requires IRS to do an audit of the type done in the EIC compliance studies\u2014a costly, time-consuming, and intrusive proposition. IRS has designed some compliance efforts to reduce qualifying child noncompliance but cannot fully address a significant root cause\u2014design of the EIC itself.", "Most of the efforts that make up the EIC compliance initiative had not progressed far enough at the time we completed our audit for us to make any judgment about their effectiveness.

Congress included four of the six proposals in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 (TRA97). Specifically, these provisions (1) require paid preparers to fulfill certain due diligence standards when preparing EIC claims for taxpayers; (2) provide that taxpayers who fraudulently claim the EIC can be denied the credit for 10 years, and those who recklessly or intentionally disregard the rules and regulations can be denied the credit for 2 years; (3) provide that taxpayers who are denied the EIC through IRS\u2019 deficiency proceduresare ineligible to claim the EIC in subsequent years unless they provide evidence of their eligibility through a recertification process; and (4) allow IRS to levy up to 15 percent of unemployment and means-tested public assistance and certain other specified payments. In addition, TRA97 included provisions that (1) give IRS access to the Department of Health and Human Service\u2019s (HHS) Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders, a federal database compiling state information on child support payments that could help IRS identify erroneous EIC claims by noncustodial parents; and (2) require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to collect SSNs of birth parents and provide IRS with information linking the parents\u2019 and child\u2019s SSNs.", "Besides the new enforcement tools provided in TRA97, Congress began funding the EIC compliance initiative. For fiscal year 1998, the first year of what is to be a 5-year effort, Congress appropriated $138 million. For the second year (fiscal year 1999), IRS has requested $143 million.

IRS data show that many taxpayers took advantage of the expanded customer service IRS offered in 1998. For example, IRS expanded telephone access for EIC-related issues to 7 days a week, 24 hours a day. According to IRS data, 95,000 taxpayers called the EIC assistance lines during the times when IRS\u2019 other assistance lines were not available. In addition, IRS provided Saturday walk-in assistance at between 152 and 173 sites from March 7 through April 11, 1998. IRS data show that staff available on these 6 Saturdays helped 2,949 taxpayers prepare their EIC returns and provided 1,032 others with different types of EIC-related assistance. According to IRS, this is in addition to 185,305 EIC taxpayers assisted on weekdays during the filing season.", "Some choices IRS made in implementing its assistance and outreach efforts in 1998, however, limited the number of persons who might have benefited. For example: IRS did not offer Saturday walk-in assistance until March 7, by which time millions of EIC claims had already been filed. IRS reported that it had received about 7.4 million EIC claims as of February 21, 1998\u20142 weeks before the first Saturday that walk-in help was available. EIC Awareness and Problem Prevention days were held even later in the filing season. IRS said that it did not offer Saturday service earlier in the year because \u201cprior to receiving the [EIC] appropriation, we had anticipated having Saturday service for only the last six weeks of the filing season\u201d when, according to IRS officials, demand among all filers is generally higher. The date for the EIC Awareness Day was selected so that IRS would have adequate time to publicize and provide for quality service to the public. IRS officials said, in retrospect, it could have been more effective if scheduled earlier. IRS did not advertise the 24-hour availability of telephone assistance for EIC-related issues. IRS informed taxpayers of this service only if they received a notice from IRS about a problem with the EIC claims on their tax returns. IRS officials told us that they did not advertise this service because they thought that it would lead to many non-EIC calls during the hours when other assistance lines were closed.", "As noted earlier, TRA97 included provisions that allow IRS to deny future EIC claims. These provisions are to be implemented in 1999, based on returns filed in 1998. For example, persons found to have intentionally disregarded the rules and regulations in filing their EIC claims in 1998 can be denied the credit for the following 2 years. IRS attempted to warn taxpayers about the implication of these provisions before they filed their returns in 1998. Those outreach efforts were intended to create a deterrent effect by providing an incentive for intentionally noncompliant taxpayers to file a correct return and for other taxpayers to be sure that they understand the EIC rules before filing. To the extent that result was achieved, the number of EIC errors may have been reduced. Although we have no way of knowing how successful those warnings were in encouraging better compliance, we believe that the chances for success might have been enhanced if IRS had done a better job of publicizing those warnings.", "In that regard, IRS\u2019 income tax return instructions did not alert taxpayers as clearly as they could have about the TRA97 provisions and their implications. The tax year 1997 Form 1040 tax package included the following statement in its general information on \u201cwhat\u2019s new for 1997\u201d: \u201cCaution: If it is determined that you are not entitled to the EIC you claim, you may not be allowed to take the credit for certain future years. See [Publication] 596 for details.\u201d A reference to this caution was not included later in the package either with the instructions for filling in the EIC line item on the tax return, the EIC worksheets, or the Schedule EIC that taxpayers must submit with their returns to substantiate their EIC claims. Thus, IRS was relying on taxpayers to read the general information in the front of the tax package before preparing their returns and, assuming they did, to order Publication 596 for details. For tax year 1996, about 19 million taxpayers claimed the EIC and IRS distributed about 636,000 copies of Publication 596. We believe that potential EIC claimants would have been more likely to read the relevant information from Publication 596 if it had been included in the Form 1040 instructions, along with statements in the EIC-specific parts of those instructions that clearly alerted taxpayers to the existence of that warning and where to find it."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Enforcement and Research", "paragraphs": ["The customer service and outreach efforts discussed above are generally broad based and not targeted to specific sources of EIC noncompliance.

IRS\u2019 tax year 1994 EIC compliance study showed that qualifying child errors associated with the residency requirement and AGI tiebreaker rules accounted for about half of the $4.4 billion EIC overclaim total and 1.8 million of the 2.3 million returns with a qualifying child error. These errors undoubtedly included both unintentional mistakes and intentional noncompliance and involved a variety of complex living situations.", "IRS is able to verify some EIC eligibility criteria using tax return or Schedule EIC information and does so through its math error program as returns are submitted. IRS receives few indicators, however, of other problematic eligibility requirements, such as qualifying child residency or the presence of another taxpayer in the household who should be claiming the child. IRS has targeted its enforcement efforts on those compliance problems that can be identified from tax return information or profiles of noncompliant returns and is able to resolve some eligibility issues through correspondence audits. However, the bulk of noncompliance, primarily related to qualifying children, can best be identified through face-to-face audits.", "One component of the compliance initiative that combines elements of customer outreach and enforcement is targeted on cases where a qualifying child\u2019s SSN is used on more than one tax return for the same tax year. Because a qualifying child can be claimed only once, resolution of these duplicate SSN cases should eliminate EIC claims by taxpayers with whom the child did not reside. For the outreach portion of this effort, IRS identified about 225,000 qualifying child SSNs that had been used by more than one taxpayer on tax year 1996 returns. In December 1997, IRS sent taxpayers using these SSNs (about 383,000 taxpayers) a notice informing them of the problem and reminding them to file a correct return for tax year 1997. To evaluate the effectiveness of these notices, IRS plans to check for duplicate use of these qualifying child SSNs on tax year 1997 returns. According to IRS, it plans to begin its evaluation in September 1998 and report the results in February 1999.", "For the compliance portion of this effort, IRS allocated additional staff to audit as many as 140,000 taxpayers who had used about 92,000 duplicate qualifying child SSNs in both tax years 1995 and 1996. According to IRS officials, as of May 16, 1998, about 103,000 of the 140,000 taxpayers had filed tax year 1997 returns, and IRS had frozen their refunds. Also as of May 16, 1998, however, IRS had released 49,000 of the refunds for taxpayers who had corresponded with IRS but whose conflicting claims for the child(ren) in question were not resolved. In discussing the release of these refunds, IRS officials told us that it could not process the amount of correspondence received because IRS (1) did not have enough time to adequately prepare for the start of this project (e.g., get staff assigned, procedures developed, and training done); and (2) had underestimated the volume of taxpayer contacts it would receive. Although IRS is continuing to investigate these cases, its effectiveness in protecting the revenue has been compromised because it is more difficult (and more costly) to recoup an erroneous refund once it has been released. IRS officials told us that meaningful data on the results of this effort would not be available until September 1998.", "Another way that IRS attempts to deal with qualifying child errors is to deny EIC claims when the taxpayer has failed to provide valid SSNs for the listed children. This effort, which is part of IRS\u2019 math error program, began before the compliance initiative and has continued as part of the initiative. As of June 4, 1998, IRS had sent about 535,000 EIC SSN-related math error notices to tax year 1997 filers; at the same point in 1997, IRS had sent about 774,000 such notices to tax year 1996 filers. IRS data for all of tax year 1996 show that it stopped approximately $876 million in erroneous refunds through the EIC SSN math error program. As of March 1998, IRS data show that it stopped about $414 million in tax year 1997 refunds. IRS expected to issue fewer SSN math error notices in 1998 because IRS, before the 1998 filing season, had sent notices to about 600,000 taxpayers with known SSN problems telling them what to do to correct the situation before filing their tax year 1997 returns.", "TRA97 included provisions giving IRS access to an SSA data file linking parent and child SSNs and a Federal Case Registry of Child Support Orders to be administered by HHS. The Federal Case Registry is to be a compilation of state child support and custody data. Access to both data files is intended to augment IRS\u2019 ability to detect EIC claims for nonqualifying children. Both, however, are still in development, and IRS plans to do a \u201cfeasibility analysis\u201d regarding their use. However, it will be several years before IRS will be able to use these data. Access, in terms of the specific data fields IRS can obtain, is still a major issue to be resolved among the three agencies. In addition to access issues, IRS\u2019 feasibility analysis is to include an assessment of data accuracy, currency, and completeness\u2014factors that will be especially important for the custodial data to be useful.", "Filing status errors. IRS\u2019 tax year 1994 study showed that a large proportion of qualifying child errors occurred in tandem with erroneous claims of head of household status. One of the components of the EIC compliance initiative involves increased staffing to expand a project aimed at a universe of about 345,000 head of household EIC claimants whose returns contain other indicators of potential qualifying child problems. This project was initiated in 1997 with audits of about 53,000 returns and expanded in 1998 to 313,000 returns. As of March 1998, about 50,700 of the 53,000 audits begun in 1997 had been closed; and about 43,400 of those closures (86 percent) resulted in tax changes totaling about $107 million. On the basis of those results, IRS expects that about 85 to 90 percent of the 1998 audits will result in a change to the EIC claim. According to IRS, results of these audits will not be available until late 1998 or early 1999. IRS officials estimated that about 25 percent of the 313,000 audits will be completed by September 30, 1998.", "Errors involving misreported income. Misreported income accounted for about 16 percent of the total EIC overclaims identified in IRS\u2019 tax year 1994 EIC compliance study. Many of IRS\u2019 traditional compliance activities are designed to identify returns with misreported income. For example, EIC returns are subject to IRS\u2019 document matching program, which compares W-2 wage reports and other income information reports (e.g., those filed on Form 1099) with income reported on tax returns. Because misreported income is of particular concern within that segment of the population that reports self-employment income on Schedule C, the EIC compliance initiative includes a study of noncompliance among EIC claimants who report self-employment income. IRS selected a sample of tax year 1997 returns, held the refunds, and plans to complete the audits by September 1998. IRS plans to issue a report of its findings in February 1999.", "Paid preparer noncompliance. The tax year 1994 study data showed that returns prepared by local or informal preparers had a higher overclaim rate (31 percent) than the returns prepared by formal preparers (20 percent). To address preparer noncompliance, TRA97 imposed due diligence requirements on paid preparers who complete EIC returns and fines for preparers who fail to comply with those requirements. In December 1997, IRS issued specific due diligence requirements and publicized these requirements in mailings to practitioners. IRS did not institute at a national level specific procedures to monitor compliance with the due diligence requirements during the 1998 filing season. However, individual field offices may have done some monitoring. At the Northern California District Office, for example, we were told that staff phoned about 560 preparers in the district to inform them of the due diligence requirements and inquired into conformity with those requirements as part of the district\u2019s normal monitoring visits to about 100 preparers. IRS informed us that national-level plans for the 1999 filing season include due diligence monitoring visits to EIC return preparers, but IRS has not decided on the procedures for these visits, the number of visits, or the extent to which they will target those preparers most likely to be noncompliant (i.e., local or informal preparers).", "As part of the EIC compliance initiative, IRS also planned to increase district office Criminal Investigation staffing in fiscal year 1998 to investigate potential EIC fraud cases, including cases involving return preparers. The increased staffing was to include a total of 40 special agents and 10 investigative aides. For fiscal year 1998 as of May 31, 1998, 31 paid preparer cases have been opened compared to 44 for all of fiscal year 1997.", "Fraud detection.

Targeting compliance efforts at qualifying child errors, however, presents IRS with a major challenge. IRS is not set up to systematically verify qualifying child eligibility. Doing so would basically require IRS to establish a process to verify eligibility before issuing a refund, similar to the processes used in EIC compliance audits.", "IRS\u2019 EIC compliance initiative includes a broad array of customer service, enforcement, and research activities aimed at reducing noncompliance. Some parts, like special audits of head of household claimants and preparer due diligence requirements, are targeted specifically at areas of noncompliance identified in the tax year 1994 study. Others, like expanded walk-in and telephone assistance, are more broadly based efforts aimed at improving taxpayers\u2019 understanding of EIC rules. Although it is too early to judge the initiative\u2019s effect on noncompliance, we did identify some opportunities for IRS to improve future implementation efforts. For example, IRS did not offer Saturday walk-in assistance until late in the filing season when millions of EIC claims had already been filed. Also, for the TRA97 provisions allowing IRS to deny future EIC claims to act as a deterrent, taxpayers must be aware of the circumstances under which these penalties will be applied.

IRS said that it did not believe the Schedule EIC should be revised to address these issues because the issues do not affect the majority of filers and providing the information on the schedule may confuse filers who have not had their EIC claim disallowed. According to IRS officials, taxpayers must go to the worksheet in the instructions to complete the schedule, and IRS\u2019 intent is to place the information so that persons using the worksheet will easily see it. Although inclusion of the information in the Schedule EIC instructions is an improvement, we continue to believe that something should also be added to the schedule. Because one of the purposes of this information is to alert potential EIC claimants to possible repercussions if they make erroneous claims, the information affects all filers. Also, although it is true that taxpayers who choose to compute their own EIC have to use the worksheet in the instructions, taxpayers who choose to have their returns prepared by someone else do not have to use the worksheet and thus would see only the Schedule EIC.

For example, IRS officials said that they hope to have, in October 1998, some preliminary findings from audits of taxpayers who had used duplicate qualifying child SSNs. IRS also noted that using interim data of this sort has limitations; it may not be adequate to measure revenue or provide a full understanding of taxpayer behavior.

We clarified our reference to income transfer programs where appropriate.", "In response to our statement in a draft of this report that IRS cannot address a significant root cause of noncompliance (IRS\u2019 difficulty verifying qualifying child eligibility), Treasury said that issues of verifying family relationships and living arrangements are not unique to the EIC but also affect taxpayers\u2019 eligibility for dependency exemptions, filing status, the child credit, and the child and dependent care tax credit. Also, both IRS and Treasury said that they were hopeful that access to new data (an HHS registry of child support orders and SSA data linking parent and child SSNs) will allow IRS to detect some qualifying child problems during return processing. We modified our statement and related discussions in the report to acknowledge IRS\u2019 ability to identify some noncompliance related to qualifying children. Our report also recognizes the provision in TRA97 giving access to the HHS and SSA databases. However, IRS told us that it will not be testing use of these databases until late 1999 or 2000 and that the amount of information that can be initially expected is small.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly release its contents earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days from the date of this letter.
