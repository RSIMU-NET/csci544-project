OMB reported greater progress than GAO determined, stating that 7 of the 10 action items were completed and that 3 were partially completed. While OMB officials acknowledge that there is more to do in each of the topic areas, they consider the key action items to be completed because the IT Reform Plan has served its purpose as a catalyst for a set of broader initiatives. They explained that work will continue on all of the initiatives even after OMB declares that the related action items are completed under the IT Reform Plan. We disagree with this approach. In prematurely declaring the action items to be completed, OMB risks losing momentum on the progress it has made to date.

In addition, the Federal CIO stated that despite agreeing with many of  the observations and recommendations in the draft report, OMB had  concerns with selected recommendations, observations, and the  scope of our review. The agency\u2019s comments and, where applicable,  our evaluation follow:", "OMB agreed with our recommendation to ensure that action items  called for in the IT Reform Plan are completed by the end of the IT  Reform Plan\u2019s 18-month deadline of June 2012 and stated that  OMB intends to complete the action items by the deadline.", "OMB agreed with our recommendation to provide clear time  frames for addressing the shortfalls associated with the IT Reform  Plan action items and stated that OMB will provide clear time  frames where applicable.", "OMB disagreed with our recommendation that the agency  accurately characterize the status of IT Reform Plan action items  in the upcoming progress report. The agency stated that it has  accurately characterized the completeness of the action items,  and therefore, the recommendation does not apply. As stated in  this report, we do not agree with OMB\u2019s characterization of four  action items: data center consolidation, cloud-first policy, best  practices collaboration portal, and redefining roles of agency CIOs  and the CIO Council. OMB considers these action items to be  completed. We do not.", "While OMB has made progress in each of these areas, we found  activities specified in the IT Reform Plan that have not yet been  completed. Specifically, in the area of data center consolidation,  we found that selected agency plans are still incomplete; in the  move to cloud computing, selected agency migration plans lack  key elements; in the area of the best practices portal, we found  that the portal lacks key features that would allow the information  to be accessible and useful to program managers; and in revising  CIO roles, we identified an agency that does not yet have the  envisioned authority over IT acquisitions. Further, in a recent  memorandum to agency CIOs, the Federal CIO acknowledged  that agency data center consolidation plans are incomplete and  required agencies to provide an annual update to the plans. In  addition, our assessment that the cloud migration plans are  incomplete was affirmed by the three agencies we reviewed  agreeing with our recommendation that they complete cloud  migration plans. Thus, we believe that our recommendation to  OMB to accurately characterize the status of IT Reform action  items is valid.", "OMB disagreed with our recommendation to establish outcome- oriented measures for each applicable action item in the IT  Reform Plan, noting that the agency measured the completeness  of the IT Reform actions and not the performance measures  associated with broader initiatives. OMB also suggested that we  erroneously gave the agency credit for performance measures  associated with broader initiatives on data center consolidation,  cloud computing, and investment review boards. We acknowledge  that some of the action items in the IT Reform Plan are subsets of  broader initiatives, and where applicable, we gave credit for  having measures associated with the broader initiatives. We  continue to believe that this approach is appropriate because the  action items and the broader initiatives are intrinsically intertwined.  For instance, it would have been unfair to state that there are no  measures associated with consolidating federal data centers when  such measures clearly exist.", "Moreover, the point remains that there are multiple action items in  the IT Reform Plan that are not aligned with broader initiatives and  for which there are no measures. Examples include the best  practices portal, development of a cadre of specialized IT  acquisition professionals, and establishing budget models that  align with modular development. Given that the purpose of the IT  Reform Plan is to achieve operational efficiencies and improve the  management of large-scale IT programs, we continue to assert  that it is appropriate to establish performance measures to monitor  the IT Reform Plan\u2019s results. According to the administration\u2019s  public website intended to provide a window on efforts to deliver a  more effective, smarter, and leaner government, performance  measurement is a necessary step in improving performance and  that it helps set priorities, tailor actions, inform on progress, and  diagnose problems. Until OMB establishes and tracks  measureable, outcome-oriented performance measures for each  of the action items in the IT Reform Plan, the agency will be  limited in its ability to evaluate progress that has been made and  whether or not the initiative is achieving its goals.", "OMB stated that the title of our draft report (Information  Technology Reform: Progress is Mixed; More Needs to Be Done  to Complete Actions and Measure Results) did not accurately  capture the substantial and overwhelmingly positive progress  made to date. Moreover, OMB stated that the responsible entities  have completed 81.5 percent of the required activities associated  with the 10 action items we reviewed. We acknowledge the  progress OMB and agencies have made on IT Reform Plan items  in this report and have modified the title of our report to reflect that  progress. However, our analysis of the percentage of completed  activities differs from OMB\u2019s calculations. The 10 action items we  reviewed include 31 distinct required activities (see table 1). We  found that the responsible entities completed 18 of these  activities\u2014a 58 percent completion rate.", "OMB also stated that our assessment should acknowledge that  OMB does not have the statutory authority to carry out certain  action items without congressional action. These action items  involved creating IT budget models to align with modular  development and consolidating commodity IT spending under the  agency CIOs. The Federal CIO stated that although OMB has  taken steps to engage with Congress, the agency cannot  unilaterally grant budget flexibilities or consolidate spending. While  it is true that completing these items depends upon congressional  action, according to the IT Reform Plan, it is the responsibility of  OMB and the federal agencies to work with Congress to propose  budget models to address these items.", "In general, OMB stated that it will continue to drive reform  throughout the federal government via the completion of the  remaining actions in the IT Reform Plan, as well as continuing to  work with agencies as they implement broader initiatives such as  data center consolidation and the transition to cloud computing.", "In supplementary comments provided via e-mail, the Federal CIO  also expressed concerns with the scope of our report, stating that  the intent of the IT Reform Plan was not to reform all federal IT,  but to establish some early wins to garner momentum for OMB\u2019s  broader initiatives. The Federal CIO also noted that OMB has  been consistent in publicizing the IT Reform Plan as an 18-month  plan with discrete goals designed to augment and accelerate  broader initiatives that existed before the IT Reform Plan was  launched and would continue after the plan has been completed.", "We believe that the scope of our review is appropriate. Since its  inception, the scope of our review has focused on the action items  and supporting activities noted in the IT Reform Plan. All of the  required activities listed in table 1 in the background section of this  report are listed in the IT Reform Plan. Moreover, we did not  evaluate activities that are outside of the IT Reform Plan, such as  OMB\u2019s efforts to establish a cost model for agencies to use in  estimating the costs and savings of data center consolidation.  Further, we agree that to completely reform IT, OMB and agencies  must undertake activities beyond the IT Reform Plan\u2019s 18-month  time frame. The activities within the IT Reform Plan are essential  building blocks that will carry on well beyond the IT Reform Plan\u2019s  end.", "In written comments, the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Director  of Departmental GAO-Office of Inspector General Liaison Office  concurred with our recommendations and identified steps that the  agency is undertaking to address them. The department\u2019s written  comments are provided in appendix III.", "In written comments, the Department of Justice\u2019s Assistant Attorney  General for Administration generally agreed with our  recommendations and identified steps that the agency has  undertaken to address them.

For each of the 10 action items in the IT Reform Plan, we  reviewed OMB\u2019s guidance and identified required activities. We compared  agency documentation to these requirements, and identified gaps and  missing elements. We rated each action item as \u201ccompleted\u201d if the  responsible agencies demonstrated that they completed the required  activities on or near the due date, and \u201cpartially completed\u201d if the  agencies demonstrated that they completed part of the required activities.  We interviewed agency officials to clarify our initial findings and to  determine why elements were incomplete or missing.", "To assess the plans for addressing any action items that are behind  schedule, we identified the agencies\u2019 plans for addressing the schedule  shortfalls and compared these to sound project planning practices  identified by organizations recognized for their experience in project  management and acquisition processes. We also interviewed relevant  agency officials regarding the reasons that their activities were behind  schedule and the impact of any shortfalls in their mitigation plans.", "To assess the extent to which sound measures are in place to evaluate  success, we determined whether performance measures were applicable  for each of the selected action items, and if so, how agencies were  tracking these measures. We compared these measures to best practices  in IT performance management identified by leading industry and  government organizations and assessed other options for measuring performance. In addition, we interviewed OMB and selected agency  officials regarding progress, plans, and measures. As we were completing  our audit work, OMB reported making progress in its efforts to consolidate  data centers, transition to a cloud computing environment, and strengthen  investment review boards, and provided data on specific measures within  each of these areas. We assessed the reliability of the data provided on  these measures by obtaining information from agency officials and from  the CIO Council regarding their efforts to ensure the reliability of the data.  While we identified limitations in the quality of the data that agencies  reported, we determined that this data was sufficiently reliable for the  purpose of presenting a general overview of progress in establishing  performance measures.", "We conducted our work at multiple agencies\u2019 headquarters in the  Washington, D.C., metropolitan area.
