First, a 90 percent decrease in Commission funding from its peak in fiscal year 2007 has raised concerns about whether the Commission can sustain its current approach as primarily a grant-making agency. Given its funding challenge, stakeholders GAO interviewed identified several options for how the Commission could approach fulfilling its statutory purpose in the future, such as shifting its focus to facilitating economic development projects or maintaining existing infrastructure rather than funding new projects. Even though the Commission has taken some steps to reassess its long-term approach, such as conducting statewide listening sessions on how best to assist rural Alaskans in the future, it has not finalized such an approach in a new multiyear strategic plan. Second, the Department of Justice's 2006 determination on the applicability of the principal federal conflict-of-interest law has resulted in a Commission that is, at times, deprived of the expertise of its six commissioners. Concerns about possible criminal prosecution for conflicts of interest have resulted in commissioners regularly recusing themselves from Commission decision-making activities. Based on various sources, GAO identified four options for restructuring the Commission so that it can better leverage the expertise of its commissioners in light of the 2006 determination. Each of the options would require changes to the Denali Commission Act, which established the Commission.", "The Commission has faced several challenges that have hindered its daily operations, including having periodic vacancies in the Federal Cochair position and not having an attorney. Having a vacancy in the Federal Cochair position has twice stymied the Commission because only the Federal Cochair is authorized to take certain critical actions, such as approving new grants. The Denali Commission Act does not provide for an acting Federal Cochair and does not allow the Federal Cochair to delegate authority to another person or to remain in office beyond the expiration of his or her 4-year term (holdover). In addition, even in the face of numerous complex legal questions, such as the applicability of the principal federal conflict-of-interest law, the Commission has never had a full-time attorney to provide it with legal advice and support on a routine and consistent basis. Without an attorney to help the Commission identify and navigate risks consistent with federal standards for internal control, the Commission is at increased risk for making legal mistakes.", "The Commission has some key procedures in place for administering its grants, but GAO found several shortcomings in how the Commission has managed its grants. Both the Commission's internal checklists and its online grants database meet established criteria for good grant management and oversight. However, the Commission does not have documented grant-making policies in place, leading to inconsistencies in how it awards and manages grants. For example, the Commission's awarding of grants has not always been open or competitive, and its monitoring of grant and project recipients has been inconsistent. Unless it issues grant management policies, the Commission may not be setting clear expectations for grantees, making it difficult to hold them accountable for fulfilling the terms of grant agreements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider amending the Denali Commission Act to, among other things, restructure the Commission to better leverage the commissioners' expertise, and create a delegation of authority or holdover provision for the Federal Cochair position.

The remainder of the population lives in smaller, often  isolated communities scattered throughout the state. Most of these  remote communities are not connected to the power grid and must  generate their own electricity and provide for their own heating locally.  In communities that burn diesel fuel to generate electricity and use  heating oil to heat their homes, these fuels must be stored in bulk fuel  tanks, and fuel delivery to some of these communities can only occur  during 3 or 4 months out of the year.

In late 2006, Justice determined that the six  commissioners were special government employees for purposes of  ethics laws and regulations and therefore subject to the principal federal  criminal conflict-of-interest law. Justice based its determination, in part,  on the requirement in the Denali Commission Act that the commissioners  receive pay for their work.

Specifically, they have had to consider  (1) whether commissioners have a conflict of interest (or the appearance  of a conflict of interest) before discussions or votes, and, (2) if they do,  whether they must recuse themselves or qualify for a waiver from the  conflict-of-interest law. The ethics official stated that he has tried to give  the commissioners ethics advice so that they do not violate the criminal  conflict-of-interest law. In 2007, the Federal Cochair granted waivers for  all six commissioners to participate in discussions of that year\u2019s work  plan, funding allocations, and program priorities, after consulting with  OGE. These waivers recognized, among other things, that the act  \u201cenvisions the commissioners as having a meaningful role in the direction  of the Commission\u201d and that the act directs individuals designated for  their expertise to use this expertise to drive the Commission\u2019s work.  Subsequently, OGE officials advised the Federal Cochair that granting  such waivers was not a viable option. Thereafter, waivers have been granted only for the State Cochair but not for other commissioners.", "As a result, commissioners have had to recuse themselves periodically  from discussions and votes, so the Commission often barely has had a  quorum to conduct business, according to the ethics official. Given such  restricted participation, commissioners no longer discuss or vote on the  relative merits of individual projects, voting instead on broadly worded  work plans, according to current and former commissioners and  Commission management. Some commissioners told us that they were  unsure about the extent of allowable participation, given the conflict-of- interest law and have been advised not to participate in discussions and  votes. Furthermore, several commissioners told us their fear of criminal  prosecution\u2014stemming in part from allegations by the former Inspector  General, prior to his resignation, that they violated the conflict-of-interest  law\u2014has led them to substantially limit their participation and, in some  instances, disengage from the Commission. One commissioner told us  that meaningfully participating in the Commission under its current  structure would mean doing so in possible violation of conflict-of-interest  laws and is not worth the risk. Consequently, the development of the  annual work plan is sometimes deprived of commissioner expertise on  the sustainability or viability of proposed projects, according to the ethics  official and several commissioners.", "The ethics official and OGE officials noted that the Commission\u2019s  structure lends itself to concerns about conflict of interests for  commissioners because the Denali Commission Act requires that officials  and directors from named organizations receiving grants serve as  commissioners and the principal conflict-of-interest law prohibits  commissioners from participating in matters that would have a direct and  predictable effect on their employer\u2019s financial interests. In contrast, the  Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional Authority are  not subject to the same concerns because the laws establishing them  exempt their commissioners and members, respectively, from the  principal federal conflict-of-interest law and instead subject them to an  alternative conflict-of-interest standard, which does not prohibit them from  participating personally and substantially in matters that the state\u2014their  employer\u2014has a financial interest.", "The restrictions on commissioner participation resulting from the conflict- of-interest law and the Denali Commission Act\u2019s silence on commissioner  roles have led to nearly a decade of frustration and concerns about the  commissioners\u2019 inability to contribute their expertise, according to several  current and former commissioners and staff. All commissioners  acknowledged that their role since the 2006 Justice determination has  decreased, with some characterizing their role as being a \u201crubberstamp\u201d  for the work plan developed by Commission staff, and others  characterizing it as being \u201cneutered\u201d or \u201cmuzzled\u201d by the application of the  conflict-of-interest law. According to the Federal Cochair, the  Commission\u2019s success depends on the shared expertise of involved  commissioners and precluding participation by experts in discussions  about which projects to fund puts the Commission at risk for making  faulty, but avoidable, funding decisions. For example, one commissioner  told us of an instance where her knowledge could have prevented a poor  Commission investment had she been able to see project-specific  information prior to approval of the work plan since the grant involved an  entity she knew to be delinquent in its taxes. Amendments to the Denali  Commission Act could enhance the ability of the commissioners to  provide their expertise with respect to the Commission's project funding  decisions.", "OGE officials told us that OGE has not been requested to issue a formal  advisory opinion on the application of the conflict-of-interest law to the  commissioners. According to OGE officials, the commissioners\u2019  participation will be restricted unless Congress amends the Denali  Commission Act to exempt commissioners from the principal conflict-of- interest law.", "OGE officials also told us that they found people to be more receptive to the opinions of  ethics officials when the advice is provided in writing. regulations. Moreover, in 2005 guidance, OGE encourages but does not  require written advice under specific circumstances, such as when the  advice applies the criminal principal conflict-of-interest law to specific  facts\u2014a circumstance common to advice given to Commissioners about  their participation in specific Commission matters.

As representatives on a FACA committee,  commissioners would be expected to represent a particular and  known bias of the particular group that they are designated and  appointed to represent. Under this option, the commissioners\u2019 open  and avowed interests, biases, and commitments are intended to  check and balance each other, resulting in a balanced and objective  recommendation.

To allow certain members of fishery  management councils with financial interests in fisheries or fishery- related activities\u2014including the financial interests of their employers\u2014 to participate in the councils, these members are exempt from the  principal federal conflict-of-interest law when they comply with the  financial disclosure and recusal requirements in the Magnuson- Stevens Act and its implementing regulations.", "Subject commissioners to alternative conflict-of-interest  standard but retain decision-making role. Under this option, the  commissioners would retain the ability to make decisions on which  projects to fund and would be subject to an alternative conflict-of- interest standard rather than the principal federal conflict-of-interest  law, which is how the Appalachian Regional Commission and Delta  Regional Authority operate. Specifically, the statutes authorizing these  other regional entities prohibit their nonfederal members from  participating personally and substantially in matters in which they or  their immediate family members\u2014but not the state, which is their  employer\u2014have a financial interest. Being subject to this alternative conflict-of-interest standard has allowed their nonfederal members to  vote on specific project funding with only a few conflicts of interest  arising, according to officials from the Appalachian Regional  Commission and Delta Regional Authority. For example, Appalachian  Regional Commission officials told us that commissioners do not have  to recuse themselves from discussing or voting on grants their state  agency applied for unless they are personally involved in the project,  and Delta Regional Authority officials told us that there is generally not  a conflict of interest that would prevent a member from discussing or  voting on projects involving their state agency. However, under this  option, the principal conflict-of-interest law and its implementing  regulations would not apply because the nonfederal members are not  subject to the principal federal conflict-of-interest law.", "Make commissioners a Board of Directors with fiduciary duty  and retain decision-making role. Under this option, the nonfederal  commissioners would become members of a Board of Directors with a  fiduciary duty\u2014a duty imposed by law on a person in a position of  trust to act for someone else\u2019s benefit and not to further one\u2019s  personal interests\u2014and not be subject to the principal federal conflict-  of-interest law. For example, the Board of Directors of the Legal  Services Corporation\u2014a federally funded, private nonprofit  corporation that makes grants to legal service providers who provide  free legal assistance to those who otherwise cannot afford it\u2014has a  fiduciary duty to use a high level of care to manage the corporation to  best promote the corporation\u2019s interest. Boards of Directors are  generally associated with corporations, but some governmental  entities also have Boards of Directors. The Farm Credit  Administration, an independent agency in the executive branch that,  among other things, regulates entities involved in the Farm Credit  System, and the National Credit Union Administration, also an  independent agency in the executive branch that regulates, charters,  and supervises credit unions, both have Boards of Directors.

Second, the Denali Commission Act\u2014unlike the statutes that established  the Appalachian Regional Commission and the Delta Regional  Authority\u2014does not provide for an alternate or acting Federal Cochair.

Once the Commission  implemented Dodd-Frank in May 2013\u2014thereby making the seven  commissioners responsible for the general supervision of the  Commission\u2019s Inspector General\u2014concerns arose about its application.  For example, commissioners who previously advocated for the removal of  the former Inspector General were now vested with the authority under  Dodd-Frank to remove an Inspector General by a two-thirds majority vote  even if the Federal Cochair is against removal. At the same time, the  Federal Cochair could no longer take actions to appoint, supervise, or  remove an Inspector General without explicit and prior approval of the  other commissioners. The Federal Cochair and attorney assisting the  Commission raised concerns about the potential for, or appearance of,  commissioners abusing this new power to fire a Commission\u2019s Inspector  General, while the former Inspector General, prior to his resignation,  raised concerns about his ability to carry out his duties with this  supervisory change.

In awarding federal grants, effective  oversight and internal control\u2014in the form of management directives,  administrative policies, or operating manuals\u2014is important in assuring the  proper and effective use of federal funds to achieve program goals,  according to the Domestic Working Group\u2019s 2005 Guide to Opportunities  for Improving Grant Accountability. The guide states that effective internal  control systems provide reasonable assurance that grants are awarded  properly, recipients are eligible, and federal funds are used as intended  and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The  Commission\u2019s Grants Management Guidelines, most recently updated in  January 2014, provide detailed information on the administrative steps  involved in awarding and managing grants, such as creating an  announcement for the award and issuing the award to officially obligate  the funds for the grant. However, the guidelines do not describe the  policies for how the Commission should award and manage its grants.  For example, the guidelines do not address issues that could be  addressed if the Commission documented its grant-making policies, such  as the number of projects acceptable under each grant, when it is  appropriate to use a competitive award process, and criteria for  identifying the appropriate requirements to include in the Commission\u2019s  grant agreements.", "Not having documented policies in place has hindered the Commission  from having a consistent approach to awarding grants. For example,  according to the Federal Cochair, the Commission used \u201cmonster  awards\u201d\u2014a single grant that funded dozens or even hundreds of  projects\u2014during its early years, which led to an \u201caccounting nightmare\u201d  because of the difficulty of tracking funds associated with such grants and  projects. The Federal Cochair explained that such problematic practices  arose because, in the absence of documented policies on the number of  projects acceptable under each grant, program managers have had  discretion in managing their program areas. In addition, the Commission  has not consistently used a competitive selection process to award  grants. For example, in awarding energy projects during the early years of  the Commission, the Federal Cochair told us that Commission officials  chose certain program partners based on previous professional contact  rather than through an open and competitive selection process. In  contrast, the Commission used a competitive process in selecting  grantees for building health clinics in rural Alaska, according to  Commission management. As the Domestic Working Group\u2019s 2005 Guide  to Opportunities for Improving Grant Accountability states, through  competition, agencies can increase assurance that grantees have the  systems and resources to efficiently and effectively use funds to meet  grant goals. A competitive process also promotes fairness and openness  in the selection of grantees.

Rather than issuing its own policies, the  Commission has often incorporated OMB guidance by reference in its  grant agreements even though the OMB guidance is intended for  agencies and not grant recipients. For example, the OMB guidance  indicates that agencies should require recipients to submit financial status  reports no more often than quarterly but no less often than annually.  Based on our sample, an estimated 33 percentprojects\u2019 grant agreements incorporated this OMB guidance by reference,   of Commission-funded  and 22 of the 33 such projects in our sample did not specify how often  grant recipients\u2019 financial status reports were due. As a result, it was  unclear how often the grantee in these 22 cases was required to report to  the Commission and difficult to determine whether these grantees met  their reporting requirement. While Commission officials told us that  program managers would have informally communicated to grant  recipients how frequently such reports were expected, not specifying  reporting requirements in written grant agreements could lead to  confusion regarding what is required of the grantee. According to the  Domestic Working Group\u2019s 2005 Guide to Opportunities for Improving  Grant Accountability, the terms, conditions, and provisions in the award  agreement, if well designed, can render all parties more accountable for  the award. Without documented policies to specify such requirements, the  Commission may not be setting clear expectations for grantees, making it  difficult to hold them accountable for fulfilling the terms of the grant  agreement.", "In addition, as a result of not having clear, documented policies related to  monitoring, the Commission has not been consistent in how it monitors  the requirements it has included in its grants. We have previously found  that once an agency has awarded grants, its monitoring of grantee  performance is important to help ensure that grantees are meeting  program and accountability requirements. Moreover, monitoring grantee  performance helps ensure that grant goals are reached, required  deliverables are completed, and potential problems can be addressed  early in the grant period.inconsistent in the following ways:   The Commission\u2019s monitoring has been", "The Commission allowed grant recipients to draw down funds without  submitting quarterly progress reports as required in the grants.  According to Commission officials, the Commission\u2019s policy is to not  provide funds to grantees unless they submit required reports.  However, in 19 of the 38 projects where this situation could be  identified, the Commission allowed grantees to draw down about  $5.6 million during periods of inadequate progress reporting.According to Commission program officials, they rarely have withheld  payment in cases where required reporting is missing. One program  official described withholding payments from grantees as the least  viable option, since many project recipients would not have the funds  to continue the project without the Commission\u2019s funding. The  Commission\u2019s Grants Management Guidelines include a description  of a process that eventually cuts off funding for awards when grantees  are delinquent on their progress reports, but it does not describe  criteria for a program official to apply in deciding whether to allow a  grantee who is delinquent to continue to draw down funds. Without  clear, documented policies that describe under what circumstances  Commission officials should withhold funds, this method of enforcing  grantee compliance is less likely to function.", "Not all required photographs were submitted in 51 of the 66 projects  in our sample where the Commission\u2019s grant required photographs.  For example, for one project to construct behavioral health space  within a primary care clinic, the grant required a minimum of three  dated photographs with each quarterly report to fully establish the  before, during, and after of the project; Commission records showed  that no photographs were submitted with the quarterly progress  reports. Photographs of ongoing projects are important because of the  inaccessibility of many rural Alaskan communities and the difficulty of  having Commission officials conduct visits to observe progress of the  project, particularly given decreased funding.", "While we found that the Commission specified requirements for  submission of other documentation and reports, we also found that they  did not ensure grant recipients submitted them.

Among the documentation for  these 13 projects, 4 contained only a letter that referred to past Labor,  Wage, and Residency reports being submitted, while the content of such  reports for an additional 3 projects did not meet the Commission\u2019s  requirements.

Most recently, the Commission was  unable to award new grants or submit its annual work plan during a nearly  4-month vacancy in 2014. Without such provisions being enacted into  law, the risk remains that the next vacancy in the Federal Cochair position  may again bring the Commission to a standstill.
