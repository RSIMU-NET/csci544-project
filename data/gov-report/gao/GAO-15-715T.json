Section 1115 of the Social Security Act provides  the Secretary of Health and Human Services with broad authority to  waive many traditional federal Medicaid requirements when approving  Medicaid demonstrations. The Secretary can use the authority to provide  states with flexibility for experimenting with delivering services outside  Medicaid\u2019s traditional rules. However, certain parameters apply. Under  law, Medicaid demonstrations must, as determined by the Secretary, be  likely to promote Medicaid objectives. By policy, demonstrations should  be budget neutral, that is, should not increase the federal government\u2019s  costs for Medicaid. One key aspect of the broad authority under section  1115 is that it allows the Secretary to approve new types of expenditures  under demonstrations. Expenditure authorities approved in these  demonstrations allow states to receive federal funds for costs that would  not otherwise be eligible for federal matching funds under Medicaid. In  other words, the Secretary may allow states to effectively turn what  otherwise would not be considered an allowed Medicaid cost into a  covered Medicaid cost, as part of their demonstrations. Expenditures for  demonstrations are a rapidly increasing proportion of Medicaid  expenditures. In fiscal year 2011, section 1115 demonstrations governed  about one-fifth of Medicaid expenditures, rising to nearly one-third of total  Medicaid expenditures in fiscal year 2014, an estimated $89 billion in  federal funds.", "Historically, many states sought section 1115 demonstrations to provide  health coverage to individuals who could not be covered under traditional  Medicaid rules.

For  that report, we examined new demonstrations, as well as extensions or  amendments to existing demonstrations, approved by HHS from June  2012 through mid-October 2013. We identified a total of 25 states that  received approvals during this time. We examined the approval  documents for each demonstration, including the special terms and  conditions, which set forth HHS\u2019s conditions and limitations for the  demonstration; interviewed HHS officials; and obtained additional  documentation from HHS to identify the criteria used for approval and  how the department documented that states\u2019 demonstrations met such  criteria.

The demonstrations provide a way for states to test and  evaluate new approaches for delivering Medicaid services. To obtain  approval, states submit applications for section 1115 demonstrations to  HHS for review. Upon approval, HHS issues an award letter to the state  and an approval specifying the Medicaid requirements that are being  waived, the expenditure authorities approved, and the special terms and  conditions detailing the requirements for the demonstration. HHS typically  approves a section 1115 demonstration for a 5-year period that can be  amended or extended.", "Under HHS policy in place since the early 1980s, section 1115  demonstrations should be budget neutral to the federal government. In  other words, the Secretary should not approve demonstrations that would  increase federal costs for the state\u2019s Medicaid program beyond what the  federal government would have spent without the demonstration. To have  a budget-neutral demonstration, generally a state must establish that its  planned changes to its Medicaid program\u2014including receiving federal  matching funds for otherwise unallowable costs\u2014will be offset by savings  or other available Medicaid funds. Once approved, each demonstration  operates under a negotiated budget neutrality agreement that places a  limit on federal Medicaid spending over the life of the demonstration,  typically 5 years. According to HHS\u2019s policy, demonstration spending  limits are based on states\u2019 projected costs of continuing their Medicaid  programs without a demonstration. The higher the projected costs without  a demonstration, the more federal funding states are eligible to receive for  the demonstration.

Prior to the demonstrations,  these programs were not coverable under Medicaid. The 5 states were  approved to spend up to $9.5 billion in Medicaid funds (federal and state)  for these programs during their current demonstration approval periods,  which ranged from 2.5 to 5 years.", "The state programs were operated or funded by a wide range of different  state agencies, such as state departments of mental health, public health,  corrections, youth services, developmental disabilities, aging, and state  educational institutions. Prior to being included in the demonstrations,  these programs could have been financed with state or non-Medicaid  federal funding sources, or a combination of these, such as state  appropriations or non-Medicaid federal grant funding. Under the  demonstrations, states must first allocate and spend state resources for  programs to receive federal Medicaid matching funds. The federal  matching funds received could replace some of the state\u2019s expenditures  for the programs, freeing up state funding for other purposes. For  example, states could use the freed-up state funding to invest in health  care quality improvement efforts or health reform initiatives or simply to  address shortfalls in states\u2019 budgets.", "The expenditure authorities for state programs supported a broad range  of state program costs that would not otherwise have been eligible for  federal Medicaid funding. Although many of the programs offered health- related services, such as prostate cancer treatment and newborn  immunizations, not all were necessarily income-based. In addition to  programs providing health-related services, other state programs  authorized to receive funding included those providing support services to  individuals and families, for example, to non-Medicaid-eligible individuals;  those providing access to private insurance coverage for targeted groups;  and those funding health care workforce training programs. Overall, state  programs that were approved for federal Medicaid funds appeared to be  wide ranging in nature.", "How funding for these state-operated programs would likely promote  Medicaid objectives was not always clear from HHS\u2019s approval  documents. We found that the documents did not consistently include  information indicating what, specifically, the approved expenditures for  state programs were for and, therefore, how they would likely promote  Medicaid objectives. State programs approved by HHS were generally  listed by program name in the special terms and conditions of each  state\u2019s approval, but often without any further detailed information.  Examples of state program names listed in the approval documents  included a healthy neighborhoods program, grants to councils on aging,  childhood lead poisoning primary prevention, and a state-funded  marketplace subsidies program. A full listing of the state programs funded  by expenditure authorities we reviewed is included in appendix I.", "Further, we found that several state programs approved for federal  Medicaid funds appeared, based on information in the approvals, to be  only tangentially related to improving health coverage for low-income  individuals and lacked documentation explaining how their approval was  likely to promote Medicaid objectives. For example, the purposes of some  programs approved included funding insurance for fishermen and their  families at a reduced rate; constructing supportive housing for the  homeless; and recruiting and retaining health care workers. For two of the  five states we reviewed, HHS\u2019s approvals included additional details  beyond the program names about the programs\u2014including program  descriptions and target populations\u2014in the special terms and conditions.  Such information can help explain how the programs may promote  Medicaid objectives; however, we found that even when such information  was included, HHS\u2019s basis for approving expenditure authorities for some  state programs was still not transparent. For example, one state received  approval to claim matching funds for spending on a state program that  issues licenses and approves certifications of hospitals and other  providers in the state. While the terms and conditions delineated the  program\u2019s mission and funding limits, it did not explicitly address how the  program related to Medicaid objectives. The approvals for the other three  states, accounting for nearly half of the more than 150 state programs in  our review, lacked information on how the state programs would promote  Medicaid objectives, such as how they would benefit low-income  populations.", "We also found that HHS\u2019s approvals varied in the extent to which they  provided assurances that Medicaid funding for state programs would not  duplicate any other potential sources of non-Medicaid federal funding. In  two of the five states we reviewed, the terms and conditions identified all  other federal and nonfederal funding sources for each state program and  included specific instructions on how states should \u201coffset\u201d other revenues  received by the state programs related to eligible expenditures. The  approval for a third state did not identify other funding sources received  by each program but included a general program integrity provision  requiring the state to have processes in place to ensure no duplication of  federal funding. In contrast, the approvals for two states did not identify  other federal and nonfederal funding sources for each program and  lacked language expressly prohibiting the states\u2019 use of funding for the  same purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS Approved Expenditure Authorities Allowing States to Establish Funding Pools, but Links to Medicaid Purposes Were Not Always Transparent", "paragraphs": ["Another major type of non-coverage-related expenditure authority that  HHS approved allowed states to make new kinds of supplemental  payments\u2014that is, payments in addition to base payments for covered  services\u2014to hospitals and other providers.

These  expenditure authorities allowed states to receive federal Medicaid funds  for supplemental payments made to providers for uncompensated care or  for delivery system or infrastructure improvements. In addition, some  states had funding pools approved for other varied purposes, such as  graduate medical education.", "Funding pools for hospital uncompensated care costs. In our April  2015 report, we found that HHS approved expenditure authorities in  six states to establish or maintain hospital uncompensated care  funding pools for a total of about $7.6 billion (federal and state) in  approved spending.", "Funding pools for incentive payments to hospitals. HHS also  approved new expenditure authorities in five states for funding pools  to make incentive payments to promote health care delivery system or  infrastructure improvements for nearly $18.8 billion (federal and state  share) in spending. These expenditure authorities were for payments to incentivize hospitals or their partners to make a variety of  improvements, such as lowering hospitals\u2019 rates of adverse events or  incidence of disease, improving care for patients with certain  conditions, and increasing delivery system capacity.", "As with approvals of expenditure authorities for state programs, we found  that HHS\u2019s approvals of expenditure authorities for funding pools also did  not consistently document how expenditures would likely promote  Medicaid objectives. The approvals of incentive payment funding pools  we reviewed established a structure for planning, reporting on, and  getting paid for general, system-wide improvements\u2014for example,  increasing primary care capacity or lowering admission rates for certain  diseases\u2014but most provided little or no detail on how the initiatives  related to Medicaid objectives, such as their potential impact on Medicaid  beneficiaries or low-income populations. Further, the criteria for selecting  providers eligible to participate in incentive pools were not apparent in  most of the approvals we reviewed. HHS\u2019s approvals typically listed  eligible providers but with no additional information about their role in  providing services to Medicaid populations. For example, none of the  terms and conditions for the five states\u2019 demonstrations that we reviewed  established a minimum threshold of Medicaid or low-income patient  volume as the basis for participation; however, three of the five states\u2019  approvals required that the payment allocations be weighted in part on  measures of Medicaid or low-income patient workload.", "We also found that the approvals for incentive payment funding pools  varied in the extent to which they provided assurances that Medicaid  funding for these initiatives would not duplicate other sources of federal  funding. The terms and conditions for only one of the five states required  the state to demonstrate that its funding pool was not duplicating any  other existing or future federal funding streams for the same purpose.  Two other states\u2019 terms and conditions required hospitals to demonstrate  that incentive projects did not duplicate other HHS initiatives. The extent  to which approvals for uncompensated care pools included protections  against potential duplication of federal funds was somewhat mixed. The  approvals placed some limits on the potential overlap between payments  to individual providers from the uncompensated care pool and Medicaid\u2019s  Disproportionate Share Hospital program, which provides allotments to  states for payments to hospitals that serve a disproportionate share of  low-income and Medicaid patients. We found that HHS consistently  included a requirement that when states calculate their Disproportionate  Share Hospital payment limits for individual hospitals, they include as  offsetting revenue any payments for inpatient or outpatient services the  hospitals may have received from the uncompensated care pool. Aside  from instructions about the Disproportionate Share Hospital program,  however, the approvals generally did not explicitly prohibit other  potentially duplicative sources of funding, such as grants awarded under  other federal programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HHS\u2019s Recent Approvals Highlight the Need for Specific Criteria and Clear Documentation to Show How Expenditure Authorities Further Medicaid Objectives", "paragraphs": ["While section 1115 of the Social Security Act provides HHS with broad  authority in approving expenditure authorities for demonstrations that, in  the Secretary\u2019s judgment, are likely to promote Medicaid objectives, as  we reported in April 2015, according to HHS officials, the agency has not  issued explicit criteria explaining how it assesses whether demonstration  expenditures meet this broad statutory requirement. HHS officials also  told us that for a demonstration to be approved, its goals and purposes  must provide an important benefit to the Medicaid program, but they did  not provide more explicit criteria for determining whether approved  demonstration expenditures would provide an important benefit or  promote Medicaid objectives. HHS officials also said that it is not in the  agency\u2019s interest to issue guidelines that might limit its flexibility in  determining which demonstrations promote Medicaid objectives.", "Given the breadth of the Secretary\u2019s authority under section 1115\u2014the  exercise of which may result in billions of dollars of federal expenditures  for costs not otherwise allowed under Medicaid, we recommended in April  2015 that HHS issue criteria for assessing whether section 1115  expenditure authorities are likely to promote Medicaid objectives. HHS  partially concurred with this recommendation, stating that all section 1115  demonstrations are reviewed against \u201cgeneral criteria\u201d to determine  whether Medicaid objectives are met, including whether the  demonstration will (1) increase and strengthen coverage of low-income  individuals; (2) increase access to, stabilize, and strengthen providers  and provider networks available to serve Medicaid and low-income  populations; (3) improve health outcomes for Medicaid and other low- income populations; and (4) increase the efficiency and quality of care for  Medicaid and other low-income populations through initiatives to  transform service delivery networks. HHS was silent, however, as to  whether it planned to issue written guidance on these general criteria, and  we maintain that these general criteria are not sufficiently specific to allow  a clear understanding of what HHS considers in reviewing whether  expenditure authorities are likely to promote Medicaid objectives.

In  using the broad authority provided under section 1115, the Secretary has  responsibility for the prudent use of federal Medicaid resources, including  ensuring that demonstration expenditures promote Medicaid objectives  and do not increase overall federal Medicaid costs. Our work has shown,  however, that it has not always been clear how approved demonstration  spending relates to Medicaid objectives. For example, several state  programs that were approved for Medicaid spending that we reviewed  appeared, based on information in the approvals, to be only tangentially  related to improving health coverage for low-income individuals. HHS\u2019s  approved expenditure authorities can set new precedents for other states  to follow and raise potential for overlap with other funding streams.  Similarly, we have had longstanding concerns, dating back decades, that  HHS\u2019s policy and process for approving total spending limits under  demonstrations have not always ensured that spending under  demonstrations will not increase federal Medicaid costs. As section 1115  demonstrations have become a significant and growing proportion of  Medicaid expenditures, ensuring that demonstration expenditures are  linked to Medicaid purposes and are budget neutral is even more critical  to ensuring the long-term sustainability of the program, upon which tens  of millions of low-income beneficiaries depend to cover their medical  costs. Without clear criteria, policies, appropriate methods for developing  spending limits, and improved documentation of the bases for decisions,  HHS\u2019s demonstration approvals affecting tens of billions in federal  spending will continue to lack transparency and to raise concerns about  the fiscal stewardship of the program.", "Chairman Pitts, Ranking Member Green, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
