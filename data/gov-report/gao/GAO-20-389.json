We assessed those plans using  GAO\u2019s acquisition leading practices to determine how Air Force plans  address key aspects of a business case to support that it has adequately  assessed the risks and costs of the ABMS effort. These include  documenting firm requirements, a plan to attain mature technologies, a  cost estimate, and an affordability analysis. In addition, we interviewed  officials to discuss aspects of the ABMS planning process that have been completed and what additional planning will be done. These offices  include the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation, Air Force  Acquisition, Air Force Headquarters Plans and Requirements, Office of  the Chief Architect of the Air Force, Chief Architect Integration Office, Air  Combat Command, and Air Force Program Executive Officer (PEO) for  Digital, and Air Force PEO for Command, Control, Communications,  Intelligence, and Networks.", "To assess the extent to which the Air Force has defined management and  decision-making authorities for ABMS efforts, we reviewed Air Force  documents to determine how the Air Force established the management  structure for ABMS.

These offices include Air Force  Acquisition, Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability (AFWIC), Office  of the Chief Architect of the Air Force, Chief Architect Integration Office,  and Air Force PEOs. We assessed the ABMS management structure  against principles GAO has identified to achieve management objectives,  which internal controls refer to as the control environment.

These capabilities will  eventually allow U.S. forces from all of the military services, as well as  allies, to conduct military operations across all warfighting domains.  Command and control is the collection and sharing of information to  enable military commanders to make timely, strategic decisions; take  tactical actions to meet mission goals; and counter threats to U.S. assets.  Figure 1 shows the concept of DOD operations within a joint all-domain  environment.", "When the Air Force began planning for ABMS in 2017, officials stated the  intent was to replace and modernize the capabilities of the Airborne  Warning and Control System (AWACS), which provides the warfighter  with the capability to detect, identify, and track airborne threats, among  other capabilities. According to officials, the Air Force currently plans to  operate AWACS aircraft through 2035. In July 2018, the DOD Joint  Requirements Oversight Council approved an ABMS Initial Capabilities  Document that describes which capabilities would need to be developed  and which associated gaps in current capabilities the Air Force would  need to address.", "According to Air Force officials, after the Initial Capabilities Document was  approved, the Air Force determined that its planned approach to ABMS  was no longer compatible with the most recent National Defense  Strategy, released in January 2018. The 2018 National Defense Strategy  outlines DOD\u2019s strategy for maintaining the defense of the United States  based on new and reemerging threats from competitors, such as Russia  and China. It also defines expectations for how DOD and its military  departments should be prepared to engage those threats during future  conflicts:  forces would be expected to strike a diverse range of targets inside  adversarial air and missile defense networks;  forces would need capabilities to enhance close combat lethality; and", "DOD would prioritize investments that enabled ground, air, sea, and  space forces to deploy, operate, and survive in all domains while  under attack.", "Air Force officials stated that these expectations led the department to  reassess requirements for ABMS and assess new options for developing  more robust and survivable systems that could operate within contested  environments. For example, the Air Force officially canceled a  recapitalization program for the Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar  System (JSTARS)\u2014an aircraft that provides surveillance and information  on moving ground targets\u2014in December 2018. The cancellation was  linked to the 2018 National Defense Strategy, which calls for a more  survivable and networked solution, among other things. A June 2018 Air  Force report to Congress identified concerns regarding the survivability of  the JSTARS aircraft in a contested environment and stated that the Air  Force was instead planning for ABMS to eventually provide JSTARS\u2019s  capabilities. The Air Force determined that it could continue using some  of its JSTARS aircraft into the 2030s.", "Officials stated the Air Force subsequently changed the scope and intent  of ABMS to align with the 2018 National Defense Strategy and broader  requirements for JADC2. According to senior Air Force officials, they  concluded that, to align with the new defense strategy, ABMS needed to  do far more than replace AWACS and JSTARS. They also concluded that  no single platform, such as an aircraft, would be the right solution to  providing command and control capabilities across multiple domains. In  an April 2019 congressional testimony, the Air Force announced a new  vision for ABMS as a multidomain command and control family of  systems enabling operations in air, land, sea, space, and cyber domains.  In that testimony, Air Force leadership explained the need to move away  from a platform-centric approach (such as JSTARS) to a network-centric  approach, one that connects every sensor to every shooter. The Air  Force, however, did not formally document its decision to change the  scope of ABMS. In November 2019, according to Air Force officials,  ABMS was determined to be the Air Force solution for JADC2 in  response to a July 2019 Joint Requirements Oversight Council memo  outlining DOD requirements for command and control systems  requirements across all domains.", "In May 2019, we reported that Air Force leadership determined that it  would not designate ABMS as a major defense acquisition program  because it would be a family of systems. The Air Force also determined  that ABMS would be directed by a Chief Architect working across PEOs,  rather than a traditional acquisition program manager. According to Air  Force officials, the Chief Architect role will be instrumental in integrating  the various programs and technologies into an overall system and is the  first of its kind within the Air Force.", "Additionally, Air Force officials stated that they intend to use a flexible  acquisition approach to develop ABMS, one that is outside of traditional  pathways such as a major defense acquisition program or middle tier  acquisition. According to the Chief Architect, this approach will allow  ABMS to develop and rapidly field capabilities. Specifically, the Air Force  intends to break up technology development into many short-term efforts,  generally lasting 4 to 6 months each. The Chief Architect stated that the  goal of breaking up development into smaller increments is to increase  innovation by requiring multiple contractors\u2014including those that may not  usually engage with DOD\u2014to compete for contracts more frequently.  These short-term efforts will include prototyping and demonstrations to  prove that the capabilities work. Those that are proven will be delivered to  the warfighter. By using this approach, the Air Force intends to field  capabilities sequentially and more quickly than if all were developed and  delivered at one time as is typically done for traditional acquisitions.  Additionally, Air Force officials indicated that this approach will not lock  the Air Force into long-term development efforts with just one contractor  and will allow the Air Force to more easily move on from unsuccessful  development efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Air Force Has Not Established a Business Case for ABMS, Increasing Development Risks", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has not established a plan or business case for ABMS that  identifies its requirements, a plan to attain mature technologies when  needed, a cost estimate, and an affordability analysis. As a result of  recent ABMS management and scope changes, the Air Force remains  early in the planning process and has not yet determined how to meet the  capabilities or identify systems that will comprise ABMS. In December  2019, Air Force officials stated an overall plan for ABMS did not exist and  would be difficult for the Air Force to develop in the near term due to the  unclear scope of ABMS requirements. To date, the Air Force has not  identified a development schedule for ABMS, and it has not formally  documented requirements.", "As previously stated, ABMS will be managed as a family of systems and  not as a traditional acquisition program typically governed by DOD  Instruction 5000.02, nor as a middle tier acquisition. As a result, Air Force  officials initially told us that they did not intend to develop most of the  typical acquisition documentation, such as a cost estimate, that is  generally required of major defense acquisition programs before entering  the development phase. In March 2020, after we sent a copy of this report  to DOD for comment, the Air Force provided us a draft tailored acquisition  plan for ABMS in lieu of an acquisition strategy. Based on our initial  review, this document includes some elements of a traditional acquisition  strategy, such as contract and test strategies. However, this tailored  acquisition plan does not include key information such as the overall  planned capabilities and estimated cost and schedule for ABMS. We will  continue to monitor the Air Force\u2019s planning efforts as the program  progresses. The Air Force also began preparing an analysis of  alternatives in January 2019 to assess options for delivering capabilities  such as surveilling moving targets and battle management command and  control. The Air Force expects to complete the analysis in 2020, but Air  Force officials expect it will inform only some aspects of ABMS planning.  The Air Force has not defined what additional planning documentation it  will develop to help it establish a business case for ABMS. For example,  major defense acquisition programs are generally required to develop  acquisition planning documents, such as a cost estimate.", "We have previously reported on the importance of establishing a solid,  executable business case before committing resources to a new  development effort. A business case demonstrates that (1) the  warfighter\u2019s needs are valid and that they can best be met with the  chosen concept and (2) the chosen concept can be developed and  produced within existing resources. In addition to an acquisition strategy,  other basic elements of a sound acquisition business case include firm  requirements, a plan for attaining mature technologies, and a reliable cost  estimate and affordability analysis, further described below.  1.  Firm requirements are the requisite technological, software,  engineering, and production capabilities needed by the user.  Acquisition leading practices state that requirements should be clearly  defined, affordable, and informed. Deciding how best to address  requirements involves a process of assessing trade-offs before  making decisions. Unstable or ill-defined requirements can lead to  cost, schedule, and performance shortfalls.  2.  A plan to attain mature technologies when needed is critical in  establishing that technologies can work as intended before integration  into a weapon system. The principle is not to avoid technical risk but  rather address risk early and resolve it ahead of the start of product  development. Identifying technologies and defining a plan to ensure  mature technologies can be attained when needed help guide  development activities and enable organizations to track development  and inform decisions on next steps.  3.  A reliable cost estimate and affordability analysis are critical to the  successful acquisition of weapon systems. GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating  and Assessment Guide states that a reliable cost estimate is  comprehensive, well-documented, accurate, and credible. Leading  practices have shown that realistic cost estimates allow program  management to obtain the knowledge needed to make investment  decisions and match requirements with resources. A cost estimate is  the basis of an affordability analysis, which validates whether a  program\u2019s budget is adequate for the planned acquisition strategy.", "The process of developing and documenting a business case builds  knowledge needed to match customer needs with available resources,  including technologies, timing, and funding. The fact that the Air Force  does not plan to establish such a business case for ABMS increases the  risk of cost and schedule overruns and may impact Congress\u2019s ability to  exercise its oversight responsibilities. The status of key elements for the  ABMS business case follows:  Status of requirements. The Air Force has not established well-defined,  firm requirements for ABMS, but Congress required that the Air Force  start defining requirements for the networked data architecture necessary  for ABMS to provide multidomain command and control and battle  management capabilities by June 2020. The Air Force has not defined  the changes in ABMS\u2019s requirements, such as the need to provide  multidomain command and control capabilities in support of joint operations. As a result, the only existing documentation of ABMS\u2019s  requirements resides in the ABMS Initial Capabilities Document from  2018, which generally focuses on the capabilities needed to replace  AWACS. That document does not address the expanded JADC2  requirements and capabilities ABMS is expected to eventually fulfill. Air  Force officials stated that ABMS requirements and the family of systems,  or programs, that compose ABMS will be defined over time as they gain  more knowledge.", "Given the lack of specificity regarding ABMS, Congress has kept a close  eye on the effort and has implemented several reporting requirements.  Since 2018, the Air Force has been required to provide quarterly updates  to the defense committees on the status of ABMS development and  associated technologies. In addition, the National Defense Authorization  Act for Fiscal Year 2020 required the Air Force to provide ABMS-related  documentation that describes certain requirements, a development  schedule, and the current programs that will support ABMS, among other  things, by June 2020.", "While the Air Force has not established firm requirements for ABMS to  date, it has informally identified some broad requirements. For example,  the Air Force anticipates that ABMS will provide interoperability between  systems, present real-time information to military decision makers, and  fully utilize the range of sensor data and capabilities across DOD to  create a common battlespace operational picture. In addition, Air Force  officials stated that ABMS would be developed as a government-owned  open architecture family of systems, which would allow any system to be  integrated into ABMS.", "The Air Force has identified seven different development categories that it  plans to simultaneously address to meet its broad ABMS requirements.  According to the Air Force, the categories are not intended to be  comprehensive and may change as development progresses. These  development categories include:", "Apps  Although the Air Force has not defined these seven development  categories, it has identified 28 development areas that fit within the  categories. For example, one of these development areas, which falls  under the \u201csecure processing\u201d category, is called cloudONE. It is intended  to store and process data using a cloud infrastructure for multiple levels of  classified and unclassified data. These development areas will eventually  compose the architecture and technologies that make up ABMS. In  January 2020, the Air Force provided us with a draft version of high-level  descriptions of the 28 development areas; however, the document did not  fully define the requirements or capabilities for the development areas nor  identify which organizations would lead each effort. For example, the  cloudONE description does not indicate specific technical requirements  that must be met, such as amount of storage, the number of users, or  data transmission rate.", "Although ABMS requirements are not fully defined, the Air Force awarded  several short-term development contracts for ABMS. According to Air  Force officials, these efforts are intended to show that its nontraditional  development approach is feasible rather than to develop specific  capabilities that will be integrated into ABMS. For example, the Air Force  awarded several development contracts totaling approximately $8 million  for gatewayONE, one of the 28 development areas that is intended to  enable communication between platforms. As part of this effort, the Air  Force conducted a demonstration in a joint military exercise in December  2019. While the exercise demonstrated some data transfer capability, it  did not directly address the intent of gatewayONE to enable  communication between multiple platforms using government-owned  systems. According to Air Force officials, ongoing and future efforts will  allow the Air Force to better define ABMS requirements and determine  what existing and emerging technologies can fulfill those capabilities. The  Air Force has not determined what development efforts will follow these  early demonstration efforts, in part because it has not fully defined its  requirements.", "Status of plan to attain mature technologies when needed. The Air  Force has started development activities without first identifying what  technologies are needed for the 28 development areas for ABMS.  According to Air Force officials, they do not plan to identify all  technologies needed while pursuing development activities. Therefore,  the Air Force cannot assess whether technologies required for ABMS are  mature or determine the necessary steps to ensure those technologies  are mature when needed. Air Force officials stated that as ABMS  development progresses, they plan to select commercially available or  other mature technologies for integration. However, without first  identifying the technologies it needs, the Air Force cannot develop a plan,  or technology roadmap, with detailed actions to ensure those  technologies will be mature when needed. For example, the Air Force  plans for ABMS to assume the capabilities of AWACS and JSTARS  aircraft, which are set to retire in the 2030s. However, the Air Force has  not defined the technologies ABMS will need or established a roadmap to  ensure those technologies are mature before the retirement of legacy  aircraft. This increases the risk that the requisite technologies will not be  mature before the Air Force must integrate them into ABMS, which  increases the likelihood that those capabilities will not be developed when  needed.", "The Chief Architect and other Air Force senior leaders stated that the  ABMS development effort is an ambitious undertaking for the Air Force.  Our prior work has found that some DOD programs related to ABMS  development have posed challenges in the past, in part because  technologies were not sufficiently mature when needed, as shown in table  1.", "Additionally, the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation  assessed previous DOD programs that were similar to ABMS  development and noted that the scope of ABMS will be larger than any of  those individual programs. Officials from that office concluded that ABMS  is a high-risk effort and the Air Force has not provided sufficient  programmatic detail. As a result, they could not conclude that the Air  Force would be able to overcome the cost, schedule, and performance  challenges of these past programs. Air Force officials stated that the Air  Force\u2019s approach to ABMS development will avoid these past challenges  because only mature technologies will be integrated into ABMS and the  Air Force is expected to frequently evaluate development progress.  However, since the Air Force has not identified what the technology  needs for ABMS are, it cannot yet determine if those technologies are  mature or will be mature when needed. We have previously found that  starting development without first identifying and assessing the maturity of  technologies increases the likelihood that those technologies are not  mature when needed, which often results in cost overruns and schedule  delays.", "Status of cost estimate and affordability. The Air Force has not  developed a cost estimate for ABMS or an affordability analysis.  According to the GAO Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide, even in  cases where limited information is available, cost estimates should still be  developed to inform budget requests. To date, the Air Force has  requested nearly $500 million for ABMS efforts through fiscal year 2021.  The Air Force, however, currently has no plans to develop a life-cycle  cost estimate, which would provide a comprehensive account of ABMS  costs, or an independent cost estimate, which would confirm the  credibility of estimated costs.", "Officials stated that the Air Force has not developed a cost estimate  because the capabilities, technologies, and systems that will compose  ABMS are still to be determined and will change over time. Officials  stated they intend to develop cost estimates for each of the 28  development areas in the future but did not identify a timeline. The GAO  Cost Estimating and Assessment Guide acknowledges that cost  estimating is more difficult when requirements\u2014and the technologies and  capabilities to meet them\u2014are changing and the final product design is  not known while the system is being built. In these cases, leading  practices call for developing cost estimates that should be updated more  frequently to reflect changes in requirements. Without a realistic and  current cost estimate for ABMS efforts, the Air Force will be unable to  effectively allocate resources and conduct informed long-range  investment planning.", "The Air Force has also not determined if it can afford ABMS. Affordability  is the degree to which the funding requirements for an acquisition effort fit  within the service\u2019s overall portfolio plan. Whether an acquisition effort is  affordable depends a great deal on the quality of its cost estimate and  other planned outlays. To conduct an affordability analysis, the budget  requirements for the entire portfolio are identified for future years. This  can help determine whether the funding needs are relatively stable or if  the portfolio will require a funding increase in the future. The GAO Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide states that, as part of the cost  estimating process, management should review and approve an  affordability analysis to identify any funding shortfalls. Air Force officials  stated that the Air Force does not plan to conduct a comprehensive  affordability analysis for ABMS because it is managing it as a family of  systems. They stated that any costs to the Air Force will be determined in  the future by the various organizations that manage the systems that will  eventually support ABMS. However, without an affordability analysis, the  Air Force will be unable to determine whether it can commit sufficient  resources for ABMS in future years."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Air Force Has Established an ABMS Management Structure, but Decision-Making Authorities Are Unclear", "paragraphs": ["While the Air Force has taken some steps to establish an ABMS  management structure, the authorities of Air Force offices to plan and  execute ABMS efforts are unclear.

However, the  guidance did not address whether the Chief Architect has authority to  direct the execution of efforts initiated and originally funded by the PEOs,  which may support ABMS. Specifically, there is no documentation to  clarify whether the Chief Architect would have the authority to realign  PEO priorities or funding for ABMS projects. For example, the PEO for  Space is currently executing a data integration project, which aligns with  the cloudONE development area. Although some ABMS funds have been  obligated for this project, there is no documentation to support that the  Chief Architect will be able to direct the PEO to change the project  objectives or timeline to align with ABMS requirements once they are  defined.", "Air Force Warfighting Integration Capability (AFWIC). In October  2017, the Air Force established AFWIC. According to Air Force officials,  AFWIC will ensure forces are operationally ready to perform JADC2  missions using ABMS technologies.

An October 2018 memorandum directed  the Chief Architect to coordinate with AFWIC regarding the development  of ABMS. Other documentation on ABMS execution indicates that AFWIC  will also coordinate with major commands on Air Force doctrine and  operations in support of ABMS. However, the documentation did not  further define this coordination or indicate whether AFWIC would have  any authority in directing ABMS activities.", "Chief Architect Integration Office.

Air Force officials stated that this office is  in the process of being staffed and the roles and responsibilities still need  to be formalized. However, as currently envisioned, this office would lead  technology development risk reduction efforts by working with the PEOs  and other organizations, such as federally funded research and  development centers, to conduct ABMS demonstrations and prototypes.  Air Force officials told us the Chief Architect Integration Office is expected  to resolve issues across Air Force organizations, such as sharing of  resources and personnel. An Air Force Life Cycle Management Center- led task force is currently developing an overall strategy for the office, to  include resource and organizational requirements. Air Force officials  stated that a proposed strategy will be completed in March 2020.

According to officials, details on these  authorities have not been developed or communicated to the offices  supporting ABMS and the Air Force has not established a timeline for  doing so. The Air Force expects that multiple organizations within the Air  Force will be responsible for executing ABMS development efforts.  Internal controls, which provides standards for effective management of  programs, states that organizational structure and authority is necessary  to plan, execute, and assess progress.

Developing these key elements of a business case helps to build a solid  foundation for any successful technology and product development effort,  even one using a nontraditional acquisition approach. Congress has  already required the Air Force to define and report on certain ABMS  requirements, among other aspects of ABMS planning, by June 2020.  However, the Air Force does not intend to develop the other elements of  a business case, even though it is requesting over $300 million for ABMS  development activities in fiscal year 2021. Given the criticality of the battle  management command and control mission and the planned retirement  of legacy programs, the lack of an ABMS business case introduces  uncertainty regarding whether the needed capabilities will be developed  within required time frames. For example, without a plan to mature  technologies needed to field ABMS capabilities, the Air Force cannot be  certain those technologies will be ready when needed.", "While it may be difficult for the Air Force to formulate a complete ABMS  business case at this time, due to the recent changes in ABMS\u2019s scope,  the Air Force is not precluded from beginning the process of defining and  formalizing a business case. As ABMS continues to evolve, so too can  the Air Force\u2019s business case. For example, the Air Force does not yet  know the total life cycle costs of ABMS, but it could provide Congress with  a cost estimate based on its knowledge today and update the cost  estimate over time. This would allow the Air Force to assess whether  ABMS is affordable.
