These satellites obtain environmental data that are processed to provide graphical weather images and specialized weather products, and that are the predominant input to numerical weather prediction models\u2014all used by weather forecasters, the military, and the public.

Today, there are two operational POES satellites and two operational DMSP satellites that are positioned so that they can observe the earth in early morning, morning, and afternoon polar orbits. Together, they ensure that for any region of the earth, the data are generally no more than 6 hours old. Figure 1 illustrates the current operational polar satellite configuration. Besides the four operational satellites, there are five older satellites in orbit that still collect some data and are available to provide some limited backup to the operational satellites should they degrade or fail. In the future, both NOAA and DOD plan to continue to launch additional POES and DMSP satellites every few years, with final launches scheduled for 2008 and 2009, respectively.", "Each of the polar satellites carries a suite of sensors designed to detect environmental data either reflected or emitted from the earth, the atmosphere, and space. The satellites store these data and then transmit the data to NOAA and Air Force ground stations when the satellites pass overhead.

Each of the four processing centers is also responsible for distributing the data to its respective users. For the DOD centers, the users include regional meteorology and oceanography centers as well as meteorology and oceanography staff on military bases. NESDIS forwards the data to the National Weather Service for distribution and use by forecasters. The processing centers also use the Internet to distribute data to the general public. NESDIS is responsible for the long-term archiving of data and derived products from POES and DMSP.", "In addition to the infrastructure supporting satellite data processing noted above, properly equipped field terminals that are within a direct line of sight of the satellites can receive real-time data directly from the polar- orbiting satellites.

When first received, satellite data are considered raw data. To make them usable, the processing centers format the data so that they are time-sequenced and include earth location and calibration information. After formatting, these data are called raw data records. The centers further process these raw data records into channel-specific data sets, called sensor data records and temperature data records. These data records are then used to derive weather products called environmental data records (EDR). EDRs range from atmospheric products detailing cloud coverage, temperature, humidity, and ozone distribution; to land surface products showing snow cover, vegetation, and land use; to ocean products depicting sea surface temperatures, sea ice, and wave height; to characterizations of the space environment. Combinations of these data records (raw, sensor, temperature, and environmental data records) are also used to derive more sophisticated products, including outputs from numerical weather models and assessments of climate trends.

Also, weather data and products are used by climatologists and meteorologists to monitor the environment. Within the military, these data and products allow military planners and tactical users to focus on anticipating and exploiting atmospheric and space environmental conditions. For example, Air Force Weather Agency officials told us that accurate wind and temperature forecasts are critical to any decision to launch an aircraft that will need mid-flight refueling. In addition to these operational uses of satellite data, there is also a substantial need for polar satellite data for research.

As a result of this assessment, the program office determined that three elements had high risk components: the interface data processing segment, the space segment, and the overall system integration segment. Specifically, the interface data processing segment and overall system integration were assessed as high risk in all three areas (technical, cost, and schedule), whereas the space segment was assessed to be high risk in the technical and cost areas, and moderate risk in the schedule area. The launch segment and the command, control, and communications segment were determined to present low or moderate risks. The program office expects to reduce its high risk components to low and moderate risks by the time the development and production contract is awarded, and to have all risk levels reduced to low before the first launch.

While individual initiatives may address one or more identified risks, the program office anticipated that the combination of these nine projects would address the risk to overall system integration. The nine projects are as follows:   Deferred development: To reduce program risk, the program office deferred development of 21 EDR requirements either because the technology needed to implement the requirements did not exist or because the requirement was too costly. For example, the requirement for measuring ocean salinity was deferred until the technology needed to take these measurements has been demonstrated in space. If feasible, the program office plans to implement these requirements later as program enhancements.", "Early sensor development: Because environmental sensors have historically taken 8 years to develop, development of six of the eight sensors with more advanced technologies was initiated early. In the late 1990s, the program office awarded contracts for the development, analysis, simulation, and prototype fabrication of five of these sensors. In addition, NASA awarded a contract for the early development of one other sensor. Responsibility for delivering these sensors will be transferred from the program office and NASA to the winning development and production contractor. According to program office officials, these sensors should be delivered at least 2 years before the earliest expected NPOESS launch because of these early development efforts.", "Building on existing sensor technologies: In order to minimize risks, the program office used existing sensor technologies as a starting point from which to build new sensors and also plans to use some existing sensors on NPOESS. For example, the new cross-track infrared sounder sensor grew from technology used on the POES high-resolution infrared sounder and on the atmospheric infrared sounder carried on NASA\u2019s Earth Observing System/Aqua satellite. Also, NPOESS\u2019 data collection system is based on the data collection system already flying on another satellite and, according to program officials, will likely be available largely \u201coff the shelf.\u201d Program office officials reported that building on existing sensors should enable them to obtain half of the NPOESS sensors and almost half of the required 55 EDRs while reducing the risk of integrating new technology into the program.", "Ground demonstrations: To reduce the risk to the data processing segment, the program office had both of the program definition and risk reduction contractors conduct four ground-based demonstrations of hardware and software components of the data processing system. Because of work done during the program definition and risk reduction contract phase, the program office expects the interface data processing segment to be relatively mature before contract award.", "Internal government studies: To reduce the risks in integrating the NPOESS space and interface data processing segments, over the past 5 years, the integrated program office has overseen risk reduction studies performed by over 30 major scientific organizations, including government laboratories, major universities, and institutes. These studies include observing system simulation experiments and data assimilation studies, which involve simulating a future sensor and then identifying ways to incorporate the new data into products and models. For example, the studies were used to assess the impact of advanced sounders similar to those on NPOESS and the impact of NPOESS-like data on forecasts and end user products.", "Aircraft flights: Since 1997, the integrated program office has used aircraft flights to demonstrate satellite sensors and to deliver early data to its users so that they can begin to work with the data. For example, in 2001, the NPOESS airborne sounder testbed project began using NASA aircraft to provide an environment in which instruments could be tested under conditions that simulate space.", "Operational algorithm teams: The integrated program office established five operational algorithm teams to serve as scientific advisory groups.

For example, National Weather Service officials told us that current supercomputers could not process the vast amount of satellite data NPOESS will generate within required timeframes to produce forecasts, because even today they are encountering computer capacity constraints. Specifically, the target usage rate for effectively processing modeling data is 50 percent of computing capacity. Officials told us that the average current usage rate is 70 percent of capacity, and usage often peaks well above this rate.

These models and products are heavily dependent on satellite data, but experts in the weather modeling community acknowledge that satellite data are not always used effectively because the science needed to understand and use the data is sometimes immature. For example, forecasters do not yet know how to use microwave data from areas covered in ice or under heavy precipitation in their weather prediction models. Experts reported that it often takes years of study and scientific advances to effectively assimilate new satellite data into weather models and to derive new weather products. While there is some debate as to how long it takes to develop the science to put new data in models, in 2000, the National Research Council reported that it generally takes 2 to 5 years of simulations and analyses before a satellite launch for data from new sensors to be effectively incorporated into weather models. They noted that if this work does not occur, there is a gap of several years during which data are collected but not used efficiently in models. Defense and civilian modeling officials reiterated the value of advance assimilation studies by citing an example in which such studies performed before a new sensor was launched allowed modelers to use the data only 10 months after launch.", "The processing centers acknowledge that much needs to be done for them to be able to incorporate NPOESS data into operational products. Officials at the processing centers reported that they should be able to use some EDRs after only minor changes to their data processing algorithms and models, because these products are expected to be comparable to current products. Other EDRs, however, involve new data and will require major scientific advances in order to be used. That is, the centers will not be able to use these data until they conduct new scientific investigations and determine how to best use the data in their derived products and models. In fact, the three centers that are the heaviest planned users of NPOESS EDRs reported that about 45 percent of the EDRs they plan to use would require major advances in science in order to be utilized. For example, NESDIS stated that it would take major science changes to be able to utilize all six of the key EDRs, including atmospheric vertical temperature profile, soil moisture, and sea surface winds.

Given that understanding, the processing centers and the integrated program office have various efforts under way and planned to address challenges in effectively using new NPOESS data. Key initiatives include the following:   Joint Center for Satellite Data Assimilation: In July 2001, NOAA and NASA formed a joint organization to accelerate the rate at which satellite data are put into operational use. While the center is currently focused on assimilating data from existing satellites, joint center scientists plan to undertake projects to accelerate the assimilation of future satellite data, including NPOESS data, into weather prediction models. The joint center received $750,000 in its fiscal year 2002 budget and requested $3.4 million for fiscal year 2003.

Since fiscal year 1995, the program office has reportedly spent more than $3 million on satellite data assimilation experiments and projects to develop techniques for processing satellite data. For example, the program office funded NOAA to develop methods to begin processing and assimilating sounding data from the advanced infrared sounder on a NASA satellite.

This new satellite system is expected to provide vast streams of data, far more than are currently handled by the four central processing centers. To prepare for these increased data volumes, the four data processing centers must address key data management challenges\u2014 including building up their respective infrastructures and working to be able to efficiently incorporate new data in their derived weather products and models. Because the NPOESS launch date is still several years in the future, the four processing centers and the integrated program office have time to continue to develop, define, and implement their plans to address key data management challenges.", "Each of the processing centers is planning activities to build its capacity to handle increased volumes of data, but more can be done to coordinate and define these plans\u2014including sharing information on what is needed in order for the centers to use particular weather products and developing a plan to address these scientific issues. Unless more is done to coordinate and define these plans, the centers could risk delays in using NPOESS data in operational weather products and forecasts.", "This concludes my statement.

We assessed the polar satellite infrastructure to understand the relationships among the satellites, ground control stations, and satellite data processing centers. We also reviewed documents and interviewed officials at the integrated program office and four processing centers to identify the processes for transforming raw satellite data into derived weather products and weather prediction models.", "To identify plans for the NPOESS program, we obtained and reviewed documents that describe the program\u2019s origin and purpose, and interviewed integrated program office officials to determine the program\u2019s background, status, and plans. We assessed the NPOESS acquisition strategy and program risk reduction efforts to understand how the program office plans to manage the acquisition and mitigate the risks to successful NPOESS implementation. We reviewed descriptions of each of the NPOESS sensors and assessed NPOESS program requirement documents to determine the types of products that NPOESS will produce and how these products will be used.", "To assess NPOESS data management challenges, we reviewed documents from the program office and the four processing centers and discussed challenges with DOD and NOAA officials. We assessed descriptions of each center\u2019s current and planned polar satellite infrastructure to identify plans for infrastructure growth. We also identified each processing centers\u2019 views on which NPOESS products will require infrastructure changes or scientific advancements in order to be used. We analyzed this information to determine whether the centers face challenges in their ability to process NPOESS data and their scientific capability to assimilate NPOESS data into their weather prediction models. We reviewed documents that describe NOAA, DOD, and integrated program office efforts to address the challenges that we identified, and we evaluated current and planned efforts to address those challenges. We interviewed program office and processing center officials to discuss these documents and their plans to address NPOESS data management challenges.", "We obtained comments from NOAA and DOD officials on the facts contained in this statement. These officials generally agreed with the facts as presented and provided some technical corrections, which we have incorporated.
