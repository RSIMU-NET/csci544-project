The Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) operates truck safety programs, including Share the Road Safely (STRS), which has a goal to improve driving behavior around large trucks. At congressional direction, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) assumed responsibility for funding STRS in 2004, but returned STRS to FMCSA in 2006. The current transportation authorization bill requested GAO to update its 2003 evaluation of STRS. This report (1) describes the STRS initiatives DOT has implemented since 2003 and their design, (2) reviews evaluations of STRS initiatives, and (3) assesses DOT's plans for the future of STRS. GAO interviewed DOT and state officials, and reviewed program plans and evaluations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["During 2004 and 2005, Share the Road Safely funding was used to implement one initiative, a pilot in Washington State that focused on aggressive driving behaviors near or by large trucks. Known as Ticketing Aggressive Cars and Trucks (TACT), it combined education, such as highway message signs, and high-visibility law enforcement to reduce aggressive driving. TACT received about $892,000 in federal and state funds. TACT was generally modeled on successful behavior modification programs, including Click It or Ticket (a program to encourage safety belt use), but was more complex to implement than past initiatives since many behaviors constitute aggressive driving and Washington State lacked a single aggressive driving law. In addition, NHTSA sought to demonstrate to FMCSA staff how to operate similar initiatives in the future. To this end, FMCSA sent a liaison to NHTSA as requested by Congress. Lastly, initiatives that were a part of STRS in 2003 were still pursued by FMCSA, but were not funded. DOT and Washington State officials conducted an evaluation of TACT that demonstrated that the initiative was successful and well-designed. The evaluation found that TACT significantly reduced the number and severity of unsafe driving acts near or by trucks. While the evaluation did not assess changes in crashes, improved driver behavior should logically lead to fewer crashes, injuries, and fatalities. GAO found that TACT's design of combining education with law enforcement better lent itself to reaching agency goals of fatality reduction than previous STRS initiatives that were purely educational. FMCSA plans to expand development of new TACT-like initiatives, but lacks resources and experience to do so. In addition, FMCSA plans to spend most of its 2006 STRS funds on educational initiatives, which lack information showing whether they improve driver behavior. In terms of TACT expansion, FMCSA is currently developing a TACT-like pilot in Pennsylvania and plans to roll out initiatives similar to TACT nationally by 2009. FMCSA, however, has few people dedicated to education and outreach and lacks NHTSA's experience with behavior modification initiatives. While FMCSA designated a liaison to learn about TACT-like initiatives, GAO continues to have concerns about FMCSA's limited experience with these initiatives. NHTSA has considerable experience with such initiatives, but its role in STRS is still evolving. Finally, FMCSA plans to spend the majority of its fiscal year 2006 STRS funds on initiatives that do not have evaluations showing their impacts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, over 42,000 people died on our nation\u2019s roads. About 12 percent  (5,190) of these fatalities occurred in collisions involving large commercial  trucks, in which many more occupants were killed in the other vehicles  than in the trucks. Furthermore, large-truck traffic has increased  significantly (33 percent) from 1994 through 2004. This trend seems likely  to continue as the Transportation Research Board estimates that truck  traffic will increase by 3.5 percent annually. However, according to the  Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) Large Truck Crash Causation  Study, passenger-vehicle drivers were responsible for the majority of these  large commercial truck crashes. The study found that specific passenger- vehicle driver behaviors, such as driving too fast for road conditions and  making illegal maneuvers, contributed significantly to crashes involving  large commercial trucks.", "Within DOT, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) is  responsible for improving the safety of commercial-vehicle operations,  which include interstate truck and motor coach (bus) companies, while the  National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has a mission to  reduce deaths, injuries, and economic losses resulting from motor vehicle  crashes. FMCSA has set a safety goal to reduce the rate of fatalities from an  estimated 2.81 per 100 million truck-miles traveled in 1996 to no more than  1.65 by the end of 2008. In 2004, the fatality rate for truck-related crashes  was 2.3 per 100 million truck-miles traveled. To work toward its 2008 goal,  FMCSA leads enforcement efforts such as working with and providing  grants to states to enforce Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations. In  addition, FMCSA operates several education and outreach programs. Share  the Road Safely (STRS) is one such program that aims to support FMCSA\u2019s  goal by educating and changing the driving behavior of both passenger- vehicle and truck drivers so that they may interact safely with one another  on the road. NHTSA sets and enforces safety standards for motor vehicles  and motor vehicle equipment and provides grants to states to improve  passenger-vehicle driver safety.", "In recent years, we raised concerns about FMCSA\u2019s education and outreach  efforts. In 2003, we reported that STRS lacked a clear program strategy and  included activities that were only tenuously linked to program goals. We  also reported that FMCSA had not recently evaluated the program\u2019s  effectiveness. Consequently, we recommended that DOT ensure that STRS  initiatives are directly linked to the program\u2019s goals, and that DOT establish  a systematic process for evaluating the program\u2019s effectiveness. We also  suggested that FMCSA apply strategies used by other parts of DOT, such as  NHTSA, to its evaluations of STRS. In fiscal year 2004, Congress  transferred funding for the program to NHTSA, an agency that sets and  enforces safety standards for motor vehicles and motor vehicle equipment  and provides grants to states to improve passenger-vehicle driver safety.  Additionally, the Conference Report accompanying the DOT appropriations  act for fiscal year 2004 indicates the conferees wanted NHTSA and FMCSA  to apply lessons learned from NHTSA\u2019s experience with high-visibility law  enforcement campaigns to STRS to educate drivers on how to drive safely  around large trucks. The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient  Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU)\u2014which  authorized the federal surface transportation programs for highways,  highway safety, and transit between 2005 and 2009\u2014annually provided $3  million to NHTSA and $1 million to FMCSA for administering education  and outreach activities associated with commercial-vehicle safety, such as  STRS. The Conference Report accompanying the DOT appropriations act  for fiscal year 2006, however, indicates that the conferees allocated the  entire $4 million for education and outreach activities associated with  commercial-vehicle safety to FMCSA, including $500,000 for STRS  initiatives.", "SAFETEA-LU also asked us to update our 2003 evaluation of STRS to  determine if the program has achieved reductions in the number and  severity of commercial motor vehicle crashes, including reductions in the  number of deaths and the severity of injuries sustained in these crashes. To  update our 2003 STRS report and assess the impact of the program on the  interaction between large commercial trucks and passenger vehicles, we  (1) describe what STRS initiatives DOT has implemented since 2003 and  assess whether its initiatives are reasonably designed; (2) review the  results of DOT evaluations of STRS initiatives and assess the evaluation  methods; and (3) assess DOT\u2019s plans for the future of STRS initiatives.", "To determine how STRS has changed since 2003 and whether the design of  its initiatives is reasonable, we interviewed DOT officials and reviewed  agency documents. Additionally, we interviewed FMCSA, NHTSA, and local  officials involved in the operation of the STRS pilot initiative in Washington  State and reviewed related program documents. We examined the design of  the Washington State pilot to determine how it compares with other  initiatives intended to modify driver behavior, and whether the pilot\u2019s  activities links to agency goals. We did not assess the design of other STRS  initiatives because they were not funded in 2004 and 2005, and we reported  on these initiatives in our 2003 report. To determine what the evaluation of  STRS pilot initiative showed, we reviewed evaluation plans and evaluation  results and spoke with DOT and state officials responsible for conducting  the evaluation. We also compared DOT\u2019s evaluation approach with  accepted evaluation methods. Although SAFETEA-LU asked us to  determine if STRS achieved reductions in the number of deaths and the  severity of injuries sustained in commercial-vehicle crashes, DOT\u2019s  evaluation did not assess these outcomes because the number of fatalities  and injuries on DOT\u2019s study corridors were too low to reliably measure any  appreciable change. Therefore, we did not discuss in this report STRS\u2019s  impact on specific numbers of fatalities and injuries. To assess DOT\u2019s  future plans for STRS, we interviewed program administrators at DOT and  reviewed provided budget and planning documents. We also compared the  planned initiatives (1) with high-visibility law enforcement campaign  models, shown to change behavior by prior research, to assess their  implementation and (2) with the initiatives described in our prior report to  see how they have evolved.

In 2004, DOT selected Washington State for the pilot initiative and  signed a cooperative agreement with the Washington Traffic Safety  Commission. The pilot, known as TACT, combined high-visibility law  enforcement waves with education and outreach activities in an effort to  reduce aggressive driving between passenger-vehicle and large-truck  drivers. TACT focused on four interstate highway corridors, each covering  a distance of approximately 25 miles. (See fig. 2.) Two intervention  corridors in the western part of the state received media messages and 2  weeks of increased, high-visibility law enforcement waves in July and  September, 2005, while two comparison corridors did not. During these  waves, law enforcement officers patrolled the intervention corridors in  marked and unmarked patrol cars, in state patrol aerial units when weather  permitted, and from the cabs of semitrucks to target unsafe driving around  large trucks.", "The TACT pilot initiative used paid radio advertising and earned media,  such as local news coverage, to inform the targeted audience of the  dangers of aggressive driving related to trucks and to announce that law  enforcement officers would issue tickets for such behavior. TACT\u2019s radio  advertisement was aired over 6,000 times during the course of the  enforcement waves, and eight local television stations dedicated coverage  to the pilot. Figure 3 shows an example of the earned media coverage.", "DOT officials said they selected Washington State to participate in this pilot  because of the state\u2019s experience with other related safety initiatives, its  accurate fatality and crash database, and its strong relationships with key  stakeholders. TACT built upon a previous STEP model campaign, Step Up  and R.I.D.E., which operated in Washington for several years. In the Step  Up and R.I.D.E. program, Washington partnered with the local trucking  industry to periodically place police officers in commercial vehicles to  identify and issue citations to drivers observed committing offenses. DOT  officials also stated that Washington has shown itself capable of  successfully implementing and evaluating a high-visibility law enforcement  campaign\u2014specifically its Click It or Ticket campaign, which in 2002  increased safety belt use from about 80 percent to 95 percent. Additionally,  DOT cited Washington as having good data on crashes and fatalities. In a  2005 report, we also recognized that Washington has very good cooperation  among state agencies involved in crash data collection and reporting, and a  strong relationship with its FMCSA division office. Finally, according to  DOT officials, a particular strength of Washington is that the Washington  Traffic Safety Commission, the lead organization in implementing the TACT  initiative, comprises multiple state agencies, including all of the agencies  that are participating in TACT, thus setting the stage for easy coordination  and cooperation among participating agencies.", "Federal, state, and local organizations participated in and contributed  about $892,000 for the planning and operation of TACT. A steering  committee led by the Washington Traffic Safety Commission planned and  administered the pilot project. Other partners on the steering committee  included the Washington DOT, the Washington State Patrol, the Association  of Sheriffs and Police Chiefs, and the Washington Trucking Association.  Officials on the steering committee believed having all of these groups  involved in developing the pilot was important to the successful  implementation of the pilot. The Washington Traffic Safety Commission  also contributed $118,000 to the pilot for project management and  communications. Local and state police made officers available for the  enforcement waves, and the Washington Trucking Association worked with  trucking companies to provide decoy trucks and drivers. NHTSA provided  considerable assistance in developing and implementing the initiative and  supplied the majority of TACT\u2019s funding, awarding $497,000 in fiscal year  2004 and an additional $68,000 for evaluation activities in fiscal year 2005.  Congress also provided NHTSA with an additional $99,000 for the TACT  initiative in fiscal year 2005. FMCSA did TACT\u2019s initial planning and  provided ongoing assistance, including reviewing plans.

These campaigns  combine education and outreach activities with high-visibility law  enforcement to bring about a change in driver behavior. Our 2003 report  stated that highway safety experts agree that attempts to modify behavior  are more effective when educational and enforcement efforts are used  together. However, the STRS initiatives we identified in our 2003 report  were purely educational. The report added that FMCSA could improve  STRS by drawing from NHTSA\u2019s considerable experience with high- visibility law enforcement campaigns like Click It or Ticket, which has been  widely considered effective in increasing the rate of safety belt use.  Furthermore, a NHTSA evaluation report found that 10 states that used the  Click It or Ticket model had significantly greater increases in safety belt  use compared with states that attempted to increase safety belt use  through other initiatives. TACT offered FMCSA an opportunity to learn  from NHTSA\u2019s experience with high-visibility law enforcement campaigns  and learn how to develop similar aggressive driving initiatives in other  states. To further ensure this transfer of knowledge as requested by  conferees in the Conference Report accompanying its 2005 appropriations  act, FMCSA hired and detailed a staff member to NHTSA to act as a  communications liaison for STRS. The liaison was involved in some facets  of TACT, including meeting with its steering committee and preparing  briefings on the pilot.

Specifically, TACT was modeled after  NHTSA\u2019s Click It or Ticket campaign. In modeling Click It or Ticket\u2019s  approach, officials in the TACT program collected data before and after its  enforcement waves to identify behavior changes; it had highly visible  enforcement on each day of its enforcement waves; and it had used both  paid and earned media to publicize its enforcement.", "TACT did deviate from the Click It or Ticket model in two ways. First, the  pilot did not use paid television advertising. Washington State officials  explained that this was because of the program\u2019s limited budget. While  evaluations of Click It or Ticket show that radio advertisements were  effective in reaching the motoring public, radio is not as effective a medium  as television. Second, the media for the TACT pilot described the  enforcement campaign as zero tolerance as prescribed by the Click It or  Ticket model, and enforcement was stepped up; however, law enforcement  officers participating in TACT issued warnings instead of citations in 28  percent of the traffic stops. NHTSA officials explained that law  enforcement officers always have discretion on whether to issue citations,  and what is more important is that the public perceive an increase in law  enforcement. Furthermore, they explained there is no research about the  most effective level of citation tickets. See appendix II for a detailed  comparison of TACT\u2019s implementation of the Click It or Ticket model.", "Although TACT is based on the high-visibility law enforcement campaign  model, it deals with more complex issues than previous initiatives. In the  case of Click It or Ticket, law enforcement is simply checking for safety  belt use. With TACT, there are a number of behaviors that may constitute  aggressive driving, including tailgating, speeding, and unsafe merging.  These multiple factors also made it more difficult to develop a primary  message for TACT to communicate to the public. TACT administrators, for  example, determined that they had to choose a primary behavioral theme\u2014 leaving more space around trucks\u2014to communicate to motorists, although  obeying the speed limit and staying out of a truck\u2019s blind spots also are  important and were secondary themes. See figure 4 for a depiction of  TACT\u2019s selected message. This message was posted on 16 highway signs in  the intervention corridors. Additionally, TACT was more difficult to  institute from a legal standpoint. Washington has a primary safety belt law,  meaning that officers can pull over drivers solely for not wearing their  safety belts. In the case of TACT, however, Washington has no single  aggressive driving law. Washington State officials told us they had to ensure  that courts would be willing to enforce the tickets because police officers  issued citations for violations under a number of laws."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Previous STRS Initiatives Were Not Funded under NHTSA", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal years 2004 and 2005, STRS did not fund initiatives that were a part  of the program in 2003.

For instance,  the No-Zone campaign\u2014a major initiative of STRS\u2014was not funded during  this period. FMCSA did, however, keep No-Zone information available on  its Web site and responded to requests for educational material. For  example, according to FMCSA officials, during this period they distributed  over 200,000 copies of the No-Zone brochure through venues such as  conferences and industry events. Also prior to TACT, FMCSA developed a  curriculum for teaching students about sharing the road with trucks.

(See app. III for a more detailed explanation of how  this video footage was analyzed.) This analysis found that the rate of unsafe  driving acts per observation hour was nearly cut in half, from 5.80 to 3.05,  for the intervention corridors, as compared with a slight decrease, from  4.03 to 3.92, for the comparison corridor. When controlled for the  preenforcement rates, these data represent a 46 percent decrease in unsafe  driving in the intervention corridors.

TACT evaluators demonstrated this by using a survey to  measure the extent to which the initiative changed the awareness of the  target audience. In each of the four communities selected for the project,  TACT administrators distributed surveys to the public at driver licensing  offices both before and after the enforcement waves. For example, the  percentage of respondents on the intervention corridors that reported  general exposure to media about giving trucks more space nearly  quadrupled, from about 18 to 67 percent. These data contrast with data for  the comparison corridors, where the percentage only increased from about  17 to 20 percent.

Additionally, the  evaluation found significant increases in the percentages of respondents on  the intervention corridors that specifically reported hearing the radio  message and seeing the TACT road sign, television, and newspaper  messages. Furthermore, surveys of drivers also showed a significant  increase in drivers reporting that they leave more space when passing  trucks (the intended behavioral change theme of the project) from about 16  to 24 percent for the intervention corridors as compared with a slight  increase from about 15 to 16 percent for the comparison corridors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Evaluation of TACT Was Generally Well- Designed and Links Results to Its Intended Goal of Crash Reduction", "paragraphs": ["We found that the evaluation of TACT was generally well-designed, since it  appropriately used an experimental design to attribute outcomes to TACT\u2019s  initiatives.

Aside from the initiative, participants  experience the same influences. That is, they face conditions that are alike  during the same period. More specifically, the evaluation of the TACT  initiative exposed drivers in the intervention corridors to paid and earned  media and high-visibility law enforcement waves, while simultaneously  leaving unexposed comparable drivers in similar comparison corridors.  Then the evaluation compared outcomes in the two groups. This procedure  was repeated in two additional corridors to make sure that any detected  differences in outcomes were not unique to the first two corridors.

NHTSA officials stated that although the  evaluation was unable to report on long-term results, the program\u2019s finding  of improved driver behavior around trucks would logically indicate an  expected decrease in truck-related crashes, injuries, and fatalities.  Furthermore, NHTSA does not evaluate individual Click It or Ticket  campaigns, which are considered to successfully modify behavior, for their  effect on long-term results such as fatality reduction.

This conclusion is supported by the evaluation of past  initiatives to change driver behavior, particularly of efforts to increase  safety belt use. For example, a 2002 study by NHTSA included data from  Texas, which showed that while the baseline percentage of individuals  wearing safety belts (80 percent) increased slightly with advertising alone,  the combination of advertising and enforcement caused the number to  increase another 6 percent. TACT\u2019s use of media, road signs, and other  educational outreach tools therefore directly linked to the STRS goal of  decreasing unsafe driver behavior around commercial vehicles by truck  drivers and passenger-vehicle drivers, and incorporating high-visibility law  enforcement increased the initiative\u2019s potential for successfully reaching  that goal.

Applications for these funds were due before the  Washington TACT evaluation report was published; therefore, states  seeking to begin similar initiatives needed to design their own initiatives  without the benefit of Washington\u2019s experience. Finally, FMCSA officials  stated that no state applied for a fiscal year 2006 grant before the  application deadline in the Federal Register; however, FMCSA will accept  applications until the end of fiscal year 2006 or until the available funds are  awarded.", "Although FMCSA has plans for a nationwide expansion of TACT, the  majority of FMCSA\u2019s STRS funds will be spent on other activities. Program  planning documents state that FMCSA has decided to transition STRS to  focus on developing initiatives similar to TACT in other states, but FMCSA  plans to invest just $150,000 of its $500,000 fiscal year 2006 STRS budget to  do this. FMCSA officials told us that STRS funds would pay for the  evaluation component of this initiative, and FMCSA will supplement  activities with MCSAP funds. The $150,000 fiscal year 2006 STRS  investment in these future initiatives is significantly less than the  approximately $664,000 in STRS funds provided solely to TACT in fiscal  years 2004 and 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA\u2019s Ability to Manage Future Initiatives Is Unclear and NHTSA\u2019s Role Is Still Evolving", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA\u2019s ability to administer future high-visibility law enforcement  campaigns and NHTSA\u2019s role in future STRS initiatives are unclear. As we  previously mentioned, a goal of the TACT pilot was for FMCSA to learn  about the operation of high-visibility enforcement programs from NHTSA,  and to support this goal, FMCSA detailed a liaison to NHTSA following  congressional direction. FMCSA, however, missed valuable opportunities  for learning because of the time it took to fill the position, since the liaison  came aboard late in the TACT program and returned to FMCSA before  NHTSA conducted its annual Click It or Ticket enforcement campaign.  After discussing our findings with FMCSA officials, they clarified that other  FMCSA staff participated in TACT and knowledge transfer was not limited  to the liaison.", "Furthermore, NHTSA\u2019s participation in future STRS activities is still  evolving. As we previously mentioned, SAFETEA-LU authorized $3 million  to NHTSA and $1 million annually to FMCSA for administering education  and outreach activities associated with commercial-vehicle safety for the 4- year period from 2006 through 2009. However, the Conference Report  accompanying the DOT appropriations act for fiscal year 2006 indicates  that the conferees did not fund the amounts authorized. Instead, they  funded $4 million to FMCSA alone for these purposes. Given its limited  experiences with programs designed to modify driver behavior, however,  FMCSA\u2019s plans call for continuing cooperation with NHTSA in future aggressive driving programs. For example, staff in FMCSA\u2019s Washington  Divisional Office told us that their agency lacks NHTSA\u2019s experience with  initiatives that change driver behavior and does not have staff with a  background in the area, especially at the division office level. This is  important because TACT\u2019s evaluation report states that having an  experienced evaluation team that can develop and implement a  comprehensive evaluation design was critical to the success of the project.  As we previously mentioned, NHTSA has experience in operating  successful campaigns to increase safe behavior by motorists. Additionally,  FMCSA has only a small number of staff dedicated to its education and  outreach programs. NHTSA staff with whom we spoke initially stated that  the agency\u2019s involvement will end with the issuance of the TACT program  evaluation report. Currently, however, NHTSA staff said they will provide  FMCSA with general assistance, and FMCSA has formed a transition team  to help ensure that the necessary expertise will be available to future  initiatives. NHTSA officials added that specific experience with behavioral  issues is not required to replicate the TACT initiative. They said that a  program plan, a media plan, an enforcement plan, and an evaluation plan  are required."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMCSA\u2019s Short-term Plans Focus on Initiatives That Do Not Include Enforcement and That Have Not Been Shown to Be Effective", "paragraphs": ["FMCSA plans to spend the majority of its 2006 STRS funds on updating the  STRS Web site and producing outreach materials. These funds will be spent  on initiatives that have limited potential for reducing fatalities and provide  limited opportunities for evaluation, representing a return to an earlier era  of STRS. FMCSA will spend $200,000 in updating its Web site, $100,000 on  education and outreach materials promoting sharing the road, and $50,000  on printing. FMCSA plans to update its Web site with information on  preventing aggressive driving, which will include Spanish-language  content. The Web site also will include a user survey to gauge satisfaction  and will be able to ask up to five questions about a user\u2019s knowledge of  STRS initiatives. Currently, FMCSA can only collect information on the  number of visits to the Web site. In addition, FMCSA plans to distribute  education and outreach materials promoting sharing the road. These  initiatives were not financially supported during fiscal years 2004 and 2005,  when NHTSA had responsibility for STRS. As we previously stated, purely  educational initiatives may conceptually link to FMCSA\u2019s goal of reducing  accidents and fatalities, but initiatives such as TACT have a better potential  to improve driver behavior by incorporating local enforcement efforts with  educational outreach. Figure 8 shows four categories of FMCSA\u2019s planned  STRS spending in fiscal year 2006. Table 1 lists FMCSA\u2019s planned outreach  activities within two of these categories.", "It is unclear if evaluations of these planned STRS education and outreach  activities will provide meaningful insight into their effectiveness. FMCSA  officials told us that they hired a contractor to develop evaluations of STRS  education and outreach activities, but plans to evaluate the impact of these  activities on fatality and injury rates have yet to be developed. This  contractor will be required to (1) develop an evaluation study that gathers  baseline data and (2) assess whether the education and outreach materials  and activities reached the intended audience, changed attitudes and  behaviors, and helped the program meet its safety goals. However, in  discussing these plans, a NHTSA official told us that it will be difficult to  measure the impact of educational materials on driver behavior.  Furthermore, in our 2003 report, we stated that previous evaluations of  STRS activities shed little light on their short-term, intermediate, and long- term outcomes. This was due, in part, to FMCSA\u2019s heavy reliance on self- reported data and to FMCSA\u2019s not establishing a baseline of driver behavior  and knowledge before the program started. By contrast, TACT\u2019s evaluation  visually assessed driver behavior before and after motorists received  education and enforcement. If FMCSA cannot evaluate the effect of these  activities on driver behavior, then the planned activities may represent a  return to the practices that we questioned in our 2003 report."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The TACT initiative represented a significant departure from previous  STRS initiatives and, by following the high-visibility law enforcement  campaign model, incorporated program elements that experts believe are  most effective in changing driver behavior. Its systematic evaluation and  clear link to agency goals were important steps toward addressing  concerns with STRS that we raised in the past. Furthermore, the positive  results shown by the TACT evaluation and the ongoing problem of crashes  between trucks and passenger vehicles demonstrate that there is merit in  further developing and implementing high-visibility law enforcement  campaigns similar to TACT. FMCSA\u2019s plans for future aggressive driving  initiatives are still evolving, but the agency is currently developing a second  pilot in Pennsylvania and has a goal of rolling out TACT-like initiatives  nationwide in 2009. However, FMCSA has yet to develop a clear strategy  describing how it will expand initiatives similar to TACT from a series of  pilots into a nationwide program or to describe how these programs will be  funded.", "Furthermore, some of FMCSA\u2019s plans for addressing unsafe driving do not  focus on expanding education and enforcement initiatives such as TACT.  Instead, FMCSA has chosen to spend the majority of its fiscal year 2006  STRS funds on initiatives that are purely educational, which safety experts  agree are less effective than when educational outreach is combined with  enforcement. Because FMCSA has not identified a cohesive strategy to  expand TACT and not focused on proven approaches such as high-visibility  law enforcement campaigns, it is unclear how FMCSA\u2019s STRS initiatives  will contribute to FMCSA\u2019s goal of expanding TACT and reducing crashes  and fatalities.", "Finally, there are doubts about FMCSA\u2019s ability to ensure the success of  STRS in the future. Although funding responsibility for STRS returned to  FMCSA in 2006 and FMCSA participated in the initial planning for TACT,  NHTSA and the Washington Traffic Safety Commission significantly  supported TACT\u2019s implementation and evaluation. Additionally, FMCSA  may have missed valuable opportunities to learn about the operation of  TACT and other similar programs because its involvement was limited by  not being able to use its legislatively mandated liaison to the fullest extent  possible. DOT, through staff from both NHTSA and FMCSA, demonstrated  that it has the ability to develop state initiatives that change driver behavior  around trucks by successfully implementing TACT. Even so, it is uncertain  that DOT will effectively use these resources in the future, given that the  relationship between NHTSA and FMCSA is still evolving and that FMCSA  has limited staff and experience in administering high-visibility law  enforcement campaigns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that the Share the Road Safely program continues to improve  driver behavior around commercial vehicles, thereby potentially reducing  fatalities, we recommend that the Secretary of Transportation direct the  Administrators of the appropriate agencies to take the following three  steps:  develop a comprehensive strategy describing how FMCSA will  implement and fund an expansion of TACT-like initiatives from several  pilots into a nationwide program and detail how STRS initiatives  contribute to this goal;  complete and execute plans to evaluate STRS outreach activities that  are purely educational and discontinue activities with no demonstrable  impact on behavior; and  monitor whether FMCSA has sufficient staff and expertise to  successfully develop and administer future high-visibility law  enforcement campaigns, and, if it does not, determine the best methods  for DOT to use its resources and expertise to modify driver behavior and  address the problem of aggressive driving around trucks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided DOT with a draft of this report for review and comment.

To determine whether the  design of TACT was reasonable, we reviewed TACT programming  documentation to determine if the design of the program links program  initiatives to goals and if the design follows the high-visibility law  enforcement campaign model for behavior change. We did not assess the  design of other STRS initiatives because they were not actively funded in  fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and because we reported on these activities in  our 2003 report.", "To address our second objective\u2014to determine what DOT evaluations have  shown and whether the methods were acceptable\u2014we reviewed  evaluation results and analyzed evaluation plans to determine if short-term,  intermediate, and long-term outcomes were measured and if external  factors were considered and controlled for in the assessment.
