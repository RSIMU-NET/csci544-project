DOD evaluates nonmilitary mission requests on the basis of legality, lethality, risk to DOD forces, the cost, the appropriateness of the mission, and the impact on military readiness. The 1878 Posse Comitatus Act prohibits the direct use of federal military troops in domestic civilian law enforcement, except where authorized by the Constitution or Acts of Congress. Congress has expressly authorized the use of the military in certain situations such as to assist with drug interdiction or assist with terrorist incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. It is too early to assess the adequacy of DOD's new management organizations or plans but some forces may not be tailored for their domestic missions. DOD established an Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Homeland Defense and U.S. Northern Command plan and execute domestic missions. U.S. Northern Command's plan for domestic military missions was developed before DOD officials had agreed on the nature of the threat. Forces are not adequately tailored for some domestic missions, and readiness could erode because of it. For example, Air Force fighter units deployed since September 11, 2001 to perform combat air patrols are unable to also perform required combat training. Overseas and domestic missions are stressing U.S. forces as measured in personnel tempo data. In September 2001, about 1,600 Air Force personnel had spent 220 to 365 days away from their homes over the previous year, but by December 2002 almost 22,100 Air Force personnel had been away that long. The Army reported similar increases. To prevent erosion in combat capabilities, DOD issued orders, known as stop loss, to involuntarily retain critical personnel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I appreciate the opportunity to discuss with you today the demands being  placed on the Department of Defense (DOD) in the post September 11,  2001, environment.

To determine the differences in DOD\u2019s missions and how DOD  evaluates mission requests, we reviewed appropriate guidance and  directives specifying mission types, and discussed these issues with  knowledgeable officials. To identify legal constraints on DOD\u2019s  nonmilitary missions, we reviewed the 1878 Posse Comitatus Act and  related laws. To determine the adequacy of organizations, plans, and  forces, we reviewed DOD reorganizations, visited the new U.S. Northern  Command, reviewed campaign plans and related documents, and  compared the types of missions performed by forces with their primary  missions. Finally, to determine the impact of domestic or overseas  missions on personnel tempo, we obtained personnel tempo databases  from DOD for the period October 2000 through December 2002 (the most  recent data available) and analyzed the data.

At the same time, DOD  has used existing forces for these missions since September 11, 2001.  However, at the time of our review, the organizations were not yet fully  operational; plans had been developed before issuance of a  counterterrorism threat assessment and before DOD officials had reached  agreement on the nature of the threat; and force capabilities were not well  matched to their domestic missions, potentially leading to an erosion of  military readiness."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New DOD Organizations to Address Military Domestic Missions Are Not Yet Fully Operational", "paragraphs": ["Two new organizations\u2014the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Homeland Defense and U.S. Northern Command\u2014together provide  long-term policy direction, planning, and execution capability but are not  yet fully operational, because they have only recently been established and  are not fully staffed.

The activation of the command marks the first time that there has been a  unity of command for military activities within the continental United  States. Prior to U.S. Northern Command\u2019s activation, U.S. Joint Forces  Command provided for military actions to defend U.S. territory from land-  and sea-based threats.

Moreover, an official in the Office of the Secretary of  Defense acknowledged that DOD officials continue to debate the nature of  the threat to U.S. territory, thus DOD itself has not yet reached internal  agreement on the nature of the threat facing the United States."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD\u2019s Forces Are Not Tailored to Conduct Long- Term Military Missions Domestically", "paragraphs": ["Based on our review, DOD\u2019s forces are not tailored for some of the  missions that they have been performing since September 11, 2001, and  the result could be eventual erosion of military readiness. To respond to  the terrorist attacks of that day, the President identified the need to  protect U.S. cities from air attack, and in response, DOD deployed 338 Air  force and about 20 Navy aircraft within 24 hours of the attacks. Air Force  fighter aircraft flew continuously from September 11, 2001, through March  2002, and intermittently thereafter. These combat patrols continue today.  While these forces may obtain some training benefit from actually  conducting the mission, the benefit is limited by the narrow scope of  maneuvers performed during these missions. Specifically, Air Force and  Air National Guard fighter units performing domestic combat air patrols  are inhibited from executing the full range of difficult, tactical maneuvers  with the frequency that the Air Force requires to prepare for their combat  missions. In one Air National Guard wing that we reviewed, the average  pilot could not meet their training requirements in 9 out of 13 months  between September 2001 and September 2002. Consequently, such units  may need to resume training after domestic combat air patrols end or they  are reassigned, to ensure their readiness for combat operations, their  primary missions. Similarly, DOD identified the need to enhance  installation security, and it subsequently deployed active, reserve, and  National Guard military police units for the mission. However, these units  were designed for a different mission, and received limited training benefit  from the domestic mission. For example, officials at a military police  internment and resettlement battalion told us that while the battalion can  provide installation security, its primary mission is to operate enemy  prisoner of war camps. Instead, for nearly a year, the battalion carried out  a domestic installation security mission, which while important, prevented  the battalion from completing required training for its primary overseas  combat mission. As a result, the battalion\u2019s military readiness may become  eroded, which could mean accepting an increased risk to the battalion if it  deploys or resuming training before it deploys again."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Increased Overseas and Domestic Missions Add to High Army and Air Force Personnel Tempo", "paragraphs": ["Current overseas and domestic missions are stressing U.S. forces as  measured in personnel tempo data. DOD believes that if servicemembers  spend too much time away from home, a risk exists that they will leave the  service and military readiness may ultimately suffer.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 requires that  DOD formally track and manage for the number of days that each member  of the armed forces is deployed and established two thresholds\u2014 servicemembers deployed more than 182 or 220 days away from home out  of the preceding 365 days. The National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2001 established a third threshold, which requires that  servicemembers who are deployed for 401 or more days out of the  preceding 730-day (2-year) period receive a $100 high deployment per  diem allowance. Between September 2001 and December 2002, personnel  tempo increased dramatically for Army and Air Force personnel due to  ongoing missions or commitments around the world and their increasing  support of Operations Noble Eagle and Enduring Freedom.", "DOD data that we obtained indicated tempo is high and increasing. For  example, as shown in figure 1, in September 2001, over 6,600 Army  personnel (including active, reserve, and National Guard personnel) had  exceeded a desired threshold, spending 182 to 219 days away from home  during the previous 365 days. By December 2002, that number had risen to  over 13,000. During the same period, the number spending 220 to 365 days  away, had risen from about 800 to over 18,000.", "The Air Force reported similar trends. As shown in figure 2, in September  2001, about 2,100 Air Force servicemembers were away from home for 182  to 219 days, but that had risen to about 8,300 by December 2002. Also, as  with the Army, Air Force servicemembers away 220 to 365 days had risen  from about 1,600 to over 22,100.", "The number of Air Force active, Air Force reserve, and Air National Guard  Air Force personnel exceeding the third personnel tempo threshold of 401  or more days away from home in the preceding 730-day period also  increased during the latter period of 2002, starting at about 3,700  personnel in September 2002 and rising to more than 8,100  servicemembers in December 2002. Of those, about one-half of these  personnel were Air National Guard personnel, some of whom were tasked  with conducting air sovereignty alert missions in the continental United  States. In September 2002, 1,900 had spent more than 401 days away from  home over a 2-year period. By December 2002, the number of Air National  Guard personnel spending more than 401 days away from home had  increased to about 3,900. Exceeding the threshold on a sustained basis can  indicate an inadequacy in the force structure or the mix of forces.", "DOD has recognized the potential for retention problems stemming from  the current high personnel tempo but has balanced that against immediate  critical skill needs to support ongoing operations. Therefore, to prevent  servicemembers with key skills from leaving the services, DOD issued  orders to prevent degradation in combat capabilities, an action known as  stop loss authority. DOD took these actions because it recognized that  individuals with certain key skills\u2014such as personnel in Army military  police and Air Force fighter units\u2014were needed, in some cases, to  perform the increasing number of military domestic missions. These  orders affected personnel with designated individual job skills or in some  cases all of the individuals in specific types of units that were critical for  overseas combat and military domestic missions.", "Officials from the four services who manage the implementation of these  orders cautioned that they are short-term tools designed to maintain unit- level military readiness for overseas combat and military domestic  missions.
