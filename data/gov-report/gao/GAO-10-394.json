The prior Administration sought to improve efficiency under the Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART) by requiring programs to have at least one efficiency measure and procedures for improving efficiency, and show annual efficiency gains. The current administration has also emphasized efficiency in some initiatives. GAO was asked to examine (1) the types of PART efficiency measures and the extent to which they included typical elements of an efficiency measure; (2) the extent to which selected programs showed gains and how they used efficiency measures for decision making; (3) the challenges selected programs faced in developing and using efficiency measures; and (4) other strategies that can be used to improve efficiency. GAO analyzed the 36 efficiency measures in 21 selected programs in 5 agencies and a generalizable sample from the other 1,355 measures governmentwide, reviewed documents and interviewed officials from selected programs, reviewed literature on efficiency, and interviewed experts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Under PART, most programs developed an efficiency measure. However, according to GAO's analysis, 26 percent did not include both typical efficiency measure elements--an input (e.g., labor hours or costs) as well as an output or outcome (e.g., the product, service, or result produced). Most frequently missing was the input (69 percent). For example, a measure developed by the National Nuclear Safety Security Administration considered the number of information assets reviewed for certification without considering costs of review. This could result in measures that do not capture efficiency. GAO has previously recommended agencies improve cost information for decision making, but they are in various stages of implementation. However, alternative forms of measurement, such as reducing costly error rates, could still be useful. Of the efficiency measures GAO reviewed that had both typical elements, a similar number reported gains and losses. Officials for some programs stated that the efficiency measures reported for PART were useful, and described ways in which they used the data, such as to evaluate proposals from field units, lower the cost of a contract, or make decisions to shift production. Others did not find the efficiency measures useful because, for example, the program lacked control over key cost drivers, such as contractually required staffing levels, or because of concern that raising output could lower quality. Officials for all of the programs reviewed described challenges to developing and using program-level efficiency measures and performance measures in general. Challenges included interpreting outcome-level efficiency information, such as the cost of improving or maintaining the condition of watershed acres, when factors other than program funding, such as past impacts from mining, affected conditions as well; achieving required annual efficiency gains in cases where a program intervention takes years to implement; and inconsistent or limited guidance and technical assistance from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to agencies on how to measure efficiency. A variety of approaches have been used to improve efficiency, including governmentwide reviews, agency restructurings, process and technology improvements, and strategic spending approaches. The Administration has some initiatives along these lines, such as information technology and procurement reforms. The Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA) provides a framework for planning future efficiency gains while maintaining or improving effectiveness and quality of outputs or outcomes. OMB, as the focal point for management in the executive branch, provides guidance and supports information-sharing mechanisms, such as the Performance Improvement Council, which could also be used to create a more strategic and crosscutting focus on agency efforts to improve efficiency. OMB has not clearly indicated whether programs should continue measuring efficiency nor has it emphasized efficiency in its GPRA guidance to agencies."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in the economy and financial markets\u2014and the government\u2019s  response to them\u2014have contributed to recent increases in federal deficits,  which reached a record level in fiscal year 2009. While a lot of attention  has been given to the recent fiscal deterioration, the federal government  faces even larger fiscal challenges, driven by certain factors, such as  health care cost growth and demographic trends, which will persist long  after the return of financial stability and economic growth. Given the  magnitude of these challenges, the federal government must identify ways  to operate and deliver results more efficiently as well as more effectively.", "In response to these fiscal challenges, the current Administration has  emphasized the importance of reducing spending and improving  government efficiency in recent initiatives. These initiatives have included:  the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) requirement for agencies to  submit alternative targets for discretionary funding levels for fiscal year  2011 budget submissions that involved freeze and reduction scenarios,  including the identification of 126 program terminations, reductions, and  other areas of savings identified which, if enacted or implemented, could  save approximately $23 billion; contracting and workforce reforms  designed to save at least $40 billion a year; information technology  management improvements designed to improve efficiency; and holding a  contest to seek ideas from federal employees on how to increase  efficiency and savings. Recently, the President also established a  management advisory board to provide advice and recommendations on,  among other things, improving the productivity of federal operations.", "At the same time, several broader government reform efforts over the past  17 years have also included a focus on improving efficiency. The  Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA),  which  Congress enacted in part to improve federal program effectiveness and  accountability and enhance congressional decision making, was created  partly to address waste and inefficiency in federal programs. The  President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA)  and Program Assessment Rating  Tool (PART) initiatives of the previous presidential administration  emphasized improving government efficiency with specific requirements  for agencies to develop program-level efficiency measures and show  annual improvements in efficiency. Analysis of the experiences of federal  agencies in developing and using efficiency measures under the PMA and  PART initiatives, as well as identification of additional strategic and  crosscutting approaches used by government, nongovernment, and  business organizations to seek improvements in efficiency, could be  helpful to agencies as they attempt to improve efficiency of programs.", "In response to your request, this report examines (1) the types of  efficiency measures reported through PART for agency programs overall,  and particularly for selected programs in five selected agencies, focusing  on the extent to which they included typical elements of an efficiency  measure, (2) for selected programs, the extent to which programs  reporting efficiency measures through PART have shown efficiency gains  and how programs have used efficiency measures for decision making,     (3) for selected programs, the types of challenges to developing and using  efficiency measures they have faced, and (4) other strategies that can be  used to improve efficiency.", "Based on our review of the literature, an efficiency measure is typically  defined as the ratio of two elements:  a program\u2019s inputs (such as costs or  hours worked by employees), to its outputs or outcomes.  Outputs can be  defined as the amount of products or services delivered by a program.   Outcomes can be defined as the desired results of a program, such as  events, occurrences, or changes in conditions, behaviors, or attitudes. In  some literature, the inverse ratio of outcomes or outputs to inputs is  referred to as a \u201cproductivity\u201d measure, but for purposes of this report,  we refer to either form of the ratio as an efficiency measure.  It should be  noted that an improvement in efficiency can be achieved by maintaining  quantity or quality of outputs or outcomes while reducing costs, as well as  by improving the quantity or quality of outputs or outcomes while  maintaining (or reducing) costs. Thus an improvement in efficiency need  not involve a reduction of costs.", "OMB initially described an efficiency measure as the ratio of a program\u2019s  outcomes or outputs to inputs in the 2004 PART guidance.  In the  December 2007 PART guidance, OMB termed this type of ratio an \u201cinput  productivity measure,\u201d and indicated that such measures could provide a  useful approach for identifying efficiency measures.  In the guidance, OMB  also identified erroneous conclusions that can result from the use of  simple output-input ratios to track changes over time in efficiency for  programs that do not produce the same or similar outputs repetitively.  OMB also identified challenges facing efforts to measure efficiency in  research and development programs and construction of special purpose  infrastructure projects. OMB broadened the discussion of efficiency  measures in the revised guidance and proposed alternative approaches to  tracking efficiency changes for such programs, such as meeting project  cost, schedule, and performance goals.", "To address our objectives, we analyzed all 1,396 PART efficiency measures  associated with 937 programs in a database provided by OMB. We  conducted more detailed analysis of the 36 efficiency measures for 21  selected programs, as well as a random sample of 100 efficiency  measures from all remaining programs. This sample was designed to  enable us to generalize our analysis to the remaining efficiency measures  for PART. We selected the 21 specific programs for review from five  departments\u2014the U.S. Departments of Agriculture, Education, the  Interior, Labor, and Transportation. These departments were selected to  represent variety in the extent to which they had developed managerial  cost accounting systems as identified by our prior work, based on an  assumption that the status of a department\u2019s cost accounting systems  could affect the availability of cost information and thus the development  of efficiency measures. We selected the 21 specific programs to represent  a diverse array of functions and operations within the federal government,  primarily focusing on the PART program type. Additional criteria were  that the selected programs had relatively large fiscal year 2009 funding  levels, and variety in the number of efficiency measures associated with  the programs. In addition, we reviewed program documents, OMB  documents, including PART assessments, and agency Web sites. We  conducted a literature review as well as expert interviews to identify the  elements of a typical efficiency measure, and to identify alternative  approaches to improving efficiency. We interviewed officials from OMB  and from the 21 selected programs, as well as officials from the five  departments who were knowledgeable about performance measurement  and financial systems for the departments.  See appendix I for a more  detailed discussion of our scope and methodology.", "We conducted the major portion of this performance audit from  September 2008 to May  2010 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

According to the statute, GPRA was intended, among other  things, to address problems of waste and inefficiency in federal programs,  and to improve congressional decision making by providing objective  information on the relative efficiency and effectiveness of federal  programs and spending.", "OMB plays an important role in the management of the federal  government\u2019s performance, and specifically GPRA implementation. Part of  OMB\u2019s overall mission is to ensure that agency plans and reports are  consistent with the President\u2019s budget and administration policies. OMB is  responsible for receiving and reviewing agencies\u2019 strategic plans, annual  performance plans, and annual performance reports. To improve the  quality and consistency of these documents, OMB issues annual guidance  to agencies for their preparation, including guidelines on format, required  elements, and submission deadlines. In addition, GPRA requires OMB to  prepare the overall governmentwide performance plan, based on agencies\u2019  annual performance plan submissions.", "The PMA and PART of the prior administration also included an emphasis  on improving government efficiency, with requirements for agencies to  develop program-level efficiency measures and show annual  improvements in efficiency. In August 2001, the Bush Administration  launched the PMA with the stated purpose of ensuring that resources  entrusted to the federal government were well managed and wisely used.  OMB developed criteria called \u201cstandards of success\u201d to measure progress  in five management initiatives under the PMA, as well as a scorecard to  track agency progress under each initiative. Criteria to receive and  maintain the highest rating score (green status) for the performance  improvement initiative included that an agency\u2019s annual budget and  performance documents include at least one efficiency measure for each  program and that program performance and efficiency improvements be  identified each year.", "PART, which was launched in 2002 as a component of the PMA, included  assessment of the extent to which programs were tracking progress  toward and achieving efficiency improvements. PART consisted of a set of  questions developed to assess various types of federal executive branch  programs, and addressed four aspects of a program:  purpose and design,  strategic planning, program management, and program  results/accountability. While there were references to efficiency in several  different sections of the 2007 and 2008 PART guidance, two PART  questions focused specifically on development of program-level efficiency  measures with annual targets for improvement:  \u201cDoes the program have procedures (e.g., competitive sourcing/cost  comparisons, information technology (IT) improvements, appropriate  incentives) to measure and achieve efficiencies and cost effectiveness in  program execution?\u201d", "In order to receive a \u201cyes\u201d response for this question, a program was to  have regular procedures in place to achieve efficiencies and cost  effectiveness, and had to have at least one efficiency measure with  baseline and targets. Evidence could include efficiency measures,  competitive sourcing plans, IT improvement plans designed to produce  tangible productivity and efficiency gains, or IT business cases that  documented how particular projects improved efficiency.  \u201cDoes the program demonstrate improved efficiencies or cost  effectiveness in achieving program goals each year?\u201d", "In order to receive a \u201cyes\u201d response for this question, a program had to  demonstrate improved efficiency or cost effectiveness over the prior  year, including meeting its efficiency target(s) in the question above."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Programs Developed an Efficiency Measure for PART, but Only about Half Clearly Included Typical Elements of an Efficiency Measure", "paragraphs": ["About 90 percent of all programs that received a PART assessment,  including those in our selected review, developed at least one performance  measure as an efficiency measure. However, we found that about half of  the approved measures either did not contain typical elements of an  efficiency measure, or were unclear. As table 1 below indicates, we  analyzed a sample of the efficiency measures that were developed for  PART, and, to the extent possible, placed them into one of the three  categories shown in the table. (In some cases, the available information on  the measure was insufficient for us to place it into one of the three  categories, so we labeled these measures as \u201cunclear.\u201d)", "As figures 1 and 2 below illustrate, our analysis of the 36 efficiency  measures from our selected programs and a random sample of the  remaining efficiency measures indicates that about half of the efficiency  measures contained typical elements by including both an input and an  output or outcome.  As illustrated in figure 1, for the 21 selected programs  (listed in appendix II), we determined that 58 percent of the efficiency  measures included both elements and 42 percent did not.  In its guidance  to programs, OMB stated that, although both output and outcome-oriented  efficiency measures were acceptable, outcome efficiency measures were  preferred. Because we obtained more in-depth information on the selected  programs\u2019 measures, we further analyzed whether those that included both  elements were output- or outcome-oriented and found most to be output- oriented.", "Figure 2 summarizes estimates for the remaining 1,355 efficiency  measures, based on a random sample of 100 of those measures. We  estimate that 48 percent of the measures included both elements,             26 percent did not, and the remaining 26 percent were unclear. Of those  that did not contain both elements, the missing element was most often an  input.", "In general, as indicated in table 1, the absence of these typical elements  can result in measures that do not truly capture efficiency.  Nevertheless,  some of the information captured in these measures could still be of value  to program officials for helping improve efficiency. For example, one  measure from our selected programs\u2014average time to correct/mitigate  higher priority operations and maintenance deficiencies at certain  facilities in the Bureau of Reclamation\u2014did not contain an input  element. However, program officials told us this was an important  measure because it helped them prioritize which ongoing preventive  maintenance projects they should repair first by categorizing repairs  needed according to the likely costs of delaying the repairs. For example a category 1 deficiency should normally be repaired immediately (within  to 6 months) to avoid escalating the cost of repair; a category 2 deficiency should be repaired in a few years.  In contrast, a category 3 deficiency is  normally repaired only if there is time and funding remaining after  repairing category 1 and 2 deficiencies.", "In another example, the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) used a  measure which was labeled an efficiency measure, but which did not hav the typical ratio of inputs to outputs or outcomes.  Instead, the measure  focused on reducing the error rate in making program payments.  Progra officials characterized the measure as a process measure, rather than an  output or outcome-based efficiency measure.  An official said that out of  s  $7 billion in total program payments, errors worth $2 billion occur in term of under and over payments, for a net cost to the program of $1 billion.  An  official said that if they were able to reduce overall overpayments due to  various types of error, it could save millions of dollars.  Officials said this  measure has been important in helping them take corrective actions to  reduce the number of payments made in error.", "Among the selected programs, for the efficiency measures that contained  an input, the type of information used to express the input varied in terms  of both availability for use and completeness. Most of the efficiency  measures we reviewed captured inputs in terms of cost, but a few us amount of staff resources or time spent to produce an output or outcome  as a proxy for cost. For example, the Department of Labor Energy  Employees Occupational Illness Compensation program\u2019s efficiency  measure was the average number of decisions per full-time equivalent  (FTE), which we determined used information on work hours as estima by FTEs as the input. While FTE information is often readily available  ted  and can be a useful proxy for cost, it does not necessarily reflect total cost  because, for example, it would neither distinguish between higher and  lower cost FTEs, nor would it include other costs, such as contractors,  training, equipment, or facilities.", "In addition, dollar cost information can vary in how completely it captures  the cost of producing outputs or outcomes. \u201cCost\u201d generally can be  thought of as the value of resources that have been, or must be, used or  sacrificed to attain a particular objective, which, in the case of an  efficiency measure, would be a unit of output or outcome. \u201cFull cost\u201d is  generally viewed as including both direct costs (costs that can be  specifically identified with a cost object, such as an output) and indirect  costs (costs of resources that are jointly or commonly used to produce  two or more types of outputs but are not specifically identifiable with any  of the outputs). Managerial cost accounting (MCA) information can  provide a more complete picture of the cost involved in producing  program outputs or outcomes by recognizing resources when they are  used and determining the full cost of producing government goods and  services, including both direct and indirect costs.  According to the  Statement of Federal Financial Accounting Standards No. 4 (SFFAS 4),  Managerial Cost Accounting Concepts and Standards for the Federal  Government, which sets forth the fundamental elements for MCA in  government agencies, costs may be measured, analyzed, and reported in  many ways and can vary depending upon the circumstances and purpose  for which the measurement is to be used.  Our analysis of the cost  information used by the selected programs showed that most of the  measures used budgetary information, such as appropriations or  obligations, for the cost element.  Of the 18 efficiency measures from our  selected programs that had both typical elements, and had cost as the  input, 14 measures (78 percent) used a form of budgetary information.", "We have previously reported that using budgetary information, such as  appropriations or obligations, may not completely capture the full cost of  producing program outputs or outcomes because of differing time frames  and account structures. With regard to timing, appropriations provide  agencies legal authority to obligate funds for a given fiscal year or beyond.  Consequently, agency outlays (payments against obligations for goods and  services received) representing the resources used to produce a program\u2019s  outputs or outcomes in a given year may flow from obligations made in a  prior year\u2019s appropriation. Therefore a given year\u2019s appropriations or  obligations may not represent the resources actually used to produce a  program\u2019s outputs or outcomes in that year. With regard to account  structures, appropriations accounts developed over the last 200 years were  oriented in different ways in response to specific needs. For example,  some appropriations accounts reflect items of expense, such as salaries or  construction, while others reflect organizations, processes, or programs.  Further, program-oriented account structures may cover multiple  programs or may exclude some indirect resources used by the programs.", "Though budgetary information may not completely cover the cost of  producing program outputs or outcomes, several program officials said it  was the most complete information available to them and best met the  needs of Congress. For example, the Department of Labor Job Corps  program, which used budgetary information in its efficiency measure,  divided its request in the fiscal year 2010 Job Corps Congressional Budget  Justification into three categories: operations, construction, and  administration. However, the program\u2019s efficiency measure\u2014cost per  participant in the Job Corps program\u2014was based entirely on the  operations category, which encompassed 92 percent of the program\u2019s  fiscal year 2010 request, meaning the measure did not capture the  remaining 8 percent of construction- or administration-related costs that  were also associated with program participation. A study commissioned  by the Job Corps recommended that all direct costs associated with Job  Corps appropriations be included in the measure if full costs were to be  determined. This would include actual expenditures (i.e., outlays rather  than appropriations or obligations) for Job Corps appropriations provided  for operations, construction, and direct administrative costs. Program  officials indicated they did not believe including the additional costs  would provide useful information because there were relatively few  opportunities to find efficiencies in the construction or administration  categories. Additionally, a Department of the Interior Wildland Fire  Management budget official told us that while they had access to more  complete cost data, this information was not necessarily accurate or easy  to obtain because it had to be collected from five different entities with  different cost accounting systems. They also preferred to use budgetary  information because it helped to justify their appropriations request to  Congress.  Program officials noted that each of their three efficiency  measures was based on obligations data.", "Relative to time or budgetary information, some agencies have sought to  develop more complete cost information by using MCA systems capable of  accumulating and analyzing both financial and nonfinancial data in order  to determine, among other things, the unit cost of producing program  outputs or outcomes.  Such systems are also capable of recognizing  resources when they are used and determining the full cost of producing  government goods and services, including both direct and indirect costs.", "However, in earlier work we found that only 3 of the 10 Chief Financial  Officer (CFO) Act agencies we reviewed had implemented MCA systems  entitywide: Interior, the Social Security Administration, and Labor.  Transportation had made significant progress in implementing MCA  entitywide and three agencies\u2014Agriculture, Health and Human Services,  and Housing and Urban Development\u2014planned to implement MCA  systems when upgrading their overall financial management systems. The  three remaining agencies we reviewed\u2014Education, the Treasury, and  Veterans Affairs\u2014had no plans to implement MCA departmentwide,  although Veterans Affairs was initiating a review to explore opportunities  to do so. Consequently, we recommended that individual agencies  commence or improve the development of entity-wide MCA systems as a  fundamental component of their financial management system, as required  by SFFAS 4 and the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of  1996.", "For this report, of the five agencies we reviewed, we selected three\u2014 Interior, Labor, and Transportation\u2014because we previously reported they  had either implemented MCA systems entitywide, or were planning to do  so.  Nevertheless, we did not find widespread use of MCA system data for  the efficiency measures we reviewed either in these agencies or in the  other two agencies\u2014Education and Agriculture\u2014that did not have  entitywide MCA systems.", "Of the 18 efficiency measures from our selected programs that included  typical elements, four measures (22 percent) used a distinct MCA system  to determine costs. Those programs that relied on MCA data produced  outputs, such as the Student Aid Administration program (student aid  disbursements), the Federal Aviation Administration\u2019s (FAA) Air Traffic  Organization Terminal (take offs and landing operations) and Technical  (maintenance and modernization of equipment needed to provide air  traffic services) programs, and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fisheries  program (pounds of trout per dollar). In addition, legislation was enacted  in the 1990s, which resulted in both Federal Student Aid (FSA) and FAA  developing MCA systems to improve performance.37, 38 Of the remaining 14  efficiency measures, officials from several of those programs told us they  used budgetary information because they either did not have access to an  MCA system, the system they could access produced poor data, or the  information would not be useful for congressional decision making. For  example, the Department of Education did not have a departmentwide  MCA system, though it is now considering creating such a system in  response to a prior recommendation we made. Also, officials with the  Department of Transportation CFO office told us that the department had  taken a decentralized approach in which some of their operating  administrations\u2014such as the FAA and Federal Transit Administration\u2014 had developed and were using their own MCA system. In addition,  although the Department of Labor\u2019s CFO had developed an MCA system  and made it available to its agencies and programs, officials from the five  Department of Labor programs we reviewed indicated that they did not  use it for their efficiency measures because, in their opinions, the system  was either not useful, not sufficiently developed for their needs, did not  capture all the program\u2019s costs, or captured a different type of funding  than was used for the efficiency measure.  Finally as indicated previously,  a Department of the Interior Wildland Fire budget official told us that cost  information for their program was neither easy to access nor was it as  useful for budget justification purposes.", "The Higher Education Amendments of 1998, which amended the Higher Education Act of  1965, established a performance-based organization for the delivery of federal student  financial assistance, after which Federal Student Aid, the one Department of Education  program office with an operational MCA system, independently developed its MCA system.

As previously indicated in figure 2, 21 of the 36  efficiency measures developed by the programs selected for our review  had both of the elements of a typical efficiency measure. As can be seen in  table 2, 8 of the 21 efficiency measures (representing seven different  programs), showed an improvement in efficiency between the baseline  and most current year. Ten of the efficiency measures (representing seven  programs) showed a decrease in efficiency over the reported periods.  Three measures (representing two programs) had only baseline data.", "We have previously reported that agencies can use performance  information to make various types of management decisions to improve  programs and results. The same is true for performance measures that  track efficiency\u2014managers need to use the information to help them  identify actions needed to bring about improved efficiency.  Our review of  selected programs that had measures with both elements of a typical  efficiency measure found variety in terms of whether officials reported  using efficiency measures. We also found no clear relationship between  efficiency gains or losses and whether program officials reported using or  not using efficiency measures. Officials from three of the seven programs  that reported efficiency gains described using their efficiency measures,  while officials for three additional programs with efficiency gains said they  did not use the efficiency measures. Officials for the other program with  efficiency gains reported mixed pictures, saying they did not use the  efficiency measure but found some value in the measure or its  components. A similar mix was found among programs that reported net  losses in efficiency, with officials for three programs using the efficiency  measures and officials for four programs not using them.", "One example of a program that showed a net gain over time for its  efficiency measure and for which officials reported using the data was the  Department of Education\u2019s Student Aid Administration program. Reducing  costs was one of the primary objectives of the program. Their efficiency  measure\u2014direct administrative unit costs to originate and disburse  student loans and Pell Grants\u2014showed a gain in efficiency from 2006 to  2008.  The agency provides federal assistance to eligible students by  partnering with postsecondary schools, financial institutions, and guaranty  agencies (state and nonprofit agencies that guarantee loans against  default). Program officials told us they used information from this  measure to establish targets for reduced unit costs for their lending  transactions. For example, they reported using the data to negotiate a  lower cost for the origination of direct student loans by a sole-source  contractor. FSA used a contractor to originate the loans made directly to  students. The contract allowed for a certain quantity of loan originations  for a set price, up to a maximum number of loans each year. According to  program officials, the sharp reduction in credit availability due to the  financial crisis beginning in 2008 led to an increase in demand for FSA  direct loans. FSA had projected that demand for direct student loans in the  4th quarter of fiscal year 2009 would exceed the contract maximum by       3 million loans. The contractor proposed a price of $8.9 million for the  additional loans, arguing that the added volume would require higher  infrastructure costs associated with greater call center capacity. FSA  officials told us they analyzed historical data for their efficiency measure  and found that the unit cost to originate loans decreased as volume  increased. They used this analysis to challenge the contractor\u2019s bid and  succeeded in lowering the agreed price to $4.9 million. Officials reported  that legislation, federal cost accounting standards, and our previous  recommendations all contributed to pressure to track unit costs and try to  lower administrative costs. Consequently, the agency had developed a  number of cost models, which facilitated their developing the efficiency  measure for PART.", "The Department of the Interior\u2019s Fisheries program provides an example  in which the efficiency measure showed a net loss but officials said they  used the efficiency measure data to make management decisions. The  efficiency measure tracked the efficiency (pounds per dollar) of producing  healthy rainbow trout for recreation. For the first 4 years examined, fiscal  years 2004 through 2007, the efficiency measure varied slightly, indicating  that overall efficiency was relatively stable. For fiscal year 2008, however,  the measure fell, indicating a significant drop in efficiency. Officials  attributed this drop to a 31 percent increase in feed, energy, and utility  costs that was experienced throughout the country in 2008 and was  beyond their control. Several fishery stations reported 40 percent  increases in feed costs in just 1 year. Officials told us that having  information about the decline in efficiency was valuable because it led  individual stations to look for opportunities to lower other costs of  production that were within their control. For example, program managers  said they used their efficiency measure data to help them decide to phase  out the production of inefficient (more costly) strains of trout. In addition,  they said they used the measure to help manage the losses resulting from  diseased trout that could not be sold by shifting production from one  fishery to another that did not have a problem with disease. Officials said  they thought it was easier for programs that directly produced products or  provided services to develop and use efficiency measures.

Officials said their efficiency measures, which tracked numbers  of wildland acres treated or moved to a better condition class (to reduce  the likelihood of wildland fires) per million dollars, enabled them to  identify unusually high or low costs when evaluating proposals from field  units for funding treatments. They could identify a proposal that did not  fall within the normal range of prior projects in terms of costs, do further  analysis, and ask for explanations from field staff to better understand  why the proposal was outside the norm.  Program officials also said they  used a tool called Ecosystem Management Decision Support (EMDS) to  help prioritize projects and allocate funding for future years.

It fields, repairs, and maintains a huge  network of complex equipment, including radars, instrument landing  systems, radio beacons, runway lighting, and computer systems. The  efficiency measure, unit cost for providing ATO Technical Operations  services, is the \u201ctotal labor obligations for the Technical Operations'  Service Unit\u201d divided by the total hours of operational availability (or  equipment \u201cuptime\u201d). Officials said the measure was used as a baselining  effort, and no decisions have been made as a result. Officials explained  that they cannot significantly influence labor costs because of a labor  agreement that requires ATO to maintain 6,100 direct employees.  Officials  said they have used data for the denominator of the efficiency measure, on  the hours of operational availability. Equipment needs to be available  continuously, and currently is about 99.7 percent of the time. Officials said  they have not done the marginal cost analysis to determine whether it  would be cost-effective to try to increase equipment uptime, but they have  broken the data down by location and looked for outliers and tried to  address impediments to operational availability at certain locations. They  also said that while they have not used the efficiency measure to make any  management decisions, it has been valuable in helping to orient staff to  think about costs of operations and how to go about looking for efficiency  improvements.", "Lastly, the Department of Labor\u2019s Occupational Safety and Health  Administration (OSHA) program reported a net loss for the efficiency  measure and told us they did not use the data.

For example, the purpose of  the Forest Service\u2019s Watershed program is to restore, enhance, and  maintain watershed conditions, including soil, water, air, and forest and  rangeland vegetation within the national forests and grasslands.  Management of these physical and biological resources provides a  foundation for healthy, viable ecosystems. The Watershed program  received a \u201cResults Not Demonstrated\u201d rating from the OMB 2006 PART  assessment process because it lacked long-term, outcome-based  performance and efficiency measures to track the performance of land  management activities on national forest and nonfederal watersheds, or  demonstrated water quality improvement over time. Basically, the Forest  Service was unable to track how watershed projects were prioritized,  identify the benefits associated with restoration projects, and determine  whether those projects improved watershed condition. Officials said they  had previously proposed the unit cost of watershed improvement projects  as an efficiency measure under PART, but OMB rejected it partly because  it was an output- rather than an outcome-level measure. According to  Forest Service documents, factors beyond its control affect watershed  conditions, and it is difficult to demonstrate the impact of program  activities on watersheds and try to determine the most cost-effective way  to improve the outcome. The agency\u2019s ability to improve the condition of  watersheds depends on many factors, including what percentage of the  land affecting the watershed is privately owned as opposed to owned by  the Forest Service and past impacts\u2014for example, an official said that  lands that were previously mined may be more difficult to restore.  Officials said that the cost of trying to improve some watersheds would  exceed available funds, and in some cases passive restoration, or doing  nothing and letting natural processes return, could improve conditions as  rapidly as any program interventions could. Forest Service officials said  they reached agreement with OMB to develop an outcome-oriented  efficiency measure based on the cost of improving or maintaining the  condition of watershed acres.  According to a 2008 report prepared by the  Forest Service, in order to be able to relate costs to outcomes, program  officials explained that they will need to develop a consistent approach for  assessing watershed condition and a system that would enable them to  track changes in watershed conditions and relate these changes to Forest  Service management activities.

For these programs, it can be difficult to identify performance  measures that will provide information on annual progress toward  program results.", "Along these lines, some program officials we interviewed told us it was not  reasonable to expect annual improvements in efficiency for some  programs because it might take several years for an increase in efficiency  to be realized as a result of some intervention or investment, or because a  technological advance might result in a one-time cost savings that would  not continue to be achieved over time. For example, the Plant and Animal  Health Monitoring and Surveillance programs of Agriculture\u2019s Animal and  Plant Health Inspection Service, which protects the health and value of  agriculture and natural resources through early detection of pest and  disease outbreaks, had an efficiency measure that tracked the value of  damage prevented or mitigated by the program per dollar spent.

Process improvement methods  can involve examining processes and systems to identify and correct  costly errors, bottlenecks, or duplicative processes while maintaining or  improving the quality of outputs.", "There are numerous process methods that use different tools and  techniques. For example, Six Sigma is a data-driven approach based on the  idea of eliminating defects and errors that contribute to losses of time,  money, opportunities, or business. The main idea behind Six Sigma is to  measure the defects in a process and then devise solutions to eliminate  them, helping an organization approach a high quality level. Another  method is Business Process Reengineering (BPR), which redesigns the  way work is done to better support the organization\u2019s mission and reduce  costs. Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the  organization\u2019s mission, strategic goals, and customers. As a result of the  strategic assessment, BPR identifies, analyzes, and redesigns an  organization\u2019s core business processes with the aim of achieving dramatic  improvements in critical performance measures, such as cost, quality,  service, and speed.", "A 2009 study conducted by the American Productivity and Quality Center  (APQC) identified a variety of methods, including Six Sigma and  Business Process Re-engineering, which have been used by organizations  to focus on process improvement. The study included a survey of 281  small-to-large-sized enterprises with annual gross revenue of $4.2 trillion  to identify current process-focused practices and learn about process  effectiveness. Survey respondents identified various efficiency related  improvements resulting from their process improvement approaches, such  as streamlined processes, improved customer satisfaction, quality  improvements, and improved decision making.", "In relation to process improvement, modernizing processes through  investments in technology can generate efficiency gains. Our prior work  indicates that the federal government can help streamline processes and  potentially reduce long-term costs by facilitating technology  enhancements. For example, as shown in figure 3, growth in electronic  filing has allowed the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to reduce staff years  used to process paper tax returns. As electronic filing increased between  fiscal years 1999 and 2006, IRS reduced the number of staff years devoted  to total tax return processing by 34 percent.  We have also reported that  processing is more accurate and costs are lower to IRS as a result of  electronic filing\u2014IRS saves $2.71 for every return that is filed  electronically instead of on paper.", "The President\u2019s 2011 Budget described a variety of initiatives the  administration intends to undertake to streamline existing IT  infrastructure, improve the management of IT investments, and leverage  new IT to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal government  operations.  In June 2009, the U.S. Chief Information Officer (CIO)  launched the IT Dashboard, which allows the American people to monitor  IT investments across the federal government.  The IT Dashboard displays  performance data on nearly 800 investments that agencies classify as  major. The performance data used to track the 800 major IT investments  include schedule, cost, and the agency CIO\u2019s assessment of the risk of the  investment\u2018s ability to accomplish its goals. Beginning in January 2010, the  U.S. CIO began holding TechStat Accountability Sessions\u2014face-to-face,  evidence-based reviews of IT programs, undertaken with OMB and agency  leadership, to improve overall performance.  According to the U.S. CIO\u2019s  Web site on TechStat, in some cases this review process is leading to  projects being eliminated.  The administration has also indicated it intends  to:    consolidate data centers to reduce costs and increase efficiency;     pursue \u201ccloud computing,\u201d which will enable agencies to share   information technology services and software rather than purchase or  develop their own;     continue to pursue various \u201ce-government\u201d initiatives, which are expected  to deliver services more efficiently both within across agency lines; and     employ federal enterprise architectures and supporting segment  architectures to streamline processes and modernize services, in many  cases across agency lines.", "In addition to these IT initiatives, the Administration has also placed  emphasis on reducing errors in payments.  Executive Order 13520, signed  in November 2009, requires, among other things, publishing information  about improper payments on the Internet, including targets for reduction  and recovery, and assigning a senior official to be accountable for  reducing and recovering improper payments at relevant agencies. The  executive order also lays out steps intended to lead to enhanced  accountability of contractors and incentives and accountability provisions  for state and local governments for reducing improper payments.", "Consistent with OMB\u2019s PART guidance for programs to identify  procedures to improve efficiency, officials from several of the selected  programs we reviewed said they had modernized information technology  to reduce costs and improve services. Officials from the Department of  Labor\u2019s Job Corps program said they reduced Federal Telecommunication  Costs through the use of voice over Internet protocol and other  improvements in technology, while expanding the use of video  conferencing and e-learning to improve customer service. As a result of  these efforts, officials reported cutting communication costs by $1 million.  Officials for the Department of the Interior\u2019s Endangered Species program  said they used information technology to reduce errors due to hand entry  of data. They said that by eliminating manual entry of data, errors were  reduced, which resulted in more accurate information and increased  efficiency.", "Such methods are consistent with PART guidance to identify procedures,  such as information technology improvements, to improve efficiency.  However, the program-level focus of the PART process would not  necessarily lead to an examination of efficiency improvements to be  gained by improving the processes and systems outside a program\u2019s  purview. Government processes and systems can involve multiple  programs within and across federal agencies. For example, we previously  reviewed the cost of administering seven key human services programs  and found that the federal government may help balance administrative  cost savings with program effectiveness and integrity by simplifying  policies and facilitating technology improvements. Simplifying policies\u2014 especially those related to eligibility determination processes and federal  funding structures\u2014could save resources, improve productivity, and help  staff focus more time on performing essential program activities. By  helping states facilitate technology enhancements across programs, the  federal government can help streamline processes and potentially reduce  long-term costs.", "As another example, we have reported that the federal agencies that share  responsibility for detecting and preventing seafood fraud\u2014the  Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Customs and Border Protection, the  Department of Commerce\u2019s National Marine Fisheries Service, and the  Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Food and Drug  Administration\u2014have not taken advantage of opportunities to share  information that could benefit each agency\u2019s efforts to detect and prevent  seafood fraud, nor have they identified similar and sometimes overlapping  activities that could be better coordinated to use limited resources more  efficiently. For example, each agency has its own laboratory capability for  determining seafood species and uses different methodologies for creating  standards for species identification. The result is that neither the  laboratories nor the data developed in them are shared."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Strategic Approach to Spending Can Be Used to Reduce Input Costs and Improve Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["We have recommended that agencies take a strategic approach to  spending that involves a range of activities\u2014from using \u201cspend analysis\u201d  to develop a better picture of what an agency is spending on goods and  services, to taking an organization-wide approach for procuring goods and  services. We found that private sector companies have adopted these  activities to help leverage their buying power, reduce costs, and better  manage suppliers of goods and services. By strategically managing costs,  government can improve efficiency in the same way as private sector  organizations examined in our prior work.   \u201cSpend analysis\u201d is a tool that provides information about how much is  being spent for goods and services, identifies buyers and suppliers, and  helps identify opportunities to leverage buying power to save money and  improve performance. To obtain this information, organizations use a  number of practices involving automating, extracting, supplementing,  organizing, and analyzing procurement data. Organizations then use these  data to institute a series of structural, process, and role changes aimed at  moving away from a fragmented procurement process to a more efficient  and effective process in which managers make decisions on an  organizationwide basis.", "Spend analysis allows for the creation of lower-cost consolidated  contracts at the local, regional, or global level. As part of a strategic  procurement effort, spend analysis allows companies to monitor trends in  small and minority-owned business supplier participation to try to address  the proper balance between small and minority business utilization, in  addition to pursuing equally important corporate financial savings goals  for strategic sourcing.", "Spend analysis is an important component of the administration\u2019s plans to  improve government procurement.  Along these lines, OMB issued  memoranda in July and October of 2009 instructing agencies to increase  competition for new contracts.  The administration also set a net savings  target of $40 billion to be achieved by agencies through improved  contracting practices in fiscal year 2010 and 2011.  The October  memorandum provided agencies guidelines for increasing competition for  contracts and structuring contracts to achieve the best results at the least  cost to the taxpayer.  Specifically, the memorandum recommends the use  of spend analysis to identify the agency\u2019s largest spending categories,  analyze and compare levels of competition achieved by different  organizations within the agency, determine if more successful practices  may exist for obtaining greater marketplace competition for a given  spending category.", "Among the programs we reviewed, officials from the Job Corps program  reported that they achieved improvements in efficiency by using some  elements of a strategic spending approach. For example, Job Corps  officials indicated that the program has avoided approximately $1 million  in utility costs by purchasing energy from utilities using competitive bids  in deregulated markets. When an area of the country became deregulated,  the program would analyze the utility prices and quantities of electricity or  natural gas used by the Job Corps centers in the area. If prices in the  deregulated market looked favorable, the energy contracts for the centers  would be placed out for bid to all eligible energy suppliers. Job Corps  would select the bid with the best price and terms and set up a contract to  purchase energy from them for a fixed period of time (usually 1 or               2 years). When the contracts came to an end, the process would be  repeated. If the prices on the deregulated market were not favorable at  that time, then the centers could revert back to the local utilities for their  energy. Job Corps also conducted energy audits to identify problem areas  and propose solutions to reduce energy costs at facilities where energy  usage was above the benchmark. Job Corps reportedly reduced energy  costs through investments in energy saving projects, training of staff and  students to control energy use, and using an online system to review and  analyze billing and procurement of energy in deregulated markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GPRA Could Provide a Framework for Structuring a More Strategic Approach to Improving Government Efficiency", "paragraphs": ["The administration has not clearly indicated whether it will continue to  emphasize measuring efficiency at the program level as it did under PART.   Rather, in describing its approach to performance and management in the  President\u2019s budget, the Administration stated that GPRA and PART  increased the production of measurements in many agencies, resulting in  the availability of better measures than previously existed; however, these  initial successes have not led to increased use.  To encourage senior  leaders to deliver results against the most important priorities, the  administration tasked agencies with identifying and committing to a  limited number of priority goals, generally three to eight, with high value  to the public. The goals were to have ambitious, but realistic, targets to  achieve within 18 to 24 months without need for new resources or  legislation, and well-defined, outcome-based measures of progress.   Further, in the coming year, the Administration will ask agency leaders to  carry out a similar priority-setting exercise with top managers of their  bureaus to set bureau-level goals and align those goals, as appropriate,  with agencywide priority goals. These efforts are not distinct from the  goal-setting and measurement expectations set forth in GPRA, but rather  reflect an intention to translate GPRA from a reporting exercise to a  performance improving practice across the federal government. By  making agencies\u2019 top leaders responsible for specific goals that they  themselves have named as most important, the Administration has stated  that it hopes to dramatically improve accountability and the chances that  government will deliver results on what matters most.", "To complement the renewed focus on achieving priority outcomes, the  Administration has also proposed increased funding to conduct program  evaluations to determine whether and how selected programs are  contributing to desired outcomes.  The Administration intends to take a  three-tiered approach to funding new program initiatives.  First, more  money is proposed for promoting the adoption of programs and practices  that generate results backed up by strong evidence. Second, for an  additional group of programs with some supportive evidence but not as  much, additional resources are allocated on the condition that the  programs will be rigorously evaluated going forward.  Third, the approach  encourages agencies to innovate and to test ideas with strong potential\u2014 ideas supported by preliminary research findings or reasonable  hypotheses.  We have previously reported on how program evaluations  can contribute to more useful and informative performance reports  through assisting program managers in developing valid and reliable  performance reporting and filling gaps in needed program information,  such as establishing program impact and reasons for observed  performance and addressing policy questions that extend beyond or  across program borders.", "In addition to program evaluations that determine program impact or  outcomes, we have identified cost-effectiveness analysis as a means to  assess the cost of meeting a single goal or objective, which can be used to  identify the least costly alternative for meeting that goal. In addition cost- benefit analysis aims to identify all relevant costs and benefits, usually  expressed in dollar terms. Given the challenges program managers we  interviewed cited in developing and using outcome-based efficiency  measures, such evaluations might fill gaps in understanding the cost of  achieving outcomes and allow for cost comparisons across alternative  program strategies intended to produce the same results.", "GPRA\u2019s focus on strategic planning, development of long-term goals, and  accountability for results provides a framework that Congress, OMB, and  executive branch agencies could use to promote and apply various  approaches to achieving efficiency gains in federal agencies. Congress  enacted GPRA in part to address waste and inefficiency in federal  programs. Agencies could use strategic plans as a vehicle for identifying  longer-term efficiency improvement goals and strategies for achieving  them. They could use annual performance plans to describe performance  goals designed to contribute to longer-term efficiency goals, and annual  performance and accountability reports to monitor progress toward  achieving annual or longer-term efficiency goals.", "GPRA could provide a framework that would balance efforts to improve  efficiency with overall improvements in outcomes.  GPRA was intended to  provide a balanced picture of performance that focused on effectiveness  as well as efficiency. Officials from some selected programs identified a  risk that focusing on reducing costs to improve efficiency could  potentially have negative effects on the quantity or quality of outputs or  outcomes. For example, officials for the Smaller Learning Communities  program at the Department of Education said their outcome-level  efficiency measures, which tracked the cost per student demonstrating  proficiency or advanced skills in math or reading, could result in  unintended negative consequences such as providing motivation for  grantees to cut costs by lowering teacher salaries, lower proficiency  standards so that more students would be classified as proficient, or  engage in \u201ccreaming\u201d (focus only on those students most likely to achieve  gains). OMB\u2019s PART guidance included recognition that efforts to improve  efficiency can involve risk to quality, outcomes, or other factors such as  customer satisfaction. The PART guidance included as an example how  reducing processing time to be more efficient could result in increased  error rates. OMB recommended that programs assess risks associated with  efficiency improvement efforts and develop risk management plans if  needed. Similarly, in the United Kingdom\u2019s governmentwide efficiency  program, departments could only report improvements in efficiency if they  could also demonstrate that the quality of public services was not  adversely affected by the reforms.  Under GPRA, agencies\u2019 plans and  performance measures are expected to strike difficult balances among  competing demands, including program outcomes, cost, service quality,  customer satisfaction, and other stakeholder concerns. Therefore agencies  could mitigate the risk to program outcomes and quality associated with  taking a narrow cost-cutting approach by developing GPRA goals,  strategies, and performance measures that clearly balance these  competing demands.", "We have previously reported that OMB could use the provision of GPRA  that calls for OMB to develop a governmentwide performance plan to  address critical federal performance and management issues, including  redundancy and other inefficiencies in how we do business. It could also  provide a framework for any restructuring efforts. This provision has not  been fully implemented, however. OMB issued the first and only such plan  in February 1998 for fiscal year 1999.", "Further, as the focal point for overall management in the executive  branch, OMB could provide guidance and management and reporting tools  to increase federal agencies\u2019 focus on efficiency improvements. OMB\u2019s  main vehicle for providing guidance on the development of agency  strategic plans and performance plans and reports, OMB Circular A-11,  Section 6 (Preparation and Submission of Strategic Plans, Annual  Performance Plans, and Annual Program Performance Reports), makes  no reference to establishing long-term goals for efficiency gains or  describing strategies for how performance outcomes can be achieved  more efficiently. References to efficiency in the guidance primarily pertain  to the inclusion of program-level efficiency measures in agency budget  justifications.", "OMB could also support mechanisms to share information and encourage  agency efforts to improve efficiency. OMB has previously developed or  contributed to mechanisms for sharing information and encouraging  improvements to federal programs in the past, such as Web sites to share  information, highlight success, and identify best practices for initiatives.  For example, www.results.gov had information on best practices related  to PMA initiatives, and www.expectmore.gov provided information on  PART assessments and improvement plans. OMB\u2019s own Web site  contained information and examples of what it considered to be high- quality PART performance measures; discussion papers on measurement  topics, such as how to effectively measure what a program is trying to  prevent; and strategies to address some of the challenges of measuring the  results of research and development programs. OMB recently launched a  collaborative wiki page which is intended to provide an online forum for  federal managers to share lessons learned and leading practices for using  performance information to drive decisionmaking. OMB has sponsored  various management councils, such as the President\u2019s Management  Council and the Performance Improvement Council, which include  representatives of agencies and serve as forums for information sharing  among agencies and with OMB. We have also reported that OMB has  hosted standing working groups and committees comprised of agency and  OMB staff, and has hosted workshops to address important issues and  identify and share best practices. For example, OMB helped form a  subgroup among agency officials responsible for the PMA budget and  performance integration initiative to share lessons learned and discuss  strategies to address challenges of developing efficiency measures in the  grant context."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The prior Administration\u2019s approach to improving efficiency under PMA  and PART focused on measuring and achieving efficiency gains at the  program level.  The approach involved requiring each program to develop  at least one efficiency measure and demonstrate annual gains in efficiency,  as well as to have regular procedures in place for achieving improvements  in efficiencies.  Although most programs that received a PART assessment  developed an efficiency measure, not all of these measures included both  elements of a typical efficiency measure\u2014an input as well as an output or  outcome.  The absence of these typical elements can result in measures  that do not truly capture efficiency.  Nevertheless, other forms of  measures intended to improve efficiency, such as those focused on  reducing costly error rates, could still provide useful information.", "Officials for some selected programs we reviewed indicated that the  efficiency measures reported for PART were useful and described ways in  which they used data for efficiency measures, such as to evaluate  proposals from field units, lower the cost of a contract, or make decisions  to shift production.  Other officials we interviewed did not find the  measures useful for decision making.  Officials for all of the programs  described challenges to developing and using efficiency measures that  were similar to challenges we previously reported on in prior work on  PART and performance measures in general.  For example, in one case the  way OMB defined the program boundaries did not line up well with how  managers ran the activities, which resulted in measures that were not  useful for decision making. Some program officials indicated it was not  always feasible to meet the requirement to demonstrate annual gains in  efficiency, given that improvement could take multiple years to achieve.  Some officials cited inconsistencies and limitations in the guidance and  technical support from OMB on how to develop and use efficiency  measures.", "OMB has not clarified whether programs should continue to collect and  use efficiency measure data established for PART.  Such clarification is  necessary to help guide any refinements, as needed, to the current  process, as well as broader issues. While tracking efficiency at the  program level can be useful, this approach can miss opportunities to seek  efficiencies on a larger scale, such as efforts that cross traditional program  and agency boundaries. The experiences of private and public sector  entities in implementing strategic and crosscutting approaches to  improving efficiency can provide insights for federal agencies. For  example, process improvement and modernization of systems can be  undertaken both within and across organizational boundaries to increase  quality, reduce waste, and lower costs. Analyzing spending and  procurement strategies to leverage buying power and improve  performance can identify opportunities to reduce the cost of producing  agency outputs and outcomes. Broader, governmentwide reviews and  analysis of restructuring opportunities that involve a wider scope of  government activity can be used to identify strategic, crosscutting  approaches to improving efficiency that emphasize the need to maintain or  improve other key dimensions of performance. Such approaches have the  potential to yield significant gains in efficiency that would be difficult to  achieve by individual programs working in isolation.", "The current Administration has begun to identify some important  opportunities for crosscutting efficiencies in its proposed information  technology initiatives and procurement reforms and has tasked agencies  with establishing agency cost reduction goals and asked federal employees  to submit their suggestions for cost savings.  Efforts to improve efficiency  can take multiple years to accomplish and can require changes in strategy  and collaboration within and across organizational lines. Furthermore,  efficiency can only be improved if  other performance dimensions, such as  the quality or quantity of agency outputs and outcomes, are maintained or  improved as resources are reduced; or conversely, if quality and quantity  of outputs/outcomes are improved with a given level of resources.  The  Administration has signaled its intent to make greater use of program  evaluation to determine which programs are producing desired results.   Program evaluations can also be used to determine the cost of achieving  outcomes, an approach that could aid in identifying the most cost-effective  program designs.", "Continuing to build on the experiences and lessons learned from prior  initiatives, with a concerted focus on specific levels of governments\u2014 governmentwide, agency, and program\u2014could help to identify, introduce,  and sustain additional efficiency gains on a more systematic and systemic  basis at these same levels.  The planning and reporting requirements of  GPRA could serve as a framework for developing agency or across-agency  strategies for improving efficiency and tracking results.  By implementing  the governmentwide performance plan provision of GPRA, OMB could  provide further impetus to identifying efficiency goals to be achieved by  consolidating operations or restructuring programs on a governmentwide  basis.  Further, OMB\u2019s A-11 guidance on preparing agency strategic and  performance plans could place greater emphasis on improvements in  efficiency.

Because we wanted to include agencies  with variety in the types of cost data available, we selected some  departments that had\u2014and some that had not\u2014developed an MCA  system. The Departments of the Interior, Labor and Transportation were  selected because these were the only departments out of the 10 agencies  we reviewed at the time that had implemented\u2014or had made significant  progress in implementing\u2014MCA departmentwide. To compare and  contrast findings from these departments, we selected two other  departments that had not implemented an MCA system. The United States  Department of Agriculture was selected because the department indicated  in our 2007 report that it planned to implement an MCA system the next  time it upgraded its financial management system.  The Department of  Education was selected because it indicated it had no plans to implement  an entitywide MCA system.", "After choosing the departments, we selected 21 programs to review from  the set of all programs that had a received a PART assessment by the  Office of Management and Budget (OMB).  PART was developed to assess  and improve program performance so that the federal government could  achieve better results.  According to OMB, a PART review helped identify  a program\u2019s strengths and weaknesses to inform funding and management  decisions aimed at making the program more effective. A PART review  included program-level performance information and efficiency measures  for the programs. The PART data we received from OMB contained 1,396  efficiency measures which were associated with 937 programs that  received a PART assessment. Within the five departments, we selected the  21 specific programs for review to represent a diverse array of functions  and operations within the federal government, as indicated by the PART  program type. Of the seven PART program types, we selected five for  inclusion in this study, excluding research and development and credit.  Additional criteria were that the selected programs have relatively large  fiscal year 2008 funding levels, and variety in the number of efficiency  measures associated with the programs.", "For the first objective regarding the extent to which efficiency measures  included typical necessary elements, we first identified the elements and  developed a definition by conducting a literature review as well as expert  interviews. We then performed various degrees of analysis on (1) all  efficiency measures for all programs represented in the PART database,  (2) all of the measures for our selected programs, and (3) a random sample  of 100 efficiency measures taken from the PART database. The following  describes the analysis we conducted on each of these three populations:    Analysis on the complete PART database: The analysis we conducted  on all PART efficiency measures resulted in a set of summary statistics,  such as the fiscal year 2008 total funding by PART program type, the mean  amount of funding each program received within the program types, the  number of programs for each PART program type, the number of  programs that had between zero and eight efficiency measures, and the  number of programs in each selected department by PART program type.", "Analysis of PART measures selected with certainty from 21  programs in five departments:  For the 21 programs we selected, we  conducted a more detailed analysis on the 36 associated efficiency  measures. However, any findings based on this analysis cannot be  generalized beyond these particular measures. We performed a content  analysis review of these measures, which was based upon the PART  efficiency measure data; our review of applicable documents concerning  the measures and programs, such as the programs\u2019 PART assessments; and  interviewing program officials to discuss the measures and programs. For  each of these measures, we identified whether certain attributes were  present, and the documents we reviewed and interviews we conducted  aided in this effort at times. The fields from the PART database we used to  assess each efficiency measure were the agency and program name, the  text for each efficiency measure and, when present, the more detailed  efficiency measure explanation.  Using this information, we determined  whether each of the measures included the program\u2019s inputs (such as cost  or hours worked by employees) as well as its outputs or outcomes. When  we identified a measure as having an output or outcome element, we  distinguished between the two. We also analyzed whether there was either  a time or cost attribute to each measure. For each of these attributes, the  potential answers were \u201cYes,\u201d \u201cNo,\u201d or \u201cUnclear.\u201d To determine whether  an efficiency measure had these attributes, we defined each term for this  particular exercise.  We defined an input as a resource, such as cost or  employee time, used to produce outputs or outcomes. We defined outputs  as the amount of products and services delivered by a program.  We  defined outcomes as the desired results of a program, such as events,  occurrences or changes in conditions, behaviors or attitudes.  We defined  a measure to have an attribute of time or cost when the measure appeared  to include some type of attribute of time (e.g., \u201chours worked by  employees,\u201d \u201cper month,\u201d \u201cannually,\u201d or \u201cwithin three months,\u201d) or cost,  respectively. We conducted our coding by having three team members  independently code each of the 36 efficiency measures without each  knowing how the other two coders assessed each measure. Afterward, the  three coders discussed and reconciled any differences and reached  agreement in all incidents. Finally, we determined whether the cost  element was based on budgetary information or MCA information.", "Analysis of a random sample from the PART database: This analysis  involved selecting a random sample of 100 efficiency measures from the  remaining 1,355 efficiency measures in the PART database. Estimates  based on the sample can be generalized to estimate characteristics of the  remaining population of 1,355 efficiency measures. Because we followed a  probability procedure based on random selections, our sample is only one  of a large number of samples that we might have drawn. Since each  sample could have provided different estimates, we express our  confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95  percent confidence interval (e.g., plus or minus 10 percentage points). This  is the interval that would contain the actual population value for 95  percent of the samples we could have drawn. As a result, we are 95  percent confident that each of the confidence intervals in this report will  include the true values in the study population. Unless otherwise noted, all  percentage estimates have 95 percent confidence intervals of within plus  or minus 10 percentage points of the estimate itself.  The analysis we  conducted on these measures was similar to the analysis we conducted for  the selected programs, meaning we analyzed and determined if each  measure had an input, output or outcome, time or cost attribute and used  the same definition and coding procedures. However, because we did not  have in-depth information from interviews or program documents  concerning these measures, in some cases we were unable to conclude  whether certain efficiency measures included necessary elements and  consequently, classified about a quarter of the sample as unclear. Also,  because of the lack of detailed information on the measures, we could not  distinguish between outputs and outcomes expressed for these measures.", "Simultaneously with the content analysis of the efficiency measures, for  the second and third objectives, on how selected agencies/programs used  efficiency measures and the extent to which they reported efficiency  gains, and what challenges or constraints to developing and using  efficiency measures they faced, we reviewed program Web sites, PART  assessments, other documents provided by program officials, and  interviewed program officials identified by the departments as  knowledgeable about the particular program and its efficiency measure(s).  These interviews consisted of asking agency officials a similar set of  questions with topics such as how the efficiency measure(s) was  developed and used, associated challenges, and alternative methods for  evaluating efficiency. For the two programs that did not have any  efficiency measures in PART, we asked questions such as whether they  had other efficiency-related measures they tracked internally which were  unrelated to PART, whether there had been prior attempts to develop an  efficiency measure, and whether they had experienced specific challenges  to developing and using efficiency measures. In addition to interviewing  program officials, we also interviewed at least one official in each of the  five departments who was responsible for performance measurement at  the departmentwide level. These interviews also had a similar set of  questions and were specific to departmentwide performance measurement  issues, such as whether the department had its own guidelines or guidance  pertaining to developing and using efficiency measures, how results for  program-level efficiency measures get reported within the agency, and  how program efficiency measures were used. Also at the department level,  we interviewed officials associated with each of the five departments\u2019  Chief Financial Officer (CFO) offices, asking questions about the role the  CFOs office played, if any, in developing efficiency measures for programs  and inquiring about the development and use of a managerial cost  accounting system. In addition to interviewing department and program  officials, we interviewed OMB officials on several occasions about the  approach to efficiency under PART and discussed, among other topics, the  training and guidance OMB provided, and any lessons learned from the  agencies\u2019 efforts to develop and use efficiency measures. OMB also  provided us with documents detailing the history of the PART program.", "Finally, to determine whether a selected program\u2019s efficiency measure  indicated a gain or loss, we reviewed the efficiency measure data that  were reported in the program\u2019s PART assessment and subtracted the  initial year of data from the latest year available.  To verify the accuracy of  the data, we asked program officials to confirm the data and when  necessary, to provide us with the most recent data.", "To address the fourth objective regarding the approaches agencies can  employ to improve efficiency, we interviewed program officials for the  selected programs to learn about the approaches they use to evaluate  efficiency and also conducted a two-stage literature review to determine  alternative approaches. The first stage of the literature review consisted of  examining GAO publications, Congressional Research Service reports, the  Internet, and various databases for general information on strategic  approaches to efficiency. We also participated in a business process  management research report with the American Productivity and Quality  Center (APQC), studying how organizations maintain quality across  processes and products as well as meet customer requirements in the face  of pressure to cut costs. Using information derived from the first literature  review and the APQC report, we identified the broad set of approaches to  improving efficiency. In our literature search, we looked for examples and  ideas that used a broad array of strategies to seek improvements or affect  efficiency from prior reports we have published and what other  institutions that have done work on the subject.  For this objective, we  refer to 18 different pieces of literature from our comprehensive literature  search.  In conducting the literature review, we did not attempt to identify  all potential alternative approaches that could lead to efficiency  improvements but focused on approaches that appeared consistent with  the broad definition of efficiency improvement that was used in this  report. Furthermore, in addition to the interviews with program officials  and the literature review, we interviewed experts on performance and  efficiency measures, who discussed definitions, uses, and insights of  efficiency measures. Among the experts, we interviewed officials in the  United Kingdom\u2019s National Audit Office, which assessed the reliability of  the efficiency gains reported by United Kingdom agencies as part of the  United Kingdom\u2019s 2004 government-wide efficiency review. We also  interviewed officials with the Office of the Auditor General of Canada,  which is conducting a study on ways to improve the efficiency of that  country\u2019s tax administration system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Departments, Selected Program Assessment Rating Tool Program (PART) Names, and Summary of Programs", "paragraphs": ["Restore, enhance, and maintain watershed conditions including soil, water,  air, and forest and rangeland vegetation within the national forests and  grasslands.
