GAO asked for agency guidance documents, reviewed monitoring reports, interviewed officials on agencies' Stevens Amendment oversight efforts, and asked agencies how grantees calculate funding amounts."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Stevens Amendment is an appropriations provision that requires grantees of the Departments of Labor (DOL), Health and Human Services (HHS), and Education (Education) to disclose for a grant program the percent of the costs financed with federal funds, the federal dollar amount, and the percentage and dollar amount financed by nongovernmental funds. The provision requires that recipients of grants funded by DOL, HHS, and Education make certain funding disclosures when issuing statements, press releases, bid solicitations, and other documents describing their grant project or program. DOL, HHS, and Education generally provide written guidance to grantees with the exact text of the Stevens Amendment or a paraphrased equivalent. In addition, a number of operating divisions within HHS referenced the HHS Grants Policy Statement, which includes language equivalent to the Stevens Amendment, as a way to instruct grantees. One HHS operating division, the Health Resources and Services Administration, provided grantees with additional guidance in the form of a web page that contained examples of funding disclosure statements and frequently asked questions intended to clarify the Stevens Amendment's requirements.", "One DOL subagency, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), whose active grants represented more than 95 percent of DOL's total grant dollars, had processes for managing grantees' compliance that were able to identify instances of grantee noncompliance with Stevens Amendment requirements. ETA's operating plan for grant oversight targets 26 percent of its active grants for risk-based monitoring each fiscal year, representing approximately 2,100 grants in fiscal year 2019. The other DOL subagencies either stated that they did not monitor grantees for compliance with Stevens Amendment requirements or did not have processes in place for managing grantee compliance with the requirements of the Stevens Amendment. Most HHS operating divisions said they did not review grantees for Stevens Amendment compliance. Education also did not monitor for grantee compliance with the Stevens Amendment's requirements. Regulations governing federal agencies' management of grants require federal agencies to manage and administer the federal award in a manner that ensures that programs are implemented in full accordance with U.S. statutory and public policy requirements. Without processes for managing compliance, some DOL subagencies, HHS operating divisions, and Education are unable to ensure that grant programs are being implemented by grantees in full accordance with the statutory requirements of the Stevens Amendment.", "Most of the subagencies and operating divisions monitoring compliance did not gather information from grantees about how the grantees calculate the dollar amounts and percentages in their Stevens Amendment funding disclosures. For example, DOL's ETA officials said that they do not know how the dollar amounts reported by grantees were calculated, and have not inquired about the level of detail factored into indirect costs involving the grantee organization's structure and the percentage of funds spent on salaries. Similarly, officials from HHS's National Institutes of Health operating division noted that calculations can be difficult given that a research program can have multiple funding streams that feed into a grant project and grantees' research portfolios are now more complex than they have been in the past."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOL subagencies (other than ETA), HHS operating divisions, and Education design and implement processes to manage grantees' compliance with the Stevens Amendment.

Officials also noted that some grantees expressed confusion regarding  the requirements and how to calculate the total federal funds, including in  cases where there may be collaboration across federally-funded  programs.

However, in the Stevens Amendment compliance examples that HRSA  provided to us, this calculation was not necessary because these projects  were 100 percent funded by the HRSA grant award. In addition, HRSA  officials told us that they are not aware of any other methods that  grantees would need to use to arrive at the percentage.

First,  Education said that our recommendation is not based on any evidence of  noncompliance with the Stevens Amendment by Education grantees. As  noted in our report, we found that Education lacks information regarding  whether its grantees are, or are not, complying with the requirements of  the Stevens Amendment. As indicated in this report, Education officials  told us that they do not collect documentation from grantees to monitor  their compliance with the Stevens Amendment, nor do they analyze  information regarding the extent of grantee compliance with the Stevens  Amendment.  As a consequence, Education does not know the extent to  which its grantees are or are not complying with the statutory  requirements of the Stevens Amendment. Without this knowledge,  Education does not have assurance that its grant awards are managed  and administered in accordance with federal regulations.", "Second, Education referred to its tiered risk-based approach to grantee  monitoring that balances compliance requirements with limited monitoring  resources in alignment with the President\u2019s Management Agenda.  According to Education, implementation of the recommendation would  require them to devote limited resources to managing and administering  grantee compliance with the Stevens Amendment when there is no  evidence of grantee noncompliance. We acknowledge that the cross- agency priority goal in the President\u2019s Management Agenda refers to  maximizing the value of grant funding by applying a risk-based, data- driven framework that balances compliance requirements with  demonstrating successful results. However, because Education does not  collect information or documentation on this aspect of grantee  compliance, it lacks the data needed to make an informed risk-based  assessment with regard to monitoring for Stevens Amendment  compliance. The recommendation could be implemented within the  context of Education\u2019s risk-based approach to grantee monitoring as long  as Education gathers the grantee compliance information needed to apply  their risk-based, data-driven framework.", "Third, Education said that it has already taken numerous steps to make  its process for awarding and overseeing grant funds transparent to the  public. However, these steps do not eliminate the legal requirements that  grantees must comply with the Stevens Amendment, and that federal  agencies, including Education, must manage and administer the federal  award in a manner that is fully in accordance with statutory requirements.  Education did state that it would consider enhancing its existing approach  to Stevens Amendment compliance with actions that further explain the  requirements to grant recipients. While such efforts could enhance  grantees\u2019 understanding of the Stevens Amendment, they would not give  Education the grantee compliance information it needs to apply to a risk- based, data-driven framework or to manage and administer its grant  awards in accordance with federal regulations. For all of these reasons  we continue to believe that our recommendation to Education is valid and  that Education should fully implement it.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Secretaries of Labor, Health  and Human Services, and Education, as well as interested congressional  committees and other interested parties.
