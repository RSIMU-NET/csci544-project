Officials at the DRC mission noted that staffing constraints had  generally limited their ability to monitor their WASH activities and that they  planned to hire additional staff to improve monitoring.", "Figure 5 summarizes our findings regarding the nine selected missions\u2019  compliance with USAID requirements in documenting targets and  reporting performance data for the 16 activities that we reviewed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Missions Did Not Verify Results for Some Water Activities and Overstated Results for Most Sanitation Activities", "paragraphs": ["For some of the 10 activities with a water component that we reviewed,  the missions did not verify the numbers of beneficiaries as required, and  for most of the 8 activities with a sanitation component, the missions  overstated the numbers of beneficiaries. As a result, because activity  performance data contribute to USAID\u2019s annual public reporting of WASH  results, the data that USAID uses to report the numbers of people gaining  access to an improved drinking water source and to an improved  sanitation facility annually may not be accurate. The reasons for lack of  verification for water beneficiaries were generally unclear, and mission  officials, as discussed later, generally provided varying reasons for the  inaccurate reporting for sanitation activities.

State and USAID guidance for the standard indicator of  access to an improved drinking water source requires that the  implementer or evaluator verify these estimates by assessing factors  such as the amount of time the user spent in collecting water and the  quantity of water produced by the new or rehabilitated water source.  The reasons for the lack of verification, or documentation of verification,  of beneficiaries of the 7 activities were generally unclear.", "Documents for only 3 of the 10 activities\u2014in Tanzania, Ethiopia, and  Indonesia, respectively\u2014evidenced verification efforts and, in one case,  corrective actions related to verifying results of activities to provide  access to improved drinking water. For 4 other activities, it was unclear,  on the basis of documents that the missions provided and mission  officials\u2019 responses to our queries, whether the reported results were  verified. For example, although officials at the Senegal mission stated that  they undertook regular site visits and data quality assessments to verify  estimated beneficiaries, they did not provide documentation of such  verification. Moreover, the midterm evaluation for this activity noted that  estimating the number of beneficiaries on the basis of the Senegalese  government\u2019s assumptions was feasible at the planning stage but not  during implementation, when the number of beneficiaries could be  verified. The evaluation also noted that, absent precise numbers of  beneficiaries, it was difficult to determine the cost-effectiveness of the  investment.", "For the remaining 3 activities\u20142 in the DRC and 1 in Zambia\u2014mission  officials informed us that they had not verified the reported results and  cited varying reasons.", "In the DRC, annual reports for 2 of the WASH activities we reviewed  indicated that more than 900,000 people gained access to an  improved drinking water source between fiscal years 2012 and  2014. In USAID\u2019s annual report for fiscal year 2013, the number of  beneficiaries reported as gaining access to an improved drinking  water source in the DRC constituted more than 13 percent of  worldwide beneficiaries (446,989 out of 3,509,090). Officials at the  DRC mission informed us that they had been unable to conduct a  data quality assessment planned for October 2014 because of  challenges that included security concerns and difficulties of traveling  in a country with limited roads. Mission officials also noted that  estimating numbers of people who gained access to an improved  drinking water source was complicated by the displacement of  population in the areas where USAID was implementing its WASH  activities.", "In Zambia, the mission reported in fiscal years 2012 and 2013 that  82,606 and 62,098 people, respectively, gained access to an  improved drinking water source as a result of the mission\u2019s two school  WASH activities. Officials at the Zambia mission informed us that  although they undertook verification of data for the ongoing school  WASH activity\u2019s sanitation component, they did not verify all reported  beneficiaries of the water component, which included the school  population as well as people from the surrounding communities. The  officials noted that while beneficiaries gaining access to improved  drinking water in schools could be verified, it was not possible to verify  beneficiaries from communities surrounding the school, who also  have access to water points constructed or rehabilitated under this  activity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Inaccurate Reporting of Beneficiaries Gaining Access to Improved Sanitation Facilities", "paragraphs": ["For six of the eight activities aimed at increasing access to improved  sanitation facilities that we reviewed, the activities\u2019 implementers reported  beneficiaries for facilities that did not meet USAID\u2019s definition of an  improved facility. As a result, the data reported to track progress toward  the goal of increasing access to improved sanitation are likely overstated.  USAID uses WHO and UNICEF definitions of an improved sanitation  facility, which state that a pit latrine without a slab or platform is an  unimproved sanitation facility and that only facilities that are not shared or  are not public are considered improved.", "For six of the eight sanitation activities that we reviewed, implementers  tracked and reported numbers of people gaining access to sanitation  facilities that included unimproved latrines and shared facilities. Mission  officials generally provided differing reasons for the inaccurate reporting  for these activities, such as perceived agency emphasis on reporting  beneficiaries and adherence to host-government policy or practice.  USAID officials in Washington, D.C., noted that, to some extent, the  missions\u2019 inconsistency in accurately reporting on the sanitation indicator  resulted from inadequate understanding of USAID\u2019s definition of improved  sanitation facilities among some mission staff overseeing these activities.", "In the DRC, more than 520,000 people gained access to an improved  sanitation facility in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 as a result of the  mission\u2019s primary WASH activity, according to activity annual  reports. However, according to mission officials, the activity\u2019s  reported beneficiaries included those who gained access to  household-built latrines, including basic pit latrines. USAID officials in  Washington, D.C., stated that community-led total sanitation, which  reflects the DRC mission\u2019s approach, involves changing people\u2019s  behavior regarding use of sanitation facilities by encouraging them to  build latrines; however, the officials said that these latrines generally  do not meet USAID\u2019s definition of improved sanitation facilities. These  officials noted that the results of community-led total sanitation efforts  should be reported for USAID\u2019s WASH indicator for a community  becoming open-defecation free rather than for the WASH indicator for  increased access to an improved sanitation facility. According to  officials at the DRC mission, the mission reported results of  community-led total sanitation efforts for the indicator for first-time  access to an improved sanitation facility in part because of perceived  USAID headquarters emphasis on reporting numbers of beneficiaries  of WASH assistance. Mission officials noted that headquarters\u2019  emphasis on numbers of beneficiaries had, to some extent, led the  mission to focus on activities to increase direct access to water and  sanitation rather than on efforts to improve institutions or governance.", "In Ethiopia, according to the final report for one of the activities we  reviewed, 385,909 people gained access to improved sanitation in  fiscal years 2009 through 2013 as a result of this activity. However,  the latrines built through this activity included pit latrines without slabs  (see fig. 7 for an example), which do not meet USAID\u2019s definition of  improved sanitation facilities; consistent with WHO and UNICEF  definitions, USAID categorizes a basic pit latrine without a slab as an  unimproved sanitation facility. According to Ethiopia mission officials,  the activity did not fund the construction of household latrines but  instead encouraged households to build their latrines with locally  available materials, in consistency with Ethiopian government policy.  Furthermore, mission officials noted that the reported results for this  activity were based on data from the Ethiopian government\u2019s Health  Management Information System, which uses an official Ethiopian  government definition of improved sanitation that is not consistent with  USAID\u2019s definition.", "In Indonesia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Zambia, respectively, the  reported beneficiaries of activities to increase access to improved  sanitation facilities included people who gained access to shared  facilities, such as school toilets. For example, the Zambia mission  reported that more than 133,000 people gained access to an  improved sanitation facility in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 as a  result of the activity focused on increasing WASH access in schools.  However, according to USAID guidance, shared sanitation facilities,  such as those in schools and hospitals, cannot be included in the  results to track progress on the number of people gaining access to  improved sanitation facilities, because this indicator is assessed at the  household level. According to officials at the Zambia mission, the data  they reported included the entire population of schools where  sanitation facilities were built; moreover, the ratio of population to  sanitation facility exceeded the national standards. Mission officials  noted that they focused on schools rather than households because  the mission\u2019s WASH efforts are aimed at improving the environment in  schools to improve education outcomes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Evaluations of Selected USAID WASH Activities Were Generally Sound", "paragraphs": ["While we found limitations in the monitoring of several of the 16 activities  we reviewed, the WASH activity evaluations that we assessed were, in  general, sufficiently reliable and methodologically sound for their intended  purposes. Ten of the 14 evaluations in our review assessed 9 of the 16  activities that we selected to examine monitoring. As noted previously in  this report, performance monitoring and evaluation are separate activities;  evaluations entail collection of additional information from sources that  may be different from sources of monitoring data. For example,  evaluators of the Ethiopia mission\u2019s primary WASH activity selected a  random sample of 6 out of 41 activity sites and obtained information  through focus groups with potential beneficiaries, interviews with local  government officials, and personal observation of new or rehabilitated  water sources. The evaluators used monitoring data where it was  available for one indicator (final target and final performance data for  beneficiaries gaining access to an improved water source) but  independently collected data via surveys to assess the results of hygiene  and sanitation component for which the implementer established a final  target but did not report on annual targets or performance data. This  example also illustrates that while evaluations are distinct from  monitoring, they can fill some gaps in monitoring information. (See app. III  for USAID\u2019s evaluation findings related to monitoring, outcomes, and  sustainability.)", "We assessed 14 evaluations of USAID\u2019s WASH-related activities\u20142  baseline evaluations, 6 midterm evaluations, and 7 final evaluations\u2014that  were conducted in fiscal years 2012 through 2014 in the nine selected  countries. We assessed the methodological quality of these evaluations  on the basis of established evaluation principles, including the  appropriateness of the evaluation design; clarity of population selection;  clarity of data collection; and adequacy of support for findings,  conclusions, and recommendations.", "Of the 14 evaluations, 7 had clearly supported findings, conclusions,  and recommendations, while 5 had certain limitations in their support  for some findings, conclusions, or recommendations. These  limitations included insufficient details about data collection and  unclear or inappropriate criteria for population selection, given  research objectives. However, we determined that, while such  limitations can lead to unsupported findings and limit the usefulness of  findings, conclusions, and recommendations, the limitations in these 5  evaluations were either clearly stated or otherwise did not  substantially detract from the evaluations\u2019 overall purpose or utility.", "The 2 remaining evaluations had significant design limitations that  suggested a lack of appropriate support for at least one finding,  conclusion, or recommendation. For example, the sampling  approaches for these evaluations were problematic. Both evaluations  selected locations or participants on the basis of convenience, which  is a nongeneralizable sampling method. This approach was not  appropriate, because the evaluations\u2019 research questions were aimed  at generalizing to the entire population or establishing a baseline for  the future.", "Figure 8 shows the results of our assessment of the 14 evaluations of  USAID\u2019s WASH activities.", "We found that in some cases, USAID incorporated evaluation results to  improve activity monitoring. Our interviews with mission officials and  reviews of monitoring documents indicated that the selected USAID  missions modified ongoing or planned activities\u2014for at least 6 of the 10  we reviewed that had relevant evaluations\u2014on the basis of evaluation  results. For example, the midterm evaluation of the primary WASH  activity in Indonesia recommended reducing the activity\u2019s target of 40,000  households willing to pay for sanitation improvements, because of the  challenges involved in meeting this goal. As a result, the Indonesia  mission modified its agreement with the implementer and reduced the  target to 15,000 households. Mission officials noted that the midterm  evaluation also provided specific recommendations for future USAID  projects that would be taken into consideration during the design process  for follow-on WASH investments in Indonesia.", "Of the 7 final performance evaluations of WASH activities that we  reviewed, 3 were conducted before the activity\u2019s completion, 3 were  conducted within 1 month of the activity\u2019s completion, and 1 was  conducted within 3 months of the activity\u2019s completion. As a result, these  studies were not set up to allow for an assessment or the longer-term  sustainability of these projects. To enable assessments of activities\u2019  impact and sustainability, USAID has identified plans to conduct  evaluations for some WASH activities several years after project  completion. Specifically, USAID\u2019s Water Strategy notes that the agency  plans to conduct assessments of WASH sustainability beyond the typical  USAID project cycle and to provide support for issues that arise  subsequent to completion of WASH activities. Additionally, in an April  2014 document, USAID noted plans to increase its focus on sustaining  development outcomes by, among other things, conducting evaluations 3  to 5 years after project conclusion. According to USAID, such long-term  evaluations provide opportunities to explore the impact of interventions  and may contribute to a deeper understanding of programmatic risk."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2005, USAID has reported that millions have gained access to  improved drinking water and sanitation facilities as a result of its  assistance.

Nevertheless, these efforts are still in the early stages.", "However, limitations in some missions\u2019 monitoring and reporting for  WASH activities that we reviewed call into question USAID\u2019s ability to  reliably assess and report progress toward its strategic WASH goals.  Unless USAID identifies and addresses factors contributing to missions\u2019  inconsistent adherence to guidance regarding establishing annual targets  for key WASH indicators for all WASH activities and disaggregating  activity data by gender, USAID cannot reliably measure these activities\u2019  contributions to achieving WASH goals or toward gender equality and  women\u2019s empowerment.

USAID provided  written comments, which appear in appendix IV, as well as technical  comments that we incorporated as appropriate. State did not provide  comments.", "In its written comments, USAID generally concurred with our  recommendations and outlined steps it is taking to address our second  recommendation. Following are highlights of USAID\u2019s comments, with our  evaluation:  1.  USAID noted that our definition of \u201cobligations\u201d excludes bilateral  obligations that have not yet been sub-obligated at the mission-level  for WASH activities. As our report states, for the purposes of our  review, we defined obligations as orders placed, contracts awarded,  and similar transactions during a given period that will require  payments during the same or a future period. USAID categorizes  these as \u201csub-obligations,\u201d because it considers these funds to have  been obligated through a bilateral agreement with the host country.", "In reporting funding for nine selected missions\u2019 WASH activities, we  generally reported total allocations for WASH activities ongoing at  each mission in fiscal years 2012 through 2014, including, when  applicable, funding for years before fiscal year 2012 and through fiscal  year 2014. (State and USAID define allocations as the distribution of  resources to bureaus and operating units by foreign assistance  account.) We included obligations when USAID data did not show  WASH activity allocations.  2.  USAID stated that it develops targets through multiple processes and  that it had provided us with performance plans and reports, which  include future-year targets for missions. On the basis of USAID\u2019s  technical comments on our draft report, we revised our assessment to  acknowledge that the mission-wide performance management plans  and reports for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 included annual targets for  the two activities we had selected for Zambia (\u201cSchools Promoting  Learning Achievement through Sanitation and Hygiene\u201d and  \u201cPartnership for Integrated Social Marketing\u201d). Although we included  this information in response to USAID\u2019s comments, it is important to  note that neither the monitoring plans nor the annual reports for these  two activities included annual targets. According to USAID policy  (ADS ch. 203), activity-level monitoring plans feed into project-level  monitoring plans and mission-wide performance management plans.  Therefore, the absence of annual targets in activity-level monitoring  plans calls into question the completeness of the Zambia mission- wide performance management plan. Additionally, given that mission- wide performance plans and reports provide only aggregate target  and performance data, it may not be possible to identify activity- specific targets or performance data from these reports.  3.  USAID stated that our report does not reference certain key  documents that USAID had provided. Although USAID\u2019s letter does  not specify which key documents it is referring to, in its technical  comments, USAID refers to mission-wide performance plans and  reports and to State\u2019s annual Water Key Issue Definition guidance. In  our report, we refer to performance plans and reports as mission-level  annual reporting. In appendix I of our report, we also note that to  assess data reliability, we compared implementer reporting on an  activity with mission-level annual reporting for the nine selected  USAID missions. In addition, our report notes that we reviewed  State\u2019s annual Water Key Issue Definition guidance and assessed the  extent to which WASH activities in the nine missions generally  adhered to this guidance\u2019s requirement regarding activities for which  funds can be attributed to the congressional spending requirement for  water and sanitation. We described the content of State\u2019s guidance in  the background section of our report, where we added a footnote, in  response to USAID comments, to more clearly identify the guidance  documents we referred to.  4.  USAID stated that the inconsistencies identified in our draft report  pertaining to the inaccurate categorization of results were the  byproduct of isolated incidences of reporting against incorrect  indicators. We found inaccuracies in six of eight activities we reviewed  that reported on the standard indicator \u201cnumber of people gaining  access to an improved sanitation facility.\u201d While USAID\u2019s comments  confirmed these inaccuracies, the agency has not provided any  documentation or other support for its statement that they represent  isolated incidences.  5.  USAID stated that missions are allowed to use custom indicators to  track results against water-directive funded activities. We did not  intend to imply that use of custom indicators was not in compliance  with State and USAID requirements. While we assessed the selected  missions\u2019 use of a number of WASH indicators to track progress for  16 selected activities, our review focused in particular on the standard  indicators for access to improved water source and improved  sanitation. As our report notes, State and USAID have reported  overall progress on WASH using these two indicators, and USAID\u2019s  Water and Development Strategy (2013-2018) uses these two  indicators to project numbers of beneficiaries during the strategy\u2019s 5- year period (i.e., at least 10 million persons would receive sustainable  access to improved water supply and 6 million persons would receive  sustainable access to improved sanitation). Nevertheless, in our  report\u2019s background section, we include a table of standard and  custom indicators that USAID allows missions to use in reporting on  results of WASH activities. Additionally, on the basis of a follow-up  discussion with USAID, we understand that the agency was  particularly concerned that our report might seem to imply that its  Indonesia mission\u2019s use of a custom indicator for verifying households  for the mission\u2019s Water Hibah activity was not in compliance with  agency guidance. As a result, we have added a note to figure 6 to  clarify that USAID guidance allows missions the flexibility to report  using custom indicators.  6. USAID noted that it informed us that verification information could be found in data quality assessments and site visit reports from missions such as Senegal. During our audit work, after the mission informed us that it had conducted verification of beneficiaries through these assessments, we requested data quality assessments from the USAID mission in Senegal. However, the mission did not provide these assessments to us. In the absence of documentation of verification of beneficiaries, we maintain that it is unclear whether the mission verified the number of beneficiaries gaining access to an improved water source.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the USAID Administrator, and the Secretary of State.

We selected these countries from the list of 22  countries that USAID designated as priority countries for WASH  assistance in fiscal year 2014. We based our country selection primarily  on the amounts of funding that the missions in these countries attributed  to the congressional spending requirement for international water and  sanitation assistance in fiscal years 2012 through 2013. During that  period, WASH assistance in the 9 selected countries accounted for 53  percent\u2014$155 million\u2014of the funding attributed to the spending  requirement by the missions in all tier 1 and tier 2 priority countries. To  address our three reporting objectives, we interviewed USAID and  Department of State (State) officials and conducted semi-structured  telephone interviews with officials at the nine USAID missions regarding  their efforts to plan, monitor, and evaluate WASH activities. Because we  judgmentally selected the nine USAID missions for our review, our  findings from these interviews cannot be generalized to all USAID  missions. In addition, we conducted fieldwork in Tanzania and Ethiopia  from January 26, 2015, to February 6, 2015. We selected these countries  for fieldwork based on factors such as level of funding and type of WASH  activities implemented in each country. For example, the Ethiopia mission  attributed the most funding to the congressional spending requirement in  fiscal years 2012 through 2013 for a range of WASH activities, and the  Tanzania mission has implemented one long-standing (since 2009)  primary activity focused on WASH.", "To describe the types of WASH activities that USAID has implemented  and the funding it has provided for these activities, we developed a data  collection instrument to obtain funding data and descriptive information  from each mission regarding its WASH activities that were ongoing or  planned during fiscal years 2012 through 2014. Each mission\u2019s total  funding for WASH activities generally represents allocations for WASH  components of activities that were ongoing at the mission at any time in  fiscal years 2012 through 2014, including, when applicable, WASH  funding for years before fiscal year 2012 and through fiscal year 2014.  We included obligations in cases for which USAID was not able to provide  allocations for WASH activities, such as when a USAID mission obligated  unplanned funding to an activity for WASH. To assess the reliability of  the data and information we obtained, we reviewed documentation and  interviewed agency officials to identify and correct any missing data and  any errors. We determined that the data and information we gathered  were sufficiently reliable to provide general information about the types of  activities implemented and approximate funding provided for these  activities.", "To assess the extent to which USAID guidance informed planning and  implementation of WASH activities, we reviewed USAID guidance,  mission-level WASH plans, and other documents. We reviewed USAID  guidance including: (1) USAID\u2019s Automated Directives System (ADS),  chapter 201, which contains agency policies and procedures and includes  guidance on strategic planning and project and activity design; (2)  USAID\u2019s Water and Development Strategy, 2013-2018 (Water Strategy);  and (3) USAID\u2019s Water and Development Strategy Implementation Field  Guide (Field Guide). We assessed the status of the USAID missions\u2019  efforts to develop WASH plans, steps that they have taken to implement  these plans, and steps that they have taken to adopt the Water Strategy\u2019s  principles and approach for their recent or planned WASH activities.  Missions\u2019 WASH plans may consist of one or more project appraisal  documents (PAD), which document a project\u2019s design and expected  results, as well as a WASH sector assessment or other related  documents that describe the mission\u2019s strategic approach to WASH. To  assess steps that missions have taken to address sustainability, we  reviewed documents that included PADs and sustainability assessments;  we also reviewed award documents for selected activities.", "We generally selected two activities per country on the basis of factors  such as the level of funding allocated and types of WASH activities  implemented in fiscal years 2012 through 2014. We based our activity  selection on funding data reported in State\u2019s Foreign Assistance  Coordination and Tracking System for fiscal years 2012 and 2013, data  included in missions\u2019 operational plans for fiscal year 2014, and  discussions with mission officials about their WASH activities between  fiscal years 2012 through 2014. The activities we selected included those  to which the missions in the selected countries had allocated the largest  amounts of WASH funding, with one exception: In Uganda, the selected  activities did not include the Uganda mission\u2019s activity that received the  largest allocations of WASH funding in fiscal years 2012 through 2014,  because the mission had allocated the majority of funding for its largest  WASH activity before fiscal year 2012, did not initially inform us of this  activity, and did not provide the prior-year funding data until after we had  made our activity selection. We selected one activity in Tanzania,  because the Tanzania mission implemented only one primary WASH  activity during the period we reviewed. We initially selected three WASH  activities in Haiti. However, the Haiti mission subsequently informed us  that two of the selected activities did not have a WASH component and  that the mission had incorrectly attributed WASH funds to these activities  and planned to take corrective action to ensure use of attributed funds for  WASH. As a result, we reviewed one WASH activity for Haiti.", "To assess monitoring of WASH activities in the nine countries, we  obtained and analyzed documentation for selected WASH activities,  including award agreements and modifications, performance  management plans, monitoring and evaluation plans, quarterly and  annual monitoring reports, and annual funding data. We compared  monitoring plans with quarterly and annual reports to determine whether  specific WASH indicators had been identified for the activity. Since  several activities had multiple WASH indicators, we focused our analysis  on standard indicators related to water, sanitation, or hygiene that were  used to monitor the activity. When an activity\u2019s monitoring plans included  no standard WASH indicators, we identified at least one activity indicator  related to access to water, access to sanitation, or hygiene improvement,  as relevant. For the purposes of this report, we refer to the indicators that  we identified for our review as key WASH indicators. We reviewed each  activity\u2019s monitoring plan and monitoring reports to determine whether (1)  annual targets were identified for the key WASH indicators and (2) results  or performance data for each key WASH indicator were reported on an  annual basis, if applicable. Further, we reviewed monitoring reports to  assess whether they included gender-disaggregated data for indicators  on number of people gaining access to an improved drinking water  source or number of people gaining access to an improved sanitation  facility. We compared the reported performance data for three key WASH  indicators\u2014number of people gaining access to improved drinking water  source, number of people gaining access to an improved sanitation  facility, and number of liters of drinking water disinfected with point-of-use  treatment products as a result of U.S. government assistance\u2014with  USAID and State\u2019s guidance for these indicators to assess the extent to  which the reported data conformed to the definitions in the guidance  document. Although USAID and State guidance required verification of  estimated beneficiaries for the indicator for access to an improved water  source, the guidance did not require verification of estimated numbers of  liters of water purified. In addition to assessing activity performance data  against agency guidance, we conducted internal consistency checks to  assess the reliability of reported data. For example, to the extent feasible,  we compared implementer reporting on an activity with mission-level  annual reporting and USAID-wide annual reporting on WASH indicators.  Because we found data inconsistencies for several activities, as noted in  the report, we did not use the performance data to report the extent to  which activities met intended targets.", "To assess USAID evaluations for WASH activities in the nine countries,  we selected all evaluations for WASH activities completed in fiscal years  2012 through 2014. We identified 14 completed evaluations, including  evaluations for 10 of the 16 activities we selected to assess monitoring.  To assess the soundness of the evaluations, we reviewed background  information about programs and evaluation questions, assessed  evaluation design and process, and considered the evaluation results and  limitations of each study. Two GAO specialists conducted these  assessments independently, using a tool that incorporated key elements  of USAID\u2019s scope-of-work checklist for evaluations and considered  various aspects of these issues. The two specialists compared the results  of their independent assessments and came to agreement about all  conclusions. We did not assess selected USAID missions\u2019 compliance  with the requirement to conduct evaluations.", "To review background information about the evaluated programs, we  considered whether the evaluations considered evaluator  independence, program objectives and mechanisms, and evaluation  goals.
