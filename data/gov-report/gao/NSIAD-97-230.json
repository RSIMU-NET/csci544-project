We also analyzed OPIC\u2019s risk assessment policies and financial reports and discussed risk mitigation strategies with private and public providers of project finance. Project financing involves lending for major projects where the assurance of repayment is provided through the project\u2019s structure and anticipated future revenues rather than through sovereign (that is, national government) or other forms of guarantees. In some cases, the public sector provides investment support to investors in these projects.

In carrying out this responsibility, OPIC took over the investment guarantee and promotion functions of the U.S. Agency for International Development. In the early 1970s, the U.S. approach to foreign assistance began to shift from one of providing government aid for infrastructure building and large capital projects to providing assistance to meet basic human needs. OPIC\u2019s role was to support market-oriented private investment in various sectors.", "More recently, the World Bank has estimated that $200 billion would be needed annually over the next 10 years to meet the infrastructure needs of developing countries. Obtaining this level of private investment will be a major challenge given the economic and political characteristics of emerging markets and the unique risks inherent in each project. Project financing is emerging as an important component in infrastructure development.", "OPIC\u2019s programs are designed to promote overseas investment and assume some of the associated risks for investors. Specifically, OPIC offers direct loans and loan guarantees to U.S.-sponsored joint ventures abroad, supports private investment funds that provide equity for projects abroad, and provides political risk insurance to U.S. investors. The political risk insurance covers investors for up to 20 years against losses due to currency inconvertibility, political violence, and expropriation. OPIC collects premiums and fees from the private sector for insurance and financing services. OPIC finance and insurance activities are backed by the full faith and credit of the U. S. government and are limited to a total exposure of $23 billion in fiscal year 1997. OPIC services are available in some 140 developing countries, although OPIC does not operate in some countries, largely for U.S. foreign policy reasons.", "Projects eligible for OPIC assistance include new investments, privatizations, and expansions or modernization of existing plants. The sectors OPIC supports include power, financial services, telecommunications, and oil and gas. To obtain OPIC support, investors must meet specific criteria, including U.S. ownership requirements.", "Over the years, Congress has placed various requirements on OPIC\u2019s authority to support U.S. investment. For example, in carrying out its activities, OPIC is to administer its entire portfolio (financing, insurance, and reinsurance operations) on a self-sustaining basis and in a manner that ensures that the projects it supports are economically and financially sound; refuse support for any investment in countries that are not taking steps to adopt and implement internationally recognized worker rights; and decline participation in investments that are likely to significantly reduce U.S. domestic employment levels or pose an unreasonable or major environmental, health, or safety hazard."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Global Changes Have Reduced the Private Sector\u2019s Perception of Risk, Yet Public Support Still Sought in Some Markets", "paragraphs": ["A changing global environment has reduced the perception of risk for the investors we spoke with in emerging markets. Economic growth and liberalization have created investment opportunities in sectors that were previously dominated by government-owned companies or were simply off limits to foreign investors. Many countries, for example, have privatized their power and telecommunication sectors and enacted laws that permit foreign ownership, resulting in dramatic increases in foreign investment. More recently, private providers of project finance and political risk insurance are increasingly available to assist investors. However, according to many of the firms we surveyed, markets still exist where they are unable to obtain private finance or insurance services. As a consequence, they seek public support.

Private flows going to infrastructure reflect these overall increases, particularly in commercial lending devoted to project finance. According to a 1996 International Finance Corporation report, these private infrastructure investments would not have seemed possible 10 years ago.

(See app. II, which identifies features of the services provided by the major public providers of political risk insurance.) Lloyd\u2019s of London, the American Insurance Group, and Exporters Insurance Corporation\u2014three major private insurers\u2014have recently increased their insurance coverage.", "Globally, public providers have increased investor coverage. According to the Berne Union, new investments insured by its members rose annually between 1991 and 1996, going from $7.1 billion to $15.2 billion. As of the end of 1996, the cumulative amount of investment covered by Berne Union members was $43.4 billion. According to data collected directly from the major public providers of political risk insurance, Japan led all public providers with $13.9 billion in cumulative exposure. OPIC was second with $13.4 billion in exposure, and the German public provider was third with $7.8 billion in exposure. These public insurers have traditionally dominated the public risk insurance market. Although the major public providers generally offer investment services in the same countries, each of the major providers\u2019 business tends to concentrate in different markets. OPIC, for example, concentrates in Latin America, the Japanese in Asia, and the Germans in Asia/Pacific and Central and Eastern Europe. (See app. III for available information on the regional concentration of major public insurance providers.) Investors are also assisted by other Berne Union members, including the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, a multilateral institution affiliated with the World Bank Group, with about $3.9 billion in exposure reported in 1997.", "The level of coverage of privately provided political risk insurance has increased considerably over the past 2 years, according to the private insurers we spoke with. Although the volume of coverage provided by private insurers is difficult to determine, a political risk insurance expert estimated that several billion dollars of private political insurance coverage was provided in 1996. According to the American Insurance Group, one of the largest private providers of political risk insurance, it increased the length of its coverage from a maximum of 3 years to a cap of 7 years in 1996. Additionally, ACE, Inc., a private insurance provider, recently entered into a reinsurance contract with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, providing up to 15 years of risk coverage on the same terms as that agency. However, according to officials of a large commercial bank and a private political risk insurer, in some risky markets private insurers are only willing to provide insurance when a public sector entity is involved in the project. A private insurer we spoke to said his company had not provided coverage in Russia and most of the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union.", "Public and private sources also provide financing in developing countries. Public providers include OPIC; the International Finance Corporation, a multilateral institution affiliated with the World Bank Group; the U.S. Eximbank; and other bilateral credit agencies, such as the Japanese Export-Import bank. Private sector financing to developing countries is available through commercial banks and other private financial institutions. According to the World Bank, this source of financing has increased significantly during the 1990s, with about one-half of these resources directed toward project financing for infrastructure development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Determines Whether Investors Seek Public or Private Finance and Insurance", "paragraphs": ["Investors\u2019, private lenders\u2019, and insurers\u2019 perception of risk frames how projects are structured and financed. The risks assumed and the type of support sought by investors can differ by project and by sector. For example, based on the projects identified in our survey, more telecommunications projects were completed without public support and with investor self-insurance than were power projects. Power plants are costly and can take 10 years or longer to recoup the investment costs, according to an energy firm official we interviewed, making plant assets and income subject to long-term political risks. Telecommunications projects, on the other hand, may generate enough income to cover investment costs in just a few years.", "Investors we surveyed told us that over the past decade, several Latin American, East Asian, and East European countries have taken steps to create environments attractive to investors. Specifically, 22 of the 34 firms we spoke to were comfortable with assuming investment risks after they had been successful in a country for a period of time. For example, one telecommunications company that is developing cellular telephone operations in Hungary told us that the availability of OPIC political risk insurance was a critical factor in its initial decision to invest $200 million when privatization allowed the company to enter the market. After 2 years, however, the company reassessed the political and economic risks of this investment and decided to drop its OPIC insurance in favor of self-insurance. A company with 10 projects in Poland told us that it developed 9 cable projects with private investment after completing 1 successful project in Poland that was financed by OPIC 5 years ago when private financing was not available. In another example, a power company that has used OPIC in other high-risk markets has made acquisitions of privatized public utilities in Argentina and Chile without official support by obtaining financing from European financial markets and locally syndicated money. Officials of the International Finance Corporation confirmed that investors are increasingly likely to cancel International Finance Corporation loans as lower-priced private financing becomes more available in lower-risk markets.", "Despite these trends, some markets are still considered high risk by investors, lenders, and private insurance companies. Thus, obtaining commercial finance and insurance in these markets remains difficult, according to private firms we surveyed. Several of the power and telecommunications companies we surveyed concurred with the assessment that in several regions of the world, including Africa, Russia, the other newly independent states of the former Soviet Union, and Central America, the perception of risk remains high. Some companies told us that they are generally unable to raise the necessary financing for transactions in high-risk countries without public support. For example, four firms that we spoke to that invested in Russia or Ukraine said that private finance was unavailable for their projects. One telecommunications company with investments in Russia and Ukraine stated that without OPIC political risk insurance, it would have avoided these high-risk markets. A power company with a $150-million equity investment in El Salvador covered by OPIC political risk insurance told us that the availability of OPIC services was a key factor in the company\u2019s decision to invest in the country. According to an official from this company, although it considers Guatemala to have great potential for the industry, private financial institutions and insurance companies still consider Guatemala to be high risk, and the company will not go forward with projects in Guatemala without OPIC or other public support. Additionally, private lenders and insurance companies we spoke with told us that they offer limited, if any, services in higher-risk markets such as the newly independent states of the former Soviet Union. Officials at the major international banks we visited noted that they are reluctant to lend in high-risk markets without some form of political risk insurance and that the private insurance companies often cannot provide the kind of insurance lenders need in these markets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "U.S. Investors Obtain Public Support in Some Non-OPIC Markets", "paragraphs": ["In countries where OPIC services are not available due to U.S. foreign policy or operational reasons, such as Mexico, China, Pakistan, and Vietnam, we found that most of the U.S. investors we interviewed often seek other forms of public support to facilitate investment. As is the case in other emerging markets, investors\u2019 decisions to invest in a project were predicated on their perceived risk. Our survey of U.S. investors showed that when U.S. firms believed they needed public investment support in a non-OPIC country, they sought investment support from the U.S. Eximbank or other foreign export credit agencies or multilateral financial institutions. Although such support facilitates the original investment, subsequent equipment and service procurements are often tied to the countries providing the support. Thus, if foreign export credit agencies provide the support, U.S. suppliers could be excluded.", "In some non-OPIC markets, such as Mexico, U.S. investors may not always seek public support. According to a telecommunications company official, several risk mitigation factors enabled the company to make a $1-billion investment in Mexico without political risk insurance or other official participation in the project. Mexico\u2019s historical and geographical relationship to the United States, trends in Mexico\u2019s economic performance, the potential for free trade, and the contractual commitment of high-level government officials and the Mexican Central Bank, along with the company\u2019s confidence in its Mexican partner, all helped lower the company\u2019s perception of risk. In contrast, a $644-million power project in Mexico is being undertaken by U.S. investors facilitated by a $477-million U.S. Eximbank loan, $28 million in U.S. Eximbank political risk insurance during construction, and a $75-million Inter-American Development Bank loan.", "In China, companies have entered into joint ventures with local companies that are affiliated with provincial governments, which lowers investor perception of risk. Depending on the size of the project, these companies were more likely to obtain a portion of their financing from multilateral institutions or foreign official sources. For example, one power company with several recent joint ventures in China financed smaller-sized projects (under $30 million) without public support. However, the same company is finalizing a $1.6-billion project and is obtaining support from the U.S. Eximbank and Hermes, Germany\u2019s export credit agency. The opportunities presented by China\u2019s large market potential may increase investors\u2019 willingness to do business there despite the perceived risk.", "In other markets where OPIC is not available, the U.S. firms we surveyed have used the services of multilateral agencies or export credit agencies.One telecommunications company mitigated its risk in Pakistan by obtaining guarantees and political risk insurance from the International Finance Corporation and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. Because OPIC was not available in Vietnam, a U.S. power firm used the Asian Development Bank and Coface (the French export credit agency) to finance a $160-million power plant.", "U.S. investors\u2019 use of investment support from sources other than OPIC may affect the source of procurements. Multilateral institutions generally do not tie their support to buying equipment from a particular country. However, some U.S. firms told us that they were unable to use U.S. suppliers when they obtained support from foreign export credit agencies. In testimony before Congress, an official of a large U.S. company testified that her company utilized or planned to use German, Japanese, or French equipment for projects in China, Pakistan, and Vietnam because the company obtained investment support from German, Japanese, and French export credit agencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "OPIC\u2019s Revenues Have Exceeded Its Losses, but Global Changes May Present Opportunities for OPIC to Further Reduce Portfolio Risk", "paragraphs": ["Historically, OPIC has been self-sustaining, generating substantial revenues from its finance and insurance programs and its investments that together have been sufficient to cover actual losses.

In 1994, OPIC raised the maximum amount of insurance and finance coverage it offers on a given project, a step that increases the government\u2019s exposure to loss but may not negatively affect the quality of OPIC\u2019s portfolio. Notwithstanding OPIC\u2019s track record, the private sector\u2019s willingness to have greater involvement in some developing countries has created opportunities for OPIC to take steps to further reduce the risk associated with its portfolio through greater risk-sharing.

OPIC has documented only 12 of 1,392 contracts that it has coinsured with the private sector since 1988."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Sharing", "paragraphs": ["A third risk mitigation strategy may be to reduce the coverage and terms of OPIC\u2019s insurance program. OPIC currently offers standard 20-year insurance with 90 percent coverage of the value of the insured assets.One potential option would be that OPIC could insure less than 90 percent of the value of each investment. OPIC\u2019s rationale for insuring 90 percent, rather than 100 percent, of the value of the assets is to ensure that the investor or project sponsor has an incentive to manage its assets prudently. Another option would be for OPIC to offer less than 20-year coverage. For example, rather than providing its current 20-year standard policy, OPIC could offer a standard 15-year term, as is the practice with other public insurers, and provide 20-year cover only in certain cases. Lastly, OPIC could require that the insured hold OPIC coverage for a minimum of 3 years. These measures would lower the value of assets covered, the length of coverage, and potentially the cost of coverage.", "Regarding the risk-sharing option, OPIC officials said that reducing the coverage level below 90 percent would have an adverse impact on small businesses and might lead U.S. investors to seek insurance support from foreign or multilateral sources that provide 90-percent coverage. They also noted that it might not be practical to make a project sponsor hold the coverage longer than he or she thinks is necessary or prevent him or her from seeking alternative sources of insurance. However, since a reduction in coverage is likely to come with a reduction in price, U.S. investors might continue to seek OPIC coverage.", "OPIC officials acknowledged that reinsurance, coinsurance, and greater risk sharing may be sound risk management options, but are not without trade-offs. For example, reinsurance may reduce OPIC\u2019s income from premiums because OPIC would have to pay premiums to the reinsurer. Furthermore, OPIC takes on the credit risks of the reinsurer.

One major U.S. foreign policy goal is to assist Russia in its transition toward a free market economy. According to OPIC officials, by entering into OPIC\u2019s bilateral agreement in 1992, Russia began to establish the conditions necessary for attracting private investment. Further, OPIC operates to promote development strategies that are consistent with internationally recognized worker rights. For example, OPIC ceased operations in the Republic of Korea in 1991, due to concerns over worker rights, including the arrest and imprisonment of labor union leaders.", "OPIC\u2019s involvement in Russia was initially quite cautious, as it offered only coverage for expropriation and political violence. OPIC officials noted that as conditions improved in Russia, OPIC began offering coverage for currency inconvertibility risk.

To identify the recent developments in the volume and types of investment support provided by the public and private sectors for investments overseas, we obtained and compared information from (1) five large private providers of political risk insurance; and (2) the largest public providers of investment support representing France, Germany, Japan, Canada, Italy, the United Kingdom, and the United States. (see app. II) and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency. We also discussed with the Berne Union information on the nature of political risk insurance and the role and capability of the public and private sectors. We obtained total insurance exposure data directly from the Group of Seven (G-7)insurance providers. Regarding financing, we obtained information from major financial institutions that provide financing to U.S. investors, including the Chase Manhattan Bank and Citibank, and the International Finance Corporation. We also discussed the international finance environment with Standard & Poor\u2019s Ratings Services and Moody\u2019s Investors Service, two large financial rating agencies. An important component of our analysis of private sector investment was the identification of the kinds of investment services U.S. investors have utilized in various developing countries or economies in transition as well as countries in which OPIC is not open for business (for example, China and Mexico). To obtain this information, we surveyed a judgmental sample of 34 U.S. investors that had made major investments within the last  5 years in the power and telecommunications sectors. We selected the power and telecommunications sectors because they (1) are listed as the major sectors of growth in emerging markets and (2) represented two of the four largest sectors supported by OPIC. Since these sectors have considerably different resource requirements and risks, their inclusion allowed us to make several important distinctions regarding the investment environments in which they operate.", "To survey firms in the power and telecommunications sectors operating overseas, we (1) reviewed relevant literature including the Directory of American Firms Operating in Foreign Countries and U.S. Security and Exchange Commission data, (2) contacted appropriate Department of Commerce officials, (3) reviewed OPIC\u2019s annual reports that list overseas investors, and (4) asked the firms contacted to identify their major competitors.

The points that OPIC highlights are there own interpretation of our analyses. Several points discussed by OPIC, such as the health of their reserves, filling a commercial void and the impact of its activities on U.S. employment, are not our specific conclusions. Rather, the report provides factual information and our analysis of the trends in private sector investment, the public sector\u2019s role in emerging markets, OPIC\u2019s portfolio and risk management strategy, and issues to be addressed if OPIC were not reauthorized. 2. Information in the report on OPIC\u2019s risk management strategy is not restricted to a discussion of how OPIC limits exposure in any one country or sector. The report also includes a discussion of OPIC\u2019s pre-approval review process and underwriting guidelines. Appendixes IV and V contain information on the application, approval, and monitoring processes for the insurance and finance programs. 3. Although the report notes that the larger finance projects tend to be less risky than smaller projects, we do not agree that the same is necessarily true for OPIC\u2019s insurance projects. Financing involves commercial risks that well-capitalized and experienced private participants have greater influence in mitigating. However, political risk insurance only covers actions taken by governments\u2014actions that are less within the control of the private sector. 4. The report discusses only the recent growth in privately provided political risk insurance. The extent to which the private market capacity for political risk insurance would be affected by changes in demand for property/casualty coverage is not certain. 5. We recognize that OPIC has in some cases pursued the risk mitigation options discussed in the report. However, we believe that the private sector\u2019s current high level of interest in investing in emerging markets has created opportunities for OPIC to further reduce portfolio risk through greater use of the options presented. 6. The report provides OPIC data that show 18 (now 12) cases since 1988 in which OPIC coinsured with the private sector. Although there may be other cases in which the private sector provided insurance to investors also insured by OPIC, this information is more anecdotal and these instances would not represent cases in which OPIC formally sought to coinsure with the private sector. 7. We revised the report to reflect that any loss that was covered by a drawdown in reserves (that are comprised of Treasury securities) would become a budgetary outlay. However, we do not agree that such an outlay should then be compared to the offsetting collections that OPIC receives. If it were necessary for OPIC to redeem Treasury securities, then it would need more cash to cover losses than it would be taking in. 8. The report states that under the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990, agencies are to estimate and budget for long-term costs of their credit programs on a present value basis. Subsidy costs arise when the estimated program disbursements by the government exceed the estimated payments to the government on a present value basis. The subsidy cost data in our report are based on OPIC\u2019s reported estimates. In order to show lower subsidy costs, the costs must be reestimated, with key factors such as the credit risk of the borrowing country showing improvement. OPIC identified $72 million in subsidy costs for fiscal year 1997 programs.", "With regard to OPIC\u2019s statement about its interest earnings, only those earnings properly allocable to its credit program are relevant to the discussion of its credit subsidy estimates. Under credit reform requirements, interest earned on credit-related reserves is required to be included in estimating the subsidy cost. 9. We modified the report to include this information. 10.
