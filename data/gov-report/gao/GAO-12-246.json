A challenging aspect of export control enforcement is the detection of illicit transshipments\u0097the transfer of items from place of origin through an intermediary country to an unauthorized destination, such as Iran. In 2010, the President announced reforms to the U.S. export control system to address weaknesses found by GAO and others. GAO was asked to address how the export control enforcement agencies allocate resources, as well as the challenges they face and the potential impact of export control reform on enforcement activities. GAO reviewed documents and met with enforcement agency officials as well as with U.S. and foreign government and company officials in Hong Kong, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates, which have a high volume of trade and have been identified as potential hubs for illicit transshipments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Agencies use a risk-based approach, including workload and threat assessment data, to allocate resources, but most do not fully track those used for export control enforcement activities. As their missions are broader than export controls, agencies can use staff resources for other activities based on need, making tracking resources used solely for export control enforcement difficult. Only Commerce\u0092s Office of Export Enforcement allocates its resources exclusively to export control enforcement as that is its primary mission. Other agencies, such as State and the Treasury, have relatively few export control enforcement staff to track. While several agencies acknowledge the need to better track export enforcement resources and have taken steps to do so, they do not know the full extent of their use of these resources and do not use this information in resource allocation decisions. In some cities, agencies are informally leveraging export enforcement resources through voluntarily created local task forces that bring together enforcement resources to work collectively on export control cases.", "Enforcement agencies face several challenges in investigating illicit transshipments, both domestically and overseas, which potentially reduce the effectiveness of enforcement activities and limit the identification and investigation of illicit transshipments.

Investigative agencies lack measures of effectiveness that fully reflect the complexity and qualitative benefits of export control cases.", "Some of these challenges may be addressed by ongoing export control reform initiatives, but reform presents both opportunities and challenges. Revising the control list could simplify the license determination process, but could also result in the need for increased enforcement activity overseas to validate the recipient of the items as fewer items may require U.S. government approval in advance of shipment. As most staff located overseas have other agency and mission-related priorities, their availability may be limited. The newly created national Export Enforcement Coordination Center is intended to help agencies coordinate their export control enforcement efforts as well as share intelligence and law enforcement information related to these efforts. However, it is unclear whether the center will address all of the challenges GAO found, as detailed plans for its operations are under development."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Commerce, DHS, Justice, and State take steps individually and with other agencies through the national Export Enforcement Coordination Center to better manage export control enforcement resources and improve the license determination process.

The U.S. government protects these items through  its export control system to ensure that they are transferred to foreign  parties in a manner consistent with U.S. interests. The current system is  governed by a complex set of laws, regulations, and processes and is  implemented by multiple agencies, some with overlapping jurisdiction.  Enforcement, a key function in the system, strives to prevent or deter the  illegal export of defense and dual-use items such as controlled  components that were shipped to countries like Iran, which were later  found in weapons and devices used against U.S. forces in Iraq. Export  control enforcement activities include inspecting items to be exported,  investigating potential export control violations, and pursuing and  imposing criminal and administrative penalties against violators. These  activities also seek to keep defense and dual-use items from being illicitly  transshipped through intermediary countries or locations, such as the  United Arab Emirates (UAE), Hong Kong, Singapore, and Malaysia,  where a high volume of trade provides potential opportunities for the illicit  transshipment of export-controlled items to an unauthorized final  destination, such as Iran.transshipment is the transfer of merchandise from its place of origin  through an intermediary country to an unauthorized destination. For  example, in September 2011, a Pakistani citizen pleaded guilty to  conspiring to commit export violations in connection with a scheme to  illegally export U.S. nuclear-related materials, by exporting these  materials from the United States through the UAE, to several restricted  entities in Pakistan. The Department of State and other federal agencies  have recognized illicit transshipment as a major weakness in trade and  national security.", "For the purposes of this report, illicit  In 2006, we found that U.S. export control enforcement agencies faced  considerable challenges and made several recommendations to improve  interagency coordination, and we continue to include the U.S. export  control system as a key component of a GAO high risk area on protecting  technologies critical to U.S. national security interests. Noting challenges  in the entire U.S. export control system, in April 2010, the President  announced a reform strategy that included the creation of a single export  enforcement coordination agency as a primary forum where agencies can  coordinate and enhance export control enforcement efforts and resolve  conflicts. However, some members of Congress have raised questions  about existing export control activities including resources agencies are  devoting to these activities. Moreover, they have expressed concerns that  without addressing existing enforcement problems, reform of the export  control system could exacerbate current shortfalls in the system designed  to prevent countries and entities of concern from obtaining sensitive U.S.  defense and dual-use items. In response to your request, we identified (1)  how agencies allocate staff resources for export control enforcement  activities, and (2) challenges that agencies face in investigating illicit  transshipments and the potential impact of export control reform initiatives  on enforcement activities.", "To conduct our work, we reviewed laws, regulations, and guidelines  relating to the enforcement of U.S. export controls on defense and dual- use items and interviewed officials from the Departments of Commerce,  Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Justice, State, and the  Treasury as well as private industry and foreign government officials. We  also visited agency headquarters as well as three domestic and three  international locations to obtain and analyze information on resources,  knowledge of illicit transshipments, and challenges in investigating export  controls for criminal violations. We corroborated information on resources  with agency budget and other documents where possible. The domestic  locations, Baltimore, MD; Los Angeles, CA; and San Francisco, CA;  represent one or more of the following: a large percentage of the  investigative caseload, ports with a high volume of trade of U.S.  commodities, and a large presence of aerospace, electronics, and  software industries and geographic dispersion. The international  locations, Hong Kong, Singapore, and the UAE, represent three of the top  10 ports in the world for trade volume and have been identified by federal  agency officials as potential hubs for illicit transshipments of defense and  dual-use items.

Investigations of  potential export control violations involving defense items are conducted  by ICE and FBI agents. OEE and ICE are authorized to investigate  potential violations of dual-use items. ICE is also authorized to investigate  potential violations of defense items. The FBI has authority to investigate  any criminal violation of law not exclusively assigned to another agency,  and is mandated to investigate and oversee export control violations with  a counterintelligence concern. The investigative agencies have various  tools for investigating potential violations (see table 2) and establishing  cases for potential criminal or administrative punitive actions.", "Punitive actions, which are either criminal or administrative, are taken  against violators of export control laws and regulations, and may involve  U.S. or foreign individuals and companies. Criminal violations are those  cases where the evidence shows that the exporter willfully violated export  control laws. U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Offices prosecute export control  enforcement criminal cases in consultation with Justice\u2019s National  Security Division. These cases can result in imprisonment, fines,  forfeitures, and other penalties. Punitive actions for administrative  violations can include fines, suspension of an export license, or denial or  debarment from exporting, and are imposed primarily by State or  Commerce, depending on whether the violation involves the export of a  defense or a dual-use item. For example, Commerce can impose the  administrative sanction of placing parties acting contrary to the national  security or foreign policy interests of the United State on a list that  prevents their receipt of items subject to Commerce controls. The  Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) administers and  enforces economic sanctions programs primarily against countries and  groups of individuals, such as terrorists and narcotics traffickers. The  sanctions can be either comprehensive or selective, using the blocking of  assets and trade restrictions to accomplish foreign policy and national  security goals. In some cases, both criminal and administrative penalties  can be levied against an export control violator. In fiscal year 2010,  Justice data showed that 56 individuals or companies were convicted of  criminal violations of export control laws.and Commerce reported more than $25.4 million in administrative fines  and penalties for fiscal year 2010.

OEE also recently  completed a field office expansion study to decide which cities would  be the best locations for additional OEE field offices. In this study,  OEE considered the volume of licensed and unlicensed exports and  the type of high-tech items exported from different areas of the United  States, and concluded that Atlanta, GA; Cincinnati, OH; Phoenix, AZ;  and Portland, OR, were optimal locations, but has not received budget  approval for expansion.", "CBP reemphasized outbound operations in the creation of its  Outbound Enforcement Division in March 2009 to help prevent  terrorist groups, rogue nations, and other criminal organizations from  obtaining defense and dual-use commodities; enforce sanctions and  trade embargoes; and increase exporter compliance.

As of fiscal year 2010, CBP had allocated approximately  660 officers for outbound enforcement activities, but these officers can  be used for other than export control-related activities at any time,  when needed. For example, the Port of Baltimore has officers  assigned to perform outbound activities at both the airport and  seaport, some of which focus on the enforcement of controlled  shipments in the seaport environment. According to the Port Director,  any of these officers can be redirected at any time and often are  assigned to the airport during the busy airline arrival times, to perform  inbound inspection duties\u2014based on priorities. Further, CBP does not  track the hours that its officers across the country spend on export  control enforcement activities, but is in the process of implementing a  system to do so. CBP officials stated that determining the right mix of  officers is complex and changes to its tracking system should allow for  better planning and accounting for resources used for outbound  activities in the future.  ICE\u2019s Homeland Security Investigations, Counter-Proliferation  Investigations Unit focuses on preventing sensitive U.S. technologies  and weapons from reaching the hands of adversaries and conducts  export control investigations. To determine how many investigators it  should allocate to this unit, ICE uses information including operational  threat assessments and case data from the previous year, by field  office, on total numbers of arrests, indictments, convictions, seizures,  and investigative hours expended on export control investigations. For  example, it assigns a tier level for each of its 70 field offices, based on  threat assessments\u2014ranging from 1 for the highest threat, resulting in  a larger number of agents assigned to these offices; to 5 for the  lowest threat, with a lower number of agents assigned. To further  prioritize resources, in 2010, ICE established Counter Proliferation  Investigations Centers in selected cities throughout the United States,  with staff focused solely on combating illegal exports and illicit  procurement networks seeking to acquire vital U.S. technology. ICE  concluded that it needed to form these centers to combat the  specialized nature of complex export control cases and determined  that its previous method of distributing resources needed refinement,  noting that some ICE field office managers had difficulty in balancing  numerous competing programmatic priorities and initiatives.  According to ICE officials, they plan to mitigate these concerns by  having staff and facilities focused solely on export control enforcement  cases, which will allow ICE to track and use this information to better  determine future resource needs.", "The FBI, with both an investigative and intelligence mission, does not  allocate resources solely for export control enforcement and officials  told us they view these activities as a tool to gain intelligence that may  lead to more robust cases. Nevertheless, cases involving export  controls are primarily led by agents within the Counterintelligence  Division. To determine the number of agents to allocate to this  division, the FBI uses a risk management process and threat  assessments. Several years ago, the FBI established at least one  Counterintelligence squad in each of its 56 field offices. In July 2011,  the FBI established a Counterproliferation Center, merging its  Counterintelligence Division and its Weapons of Mass Destruction  Directorate to better focus their efforts and resources.

These  priorities include law enforcement concerns for their district and leads  from investigative agencies. In response to the risk associated with  national security, which includes export control enforcement cases,  staffing for national security activities has increased and several  districts have created national security sections within their office. In  2008, the Executive Office for U.S. Attorneys provided codes for  charging time and labeling cases to obtain better information on the  U.S. Attorneys\u2019 Office distribution of work and those resources used  for export control enforcement. However, some Assistant U.S.  Attorneys told us that the time-keeping system is complicated as there  are multiple codes and sub-categories in the tracking system and  determining the correct codes is often subjective, making it difficult to  track time spent on export control enforcement cases. Senior agency  officials acknowledged this concern and are working with the U.S.  Attorneys\u2019 Offices to provide better guidance to improve the accuracy  of attorney time charges.", "Other offices, such as State\u2019s Office of the Legal Adviser for Political- Military Affairs and Commerce\u2019s Office of the Chief Counsel for the  Bureau of Industry and Security assist the enforcement agencies by  providing legal support. For example, Commerce\u2019s Office of the Chief  Counsel pursues administrative enforcement actions against  individuals and entities, but also reviews and advises on OEE  recommendations for other administrative actions, such as temporary  denials of licenses. In addition, DDTC and OFAC pursue  administrative enforcement actions against violators. For example,  OFAC administers and enforces U.S. economic and trade sanctions  against designated foreign countries. While not all of staff in these  offices are allocated to export control enforcement, these offices have  relatively few staff to track.", "In addition to a domestic presence, most export control enforcement  agencies also allocate resources overseas, but only Commerce allocates  resources exclusively to export control enforcement. For example,  Commerce maintains Export Control Officers in six locations abroad;  Beijing and Hong Kong, China; Abu Dhabi, UAE; New Delhi, India;  Moscow, Russia; and Singapore, to support its dual-use export control  enforcement activities. Given that these officers have regional  responsibilities, they cover additional locations. For example, the Export  Control Officer assigned to Singapore also covers Malaysia and  Indonesia. While other agencies have field locations in many overseas  locations, these resources are to support the agencies\u2019 broader missions  and can be used for other duties based on the overseas mission  priorities. For example, ICE has 70 offices in 47 foreign countries with  more than 380 government and contract personnel which support all ICE  enforcement activities, including export control. They can also be called  upon to support various other DHS mission priorities. Specifically, the ICE  agents we met with at the U.S. Embassy in Abu Dhabi also conduct  activities in support of the full DHS mission and a great portion of their  time is spent on visa security and a lesser amount on export control  enforcement activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agencies Informally Leverage Enforcement Resources through Local Task Forces", "paragraphs": ["The export control enforcement investigative agencies often have offices  located in the same cities or geographic areas.

In its comments,  DHS stated its intent to work with the other agencies to improve the  license determination process as well as take steps to deploy its  resources in the most effective and efficient manner and provided target  dates for completing these actions. In particular, DHS noted that ongoing  tracking efforts by CBP and ICE will be used to improve their knowledge  of resources expended on export control enforcement activities and that  they will periodically review this information to determine the overall  direction of the export control program. Additionally, DHS stated its intent  to establish a working group with other agencies to develop performance  measures related to export control enforcement to help estimate the  effectiveness of all associated law enforcement activity. Written  comments from Commerce, DHS, and State are reprinted in appendixes  II, III, and IV, respectively.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees, as well as the Secretaries of Commerce, Defense,  Homeland Security, State, and Treasury as well as the Attorney General.

We interviewed  officials about their resources at the headquarters of Commerce, DHS,  Justice, State, and the Treasury. We also discussed with DOD officials  their role in providing investigative support to agencies responsible for  export control enforcement. We developed and used a set of structured  questions to interview each agency\u2019s resource planners to determine how  they allocate resources, what information and factors they consider in  resource allocation decisions, what their enforcement priorities are,  whether they track resources expended on enforcement, if they had  conducted an analysis of their resource need, and if they consider or  leverage other agencies\u2019 resources. We obtained applicable criteria  including the Office of Management and Budget  Circular A-11 and  departmental guidance on resource allocation and tracking. We also  reviewed previous GAO and inspector general reports regarding the  Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), as amended, and  resource management for enforcement programs. To determine current  resource levels, we obtained geographic locations of all domestic staff  conducting export control enforcement, actual expenditures on export  control enforcement activities, and information on staffing levels from  each agency for fiscal years 2006 through 2010. We did not  independently verify the accuracy of agency information on expenditures  and staffing levels obtained, but we corroborated this information with  cognizant agency officials. We considered agencies\u2019 overall resources for  the broad enforcement authorities and the resources allocated to export  control enforcement specifically. Finally, we analyzed agencies\u2019 budget  requests, expenditures, and staff hours to determine agencies current  resource commitment and how agencies have allocated resources to  export control enforcement activities.", "To determine challenges that agencies face in investigating illicit  transshipments and the potential impact of export control reform initiatives  on enforcement activities, we interviewed cognizant officials, examined  and analyzed relevant export control documents and statutes, and  conducted sites visits both domestically and overseas. We interviewed  officials about their enforcement priorities at the headquarters of  Commerce, DHS, Justice, and State. We also discussed with DOD  officials their role in providing license determination support to agencies  responsible for export control enforcement. We developed and used a set  of structured questions to interview enforcement agency officials in  selected domestic and overseas locations and observed export  enforcement operations at those locations that had air, land, and  seaports. We selected sites to visit based on various factors, including  geographical areas where all enforcement agencies were represented  with a large percentage of investigative caseload; areas with a mix of  defense and high-tech companies represented; ports with a high volume  of trade of U.S. commodities; a large presence of aerospace, electronics,  and software industries, and based on headquarters officials\u2019  recommendations on key areas of export control enforcement activities  both domestically and abroad. On the basis of these factors, we visited  Irvine, Long Beach, Los Angeles, Oakland, San Francisco, and San Jose,  CA; Washington, D.C.; and Baltimore, MD domestically. Internationally,  we interviewed United States Embassy and Consulate officials and host  government authorities in Hong Kong, Singapore, and in Abu Dhabi and  Dubai in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). We received briefings on the  export control systems from the Hong Kong Government\u2019s Trade and  Industry Department, Customs and Excise Tax Department, from  Singapore\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Singapore\u2019s Immigration and  Customs Authority; as well as toured ports at these locations. We also  received a briefing from the Hong Kong Customs Airport Command on air  cargo and air-to-air transshipment of strategic commodities and visited  the DHL Hub at the Hong Kong International Airport. In the UAE, we  visited the Government of Sharjah, Department of Seaports & Customs,  Hamriyah Free Zone Authority and met with the Director and Security and  Safety Manager to discuss the Hamriyah Free Zone. We reviewed the  findings and recommendations of past GAO reports, documentation from  enforcement agencies, and interviewed U.S. government officials from  these agencies as well as their field offices. We also met with several  agency representatives of the Export Control Reform Task Force and  reviewed recent White House press releases on the export reform  initiatives. Further, we examined Federal Register notices on changing  regulations related to the export control reform initiative.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2011 through March  2012, in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
