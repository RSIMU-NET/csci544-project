However, neither DOE nor NWC officials could demonstrate that a technical analysis had been conducted to justify the amount of plutonium held for this purpose.", "DOE officials believe that the allocations of plutonium for reliability replacement warheads and for the strategic reserve are prudent because (1) nuclear weapons are required to deter forces hostile to the United States and its allies; (2) no new nuclear weapons are currently being designed, developed or manufactured; (3) the United States has no active underground nuclear testing program; and (4) nuclear weapons in the stockpile are being retained beyond their original expected service life. For these reasons, DOD and DOE, in deciding how much plutonium to hold for reliability replacement warheads and for the strategic reserve, assume that all of the nuclear warheads in the active stockpile will fail. Therefore, DOD and DOE believe that each active warhead needs to be supported either by a backup warhead in the reliability replacement category or by plutonium in the strategic reserve.

As a result, contractors at these facilities are still stabilizing the plutonium and correcting packaging problems that remained when weapons production ceased. At Rocky Flats, for example, some of the excess plutonium is contained in highly acidic, corrosive solutions that can damage containers.

Until DOE has developed and built conversion facilities, it plans to store the excess plutonium at five sites. DOE estimates that this storage could cost over $1 billion from 2002 through 2019. This estimate includes approximately $140 million for constructing a new storage facility at Savannah River; about $390 million for upgrading, expanding, and operating the facilities at Pantex and Savannah River; and as much as $600 million for operating the storage facilities at Hanford, INEEL, and Los Alamos.

One of the conversion tracks involves immobilizing plutonium in either glass or ceramic material within small containers. These containers are placed inside large stainless steel canisters, which are then filled with glass containing high-level waste to provide a radiation barrier. The other track converts plutonium into spent fuel by burning it as fuel in existing commercial reactors. The plutonium is first processed into plutonium dioxide, which is then mixed with uranium dioxide to make mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. The MOX fuel is then burned in a commercial reactor to generate electricity.

Investment costs cover research and development, licensing, conceptual design, start-up, engineering, capital equipment, and construction. Operating costs cover staffing, maintenance, consumables, waste management, and decontamination and decommissioning. Also, in estimating the MOX fuel costs, DOE assumed that some costs could be recovered when reactor operators acquire MOX fuel from DOE instead of purchasing conventional reactor fuel.

According to DOE, most nations and some terrorist groups would be able to produce nuclear weapons if they had access to sufficient quantities of nuclear materials. Therefore, controls on access to nuclear materials are the primary technical barrier to nuclear proliferation in the world today. Several thefts of weapons-usable nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union have been confirmed since the end of the Cold War, leading the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency to warn that these materials are more available now than ever before in history.", "To help reduce the risk of nuclear proliferation posed by plutonium and other nuclear materials, the United States and Russia are working towards nuclear arms reduction treaties. Agreements such as the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaties (START-I and START-II) require that weapons be retired from deployed status and their delivery systems be removed or destroyed. These treaties do not, however, require that the nuclear warheads be dismantled or that their parts and materials, including plutonium, be destroyed. The United States has nevertheless removed some weapons from its stockpile, dismantled their warheads, and stored or disposed of their components and key nuclear materials.", "In addition, through a \u201clead and hedge\u201d approach, the United States is encouraging Russia to reduce both the number of nuclear warheads in its arsenal and the amount of nuclear material it maintains to support these warheads. Specifically, the United States plans to \u201clead\u201d the Russians by reducing the U.S. arsenal of strategic warheads, as agreed in the START-II treaty. At the same time, it plans to \u201chedge\u201d by maintaining its ability to return to the levels established under START-I, should the need for additional warheads arise. Although the Congress ratified START-II in January 1996, the Russian parliament has not yet scheduled a vote on it. Because of Russia\u2019s delay in ratifying START-II, the Department of Defense (DOD) is evaluating its ability to resume START-I levels of nuclear warheads in the active stockpile."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Environmental Cleanup", "paragraphs": ["Now that DOE is no longer producing plutonium for nuclear weapons, it is changing its focus to cleaning up the environmental contamination created by 50 years of production at its facilities.

We conducted a survey of the eight DOE sites that, according to DOE\u2019s 1996 report Plutonium: The First 50 Years, maintain the majority of DOE\u2019s plutonium inventory. These sites are Argonne National Laboratory-West, Hanford Site, Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Pantex Plant, Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site, and Savannah River Site. The survey asked each site to identify its (1) actual costs for fiscal years 1995 and 1996, (2) budget estimates for fiscal year 1997, and (3) projected cost estimates for fiscal year 1998 through fiscal year 2002. All cost estimates were adjusted to constant 1996 dollars.

We could not readily verify the data\u2019s accuracy, as we would have done had the data been derived from a budget and accounting system. However, we discussed our data-gathering approach with cognizant DOE officials, coordinated our request for data through the Office of the Chief Financial Officer, and provided our summarized cost data to DOE officials, who agreed that the data-gathering approach was reasonable and that the data provided by the field sites were probably the best that could be obtained under the circumstances. Similarly, officials from the Congressional Research Service and Congressional Budget Office reviewed the cost data and suggested no changes.", "To obtain information on the long-term costs of managing plutonium, we interviewed DOE officials and examined various DOE documents, including the Record of Decision for the Storage and Disposition of Weapons-Usable Fissile Materials Final Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement and documents prepared to support it.
