However, we found that more than one-quarter of the completed reforms only consisted of developing plans or establishing new offices--the first steps in achieving longer term reform goals. In addition, the Secretariat had not periodically conducted comprehensive assessments of the status and impact of its reforms. Accordingly, the Secretariat had not been able to determine what progress had been made or where future improvements were needed. A t the program level, management reviews that compare actual performance to expected results are critical elements of effective oversight and accountability. The United Nations has completed the initial phase of implementing reforms in a key area--performance-based budgeting. It adopted a budget that reflects a result-based budgeting format, including specific program costs, objectives, expected results, and performance indicators to measure results. However, the United Nations has yet to implement the next critical step in performance-based budgeting--a system to monitor and evaluate program impact or results. Program reviews that compare actual performance to expected outcomes are important for accounting for resources and achieving effective results. A strong internal audit function provides additional oversight and accountability through independent assessments of U.N. activities, as demonstrated by audits of the U.N Oil for Food program. U.N. internal auditors found recurring management weaknesses in 58 audits it conducted over 5 years. However, constraints on their scope and authority prevented the auditors from examining and reporting widely on problems in the Oil for Food program. U.N. oversight bodies did not obtain timely reporting on serious management problems and were unable to take corrective actions when needed.

Although the Secretary General does not have direct authority over  specialized agencies and many funds and programs, changes at the  Secretariat were intended to serve as a model for reforms throughout the  U.N. system. The Secretary General launched a second round of reforms in  2002 that expanded on the 1997 initiatives and reflected new areas of  focus, such as public information activities and the human rights program.  The overall goal was to align U.N. activities with the priorities defined by  the Millennium Declaration and the new security environment.", "The 1997 and 2002 initiatives followed several efforts to reform the United  Nations that began soon after its creation in 1945. Despite periodic cycles  of reform, U.N. member states have continued to have concerns about  inefficient operations; problems of fragmentation, duplication, and poor  coordination; and the proliferation of mandates. These calls have also  highlighted the need for more accountable leadership and improvement in  key management practices. As the largest financial contributor to the  United Nations, the United States has a strong interest in the completion  of these reforms and has played a significant role in promoting financial,  administrative, and programmatic changes. The State Department and the  U.S. Permanent Mission to the United Nations continue to promote further  reforms and report on the status of major reform initiatives to the U.S.  Congress.", "The call for reforms has also grown as a result of problems identified in  the United Nations\u2019 management of the Oil for Food program.

The Iraq Survey Group, responsible for investigating Iraq\u2019s  activities in developing weapons of mass destruction, estimated illicit  revenues at $10.9 billion and found similar irregularities in contract  overpricing and surcharges. In April 2004, the Secretary General  established the U.N. Independent Inquiry Committee (IIC) to investigate  allegations of mismanagement and misconduct within the Oil for Food  program. In February 2005, the IIC issued an interim report on the initial  procurement of U.N. contractors, recipients of oil allocations, internal  audit structure and activities, and management of administrative  expenses.

We found that 70 percent of reform initiatives under the  Secretary General\u2019s authority were in place, compared with 44 percent of  the initiatives requiring member state approval.

In December 2000, the Secretariat implemented  the first key element of a performance-based budgeting framework by  adopting a budget that reflects a results-based budgeting format, including  specific program costs, objectives, expected results, and performance  indicators to measure the results. For the first time, the 2004-2005 budget  included specific performance targets and baseline data for many  performance indicators that can help measure performance over time and  allow program managers to compare actual achievements to expected  results. However, oversight committees have reported that some programs  still lacked clear and concise expected outcomes and performance  indicators.", "Further, although the United Nations had developed measures for  assessing program progress, many of these measures represent tasks and  outputs rather than outcomes. For example, in 2003, a key objective of the  peacekeeping operation in East Timor was to increase the capacity of the  national police force to provide internal security. The indicator for  measuring results was the number of police trained\u2014a goal of 2,830 police  by 2004.

However, in 2003, the Advisory Committee on  Administrative and Budgetary Questions and the Committee for Program  and Coordination reported that many sections in the budget still lacked  justifications for continuing certain outputs.

For example, while the contract  allowed the United Nations to inspect and test all contractor services, the  auditors found that OIP had received, certified, and approved the  contractor\u2019s invoices without on-site verification or inspection reports. In  responding to the auditors findings, OIP rejected the call for on-site  inspections and stated that any dissatisfaction with the contractor\u2019s  services should come from the suppliers or their home countries.", "A July 2002 audit of Saybolt\u2019s operation found similar problems, including  inadequate documentation for contractor charges and payments made for  equipment already included in the contractor\u2019s daily staff cost structure.  As with the Lloyd\u2019s Register contract, OIOS found that OIP officials  charged with monitoring the Saybolt contract had made no inspection  visits to Iraq but had certified the contractor\u2019s satisfactory compliance  with the contract and approved extensions to the contract.", "In an April 2003 report, OIOS cited concerns about amendments and  extensions to Cotecna\u2019s original $4.9 million contract. Specifically, OIOS  found that OIP increased Cotecna\u2019s contract by $356,000 4 days after the  contract was signed. The amendment included additional costs for  communication equipment and operations that OIOS asserted were  included in the original contract. In addition, OIOS found that the contract  equaled the offer of the second lowest bidder through amendments and  extensions during the contract\u2019s first year. Accordingly, OIOS concluded  that, one year after the start of the contract, the reason for awarding the  contract to Cotecna\u2014on the grounds that it was the lowest bidder\u2014was  no longer valid.", "In addition to the three inspection contracts, OIOS reported procurement  weaknesses in other areas of the Oil for Food program. For example, in  November 2002, OIOS reported that almost $38 million in procurement of  equipment for the U.N.-Habitat program was not based on a needs  assessment. As a result, 51 generators went unused from September 2000  to March 2002, and 12 generators meant for project-related activities were  converted to office use.

This division has two funding  sources: (1) the U.N. regular budget, which covers normal, recurring audit  activities; and (2) extra-budgetary funds allocated outside the U.N. regular  budget, which cover audits of special non-recurring funds and programs,  such as the Oil for Food program. OIOS\u2019 internal audit division received  extra-budgetary funds directly from the Oil for Food program managers it  audited. It assigned 2 to 6 auditors to cover the program.

Board of  Auditors.", "The IIC found that the practice of allowing executive directors of funds  and programs the right to approve the budgets and staffing of internal  audit activities can lead to critical and high risk areas being excluded from  internal audit examination and review by oversight bodies. For example:    Since its inception, OIOS has generally submitted its audit reports only to  the head of the audited agency. However, in August 2000 OIOS tried to  widen its report distribution by sending its Oil for Food reports to the  Security Council. However, the OIP director opposed this proposal, stating  that it would compromise the division of responsibility between internal  and external audit. The Deputy Secretary General also denied the request,  and OIOS subsequently abandoned any efforts to report directly to the  Security Council.", "OIOS did not examine OIP\u2019s oversight of the contracts for humanitarian  goods in central and southern Iraq that accounted for almost $40 billion in  Oil for Food proceeds. OIP was responsible for examining these contracts  for price and value at its New York headquarters. The Iraqi government\u2019s  ability to negotiate contracts directly with commodity suppliers was an  important factor in enabling Iraq to levy illegal commissions. OIOS  believed that these contracts were outside its purview because the  Security Council\u2019s sanctions committee was responsible for their approval.  However, OIP management also steered OIOS toward program activities in  Iraq rather than headquarters functions where OIP reviewed the  humanitarian contracts.", "In May 2002, OIP\u2019s executive director did not approve the auditors\u2019 request  to conduct a risk assessment of OIP\u2019s Program Management Division,  citing financial reasons. We reported last year that it was unclear how  certain entities involved in the Oil for Food program, including OIP,  exercised their oversight responsibilities over humanitarian contracts and  sanctions compliance by member states.

Office of Legal Affairs noted that  the audit authority extended to computing the amounts of compensation  but did not extend to reviewing those aspects of the panels\u2019 work that  constitute a legal process. However, OIOS disputed the legal opinion,  noting that its mandate was to review and appraise the use of U.N.  financial resources. OIOS believed that the opinion would effectively  restrict any meaningful audit of the claims process. OIOS identified more  than $500 million in potential overpayments by the Commission.
