While DOD records show that an absolute value of $35 billion or a net value of $629 million of suspense amounts and check payment differences were written off, the reported amounts are not reliable. Many of the write-offs represented transactions that had already been netted together (i.e., positive amounts offsetting negative amounts) at lower level accounting sites before they were recorded in the suspense accounts. This netting or summarizing of transactions misstated the total value of the write-offs and made it impossible for DOD to locate the support needed to identify what appropriations may have been under- or overcharged or determine whether individual transactions were valid. In particular, DOD could not determine whether any of the write-off amounts, had they been charged to the proper appropriation, would have caused an Antideficiency Act violation. It is important that DOD accurately and promptly charge transactions to appropriation accounts since these accounts provide the department with legal authority to incur and pay obligations for goods or services. DOD has hundreds of current and closed appropriation accounts that were authorized by law over the years. Similar to a checking account, the funds available in DOD's appropriation accounts must be reduced or increased as the department spends money or receives collections that it is authorized to retain for its own use. Just as an individual who maintains multiple checking accounts must be sure that transactions are recorded to the proper account, DOD also must ensure that the proper appropriation account is charged or credited for each specific disbursement and collection. Our review found that DOD's guidance and processes developed to ensure compliance with the legislation provided reasonable assurance that amounts were written off properly except that check payment differences did not have the required written certification. The write-off process did not correct underlying records and significant DOD resources were needed to ensure that write-off amounts were properly identified and handled. Also, using staff resources to process old transactions resulted in fewer staff to research and clear current problems. At December 31, 2004, DOD reports showed that after the write-offs, more than $1.3 billion (absolute value) of suspense amounts and $39 million of check differences remained uncleared for more than 60 days. However, DOD has acknowledged that its suspense reports are incomplete and inaccurate. Until DOD complies with existing laws and enforces its own guidance for reconciling, reporting, and resolving amounts in suspense and check differences on a regular basis, the buildup of current balances will likely continue, the department's appropriation accounts will remain unreliable, and another costly write-off process may eventually be required."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) inability to accurately account for and  record its disbursements and collections has been a serious, long-standing,  and much reported financial management problem.

Although the bill for goods  and services received should be matched to the relevant obligation to  ensure that funds are available for payment before any disbursement is  made, DFAS, military service, or defense agency personnel often do not  identify the correct appropriation and perform the match until after making  the payment. If the appropriation and obligation then cannot be identified  based on the available information, the disbursement is recorded in a  suspense account until research is performed, additional information is  received, or any errors are corrected. If DFAS staff cannot determine the  correct appropriation account to charge, DOD policies allow DFAS staff to  request approval for charging current funds.", "Several military services and DOD agencies can be involved in a single  disbursement, and each has differing financial policies, processes, and  nonstandard nonintegrated systems. As a result, millions of disbursement  transactions must be keyed and rekeyed into the vast number of systems  involved in any given DOD business process. Also, DOD disbursements  must be recorded using an account coding structure that can exceed  75 digits, and this coding structure often differs by military service in terms  of the type, quantity, and format of data required. The manual entry and  reentry of the account code alone often results in errors and missing  information about transactions. Automated system edit checks identify  transaction records with invalid or missing account coding information,  such as the appropriation account number or the chargeable entity, and  refuse to process the faulty records. DFAS then records the problem  disbursements in suspense accounts until the individual transactions can  be corrected and reprocessed by the accounting systems.", "Other reasons for disbursement transactions to be recorded to suspense  accounts include  no valid obligation data identified,  DOD disbursement records and Treasury disbursement records differ,   unsupported charges between DOD services and defense agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collection Problems", "paragraphs": ["DOD uses suspense accounts to hold several different kinds of collections  until they can be properly credited to the relevant appropriation account or  organization.

DOD also routinely  accumulates estimated payroll tax withholding amounts in suspense  accounts until the payments must be transferred to the Internal Revenue  Service. If the estimates are higher than actual payments, amounts can be  left in suspense indefinitely. Similarly, DOD records user fees collected for  various purposes, such as grazing rights and forestry products, to suspense  accounts until the accumulated funds are credited to the correct  appropriation account or organization.

In order to calculate absolute values  for the suspense account write-offs, DOD could only add together the  already netted disbursement, collection, adjustment, and correcting  amounts.

For this type,  the DFAS center director had to certify that steps were taken to obtain the  missing information to clear the transactions and that further action was  not warranted.

DOD reviewers told us\u2014 and documentary evidence supports their claims\u2014that additional  information was requested from DFAS centers to support various  questioned amounts or that packages with unsupported amounts were  rejected and returned to the centers. For example, a $326 million package,  consisting of a single amount supposedly representing transactions dating  back to May 1992, was questioned by DFAS Arlington, DFAS internal  review, and the Comptroller\u2019s office. Because no supporting detailed  transactions were identified and because the package did not clearly  demonstrate that the amount had been recorded prior to March 1, 2001, the  package was flagged. Reviewers contacted the originating DFAS center and  requested additional documentation and explanation. The center provided  the reviewers with detailed analyses demonstrating that the proposed  write-off amounts had to represent transactions transferred into the  center\u2019s suspense accounts when the center was established in May 1992.  Based on the additional evidence, the reviewers concluded that the  proposed write-off met legislative requirements and approved the package.  DOD reviewers rejected numerous proposed write-off amounts that did not  comply with the legislation, including 18 of the original 116 packages  submitted by the DFAS centers, often because they did not clearly support  a transaction date prior to March 1, 2001.", "To ensure suspense write-off amounts were recorded within 30 days of the  determination by the Secretary of Defense\u2019s designee and before the  legislative deadline of December 2, 2004, DFAS center officials reviewed  accounting system records and requested additional information from their  staff.

Therefore, DOD needs  to continue its focus on the keys to eliminating aged problem  disbursements and preventing their future occurrence, including improved  disbursement processes and better management controls. Until DOD  enforces its own guidance for reconciling and resolving its suspense  accounts and check differences regularly, balances will likely grow.  Without adequate tools for tracking and archiving the individual  transactions charged to suspense, DOD will continue to have difficulty  researching and determining proper accounting treatment. DOD\u2019s inability  over the years to promptly and correctly charge its appropriation accounts  has prevented the department and Congress from knowing whether  specific appropriation accounts were overspent or underspent and from  identifying any potential Antideficiency Act violations.
