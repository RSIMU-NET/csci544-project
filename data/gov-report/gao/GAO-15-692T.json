EMP and solar weather events could potentially  lead to power outages over broad geographic areas for extended  durations, which experts have reported could result in severe economic  disruption and significant impacts to public health and safety. Addressing  these threats necessitates effective collaboration among multiple  government agencies and industry partners and no singular federal  program or entity has sole responsibility for addressing electromagnetic  threats. However, the National Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP)  outlines the roles and responsibilities of DHS and applicable sector- specific agencies for each of the 16 critical infrastructure sectors.

EMP events may be  further categorized into a number of different types, based on their  specific source of initiation. The threat focused on primarily by the EMP  Commission is the high-altitude EMP (HEMP). A HEMP event is caused  by the detonation of a nuclear device at a high-altitude, about 40 to 400  kilometers, above the Earth\u2019s atmosphere. A HEMP attack is not  intended to cause direct physical impacts at the Earth\u2019s surface, such as  injury or damage directly from heat or blast, but instead interacts with the  atmosphere to create an intense electromagnetic energy field that can  overload computer circuitry and could cause significant damage to critical  electrical infrastructure.", "In addition to manmade EMPs, naturally occurring solar weather events  can also cause related electromagnetic impacts that can adversely affect  components of the commercial electric grid. This type of event is  commonly referred to as a geomagnetic disturbance (GMD). In 1989, a  GMD caused wide-scale impacts on the Hydro-Quebec power system in  Canada which caused the electric grid to collapse within 92 seconds and  left six million customers without power for 9 hours. As noted in  Presidential Policy Directive 21 (PPD-21), energy sector infrastructure is  uniquely critical due to the enabling functions it provides to other critical  infrastructure sectors. Given this interdependency, an EMP or major  GMD event that disrupts the electric grid could also result in potential  cascading impacts on fuel distribution, transportation systems, food and  water supplies, and communications and equipment for emergency  services, as well as other communication systems which utilize the  civilian infrastructure. PPD-21 also recognizes that DHS has numerous  responsibilities to protect critical infrastructure, including such things as  analyzing threats to, vulnerabilities of, and potential consequences from  all hazards on critical infrastructure.", "Within DHS, the National Protection and Programs Directorate (NPPD) is  responsible for working with public and industry infrastructure partners  and leads the coordinated national effort to mitigate risk to the nation\u2019s  infrastructure through the development and implementation of the  infrastructure protection program. NPPD has two principal offices with  responsibilities to facilitate protection of critical infrastructure that could be  at risk from EMP and GMD events\u2014the Office of Infrastructure Protection  (IP) and the Office of Cyber Security and Communications (CS&C). In  addition, DHS\u2019s Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and  Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) have roles related to  addressing potential impacts to the electric grid, which could include EMP  and GMD threats.", "DOE also has a significant role as the sector-specific agency for the  energy sector, which includes critical infrastructure and key resources  related to electricity.

Additionally, the RecX project  provided a functional prototype that may facilitate industry efforts to  further develop more mobile transformers and assist with recovery efforts  in the event of an electromagnetic attack on the electric grid.

For  example, DHS\u2019s efforts to clearly identify agency roles and responsibilities  to date have been limited. Specifically, DHS has had difficulty identifying  the relevant DHS components, officials, or ongoing internal DHS activities  with an EMP nexus. For example, DHS officials were unable to determine  internally which component would serve as the lead\u2014S&T or NPPD\u2014in  regards to addressing EMP threats. In addition, NPPD has not yet  identified its specific roles and activities in addressing electromagnetic  threats even though it has been identified by the DHS Office of Policy as  the proposed risk analysis \u201cowner\u201d relative to space weather threats.", "We recognize that DHS does not have a statutory obligation to address  the specific recommendations of the EMP Commission and many of  these recommendations were also directed to DOE. Nevertheless, we  believe that implementation of them could help mitigate electromagnetic  impacts to the electric grid, such as helping to assure the protection of  high-value transmission assets. Moreover, PPD-21 articulates DHS\u2019s  roles and responsibilities to safeguard the nation\u2019s critical infrastructure,  which are consistent with such recommendations. For example, PPD-21  states that DHS, in carrying out its responsibilities under the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, as amended, is to, among other things, evaluate  national capabilities, opportunities, and challenges in protecting critical  infrastructure; analyze threats to, vulnerabilities of, and potential  consequences from all hazards on critical infrastructure; identify security  and resilience functions that are necessary for effective stakeholder  engagement with all critical infrastructure sectors; integrate and  coordinate federal cross-sector security and resilience activities; and  identify and analyze key interdependencies among critical infrastructure  sectors. Moreover, PPD-21 calls for DHS to specifically consider sector  dependencies on energy and communications systems, and identify pre- event and mitigation measures or alternate capabilities during disruptions  to those systems in updating the NIPP. To date, our preliminary analysis  suggests that DHS has not fully addressed some key responsibilities  related to effectively preparing for and responding to electromagnetic  threats to the electric grid, in conjunction with DOE as the sector-specific  agency for the energy sector, which is responsible for critical electrical  infrastructure. Specifically, DHS did not identify any efforts it conducted to  support the identification of key electrical infrastructure assets or assess  cross-sector dependencies on these assets, for which DHS would be  expected to play a key role. According to officials within NPPD and the  DHS Office of Policy, factors such as competing priorities and a focus on  all hazards may contribute to limited efforts being taken by DHS to  specifically address electromagnetic threats. We will continue to assess  the extent to which DHS\u2019s efforts align with the EMP Commission  recommendations as well as the extent to which DHS\u2019s current and  planned actions align with its own risk management framework, as  identified in the NIPP, as we complete our work.

Specifically, our preliminary analysis indicates that DHS has not  fully coordinated with stakeholders to address electromagnetic threats to  the electric grid in the following areas:  Providing threat information. DHS has not identified any efforts to  specifically provide EMP-related threat information to industry  stakeholders. Industry officials we spoke with generally stated that they  do not have sufficient threat information to determine the extent to which  specific actions should be taken to mitigate the effects of an EMP event.  Whereas industry officials reported having a greater understanding of the  potential likelihood of a major GMD caused by solar weather, they noted  that applicable EMP threat briefings by DOD or DHS could help them to  better justify to their management or stockholders the level of investment  required to take protective actions. According to the Quadrennial Energy  Review, incomplete or ambiguous threat information may lead to  inconsistency in physical security among grid owners, inefficient spending  on security measures, or deployment of security measures against the  wrong threat.", "This concern generally aligns with previous work related to cyber threats  in which we reported that federal partners\u2019 efforts to share information did  not consistently meet industry\u2019s expectations, in part, due to restrictions  on the threat information that can be shared with industry partners. generally concurred with our prior recommendations directed at  strengthening its partnership and information-sharing efforts, and has  since taken steps to enhance its information sharing activities, including  granting security clearances, and establishing a secure mechanism to  share cyber threat information.
