The new medical listings for mental impairments provided much more detailed and specific guidance on how to evaluate mental disorders in children than the former regulations, which were published in 1977. In particular, the new medical listings placed much more emphasis on assessing how a child\u2019s mental impairment limits his or her ability to function in age-appropriate ways. SSA made this change because mental health professionals consider functional factors particularly important in evaluating the mental disorders of children.", "The former medical listings for mental impairments emphasized the medical characteristics that must be met to substantiate the existence of the impairment. Specific areas of functioning sometimes were and sometimes were not mentioned as a factor in this determination. In contrast, the new medical listings provide much more detailed guidance on assessing the functional aspects of each impairment. The standard for most impairments is divided into two parts: medical and functional criteria, both of which must be satisfied for the applicant to qualify for a benefit.", "The functional criteria are described in terms of the age of the child and the specific areas of functioning\u2014such as social, communication/ cognition, or personal/behavioral skills\u2014that must be assessed. The new medical listings emphasize the importance of parents and others as sources of nonmedical information about a child\u2019s day-to-day functioning. In general, the childhood mental listings require children over 2 years old to have marked limitations in two of the four areas of functioning to qualify for benefits. Further, when standardized tests are available, the listing defines the term \u201cmarked\u201d as a level of functioning that is two standard deviations below the mean for children of similar age.", "The new medical listings also classified childhood mental disorders into more distinct categories of mental impairments. Previously, there were 4 impairments listed\u2014mental retardation, chronic brain syndrome, psychosis of infancy and childhood, and functional nonpsychotic disorders\u2014now there are 11. Several of the newly listed impairments, such as autism and other pervasive developmental disorders, mood disorders, and personality disorders, describe impairments that were previously evaluated under one or more of the four broader categories of childhood mental impairments.

In contrast, adults whose conditions were not severe enough to qualify under the medical listings could still be found eligible for benefits if an assessment of their residual functional capacity (RFC) showed that they could not engage in substantial work.

Included were experts in general and developmental pediatrics, child psychology, learning disorders, and early and adolescent childhood education as well as advocates from groups such as Community Legal Services in Philadelphia (plaintiff\u2019s counsel in the Zebley case), the Association for Retarded Citizens, and the Mental Health Law Project. SSA also consulted with its regional offices and the state DDSs.", "Building on the functional criteria added to the listings after DBRA, SSA issued regulations implementing the Supreme Court\u2019s decision on February 11, 1991. According to these regulations, for the child to be eligible for disability benefits, the IFA must show that the child\u2019s impairment or combination of impairments limits his or her ability \u201cto function independently, appropriately, and effectively in an age-appropriate manner.\u201d Specifically, the impairment must substantially reduce the child\u2019s ability to grow, develop, or mature physically, mentally, or emotionally to the extent that it limits his or her ability to (1) attain age-appropriate developmental milestones; (2) attain age-appropriate daily activities at home, school, play, or work; or (3) acquire the skills needed to assume adult roles. Although SSA officials describe these as state-of-the-art criteria for assessing children\u2019s functioning, they concede that many of these concepts are not clear cut.", "As a result of these regulations, DDSs now perform IFAs to assess the child\u2019s social, communication, cognitive, personal and behavioral, and motor skills, as well as his or her responsiveness to stimuli and ability to concentrate, persist at tasks at hand, and keep pace. Like the DBRA regulations, the IFA process requires DDSs to supplement medical information with information about the child\u2019s behavior and activities from the child\u2019s teachers, parents, and others knowledgeable about the child\u2019s day-to-day functioning in order to make these assessments. Generally, if the IFA shows that a child has a moderate limitation in three areas of functioning or a marked limitation in one area and a moderate limitation in another, benefits are awarded. In contrast, the more restrictive functional criteria under SSA\u2019s mental listings require two marked limitations.", "In addition to measuring functioning as part of the IFA process, the Zebley regulations added the concept of functional equivalence to SSA\u2019s medical listings. Before Zebley, a child qualified for benefits only if his or her impairment met or was medically equivalent to the severity criteria in the listings. After Zebley, a child could qualify if his or her impairment was functionally equivalent to an impairment in the medical listings, as long as there was a direct, medically determinable cause of the functional limitations.

If all 219,000 children receive the maximum benefit, their SSI benefits would cost about $1 billion a year. About 84 percent of these children had a mental impairment as their primary limitation, and about 16 percent had physical impairments. (Fig. 2 shows a breakdown of the impairments.)", "Figure 3 shows the substantial increase in the number of awards. Much of this increase was due to the implementation of new medical listings for mental impairments. The IFA process also added to the growth in the rolls and accounted for a substantial portion of new awards. Figure 3 also shows that the average monthly number of applications jumped dramatically after Zebley and has continued to grow. Many observers attribute this increase in applications to the publicity surrounding Zebley, as well as to increased outreach by SSA, some of which was congressionally mandated.", "Also, some of the increase in awards may have been attributable to the close scrutiny of the IFA process by courts and disabled child advocates, which some believe may have resulted in some DDSs feeling pressured to increase their award rates during the 1991-1992 period. (App. II provides a chronology of their actions.) Before the IFA process was introduced in 1991, the national award rate for all types of childhood cases was 38 percent, but the award rate jumped to 56 percent in the first 2 years after the IFA and DBRA regulations were issued.

Although SSA has tried to add rigor to the IFA process through guidance and training, we believe that problems will likely continue because of the difficulties inherent in using age-appropriate behavior as an analog for the adult vocational assessment of residual functional capacity."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "IFA\u2014A Complex Process That Relies Heavily on Adjudicator Judgment", "paragraphs": ["Determining disability for children with impairments that are not severe enough to match a listed impairment can be a highly subjective process. SSA designed the IFA process to provide DDS adjudicators with a structure to help them make uniform and rational disability determinations for children with less severe impairments. Even so, the necessity to assess a child\u2019s ability to function age-appropriately requires DDS adjudicators to make a series of judgments, which we believe raises questions about the consistency and reliability of DDS decisions. SSA and IG studies and our analysis document problems throughout the IFA process, especially for mental impairments. (See app. III for a more detailed discussion of the problems that SSA and the IG identified.)", "Extensive evidence needed: To make disability determinations, DDSs use information from both medical and nonmedical sources, including teachers, day care providers, parents, and others knowledgeable about the child\u2019s day-to-day behavior and activities. For the functional assessment, observations are needed about the child\u2019s behavior over a long period of time, so evidence-gathering can be a considerable task. SSA found in its 1994 study that the lack of sufficient supporting documentation was the most common problem in its sample of childhood disability decisions.", "School officials in particular are an important source of nonmedical data on children\u2019s behavior over time. Each DDS develops its own questionnaires for eliciting the data, and inquiries are made on virtually every applicant because this information is also used to assess functioning under the medical listings. We estimate that the process now results in about 500,000 inquiries to schools each year, a substantial reporting burden. Some parties believe that the open-ended questionnaire design in many states and the burden on school officials faced with many inquiries may be contributing to poor quality data from this key source.", "Difficulty classifying limitations: If an IFA is needed, a disability adjudicator must classify the child\u2019s limitations in the appropriate areas of functioning, as shown in figure 4. This is a complex judgment because some areas are closely interrelated and impairments may or may not affect functioning in more than one area. If, for example, evidence indicates that a child gets in fights at school, the adjudicator must determine whether the specific behavior is evidence of a limitation in social skills, personal and behavioral skills, or some combination of these. SSA found that in cases of incorrect awards a common mistake that adjudicators made was to count the effect of an impairment in two areas when only one was appropriate. This resulted in the impairment seeming more severe than it actually was.", "Problems defining degrees of limitation: Once the areas have been identified, the adjudicator must judge the degree of limitation. Because only certain conditions\u2014such as low intelligence quotient (IQ)\u2014can be objectively tested and determined, SSA has defined the severity of limitations by comparison with expected behavior for the child\u2019s chronological age. Figure 4 shows the degrees of limitation adjudicators use to assess children 3 through 15 years old. SSA\u2019s guidance defines a limitation in the moderate category as more than a mild or minimal limitation but less than a marked limitation. The terms \u201cmild\u201d and \u201cminimal\u201d are not defined, but SSA guidance describes an impairment in the marked category as one that \u201cseriously\u201d interferes with a child\u2019s ability to function age-appropriately, while a moderate limitation creates \u201cconsiderable\u201d interference. Within each category, adjudicators are expected to be able to differentiate the degree of limitation. For example, a moderate rating can range from a \u201cweak moderate\u201d (just above a less-than-moderate) up to a \u201cstrong moderate\u201d (just below a marked limitation).", "Limited guidance for summing the result: Because the IFA process is inherently subjective, SSA cannot provide an objective procedure for summarizing the IFA results. Therefore, SSA instructs adjudicators to step back and assess whether the child meets the overall definition of disability. As an example to guide adjudicators, SSA has said that an award may generally be granted if a child has a moderate limitation in three areas. However, SSA officials stress that this statement assumes \u201cthree good, solid moderates,\u201d and they characterize it as a general guideline, not a firm rule. Also, they stress that other possible combinations of ratings, such as two strong moderates, could justify finding a child disabled, depending on the individual child\u2019s circumstances. In the end, officials stress that adjudicators are expected to award or deny benefits based on an overall judgment, not on any specific sum of severity ratings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SSA and IG Studies Highlight IFA Difficulties", "paragraphs": ["SSA\u2019s 1994 study of 325 childhood awards highlighted the difficulties in using the IFA process to reliably identify disabled children, particularly children with behavioral and learning disorders.

These cases had been decided by DDS adjudicators, based on their understanding of existing guidance from SSA. Then, SSA\u2019s regional quality assurance staff had reviewed the decisions and found them accurate. The study involved a third group of experts in the Office of Disability who reviewed the same cases and found inaccuracies in the decisions. Based on their findings, we concluded that about 13 percent of the awards reviewed by SSA had been made to children who were not impaired enough to qualify. Also, another 23 percent of the awards had been made without sufficient supporting documentation.", "A January 1995 IG report focused on IFA-based awards to children with mental impairments. IG staff, with assistance from the Office of Disability, reviewed 129 IFA-based awards for mental retardation, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and other behavioral or learning disorders. The IG found that 17 (13 percent) of the awards should have been denials and another 38 (29 percent) had been based on insufficient evidence. The IG attributed this to DDS adjudicators\u2019 difficulty interpreting and complying with SSA\u2019s IFA guidelines for assessing the severity of children\u2019s mental impairments. Many adjudicators reported that they found the SSA guidelines unclear and not sufficiently objective. The IG stated that this group of children had less severe impairments than those children determined disabled based on the medical listings, making the assessment of their impairments\u2019 effect on their ability to function age-appropriately more difficult.", "We observed firsthand the difficulty that adjudicators face in making the judgments required by the IFA process for children who have behavioral and learning disorders. In June 1994, we attended 1-day training sessions for DDS adjudicators and SSA\u2019s regional quality assurance staff from across the nation. The Office of Disability presented the findings from its 1994 study and discussed the policies and procedures that DDS and quality assurance staff had misapplied. In this training, Office of Disability staff presented case studies of children included in the 1994 study. After those in attendance reviewed the evidence for each child\u2019s case, they were asked to assess the degree to which the child\u2019s impairment limited his or her functioning. The attendees\u2019 opinions were tallied and in all cases they were split. During discussions of each case, attendees often voiced differing views on why they believed, for example, that the child\u2019s limitation was less than moderate or moderate, or whether a moderate limitation was a good, solid moderate, or a weak moderate. In some cases, the opinion of the majority of attendees turned out to be different from the conclusion of the Office of Disability.", "In addition to the national training in June 1994, SSA took other steps to correct implementation problems, including (1) issuing numerous instructional clarifications and reminders, (2) requiring DDSs to specially code certain types of mental impairments and all decisions based on three moderate limitations (to facilitate selecting samples of cases for further study), and (3) establishing more rigorous requirements for documenting awards that are based on three moderate limitations. The Office of Disability plans to do a follow-up study to assess the effectiveness of its remedial efforts.", "Some experts believe that further steps could be taken to improve the IFA process. For example, experts we contacted commented on the need for more complete longitudinal evaluations by professionals. They pointed out that more complete examinations\u2014sometimes including multiple visits and observations of both parents and children\u2014would help to address concerns about the adequacy of information from schools and medical sources and provide higher assurance of good decisions. They stated that because professionals are trained to identify malingering in mental examinations, the expanded examinations might also help relieve concerns about coaching. They agreed that such examinations would raise the program\u2019s administrative costs considerably, but because a child can receive almost $5,500 a year in benefits (which can continue for life) they believed that the costs would be justified.", "SSA\u2019s efforts and experts\u2019 suggestions are geared toward improving the process rather than addressing the underlying conceptual problems with the IFA.

Critics believe that cash payments and Medicaid act as incentives for some parents to coach and, therefore, they are concerned about the extent to which parents can manipulate the disability determination process. However, we believe that measuring the extent to which coaching may actually occur is extremely difficult.", "Unless parents admit to it, coaching is almost impossible to substantiate. The nature of the parent-child relationship makes investigating coaching allegations difficult. Many communications between parent and child take place at home, out of the view of outside observers. In addition, the variability of children\u2019s behavior makes knowing whether a child\u2019s behavior is the result of coaching difficult. Behavior can vary naturally among children of the same age\u2014or in the same child over time\u2014as they go through stages in development or respond to changes in their home or school environment. If a child started misbehaving in school, investigators would need baseline evidence to establish that the child had not misbehaved extensively in the past. Finally, even if investigators could identify a sudden change in behavior, they would have to rule out other reasons for the change, such as changes in the child\u2019s household or neighborhood environment. In short, knowing whether the child is performing poorly or misbehaving because of coaching or for other reasons is difficult.", "Because coaching is difficult to detect, the extent of coaching cannot be measured with much confidence.

In mid-November 1994, SSA instructed DDSs to begin distributing these toll-free numbers to schools. Also, SSA has instructed its field offices and telephone service centers to report to the regional quality assurance units any allegations of coaching received from the general public.

Indeed, the rise in allegations of coaching may reflect public suspicion of a process that has allowed many children with less severe impairments to qualify for benefits. Although scant evidence exists to substantiate that coaching is a problem, coaching cannot be ruled out and its extent is virtually unmeasurable.", "We believe that a more fundamental problem than coaching is determining which children are eligible for benefits using the new IFA process. Our analysis documents the many subjective judgments built into each step of the IFA process to assess where a child\u2019s behavior falls along the continuum of age-appropriate functioning. Moreover, studies by SSA and the IG of children awarded benefits for behavioral and learning disorders illustrate the difficulties that SSA has experienced over the last 4 years in making definitive and consistent eligibility decisions for children with these disorders.", "SSA\u2019s efforts have been aimed at process improvements rather than reexamining the conceptual basis for the IFA. Despite its efforts, too much adjudicator judgment remains. Although better evidence and more use of objective tests where possible would improve the process, the likelihood of significantly reducing judgment involved in deciding whether a child qualifies for benefits under the IFA is remote.

These records exclude the results of disability decisions made by administrative law judges. From these records, we determined (1) the overall award rate for children, (2) the percentage of IFA awards that were based on mental impairments versus physical impairments, (3) the average monthly number of childhood applications, and (4) the average monthly number of awards that were based on IFAs versus medical listings. These data, as applicable, were determined for the following periods: (1) 2 years before the Supreme Court\u2019s Sullivan v. Zebley decision (Jan. 1, 1988, through Feb. 20, 1990); (2) 2 years after the IFA process was implemented (Feb. 11, 1991, through Dec. 31, 1992); (3) January-December 1993; and (4) January- September 1994.

In all cases, the evidence indicating possible coaching was provided by medical professionals or psychologists who performed consultative examinations for SSA. None of the evidence indicating possible coaching or malingering was provided by schools. The three questioned awards involved children who may have malingered during IQ testing. In these cases, however, the awards were based on factors other than the results of the testing.

We asked SSA, based on experience in its quality assurance program, to estimate how many of the 90 cases with insufficient documentation would have been denials if all documentation had been obtained, and SSA estimated that 13 (or 4 percent of the 325 awards) would have been denials. Thus, we concluded that a total of 41 awards (12.6 percent of the 325 awards) should have been denials. By contrast, of 292 denials reviewed in the study, SSA found that only 1.4 percent (4) should have been awards, and another 1.4 percent (4) should not have been made without obtaining more supporting documentation.", "Combining all decisional and documentational errors for the 617 denials and awards in SSA\u2019s study, the overall error rate for this group of cases was 20.4 percent. This is about twice the maximum acceptable error rate of 9.4 percent that SSA allows for decisional and documentational errors combined for all initial disability decisions made by an individual DDS.", "According to SSA\u2019s Office of Disability, a primary reason that DDSs made awards that should have been denials was that DDSs had frequently overrated\u2014but rarely underrated\u2014the severity of children\u2019s functional limitations. Such overrating occurred primarily because DDSs had (1) compared the child with the perfect child rather than the average child, (2) based the limitation on a single incident rather than behavior over time, (3) not considered the child\u2019s ability to function while on an effective medication regimen, and (4) based the limitation on the child\u2019s life circumstances rather than the effects of a medically determinable impairment.", "DDSs also had mechanically applied SSA\u2019s guidelines on how to make awards using the results of the IFA process. SSA\u2019s guidelines instruct DDSs that they generally should award benefits to children who have moderate limitations in any three of the areas of ability assessed in the IFA process. SSA found, however, that DDSs had used this instruction as a rule rather than a guideline. DDSs had automatically made awards to any child with three moderate limitations, regardless of how strong or weak the moderate limitations were. SSA stated that its guideline assumed \u201cthree good, solid moderates.\u201d SSA found that, when DDSs had identified two moderate limitations, they sometimes made special attempts to find a third moderate limitation even though the evidence did not support it.", "DDSs had also \u201cdouble-weighed\u201d the effects of impairments in more than one of the areas of ability assessed in the IFA process, making the impairment seem more severe and pervasive than it actually was. For example, in some cases children displayed a lack of self-control by exhibiting more than one inappropriate behavior, such as fighting, aggressive behavior, disrespectful behavior, lying, oppositional behavior, and stealing. Although all these behaviors should have been rated only in the personal/behavioral area, DDSs had rated some behaviors in the personal/behavioral area and others in the social abilities area, giving the child moderate limitations in two areas rather than only one. This meant that the child needed only one more moderate limitation to have the three moderate limitations needed for approval.", "SSA also found that DDSs had sometimes based decisions on old evidence when current evidence indicated children had improved and that DDSs had sometimes assessed limitations that could not be attributed to medical impairments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Inspector General Study", "paragraphs": ["As the IG reported in January 1995, IG staff reviewed the case files for a sample of 553 children whose applications were adjudicated by DDSs in 1992.

The IG attributed this problem to DDSs having difficulty in interpreting and complying with SSA guidelines for obtaining and evaluating evidence concerning the severity of the mental impairments of children on whom IFAs are conducted. The IG stated that these children have less severe impairments than those children determined to be disabled based on the impairment listing, making the assessment of the effects of their impairments on their ability to function age-appropriately more difficult.
