Preserving universal service, particularly in rural areas, is a goal of postal reform. GAO was asked to discuss (1) how USPS provides universal mail delivery services and access to postal services in both rural and urban areas; (2) what changes USPS is making or plans to make related to providing postal services, including changes that may affect rural areas; and (3) what are the major issues that have been raised related to how USPS provides postal services."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USPS provides its customers, regardless of where they live, with services that include mail delivery at no charge and access to retail services. However, differences exist in how, when, and where USPS provides these services. These differences have always existed due to the nation's geographic diversity and changes in technology, transportation, and communications. Universal postal service is not defined by law, but appropriations legislation requires 6-day mail delivery and prohibits USPS from closing small, rural post offices. Delivery and retail decisions are made primarily by local USPS officials with overarching guidance provided by national policies and procedures. Local decisions are based on cost and service factors, including the number and location of deliveries, quality of roads, employee safety, and mail volume. USPS has taken actions, and is planning future actions, to improve the efficiency of its delivery and retail networks. Overall, customers in urban and rural areas will probably not see significant changes in delivery services since most changes are focused on operational improvements. On the retail side, USPS plans to provide more cost-effective and convenient service by developing new, low-cost alternatives; moving stamp-only transactions away from post office counters; and optimizing its retail network. USPS's retail optimization involves tailoring services to communities' needs and replacing \"redundant, low-value access points with alternative access methods.\" It remains unclear how customers in rural areas will be affected by these retail initiatives since most are planned for high-growth, high-density areas. Generally, postal customers are satisfied with the services provided to them. The issues that have raised the greatest concerns from customers include inconsistent mail delivery and the threat of post office closings or reductions in post office hours. Also, concerns have been raised about USPS's limited communication regarding its planned changes to its networks. USPS's retail optimization could be an opportunity for USPS to reduce its costs while improving customer service. However, USPS needs to provide additional transparency and accountability mechanisms to better communicate its retail optimization plans and raise stakeholders' confidence that decisions will be made in a fair, rational, and fact-based manner."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The challenges facing the U.S. Postal Service (USPS)\u2014that is, record  declines in mail volumes for some high-margin products, difficulties in  controlling costs and enhancing revenues, and increases in competition\u2014 are not temporary problems that will fade away. Nevertheless, a common  message voiced by many postal stakeholders is that although change is  needed to address these and other significant challenges, the concept of  universal postal service needs to be preserved. These stakeholders believe  that providing universal postal service is the cornerstone of USPS\u2019s  mission; is essential to the nation\u2019s communications network and economy;  and is vital to the American people, many of whom rely upon the  consistency of mail delivery and convenient access to the retail postal  network. The concept of universal postal service, however, is not clearly  defined in law and has evolved over time with changes in technology,  transportation, and communications. These changes are continuing today,  raising some concerns about how they may affect future postal services\u2014 including those in rural areas.

We placed USPS\u2019s transformation  efforts and long-term outlook on our high-risk list and recommended that  USPS develop a comprehensive plan to determine the actions needed to  address its major challenges. USPS issued its Transformation Plan a year  later, which identified steps to guide future USPS operations. This plan  included specific actions aimed at making the delivery and retail networks  more efficient and convenient for customers, including promoting more  efficient delivery routes and utilizing low-cost retail transactions. The  President also recognized the importance of USPS\u2019s role and mission and  established the President\u2019s Commission on the United States Postal Service  (the President\u2019s Commission) to examine USPS\u2019s future. The President\u2019s  Commission issued a report in July 2003 that put forward a proposed vision  for USPS and recommendations to ensure the future viability of postal  services. The report emphasized the importance of maintaining 6-day-a- week, affordable, universal postal service and acknowledged that USPS\u2019s  mission is at risk in the current operating environment of increasing  competition and decreasing mail volumes. In addition, Congress is also  interested in maintaining a high level of postal services for the American  people and has held a number of hearings recently on postal reform issues.

Key events in postal history are listed  in table 1.", "Most customers in the early development of the national post office had to  pick up their mail from a post office. The first step toward universal  delivery service was taken in 1863 when Congress declared that free city  delivery would be established at post offices where income from postage  was sufficient to pay all expenses of delivery. Mail delivery service was  gradually extended to smaller cities and was later extended to rural areas  in 1902. Advances in the delivery of mail coincided with transportation  improvements. Various transportation modes developed throughout  history have been used to transport mail, ranging from stagecoaches in the  1700s; steamboats, trains, and the Pony Express in the 1800s; and finally by  airplanes, automobiles, and trucks in the 1900s. Furthermore, advances in  transportation were particularly important in rural areas; rural delivery  helped stimulate road improvements to these areas because passable roads  were a prerequisite for establishing new delivery routes.", "Throughout the nation\u2019s history, the post office has been a key component  in the provision of postal services. Post offices proliferated throughout the  1800s as the United States\u2019 territory grew and new postal routes were  established. At the turn of the 20th century, the number of post offices  reached its peak with nearly 77,000 offices, which was an average of 1 post  office for every 1,000 residents in the country (see fig. 1).", "The number of post offices per capita declined throughout the 20th century,  to an average of 1 post office for every 10,000 people in 2000. As  transportation improved, it became easier for rural carriers to deliver mail  to a wider area, which decreased reliance on post offices for being the  primary delivery and collection point.

At the time of this case, USPS estimated that  about 940,000 boxes would be offered free of charge as a result of this  policy. This proposal, however, did not require USPS to offer a free box to  all customers ineligible for carrier delivery, such as those ineligible due to  their proximity to a postal facility (i.e., the quarter-mile rule). These  customers would only be allowed to receive general delivery service at no  charge. The PRC, in its ensuing recommendation, raised issues about  inequities regarding customer eligibility for free box delivery and urged  USPS to rectify them.

Once it is determined that a customer is eligible for carrier service,  USPS determines the type of carrier route service that will be provided.  USPS has three primary carrier route categories\u2014city, rural, and highway  contract routes\u2014and has national policies and procedures that contain the  criteria used to establish, manage, and operate the three types of routes.  Excerpts from these policy and procedure manuals are provided in table 3.", "USPS\u2019s \u201crural\u201d designation does not necessarily reflect geographically  defined rural areas, and there is no population threshold for a USPS- designated rural or city route.

A USPS rural route such as one in Charlotte, North  Carolina, or Jacksonville, Florida, may cover a geographically defined  suburban area and may contain a similar number of delivery points as a city  route. USPS officials explained that many suburban areas met rural route  criteria when they were originally established. However, they also stated  that although the population may have grown in an area that now may be  considered suburban, USPS maintains existing operations in this situation.  Thus, it retains the rural route classification. A brief overview of these  route types is provided in table 4.", "City routes (67 percent of all routes) tend to be located in densely  populated areas with high concentrations of delivery points.

Rural routes encompass a wide range of areas, with some of the larger  routes serving hundreds of delivery points and some smaller routes having  just 1 delivery per mile. Not only are rural routes the fastest growing route  type, the number of deliveries per route (route density) is also increasing.  Figure 3 shows that rural routes with 12 or more deliveries per mile have  been increasing at a much faster rate than rural routes with fewer than 12  deliveries per mile. Furthermore, as shown in table 4, the average deliveries  per route for city routes and rural routes are relatively similar, 513 and 474,  respectively.", "The remaining 4 percent of routes are highway contract routes (10,065 in  fiscal year 2003), which serve areas that are not serviced by city or rural  routes.

Figure 4 provides the number of these modes of  delivery as of the end of fiscal year 2003.", "Door delivery once was the norm in urban settings; however, USPS  changed its policy in 1978 to limit additional door deliveries to further  enhance delivery efficiencies (door deliveries remain the most expensive  mode of delivery). As a result, curbline delivery and centralized delivery are  the fastest growing modes of delivery. According to USPS delivery officials,  the only instance where new delivery points would receive door delivery  would be if the new delivery point is established on a block that currently  receives door delivery. Centralized units include cluster boxes,  Neighborhood Delivery Collection Box Units (NDCBU), and apartment- style boxes. Cluster box units are centralized units of individually locked  compartments, while NDCBUs are centralized units of more than eight  individually locked compartments. Between fiscal years 2001 and 2003, the  number of curbline boxes increased by more than 2 million; the number of  centralized boxes has grown by about 1.8 million; and the number of other  deliveries (primarily door), which are not available for most new deliveries,  decreased by almost 400,000."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Differences in Delivery Service Are Based on Cost and Service Considerations", "paragraphs": ["According to USPS, it must balance the legal requirement to operate as a  break-even entity with the need to serve its customers in a competitive  environment.

If  carrier service is provided, USPS incurs the cost of providing the  personnel and transportation to support these services, but most  customers receive their mail closer to their residences or businesses. On  the other hand, requiring customers to travel to their respective post  office to collect mail may be more inconvenient for the customer, but  USPS does not have to incur personnel and transportation costs  associated with carrier delivery.  6-day-a-week delivery v. something less than 6-day-a-week delivery.", "According to USPS, the more days that delivery is provided, the higher  the cost of providing this service. On the other hand, customers,  Congress, and the President\u2019s Commission have noted the importance of  6-day-a-week delivery. USPS studied the impact of eliminating Saturday  delivery and found that the possible savings were not significant enough  to offset the potential risks that any reduction in delivery days would  have a negative impact on USPS\u2019s competitive position.", "City v. rural v. highway contract box delivery routes. Although the  delivery service provided on each of these routes is generally similar,  carriers on rural and highway contract routes provide retail services,  such as stamp sales, while city carriers do not. A USPS official stated  that there are significant cost differences between the different types of  routes. USPS estimated that the additional annual cost in fiscal year  2003 for each city door delivery ($295) was more than twice as  expensive as rural delivery ($143) and over three times as expensive as  highway contract deliveries ($90). The USPS official stated that a key  factor in determining the total cost of a route is the carriers\u2019  compensation systems, which differ for each group of carriers. The  systems for city and rural carriers are collectively bargained between  USPS and their associated unions\u2014the National Association of Letter  Carriers (NALC) represents city carriers, and the National Rural Letter  Carriers Association (NRLCA) represents rural carriers. Generally  speaking, city carriers are compensated on an hourly basis, while rural  carriers are compensated on a salary basis. Agreements entered into by  these groups also establish duties and responsibilities for the carriers  and USPS management. Compensation for contract carriers are  established via the contract posted by USPS.", "Door v. curbline v. centralized modes of delivery. According to USPS,  the cost per delivery generally increases as the delivery is made closer  to the customer\u2019s door. Delivery to a customer\u2019s door is the least  efficient mode of delivery because the carrier has to dismount from the  vehicle. Deliveries to centralized units, such as cluster boxes and  NDCBUs, are the most efficient form of carrier delivery because carriers  can make multiple deliveries in one stop. The mode of delivery to be  provided is considered by USPS when determining the type of service  that will be used. For example, most deliveries on rural and highway  contract routes are farther away from the customer\u2019s front door than  deliveries on city routes. Figure 5 shows that most rural and highway  contract deliveries in fiscal year 2003 were to the curb rather than at the  door.", "Other delivery (primarily door)", "USPS local officials select the delivery option that provides service in the  most efficient and cost-effective manner, and they consider numerous cost  and customer service factors when making these decisions.

This section identifies  access points currently provided by USPS, describes differences in the  network, and explains why these differences exist.", "The wide variety of retail options currently offered by USPS differs  significantly from its original retail network. Changes in technology,  transportation, and geography diminished the need for a large network of  post offices, and the number of post offices per capita has consistently  declined since the early 1900s (see fig. 1). Table 5 shows that over the last  20 years, the number of post offices, stations, and branches has decreased  by over 1,900 units.

The number of post  offices and retail facilities compared with the population of the area served  differs throughout the country. Appendix II provides information on the  number of retail postal facilities in each state, along with each state\u2019s  population. For example, states such as North Dakota and South Dakota  that have a relatively low-population density tend to have a lower ratio of  people per USPS retail facility (i.e., fewer than 2,000 residents for every  USPS retail facility). On the other hand, states such as Florida and  California that have a relatively high-population density tend to have a  higher ratio of people per USPS retail facility (i.e., about 15,000 residents  for every USPS retail facility).", "Postal officials told us that customers of smaller post offices tend to be  more dependent on their post office for access to the postal network.  Survey data collected for the President\u2019s Commission showed that rural  customers reported visiting their post offices more often than customers in  urban areas. This issue of dependency is important to note when  considering retail access because USPS recognizes that customer use of  post offices versus other retail alternatives varies. For example, according  to USPS, many of the new retail alternatives, such as consignment with  private retailers such as grocery stores and ATMs, have been deployed  primarily in high-growth, high-population areas (coincidentally, these areas  are where many retail competitors to USPS are located). Customers in  these high-growth, high-population areas may not be as dependent on a  post office for meeting their daily postal needs, and therefore they utilize  these alternative methods of accessing USPS\u2019s retail network."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Retail Decisions Are Based on Cost and Customer Access Considerations", "paragraphs": ["Differences exist throughout the postal network in terms of how and where  customers have access to USPS\u2019s retail network.

Some customers, however, may not have Internet service or may prefer  going to their local post office to conduct their postal transactions.  Moreover, USPS has stated that opening new post offices is considered  only when area service needs cannot be met through its current facilities or  by less costly alternatives. USPS has stated that whenever possible it  establishes contract postal units, which can provide equal service without  the costs associated with building and operating new post offices.

These  initiatives include sending managers through a training program to ensure  that they understand the basic concepts of managing rural delivery;  distributing electronic operations newsletters that provide specific  strategies for reducing rural workhours and raising awareness of the need  to focus on rural management; and implementing a rural time review,  which is a process to examine and analyze the timekeeping, recording, and  reporting process for rural delivery.", "On a more comprehensive, nationwide basis, USPS has implemented  initiatives aimed at increasing the efficiency of the overall delivery  network. USPS has established a route optimization effort meant to help  determine the best way to route carriers. USPS hopes this effort will lead to  a reduction in workhours, vehicle mileage, and costs, while at the same  time improving safety. According to USPS, automation improvements, such  as the Delivery Point Sequencing of mail, will increase efficiency by  automating some of the mail sorting activities that are currently done  manually by mail carriers. This automation would decrease the amount of  time that a carrier would spend sorting the mail and increase the amount of  time that a carrier could be out making more deliveries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Actions to Improve Efficiency and Customer Access to USPS\u2019s Retail Network", "paragraphs": ["Both USPS and the President\u2019s Commission have recognized that USPS  needs to adjust its retail network so that it provides the optimal level of  retail access at the lowest possible cost. The retail service options available  to rural customers will largely remain the same, with the exception of rural  customers who have access to the Internet (www.usps.com). USPS  officials stated that USPS plans to deploy most other new retail alternatives  in high-growth, high-density areas, such as fast-growing suburbs. However,  it is not clear why some retail alternatives that offer greater customer  convenience, such as stamp purchases at grocery or other retail stores,  may not be provided to those in rural areas. Further, it is not clear how  rural customers may be impacted by USPS\u2019s retail optimization efforts to  close and/or consolidate retail facilities. In its Transformation Plan, USPS  stated that its planned efforts to improve access to retail services for all  customers while becoming more cost-effective include three key  initiatives: (1) Create new, low-cost retail alternatives. USPS identified ways to  provide cost-effective services that improve customer convenience and  access by utilizing low-cost retail alternatives, such as the Internet, ATMs,  and supermarkets. According to USPS, most of the alternatives are aimed  at providing additional access to high-growth, high-revenue areas where  demand for services is more concentrated and will not be available in less- populated areas. For example, many of the 666 contract postal units  opened in fiscal year 2003 were in urban areas such as Los Angeles,  California, and Orlando, Florida. However, USPS noted two alternatives  that would be available to most customers, including those in rural areas\u2014 the Internet, for customers with access, and the recently implemented  \u201cClick-N-Ship\u201d program. USPS\u2019s Internet Web site is available to customers  24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and was designed to handle most retail  transactions that take place in local post offices, such as printing shipping  labels and postage for packages, buying stamps, sending money orders, and  filing address changes. USPS\u2019s Click-N-Ship program allows customers to  print shipping labels for packages and pay for postage using their  computers. Customers can arrange to have their mail carrier pick up the  package, or they can leave it in a mail collection box or at their local post  office. This carrier pick-up service is currently available in urban and  suburban areas, and USPS and the NRLCA have recently agreed to conduct  a nationwide pilot that would test this program on rural routes. (2) Move stamp-only transactions away from the post office window. The  new, low-cost retail alternatives provide USPS with an opportunity to  increase the efficiency of postal transactions. In fiscal year 2003, about one- third of the visits to USPS retail facilities included stamp purchases, and  over 130 million visits were for stamp-only purchases. Smaller post offices  tend to conduct a higher percentage of stamp-only transactions. As  indicated in its Transformation Plan, window service at a post office is a  relatively expensive way to provide stamp purchases when compared with  low-cost alternatives, such as providing stamp purchases from ATMs,  through the mail, from the Internet, or from a grocery store. In addition,  residents on rural and highway contract routes can purchase stamps and  other retail services from their mail carriers. USPS has begun to promote  the use of these alternatives for postal transactions; in November 2002,  USPS launched a national campaign promoting alternative access to postal  products to create customer awareness of stamp-purchasing alternatives.  Between fiscal year 2002 and 2003, the number of stamp-only visits at  postal facilities decreased by about 25 million (a 16 percent reduction), and  the number of stamp transactions decreased by about 60 million (a 10  percent reduction). (3) Optimize the retail network. As simple transactions such as selling  stamps and printing shipping labels are redirected to lower cost  alternatives, USPS plans to take actions to tailor retail services to the  individual community needs and provide the optimal level of retail access  at the least possible cost. USPS has established a nationwide database of  its retail network that includes about 150 data points for each of its retail  postal facilities, such as operating costs, revenues, proximity to other retail  points, number of deliveries, and customer demographics. This database  provides USPS with a baseline for evaluating its network, from which it  plans to first focus its retail strategy on \u201cunderserved\u201d locations. USPS then  plans to focus on high-revenue locations, most of which are located in  urban and suburban areas. Lastly, USPS will focus on \u201coverrepresented\u201d  areas. The Transformation Plan stated that USPS would replace  \u201credundant, low-value access points\u201d with alternative access methods, but  it did not provide information on the specific criteria that USPS would use  to make this determination. It is unclear how post offices in rural areas may  be affected by this initiative, because, as USPS stated in its Infrastructure  and Workforce Rationalization Plan to Congress, \u201cthe savings from closing  small post offices are minimal, since the potential savings in personnel and  office rent are often more than offset by the additional cost of rural delivery  service needed in lieu of post office box delivery.\u201d  Another approach,  recommended by the President\u2019s Commission, would be for USPS to  optimize its retail network by assessing its \u201clow-activity\u201d post offices to  determine if they are needed to ensure the fulfillment of universal service.  If USPS determines that these post offices are needed, they should be  retained, even if they are not economical. If not, the President\u2019s  Commission stated that USPS should work with the affected community to  consider how to dispose of excess facilities.", "USPS has begun taking actions to optimize its retail network by lifting the  self-imposed moratorium established in 1998 on closing post offices and by  adjusting post office hours. During fiscal year 2003, USPS formally closed  about 440 post offices and other retail facilities, more than half of which  USPS had placed on emergency suspension. A post office can be placed on  emergency suspension due to circumstances such as a natural disaster,  sudden loss of the post office building lease when no suitable alternative  quarters are available, or severe damage to or destruction of the post office  building. An emergency suspension is one of three circumstances that may  prompt USPS to initiate a feasibility study to determine whether to close a  post office. The other two are (1) a postmaster vacancy and (2) special  circumstances such as the incorporation of two communities into one.  USPS plans to close 311 post offices in fiscal year 2004 that were placed on  emergency suspension between February 1983 and June 2003. An  additional 65 post offices that were placed on emergency suspension  between August 2002 and November 2003 are not scheduled to close. USPS  has reported that post office closures will continue, and that in a normal  year about 100 to 200 small, rural post offices are closed when the  communities in which these offices are located essentially disappear.", "According to USPS, it has also adjusted hours at existing post offices from  time to time to reflect customer demand. Although USPS could not provide  information on the number of post offices where changes in hours  occurred in fiscal year 2003, it did provide a description of how hour  adjustments are made. According to USPS officials, postmasters are  responsible for establishing window service hours based on the needs of  the community within the funding resources. Officials noted that they  periodically assess the number of transactions and customer visits  throughout the day to determine the appropriate hours, and that hours may  be extended or shortened in response to customer demand. USPS reported  that its efforts to increase efficiencies in its retail area have resulted in a  decrease of almost 5 million workhours from fiscal years 2002 to 2003."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Issues Include Delivery Inconsistencies and the Uncertain Future of Retail Network", "paragraphs": ["USPS and the President\u2019s Commission both have recognized the need for  establishing a postal network that is capable of providing universal service  in an efficient and cost-effective manner.

According to surveys conducted both by USPS and for  the President\u2019s Commission, customers are generally satisfied with the  services provided by USPS. However, when issues are raised by postal  stakeholders, including Members of Congress, customers, and USPS  employees, they generally relate to inconsistent delivery services and  limited communication related to planned changes to the retail network.  USPS has also raised issues about legal requirements and practical  constraints that limit its flexibility to make changes to the postal network.

The Postal Reorganization Act contained specific provisions  requiring that effective postal services would be ensured to residents of  both urban and rural communities. Congress had additional concerns  about community involvement in decisions to close or consolidate post  offices. In 1976, it amended the Postal Reorganization Act and established  specific requirements for USPS when attempting to close a post office,  including that USPS must consider the effects on the community served,  the employees of the facility, and economic savings to USPS that would  result from the closure, as well as provide notice to customers. This  amendment sought to involve communities in decisions, which would help  to ensure that these decisions were made in a fair, consistent manner. The  amendment also established an appeals process to the PRC to allow for  independent review of decisions to close or consolidate post offices.  Congress has long included language in USPS annual appropriations  legislation forbidding the closure or consolidation of small, rural post  offices.", "The closure requirements added by this amendment, however, did not  apply to postal facilities that were to be expanded, relocated, or newly  constructed, and Congress remained concerned that communities were not  sufficiently involved in decisions regarding their post offices. In 1998, USPS  responded to these concerns by establishing regulations relating to the  expansion, relocation, or new construction of post offices that required  local officials and citizens to be notified, provided affected customers with  a chance to provide comments, and required USPS officials to consider this  community input. However, postal facilities placed in emergency  suspension were not subject to the post office closure or consolidation  requirements. A 1999 congressional hearing focused on USPS\u2019s closure  process when some stakeholders raised concerns that USPS might be using  its emergency suspension procedures to avoid post office closure  requirements. We issued a report on emergency suspensions in 1997 and  found that between the beginning of fiscal year 1992 through March 31,  1997, USPS had suspended the operations of 651 post offices, some of  which had been in suspension over 10 years. After USPS lifted its 1998  moratorium on closures in 2003, USPS began to close most of its  suspended post offices.", "Concerns remain about the extent to which customers are included in retail  decisions as evidenced by the fact that current Members of Congress  continue to introduce legislation related to USPS\u2019s process for closing post  offices and ensuring that communities are involved in the decision-making  process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USPS Employee Issues", "paragraphs": ["Employee groups are concerned with USPS\u2019s attempts to make changes to  the postal network.

Carrier compensation  represents a significant portion of the total delivery costs, which is a key  consideration in USPS\u2019s delivery route decisions. For a number of years,  USPS, the NALC, and the NRLCA have had a continuing dispute over the  assignment of work jurisdictions for mail delivery. These disputes pertain  to the conversion of city delivery to rural delivery, or vice versa, and the  assignment of new deliveries (whether a new route will be a city route or a  rural route). There were an estimated 1,300 disputes at the national and  local levels related to this issue at the end of 2003. USPS and the two  unions established a joint task force in May 2003 to expedite resolution of  outstanding city/rural jurisdictional disputes.

Furthermore, Members  of Congress and other stakeholders have often intervened in the past when  USPS has attempted to close post offices or consolidate postal facilities.  Proposed post office closures have provoked intense opposition because  local post offices are sometimes viewed as (1) a critical means of obtaining  ready access to postal retail services, (2) a part of American culture and  business, and (3) critical to the viability of certain towns or central  business districts. In regards to its delivery network, USPS appropriations  acts have included provisions on 6-day-a-week delivery and rural mail  service, and there is strong stakeholder opposition to cuts in the frequency  or quality of postal services.
