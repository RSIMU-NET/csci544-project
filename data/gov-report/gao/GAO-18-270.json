The Office\u2019s work got little traction while the acting  was in charge, in part because the Office was without a permanent leader and the agency did not feel compelled to pay attention to OIG recommendations.\u201d \u201cI believe the greatest challenge to anyone in an acting role has more to do with authority than it has to do with independence . . . . I believe  it is often difficult for anyone in an acting position to think long-term  and make decisions that have long-term implications because they (1)  have no idea how long they will be acting and (2) may be overruled or  have decisions reversed by a permanent appointee.

To address  these objectives we included in our scope the 64 active OIGs that were  established under the IG Act of 1978, as amended (IG Act).", "To determine the status of IG vacancies as of the end of fiscal year 2017,  we obtained the vacancy data from the 64 OIGs active under the IG Act,  and documented any changes for fiscal year 2017. To identify IG  vacancies and changes for fiscal years 2007 through 2016, we first  obtained vacancy data from the Council of the Inspectors General on  Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE). We interviewed CIGIE personnel to  obtain an understanding of issues related to IG vacancies and to discuss  the reliability of the vacancy data. Data obtained from CIGIE included the  resignation dates of the permanent IGs, vacancy start and end dates,  names of the acting IGs, names of newly appointed IGs, and whether  each IG was presidentially appointed, Senate confirmed (PAS) or  appointed by the head of a designated federal entity (DFE). We also  obtained nominations from Congress.gov, which included information on  nominated IGs and the status of those nominations. As part of our data  reliability procedures, we confirmed the vacancy data with the 64 OIGs  established under the IG Act. We reviewed and summarized the IG  vacancy data and documented any changes in IG vacancies for fiscal  years 2007 through 2016. In 2014, the IG appointment structure for the  IGs of the National Security Agency and National Reconnaissance Office  was changed from DFE to PAS. For the 10-year period under review,  these two OIGs experienced vacancies during both their DFE and new  PAS status. However, to avoid duplicating the agencies, we only counted  the number and length of vacancies for each agency under the PAS IGs.", "To obtain the views of the IG community\u2014specifically, permanent IGs,  acting IGs, and employees working under an acting IG\u2014on the impact  that a prolonged IG vacancy can have on the OIG\u2019s ability to carry out its  duties effectively, including any impact on independence, we conducted  web-based surveys of 54 IG Act OIGs. These surveys included both  multiple choice and open-ended questions for written responses to obtain  the views of the IG community on the impacts of vacancies, if any, and  views on independence, challenges, and positive outcomes. The  surveyed groups were as follows:  Fifty-two permanent IGs serving as of August 22, 2017.We used both multiple choice questions and open-ended questions to obtain their views on the impact that an IG vacancy could have on the OIG\u2019s ability to conduct its oversight, including any independence issues presented by acting IG. We also asked the permanent IGs to provide any suggestions for improvements in the appointment process. The survey was administered on the web from August 22, 2017, through September 29, 2017. The survey response rate of permanent IGs was 96 percent: 50 of the 52 permanent IGs completed the survey. Two permanent IGs did not respond to the survey.", "Nine acting IGs who had served for over 365 days from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. We used both multiple choice questions and open-ended questions to obtain their views on the impact that a prolonged vacancy could have on the acting IG\u2019s ability to carry out his or her duties, including any impact on independence. The survey was administered on the web from August 22, 2017, through September 29, 2017. The survey response rate of acting IGs was 100 percent. While 14 acting IGs met our selection criteria, 4 have either retired or have since left the government and were not surveyed. The National Reconnaissance Office\u2019s acting IG was excluded because of concerns regarding sensitive personally identifiable information. Of the 9 remaining acting IGs, 2 are now permanent IGs but provided responses for their acting IG tenure, which were included with those of the 7 acting IGs. In this report, we refer to all nine as acting IGs.", "A stratified random sample of 185 OIG employees consisting of 39 Senior Executive Service (SES) employees and 146 non-SES OIG employees, from OIGs with an acting IG in place for over 365 days from fiscal years 2014 through 2016. We used both multiple choice questions and open-ended questions to obtain the employee views about challenges related to working under an acting IG as compared to a permanent IG. The web-based survey was administered from September 11, 2017, through September 29, 2017. We had a weighted survey response rate of 71 percent; 133 of the sample of 185 employees completed the survey.", "Because we followed a probability procedure based on random  selections, our OIG employee sample is only one of a large number of  samples that we might have drawn. Since each sample could have  provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the precision  of our particular sample\u2019s results as a 95 percent confidence interval  (e.g., plus or minus 10 percentage points). This is the interval that would  contain the actual population value for 95 percent of the samples we  could have drawn. Confidence intervals are provided along with each  sample estimate in the report. Estimates from the employee survey are  generalizable to the population of employees from OIGs that had an  acting IG in place for over 365 days from fiscal years 2014 through 2016.  To minimize nonsampling errors, and to enhance data quality, we  employed recognized survey design practices in the development of the  questionnaire and in the collection, processing, and analysis of the survey  data. To minimize errors arising from differences in how questions might  be interpreted and to reduce variability in responses that should be  qualitatively the same, we conducted pretests with permanent IGs, acting  IGs, and employees.", "To ensure that we obtained a variety of perspectives on our survey  questions, we randomly selected three permanent IGs, two acting IGs,  and two employees for the pretests. Based on their feedback, we revised  each survey in order to improve the clarity of the questions. An  independent survey specialist within GAO also reviewed a draft of each  survey prior to its administration. To reduce nonresponse, another source  of nonsampling error, we followed up by e-mail or phone with the IGs,  acting IGs, and employees who had not responded to encourage them to  complete the survey.", "We did not survey a total of 10 IG Act OIGs. Nine OIGs were not  surveyed because there was no permanent IG in position or the acting IG  at the time of our survey did not meet our criteria of serving for more than  365 days from fiscal year 2014 through 2016. Those OIGs were at the  U.S. Postal Service, Social Security Administration, Small Business  Administration, Office of Personnel Management, National Security  Agency, Federal Election Commission, Department of Housing and Urban  Development, Department of Energy, and Department of Defense. In  addition, one OIG, the National Reconnaissance Office, was not surveyed  because of concerns regarding sensitive personally identifiable  information.", "We also performed a two-step content analysis on the open-ended survey  responses to summarize key ideas. In the first step, analysts read the  respondents\u2019 comments and jointly developed categories for them. In the  second step, each open-ended response was coded by one analyst, and  then those codes were verified by another analyst. Any coding  discrepancies were resolved by the analysts discussing the comments  and then agreeing on the code. In some cases, we edited responses for  clarity or grammar. Views expressed in the open-ended questions may  not be representative of all acting IGs, permanent IGs, or employees on  given topics. We did not assess the merits of the individual comments or  suggestions provided in response to the open-ended survey questions.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2017 to March 2018  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
