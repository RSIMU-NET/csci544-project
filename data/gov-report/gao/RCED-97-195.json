Under the loan fund, communities may borrow up to 5 times their current year\u2019s CDBG allotment using their current and future CDBG grants as the principal collateral. Initially, only CDBG entitlement communities\u2014large metropolitan areas and urban counties that receive CDBG grants directly\u2014were eligible for the loan fund; in 1990, nonentitlement communities\u2014small cities and rural areas that receive CDBG grants through their states\u2014became eligible for the fund.", "Loan proceeds may be used, for the most part, for the same activities as CDBG grants; but because the loan amount can be substantially larger than the annual CDBG grant, communities may use the loan proceeds to finance much larger community development efforts. HUD approves loan commitments but does not directly fund the loan program. Rather, the loans are financed through periodic public offerings of pooled loans on the private sector-capital market and are guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. To encourage communities to make greater use of the loan program, the Congress substantially increased the amount of funds available for the program in 1993. In 1994, it established Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grants, which communities may use to help fund projects or to pay for some of the costs associated with borrowing under the loan program.", "Concerned about how these changes had affected the loan program, you asked us to examine (1) the extent to which communities are using the loan fund, (2) factors affecting communities\u2019 willingness to use the fund, (3) the types of projects being financed with loan proceeds, and (4) HUD\u2019s procedures for overseeing the program. This report is based on HUD\u2019s data over the life of the program and a representative sample of 100 loans made in fiscal years 1990 through 1996 that had funding advances. The loan sample was designed to allow us to estimate the types of activities that have been financed by communities and states for those years."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The loan program provides communities and states with a way of leveraging their CDBG awards to obtain additional resources for financing larger community revitalization projects without waiting for the actual CDBG award. The loans can have repayment terms of up to 20 years.", "In the loan program, as in the CDBG program, communities and states must use their loan proceeds only for activities that meet one or more of three national objectives: (1) benefit low- and moderate-income people\u2014that is, households earning less than 80 percent of the local area\u2019s median income; (2) aid in the prevention and elimination of slums or blight; or (3) meet other urgent community development needs. In addition, the loan proceeds must be used to help finance one or more of the activities cited in section 108 of the 1974 act. These activities include, among others, the acquisition of real property; the rehabilitation of real property, either publicly owned or acquired; housing rehabilitation and preservation; and economic development.", "Although current and future CDBG grants are the principal collateral for loans, since 1995, communities have had to provide additional collateral. To meet this requirement, HUD has generally approved loans only for those activities expected to generate a cash flow that would allow the community to repay the guaranteed loan. A 1994 amendment to the program expanded the list of eligible activities to include the acquisition and restoration of public facilities, which would generally not produce a cash flow to repay the debt. In addition to revenue generated from the project, communities and states may designate tax revenues or other revenue sources as the additional collateral. The Treasury has never had to use public funds to fulfill the federal guarantee, according to HUD\u2019s 1996 Consolidated Annual Report to Congress.", "Eligible applicants include the CDBG grantees: (1) entitlement communities\u2014generally cities designated as central cities of metropolitan statistical areas, other cities with populations of at least 50,000, and qualified urban counties\u2014that are directly responsible for administering their grants and (2) nonentitlement communities\u2014smaller communities, including many rural communities whose CDBG programs are administered by the state. Nonentitlement communities became eligible for the loan program through the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act of 1990.", "Both HUD headquarters and field offices play a role in managing the loan program. Generally, headquarters provides final approval; negotiates loan terms with applicants; and, through HUD\u2019s fiscal agent, arranges for the sale of the loans. The fiscal agent acts as a trustee under contract to HUD and, among other duties, collects loan payments from the communities and notifies HUD to take funds from communities\u2019 CDBG allotment when payments are not received. Field offices assist communities and states in preparing applications, make recommendations to headquarters to approve or deny loans, and monitor funded activities.", "HUD has financial monitoring procedures to safeguard against communities\u2019 or states\u2019 defaulting on their loans. HUD\u2019s fiscal agent must receive the loan payment 5 days before it is due. Payments are due either semiannually or quarterly. If the payment is not received, the fiscal agent notifies the HUD headquarters program office, which contacts the cognizant community or state. If the fiscal agent does not receive payment within 72 hours of the payment\u2019s due date, HUD will make the loan payment using funds from the community\u2019s or state\u2019s CDBG allocation. When payments are made late, HUD will credit the community\u2019s or state\u2019s CDBG allocation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Loan Program Recently Experienced Significant Growth", "paragraphs": ["Between fiscal years 1994 and 1996, communities and states used the loan program in far greater numbers than ever before. Over this period, HUD approved nearly 60 percent of all the funds loaned, for a total of $2.63 billion. From the program\u2019s inception through September 1996, HUD made 930 commitments to guarantee loans totaling $4.4 billion. Figure 1 shows the number of approved loan commitments from 1978\u2014when the first loan application was approved\u2014through September 1996.", "Entitlement communities used the program significantly more than nonentitlement communities. About 38 percent of entitlement communities have received 884 loan guarantees totaling $4.2 billion. Nonentitlement communities in 16 states have received 46 loan guarantees totaling $235 million. Even though the program has recently experienced significant growth, the level of loan commitments has always been below the level approved by the Congress. For example, in fiscal year 1995\u2014the program\u2019s most active year\u2014HUD approved $1.8 billion in commitments, while the Congress had appropriated $2.1 billion in commitments for that fiscal year. Figure 2 shows the level of commitments approved by the Congress and actual loan commitment levels through September 1996."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EDI Grants Spurred Program Growth, but Concerns About Collateral Remain", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD and associations representing community development officials, EDI grants encouraged communities to make greater use of the loan program. HUD provided $369 million in EDI grants from fiscal year 1994 through September 1996. However, according to these officials, the program continues to be underutilized because (1) many communities and states are reluctant to pledge their future CDBG funds as collateral for the loans, as the 1974 act, as amended, requires, and (2) collateral requirements imposed in 1995 and new procedural guidelines are likely to make communities even more reluctant to use the program."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "EDI Grants Encouraged Increased Loan Program Use", "paragraphs": ["Recent growth in the use of the loan program was primarily stimulated by the introduction of EDI grants in fiscal year 1994, according to HUD and associations representing community development officials. HUD provided EDI grants for 123 out of the 395 loan commitments made between fiscal years 1994 and 1995. These EDI grants totaled $369 million. (App.1 provides detailed information on EDI grants approved during fiscal years 1994 through 1995.)", "The EDI grants enhance the program\u2019s use because the communities and states can use the grant funds in a number of ways to cover the costs of administering the program, such as creating a loss reserve and writing down loan rates to businesses financing projects within the program. By helping to finance some of the projects\u2019 costs, the grant money also strengthens the economic feasibility of the assisted projects.", "According to one CDBG entitlement community, the ability to receive an EDI grant along with a loan commitment from the loan fund was the key factor making it possible for the community to take out the loan. If not for the EDI grant, this community would have sought funds from alternative lending sources or issued bonds itself.", "Communities may use their EDI grants in different ways. For example, in 1994, Los Angeles was awarded a $300 million loan commitment\u2014the largest single loan amount granted under this program\u2014to establish and assist in funding a community development bank. The bank\u2019s mission is to stimulate economic development that will create and/or retain jobs for Los Angeles\u2019 low- and moderate-income families. In addition to the loan commitment, the city was awarded a $100 million EDI grant, bringing the bank\u2019s total reserves to $400 million. The bank will provide loans, loan guarantees, venture capital investments, grants, and technical assistance to area businesses. In another instance, Kingston, New York, was awarded a $3.7 million loan to establish two revolving loan funds, one to rehabilitate housing and one to assist small businesses that are locating or expanding at a former IBM facility. In addition to the loan commitment, the city was awarded a $555,000 EDI grant to establish a revolving loan fund offering below-market interest rates for small businesses and a loan loss reserve."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collateral Requirements May Discourage Use of the Loan Program", "paragraphs": ["Even though communities and states generally view the loan program favorably, they have concerns about the current collateral requirements and the proposed guidance to communities on the collateral to be used when providing third-party loans. As the law requires, communities and states must pledge current and future CDBG grants as the principal collateral for their loan. According to officials from five of six associations that represent community development officials, the collateral requirements are a concern for their members. For example, one association representative told us that while many of the association\u2019s members who used the program viewed it positively, the overall membership was slow to use the program because of the requirement to pledge future CDBG grants.", "Beginning in February 1995, HUD required all communities and states to pledge collateral beyond their CDBG grant. Previously, only communities and states that had loan repayment terms for 10 years or longer and, in some cases, loans with shorter repayment periods (such as those with \u201cballoon\u201d payments), had to pledge additional collateral. HUD\u2019s new requirement was in response to the Credit Reform Act of 1990 and resulting directives from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The 1990 act required agencies to calculate subsidy costs for loan guarantee programs. This cost is the amount of appropriation an agency must have in order to cover anticipated losses in the program. In calculating this cost, OMB told HUD that it cannot use future CDBG grants as the only source of collateral for the loan. If additional collateral were not required, the subsidy cost on the loan program would be prohibitively high. According to HUD\u2019s requirements, for loans that financed some type of tangible item, such as a building or equipment, the items themselves can serve as additional collateral. For public infrastructure activities, additional collateral will generally come from income related to CDBG activities, such as interest from repayments of housing rehabilitation loans. As a final option, communities can pledge revenues from future tax collections.", "In addition to concerns about collateral, association officials questioned the proposed more stringent guidelines on third-party loans, such as loans that communities make to businesses. HUD plans to issue draft guidance for review and comment on the procedures that communities and states may follow in granting loans from the loan program to third parties. The proposed guidelines would seek to minimize third-party default rates by using commercial lending practices as the benchmark for the communities\u2019 own loan activities. HUD\u2019s program manager recognized that the new guidance may make communities more reluctant to use the program and acknowledged that HUD will have to find ways to help communities adapt to the new guidelines. HUD stated that it is proposing this guidance in response to the 1990 credit reform act, and we identified five instances in which third parties had defaulted on the loans they had received from the community that had secured the loan with its CDBG allotment. Nevertheless, several associations questioned this guidance because it moves the loan program toward more stringent commercial lending practices. They believed the use of more conservative lending practices as a benchmark for any public benefit program is unrealistic and inappropriate because such projects by their nature are riskier and would be unable to qualify in a conservative lending environment.", "In a letter commenting on a draft of this report, HUD stressed that the underwriting guidelines will not be issued as regulations and their use will not be mandatory. HUD noted that the guidelines are not intended to be used in connection with improvements to public facilities and other activities that do not generate revenue, and that communities will still be able to use CDBG funds to repay loans used to finance activities that do not generate revenue. HUD also noted, however, that communities will have to furnish alternative security to protect the federal financial interest in the event that future appropriations are not made for the CDBG program.", "According to one CDBG participant, that state chose not to participate in the loan program for its nonentitlement communities because pledging the state\u2019s future CDBG funds would put other nonentitlement communities at risk of losing their CDBG funds if the community receiving the funds were to default. This official added that while the benefits of leveraging future CDBG grants are tempting, the risk posed by the loan on future CDBG awards is too great because of the impact on countless low- and moderate-income persons around the state who depend on CDBG-funded activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HUD Does Not Track Communities\u2019 Use of CDBG Funds to Make Loan Payments", "paragraphs": ["According to the director of HUD\u2019s loan program, communities intend, in most instances, to repay loans with revenues generated by the funded project or from another revenue source identified by the community or state in its loan application. The director emphasized that identifying a viable source of revenue other than the CDBG for loan payments was a critical consideration in HUD\u2019s review of a loan application. However, HUD was not able to provide information on communities\u2019 actual use of CDBG funds to cover shortfalls when the intended revenue sources for loan payments do not materialize because it has not been tracking these payments. The director agreed that this is important information that HUD should be tracking to improve its oversight of the program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Communities Used Loans Primarily for Economic Development Activities", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of our sample of 100 loans approved in fiscal years 1990 through 1996 that had funding advances, we estimated the types of activities reported as funded by the program for these years. Our analysis relied on the information that the communities and states reported to HUD. (App. II provides detailed information on loans approved in fiscal years 1990 through 1996 that had funding advances, and app. III provides detailed information, estimates, and sampling errors for the data presented in this report.)", "By an overwhelming margin, both entitlement and nonentitlement borrowers reported that they used their loan funds to finance economic development activities. However, nonentitlement communities were more likely than entitlement communities to report that they used their funds for economic development. Table 1 shows our estimates of the types of activities funded overall and by entitlement and nonentitlement communities.", "Loans for economic development were made for activities such as constructing shopping centers, creating revolving loan funds, and rehabilitating hotels and restaurants. On the basis of the information provided to HUD by communities and states, we estimate that at least $1.3 billion was used to finance an economic development activity. This estimate is conservative and includes only instances in which the community reported funds being used for only one purpose. As noted earlier, in reporting to HUD, communities and states could indicate more than one eligible activity for the loan commitment.", "Figure 3 shows our estimates of the type of economic development activities funded. As the figure shows, 46 percent of the loans went to support for-profit, start-up businesses or to retain for-profit businesses.", "Establishing revolving loan funds is one method that communities use to make even greater use of CDBG funds by providing funding for businesses that might otherwise not qualify for commercial lending opportunities. While we estimate that only 6 percent of the loans were used to establish or enhance such funds, about half of the entitlement communities with the largest loans reported using loan commitments to finance a revolving loan fund. Only one nonentitlement community reported using loan proceeds for this purpose.", "These revolving loan funds are used to finance a variety of businesses. For example, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, reported using $20 million in loan proceeds to establish a revolving loan fund for small and mid-sized inner-city businesses. The program\u2019s goal is to foster the retention and expansion of inner-city businesses. Eligible businesses will receive long-term, fixed-rate loans that conventional banks have been unwilling to provide. Businesses that have received assistance from the fund include an insurance company, a wholesale food distributor, a smelting and refining company, an apparel warehouser and distributor, and a card and gift warehouser and distributor.", "On the basis of the information in the loan files, we also estimate that communities and states used about 88 percent of their loans to finance activities that benefited low- and moderate-income people from households earning less than 80 percent of the local area\u2019s median income. For example, Greene County, Alabama, reported to HUD that it planned to use $9 million in loan proceeds to finance the construction of a 85,000-square-foot facility to house a tire and wheel assembly plant. The county estimates that the plant will create at least 180 new jobs, 51 percent of which will be for low- and moderate- income persons. Cheboygan, Michigan, reported using $3 million in loan proceeds to help a start-up, for-profit business purchase a vacant paper plant and industrial equipment. The plant will benefit the community by creating 100 jobs for low- to moderate-income persons, according to a state community development official.", "About 23 percent of the loans funded activities that supported the national objective of aiding in the elimination of slums and blight. However, none of the loans funded activities that supported the national objective of addressing an urgent community development need. Percentages do not add up to 100 because, in reporting to HUD, communities and states could indicate more than one national objective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some Field Offices Are Not Including the Loan Program in CDBG Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["According to its regulations, the Department must conduct an annual performance review of CDBG communities and states to determine whether CDBG-funded activities are being carried out (1) in a timely manner, (2) in accordance with approved plans, and (3) in compliance with primary and national objectives.", "Because the loan program is a component of the CDBG program, loan commitments should be included in annual reviews of CDBG recipients. However, in 5 of the 30 field offices we contacted, these loan commitments were not reviewed. These five offices accounted for about 26 percent of all loan commitments. The five offices that did not include loan fund activities said that they did not do so because they (1) did not believe they had guidance on how to monitor the program, (2) did not believe they had a responsibility to monitor the loans, (3) had other priorities, or (4) lacked loan-specific information. Another two field offices did not monitor these loans because one had recently opened and one had its records destroyed. The remaining 23 field offices included the loan fund activities in their review.", "Even when the field offices include loan activities in the annual CDBG review, their task is made more difficult by poor communication between HUD headquarters and its field offices. According to officials in 7 of the 30 field offices we contacted, HUD representatives did not have enough information on loans to fully carry out their monitoring responsibilities. According to the HUD headquarters program director, field offices may not routinely receive copies of all loan documentation, but he was surprised to learn that some offices may not be receiving documentation containing sufficient information for monitoring purposes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Communities and states have made greater use of the loan program since the EDI grants were instituted. Nonetheless, the total amount of money loaned has remained less than the amount that congressional appropriations would support. This may be due in part to communities\u2019 and states\u2019 reluctance to risk having to use future CDBG funds to repay loans. However, because HUD does not track the use of CDBG funds for loan payments, it does not know the extent to which CDBG funds have been used in this manner.", "Furthermore, some HUD field offices have not been routinely including loan commitments in their oversight of CDBG communities and states. Seven different field offices were not getting information from headquarters on final loan terms, which affected their ability to monitor loan activities; and five field offices were not including loans in their monitoring of CDBG communities.

He stressed HUD\u2019s commitment to making sure that it effectively oversees the loan program. The Deputy Assistant Secretary and the other officials provided suggestions for clarifying the report, which we incorporated as appropriate.", "In its letter, HUD noted that it views the growth in the loan program as positive and encourages communities to use the program to create jobs and revitalize distressed neighborhoods. At the same time, HUD stated, it is mindful of its stewardship responsibilities and therefore considers our report as constructive and generally agrees with our recommendations. HUD raised several points about collateral requirements that, while consistent with our report, provided details of HUD\u2019s intent. HUD emphasized that the underwriting guidelines will not be issued as regulations and their use is not mandatory; rather, HUD views them as a tool for communities to underwrite revenue-generating projects financed with the loan fund. These guidelines will assist communities in protecting their CDBG programs and in providing adequate security for the loan guarantees. HUD also noted that the guidelines were not intended to be used for loans used to finance public facilities or other activities that do not generate income. Although HUD points out that the guidelines will not be mandatory, it was clear during our work that associations representing communities perceive the guidelines as requirements. Accordingly, we believe that the program may benefit from HUD\u2019s opening and maintaining a dialogue with communities as it develops these guidelines to ensure that they are understood and not viewed as an obstacle to using the program.", "In connection with our recommendations, HUD agreed to implement procedures to require reporting of unplanned use of CDBG funds to make loan payments. However, our first recommendation goes beyond a reporting requirement. We believe that routine tracking of these data will provide HUD and communities with useful information on, among other things, the likelihood that communities may need to use future CDBG funds to repay loans when other intended revenue sources fail to materialize. In connection with our second recommendation, HUD noted that the distribution of oversight information needed by the field offices must be comprehensive and that while HUD has improved in this area in recent years, the current system is inadequate for accomplishing that result. HUD plans to implement our recommendation to correct this problem through a design change to its integrated disbursement and information system \u2014a computer-based information system. HUD noted that it will consult with its field offices to ensure that they are receiving the information needed for monitoring.

We also reviewed HUD\u2019s annual reports to the Congress for community development programs for 1994 and 1996. We interviewed the Director, Office of Block Grant Assistance; the Director, Financial Management Division (FMD) (the loan fund program office); FMD representatives; HUD Community Planning and Development officials in HUD field offices in Atlanta, Georgia; Columbia, South Carolina; and Portland, Oregon. We also interviewed community development officials for the states of Georgia and South Carolina, and the cities of Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina. We reviewed Inspector General reports issued as of January 7, 1997.", "To determine the extent to which communities and states use the program, we obtained and analyzed FMD\u2019s database of HUD\u2019s loan fund. We identified the manner in which the data were collected and summarized. We reviewed annual reports to the Congress for community development programs for 1994 and 1996. We interviewed the Director, Financial Management Division, and Community Planning and Development officials at HUD\u2019s field offices in Atlanta, Georgia, and Columbia, South Carolina.", "To identify the factors affecting communities\u2019 willingness to use the program, we interviewed officials of associations that represent communities eligible for the program, including the Council of State Community Development Agencies, the National Congress for Community Economic Development, the National Council for Urban Economic Development, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Community Development Association, and the National Association of State Development Agencies. We discussed this issue with the Director of HUD\u2019s Financial Management Division; and HUD Community Planning and Development officials at two HUD field offices. In addition, we interviewed state community development officials in Georgia and South Carolina, and city development officials in Atlanta and Columbia. We also reviewed documentation obtained during these interviews.", "To identify the types of projects financed with loan proceeds, we obtained and analyzed FMD\u2019s database of HUD\u2019s loan fund. We developed two data collection instruments to obtain additional information about loan commitments. With the first, we recorded data from loan files on the activities communities and states financed with loan proceeds. With the second, we conducted a telephone survey with HUD community planning and development officials at HUD field offices responsible for monitoring loan commitments in our sample. HUD program officials reviewed and commented on the telephone data collection instrument, and we incorporated their suggested changes. (App. V shows the locations of HUD field offices contacted.) In developing these instruments, we interviewed program officials, reviewed Economic Development Loan Fund legislation and regulations, and examined selected loan fund files.", "We used these data collection instruments to collect information about a sample of loan commitments. We selected a stratified random sample of 100 loan commitments approved (out of 313 loan commitments) in fiscal years 1990 through 1996 that had funding advances. We included all loan commitments of $15 million and above (20 loans) given to entitlement communities and states, all loan commitments to nonentitlement communities (23 loans), and a random sample of the remaining loan commitments to entitlement communities and states (57 of 270 loans). We appropriately weighted the information to take into consideration the stratification used to select loan commitments.", "Since we used a sample (called a probability sample) of loan commitments to develop our estimates, each estimate has a measurable precision, or sampling error, that may be expressed as a plus/minus figure. A sampling error indicates how closely we can reproduce from a sample the results that we would obtain if we were to take a complete count of the universe using the same measurement methods. By adding the sampling error to and subtracting it from the estimate, we can develop upper and lower bounds for each estimate. This range is called a confidence interval. Sampling errors and confidence intervals are stated at a certain confidence level\u2014in this case, 95 percent. For example, a confidence interval at the 95-percent confidence level means that in 95 out of 100 instances, the sampling procedure we used would produce a confidence interval containing the universe value we are estimating.", "To determine HUD\u2019s monitoring of the program, we conducted a telephone survey of HUD community planning and development officials in HUD field offices responsible for monitoring loan fund commitments in our sample.", "This resulted in our interviewing HUD officials in 30 of 44 field offices. We also obtained and reviewed HUD reports of the most recent monitoring activities performed on the CDBG communities or states that held the respective loan commitments.", "Using the information collected about the sample of 100 loans, we are able to provides estimates for the 313 loan commitments approved in fiscal years 1990 and 1996 which had funding advances. Appendix IV provides the sampling errors of estimates, referred to in this report, that were made from the above mentioned data collection instruments. In contrast, information obtained from the 30 of 44 field offices is not projectable to the program, as a whole.

We revised the title of the report after we sent it to HUD for comment. 2. We added a discussion of HUD\u2019s view of the underwriting guidelines to the text and at the end of the report. As we point out, although HUD may not regard the collateral guidelines as mandatory, the associations we spoke with perceived that they will be required. We believe the program may benefit if HUD would open and maintain a dialogue with communities as it develops these guidelines to ensure that they are understood and not viewed as an obstacle to using the program. 3. HUD\u2019s comment addressed the first part of our second recommendation. HUD noted that the distribution of oversight information needed by the field offices must be comprehensive and that, while HUD has improved in this area in recent years, the current system\u2014as our report points out\u2014 is inadequate to accomplish that result. HUD plans to implement our recommendation through a design change to its integrated disbursement and information system\u2014a computer-based information system. As we discussed, HUD noted that it will consult with its field offices to ensure that the field offices are receiving the information needed for monitoring. 4. HUD\u2019s comment addressed the first and second part of our second recommendation. As we discussed, HUD agreed to develop procedures to ensure that the necessary monitoring information is provided promptly to field offices and to direct field offices to include loan activities in their monitoring of CDBG recipients as we recommend. We discuss this at the end of our report. 5. HUD\u2019s comment addressed our first recommendation. HUD agreed to implement procedures to require reporting of unplanned use of CDBG funds to make loan payments. However, our recommendation goes beyond a reporting requirement. As we discussed, we believe that routine tracking of these data will provide HUD and communities with useful information on, among other things, the likelihood that communities may need to use future CDBG funds to repay loans when other intended revenue sources fail to materialize."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": ["Erin Lansburgh Signora J.
