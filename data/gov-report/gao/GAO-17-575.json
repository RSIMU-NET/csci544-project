As a result, the estimate does not demonstrate that the program can meet its $11.4 billion cost cap. Cost growth for the lead ship was driven by challenges with technology development, design, and construction, compounded by an optimistic budget estimate. Instead of learning from the mistakes of CVN 78, the Navy developed an estimate for CVN 79 that assumes a reduction in labor hours needed to construct the ship that is unprecedented in the past 50 years of aircraft carrier construction, as shown in the figure below.", "After developing the program estimate, the Navy negotiated 18 percent fewer labor hours for CVN 79 than were required for CVN 78. CVN 79's estimate is optimistic compared to the labor hour reductions calculated in independent cost reviews conducted in 2015 by the Naval Center for Cost Analysis and the Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation. Navy analysis shows that the CVN 79 cost estimate may not sufficiently account for program risks, with the current budget likely insufficient to complete ship construction.", "The Navy's current reporting mechanisms, such as budget requests and annual acquisition reports to Congress, provide limited insight into the overall Ford Class program and individual ship costs. For example, the program requests funding for each ship before that ship obtains an independent cost estimate. During an 11-year period prior to 2015, no independent cost estimate was conducted for any of the Ford class ships; however, the program received over $15 billion in funding. In addition, the program's Selected Acquisition Reports (SAR)\u2014annual cost, status, and performance reports to Congress\u2014provide only aggregate program cost for all three ships currently in the class, a practice that limits transparency into individual ship costs.

In contrast, the CVN 79 detail design and construction  contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract, meaning the government\u2019s  liability is capped at a negotiated ceiling price. However, because the  Navy budgeted the ship at the target cost, any cost increases above the  target would require the Navy to adjust its budget planning and request  additional funding from Congress.

Among other things, we recommended actions to improve the realism  of the CVN 78 budget estimate and the Navy\u2019s cost surveillance  capability. We also recommended that the Navy develop carrier- specific tests of DBR to ensure that it could meet carrier-specific  requirements.

CVN 79\u2019s cost estimate appears to suffer from similar optimism,  indicating that lessons were not learned from the lead ship in this regard.  NAVSEA 05C\u2019s CVN 79 estimate is not realistic, as it does not accurately  capture actual program risks. As a result, CVN 79 is likely to experience  cost growth beyond the congressionally mandated cost cap and will  require additional program funding. Congress designed the cost cap in  order to encourage the program to adhere to its cost estimate. However,  the cost cap for CVN 79 was established without the input from a program  cost estimate. Consequently, instead of the program cost estimate  informing the cost cap, the cost cap informed the program cost estimate.  Developing a new CVN 79 cost estimate would allow the program to have  a more realistic budget that accurately reflects current shipbuilder  performance.", "Further, the infrequent independent cost estimates result in Congress  being asked to commit billions of dollars to the program before key  information is available. As a result, individual ships receive billions of  dollars in funding before a realistic cost is determined, at which point  there are fewer opportunities to identify cost efficiencies or potential  tradeoffs. More frequent independent cost reviews would identify risks for  program cost growth sooner, allowing actions to be taken.", "Finally, although each individual ship far exceeds the threshold for being  a major defense acquisition program, the entire Ford Class, rather than  each ship, is considered a major defense acquisition program, and thus  there is less oversight over individual ships as a result of infrequent  independent cost reviews and consolidated SAR reporting. Reporting cost  and funding summaries in the SAR individually for each ship would allow  Congress insight into individual ship cost growth and any tradeoffs that  are made to stay within cost caps. Additional information on ship costs  would allow for the Navy and Congress to develop a realistic acquisition  strategy and budget for the Ford-Class program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the Navy  to take the following three actions:", "To ensure the Milestone Decision Authority has an accurate and  credible cost estimate for the Milestone C program review, NAVSEA  05C should update the cost estimate for CVN 79 as part of the Ford- Class program life-cycle cost estimate. This estimate should be  prepared in accordance with cost estimating best practices and  include current shipbuilder performance data.", "NCCA should review the new CVN 79 cost estimate as part of the  planned independent cost assessment.", "Further, the Secretary of Defense should direct the CAPE to  include the new CVN 79 cost estimate as part of the planned  independent cost estimate, which should form the basis of the  program budget request. If the independent cost estimate for CVN  79 should exceed the cost cap, the Navy should submit to  Congress a request to revise the cost cap.", "Starting with CVN 80, NAVSEA 05C should develop program life- cycle cost estimates for each individual ship in the Ford-Class  program baseline.", "Development of these estimates should be provided at milestone  reviews that should be aligned with major aircraft carrier funding  events. In particular, for CVN 80, a program life-cycle cost  estimate should be developed prior to the request for ship  construction funding.", "For all ships in the class after CVN 80, a program life-cycle cost  estimate should be aligned with milestone reviews that correspond  with the receipt of any advance procurement funding and the first  year of the request for ship construction funding. These estimates  should be prepared in accordance with best practices and  updated regularly with actual cost data.", "The Secretary of Defense should further direct the CAPE to  develop independent cost estimates for these ships prior to the  listed events.", "The Secretary of the Navy should direct NCCA to conduct  independent cost assessments for these ships prior to the listed  events.", "To improve insight into cost changes for individual ships in the Ford  Class, the program office should prepare cost summary and funding  summary sections for each individual ship in the class as part of the  SAR for the overall Ford-Class program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD for comment. In its written  comments, which are reprinted in appendix III, DOD concurred with much  of the report. DOD agreed that an accurate cost estimate for CVN 79 is  essential to support the Milestone C review for the program, but did not  concur with revising the cost cap should the CVN 79 cost estimate  exceed the current cost cap, stating that it will use the cost estimate to  determine whether the current cost cap is at risk and if additional cost  mitigation strategies are needed. While we understand that the program  would want to evaluate and balance the cost risks, we continue to believe  that the cost cap is meant to reflect the program\u2019s baseline. If the  department chooses not to request that Congress update the cost cap,  then the cost cap is driving the cost estimate and not vice versa,  increasing the likelihood that the cost estimate will not reflect realistic  assumptions, such as regarding the number of labor hours needed to  construct the ships. We will review the updated CVN 79 cost estimate to  determine whether it accurately reflects likely program costs.", "DOD agreed to develop program life-cycle cost estimates for each  individual ship according to our recommended timelines. However, DOD  stated that it will not be able to meet the timeline for CVN 80 since the  request for ship construction funding has already been submitted and the  first program life-cycle cost estimate is still being prepared to support the  program review in fiscal year 2018. DOD stated it will follow our  recommendation for all subsequent ships.", "In response to agency comments, we revised one of our draft  recommendations, specifically regarding reporting in the SAR. DOD  informed us that submitting a separate SAR report for each individual ship  would result in duplicative information. We subsequently revised the  recommendation to focus on cost and funding data for each ship within  the overall Ford Class SAR. We believe this change will improve the  transparency of individual ship costs without imposing burdensome or  duplicative reporting requirements. DOD noted that the department  currently provides progress reports to Congress on costs for CVN 78 and  CVN 79. While true, the SAR is the primary statutorily required means for  DOD to report on program status. And as our report notes, at present the  SAR does not include any cost information on individual ships. Grouping  costs of all Ford-Class ships together does not provide Congress with an  adequate level of insight to monitor this approximately $40 billion  program. Further, the current progress reports do not include CVN 80.  Our recommendation would ensure that Congress receives insight into  the costs of each existing and planned Ford Class ship.", "In addition, DOD provided technical comments that were incorporated as  appropriate.", "We are sending copies of this report to the appropriate congressional  committees, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Navy.

In addition, we analyzed Navy budget  submissions. We also relied on our prior work evaluating the Ford-Class  program to supplement the above analyses.

We  examined documents supporting the cost estimate, such as the CVN 79  estimate brief, memorandum, and other documents that contain cost,  schedule, and risk information, as well as relevant Department of Defense  (DOD) and Navy policies. We met with Navy personnel responsible for  developing the cost estimate to understand the processes used by the  cost estimators, to clarify information, and to allow the program to provide  additional documentation to support the estimate. Because we did not  have direct access to the CVN 79 cost model, we observed portions of  the model during a presentation and discussion with Navy cost  estimators. Finally, we examined Navy cost estimating guidance to  determine whether the Navy complied with the guidance in developing the  CVN 79 estimate.

We analyzed the  cost estimating practices used by the Navy against these best practices.  For our reporting needs, we collapsed these best practices into four  general characteristics for sound cost estimating, which include: well- documented, comprehensive, accurate, and credible.
