Specifically, you requested that we evaluate and compare each report\u2019s research methodology for estimating the number of bankruptcy debtors who would be able to pay a portion of their debts and the amount of debt such debtors could repay. Last year, we reported on our evaluation of a similar report by the Credit Research Center.", "Debtors who file personal bankruptcy petitions usually file under chapter 7 or chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code. Generally, debtors who file under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code seek a discharge of all their eligible dischargeable debts. Debtors who file under chapter 13 submit a repayment plan, which must be confirmed by the bankruptcy court, for paying all or a portion of their debts over a 3-year period, unless for cause the court approves a period not to exceed 5 years. Recent congressional bankruptcy reform proposals would establish \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions for personal bankruptcy in which a debtor who was determined to be able to pay a specified portion of his or her debts would be required to file under chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Personal bankruptcy filings have set new records in each of the past 3 years, reaching about 1.4 million in calendar year 1998, of which more than 1 million were chapter 7 filings. There is little agreement on the causes for such high personal bankruptcy filings in a period of relatively low unemployment, low inflation, and steady economic growth. Nor is there agreement on the number of debtors who seek relief through the bankruptcy process who have the ability to pay at least a portion of their debts and the amount of debt such debtors could potentially repay.", "Several bills were introduced in the 105th Congress that would implement some form of \u201cneeds-based\u201d bankruptcy for those who file for personal bankruptcy under chapter 7 of the bankruptcy code. The conference report on the Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1998, H.R. 3150, passed the House in October 1998, but did not reach a vote in the Senate. In the 106th Congress, the conference report version of H.R. 3150 was introduced in the House as H.R. 833, and a bill with somewhat different provisions, S.625, was introduced in the Senate.", "Each of these bills has included provisions for determining when a debtor could be required to file under chapter 13 of the bankruptcy code, rather than under chapter 7. Currently, the debtor usually determines whether to file under chapters 7 or 13. Generally, these bills would require debtors who filed under chapter 7 and whose gross monthly income met a specified income threshold to undergo a detailed analysis of their income, expenses, and debts to determine whether they could proceed under chapter 7 or be required to file under chapter 13. Under chapter 13, debtors enter into a repayment plan, which must be approved by the bankruptcy court, to repay their debts over a period not to exceed 3 years, unless for cause the bankruptcy court approved a period not to exceed 5 years. The \u201cneeds-based\u201d bankruptcy reform bills introduced in the 105th and 106th Congress would generally mandate a 5-year repayment period for debtors required to file under chapter 13, rather than under chapter 7. Generally, the private panel trustee would be responsible for making the initial determination of whether a debtor would be permitted to proceed under chapter 7.", "Under the bankruptcy code, a debtor\u2019s debts may be grouped into three general categories for the purposes of determining creditor payment priority: (1) secured debts, for which the debtor has pledged collateral, such as home mortgage and automobile loans; (2) unsecured priority debt, such as child support, alimony, and certain back taxes; and (3) unsecured nonpriority debt, such as credit card debts, student loans, and other unsecured personal loans. In analyzing debtors\u2019 repayment capacity, the four reports focused principally on the proportion of total unsecured nonpriority debt that debtors could potentially repay. In general, \u201cneeds- based\u201d bankruptcy bills introduced in the 105th and 106th Congress would require debtors to file under chapter 13 if the debtors met or exceeded a specific income standard and could repay all their nonhousing secured debts, all their unsecured priority debts, and a minimum specified amount of their unsecured nonpriority debts over a 5-year period."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To evaluate and compare the four reports\u2019 research methodologies, we assessed the strengths and limitations, if any, of each report\u2019s assumptions and methodology for determining debtors\u2019 ability to pay and the amount of debt that debtors could potentially repay. The comments and observations in this report are based on our review of the March 1998 and March 1999 Ernst & Young reports, the March 1999 Creighton/ABI report, and the January 1999 EOUST report; some additional information we requested from each report\u2019s authors; independent analyses using the Creighton/ABI report\u2019s database; and our experience in research design and evaluation. We reviewed specific aspects of each report\u2019s methodology, including the proposed legislation on which the report was based, how the bankruptcy cases used in the analysis were selected, what types of assumptions were made about debtors\u2019 and their debt repayment ability, how debtors\u2019 income and allowable living expenses were determined, and whether appropriate data analysis techniques were used. We also assessed the similarities and differences in the methodologies used in the four reports.", "In addition to reviewing the reports, we had numerous contacts with the reports\u2019 authors. On March 16, 1999, we met with one of the authors of the Creighton/ABI report, and on March 25, 1999, we met with the authors of the two Ernst & Young reports to discuss our questions and observations about each report\u2019s methodology and assumptions. Following these discussions, we created a detailed description of each report\u2019s methodology (see app.I), which we sent to the authors of each report for review and comment. On the basis of the comments received, we amended our methodological descriptions as appropriate. The authors of the Creighton/ABI report responded to written questions we submitted. Ernst & Young, Creighton/ABI, and EOUST provided additional details on their methodologies and assumptions that were not fully described in their reports. We did not verify the accuracy of the data used in any of these reports back to the original documents filed with the bankruptcy courts. However, the Creighton/ABI authors provided us with a copy of the database used in their analysis. Ernst & Young declined to provide a copy of their database, citing VISA\u2019s proprietary interest in the data. (VISA U.S.A. and MasterCard International sponsored the Ernst & Young reports.) We received the EOUST report in early April and, because of time constraints, did not request the database for the report. We reviewed the Creighton/ABI data and performed some analyses of our own to verify the authors\u2019 categorization of data used in their analyses. In our review, we found that the Creighton/ABI researchers prepared and analyzed their data in a careful, thorough manner.", "The team that reviewed the reports included specialists in program evaluation, statistical sampling, and statistical analysis from our General Government Division\u2019s Design, Methodology, and Technical Assistance group. We did our work between February and May 1999 in Washington, D.C., in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. On May 18, 1999, we provided a draft of our report to Ernst & Young, the authors of the Creighton/ABI report, and EOUST for comment. Each provided written comments on the report. In addition, on May 28, 1999, we met with representatives from Ernst & Young to discuss their comments on the draft report. Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI also separately provided technical comments on the report, which we have incorporated as appropriate.

The amount of unsecured nonpriority debt that each report estimated these \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors could repay over 5 years ranged from about $1 billion to about $4 billion.", "It is important to note that these estimates do not necessarily represent unsecured nonpriority creditors\u2019 potential net gain from implementing needs-based bankruptcy, compared with current bankruptcy practice. It was not the objective of any of these reports to estimate the potential net gain to creditors (secured or unsecured) under \u201cneeds-based\u201d bankruptcy and, consequently, none of the reports attempted to do so. Currently, many chapter 7 debtors repay at least some of their debts. Debtors may voluntarily reaffirm\u2014that is, agree to repay\u2014specific debts (most commonly home mortgage or vehicle loans) or they may, in effect, be required to repay others. Some debts, including such unsecured nonpriority debts as most student loans, cannot be discharged in bankruptcy. Following the close of their bankruptcy cases, debtors remain financially responsible for all debts reaffirmed with the bankruptcy court and all debts that cannot be discharged in bankruptcy.", "In developing its estimates of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors and the total amount of debt such debtors could repay, each report made a number of assumptions, which varied by report. Three of these assumptions were used in all four reports: (1) the data in debtors\u2019 schedules of current estimated income, current estimated monthly expenses, and debts were accurate and could be used as the basis for forecasting debtors\u2019 income and expenses for a 5-year period; (2) debtors\u2019 income and allowable living expenses would remain unchanged during the 5-year repayment period; and (3) all debtors required to file under chapter 13 and enter a 5-year repayment plan would complete that plan. The reports used the second and third assumptions because proposed \u201cneeds-based\u201d legislation specified their use in identifying \u201ccan-pay\u201d chapter 7 debtors. However, none of these assumptions has been validated.", "Each report\u2019s data on debtors\u2019 income, debts, and most living expenses were from the financial schedules that debtors generally file at the same time as their bankruptcy petitions. The instructions for the income and expense schedules specifically ask the debtors to enter their \u201cestimated\u201d monthly income or expenses. Although these schedules are the only source of detailed debtor financial data publicly available, the data in the schedules are of unknown accuracy and reliability.", "Both Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI, for example, developed separate methodologies for valuing the amount of unexpired vehicle leases because the data debtors reported on the schedule for unexpired leases was incomplete or inconsistent. In some cases, for example, debtors reported the monthly lease payment rather than the total amount of the payments due on the remainder of the lease. To the extent this occurred, it would have understated the amount owed on the lease and, thus, overstated a debtor\u2019s repayment capacity. The National Bankruptcy Review Commission\u2019s October 1997 report noted that there had been no empirical report of the accuracy of the financial data initially reported by bankruptcy debtors, and it recommended random audits of such data.", "Each report noted that the proposed legislation used in its analysis required the use of the assumptions that all \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors who entered a 5-year repayment plan would complete the plan without modification and that such debtors\u2019 income and expenses would remain stable during the 5-year repayment period. All four reports noted that a debtor\u2019s income and/or expenses may change during the course of a 5-year repayment plan and that any such changes could affect a debtor\u2019s repayment capacity. The Creighton/ABI and EOUST reports asserted that it was likely that many debtors would experience a change in income, expenses, or both over the 5-year period that would reduce their ability to complete their repayment plans.", "Available evidence suggests that at least some percentage of debtors would be unable to complete their chapter 13 repayment plans. A 1994 AOUSC report reviewed the outcomes of all 953,180 chapter 13 cases filed between calendar years 1980 and 1988 and terminated by September 30, 1993. The report found that about 36 percent of debtors who voluntarily entered a 3- to 5-year bankruptcy debt repayment plan under chapter 13 were able to complete their repayment plans and obtain discharges. Another 14 percent of these debtors were unable to complete their chapter 13 plans and had their eligible debts discharged after their cases were converted to chapter 7. About 49 percent had their cases dismissed and did not receive a discharge of their eligible dischargeable debts. The results of the AOUSC report caution against making broad conclusions about debtors\u2019 ability to maintain debt payments over a 5-year period based on the data in the initial debtor financial schedules alone. If needs-based bankruptcy provisions were enacted, at least some debtors are likely to experience a change in their financial circumstances during a 5-year repayment period that could increase or decrease their repayment capacity. Thus, at least some percentage of debtors who complete their repayment plans are likely to have those repayment plans modified during the 5-year repayment period. In addition, there is no empirical basis for assuming that the completion rate would be 100 percent, as assumed in each of these reports. To the extent that the completion rate was less than 100 percent, the amount of debt repaid to creditors could be less than estimated in the reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in the Four Reports", "paragraphs": ["The reports differed in their sampling methods, the calendar period from which the sample of debtors was selected, the proposed legislation used as the basis for their repayment capacity analyses, the income levels used to screen debtors for further repayment analysis, the methods used to impute interest for certain debts, and the assumptions used to estimate debtors\u2019 allowable living expenses and debt repayments. Thus, the reports also differed in the proportion of debtors\u2014the \u201ccan-pay debtors--they estimated would have sufficient income, after paying allowable living expenses, to repay all of their nonhousing secured debts, all their unsecured priority debts, and a specific minimum portion of their unsecured nonpriority debts over a 5-year period.

These differences limit the degree to which the results of each report can be compared.", "The Ernst & Young reports were based on a national probability sample of about 2,200 drawn from all chapter 7 bankruptcy cases filed nationwide during calendar year 1997. The cases were selected randomly from the petitions filed in all federal bankruptcy districts, largely in proportion to each district\u2019s total chapter 7 filings. Consequently, the results of the Ernst & Young reports can be generalized to all chapter 7 petitions filed nationwide in calendar year 1997.", "The Creighton/ABI report used randomly selected chapter 7 cases that met certain qualifications from seven judgmentally selected bankruptcy districts. The districts used in the report were originally chosen for a different purpose\u2014a report of debtors\u2019 reaffirmations of their debts.  The report\u2019s results can only be generalized to these seven districts. Therefore, neither extrapolation of the Creighton/ABI results to the nation nor comparison to the results of Ernst & Young\u2019s March 1998 report is supported by the methods used. The Creighton/ABI report\u2019s authors acknowledged that the two reports were based on different sample designs. However, they still portrayed their results as comparable with those of the Ernst & Young report. Nevertheless, we recognize that statistically valid probability samples of less than national scope, such as Creighton/ABI\u2019s, are often mandated by limited resources. The results of such samples, appropriately limited to the scope of the sample, can provide useful information for policymakers.", "The EOUST report was based on a nonprobability sample of nearly 2,000 cases drawn from those chapter 7 cases designated as no-asset by the U.S. Trustees in 84 of the 90 bankruptcy districts and closed in the first half of calendar year 1998. The cases were selected in proportion to each district\u2019s chapter 7 filings during calendar year 1997. Cases from six bankruptcy districts in Alabama and North Carolina were excluded from the report because these districts do not have U.S. Trustees. Because statistical probability sampling methods were not used to select the cases closed within each district, standard statistical methods are not technically applicable for making inferences from these results to the population of no-asset chapter 7 cases from those 84 bankruptcy districts closed during this period.  However, treating such a sample as if it were a random sample may sometimes be reasonable from a practical point of view. EOUST, based on its subject matter expertise, asserts that these cases are as random as those they would have obtained from a statistical random sample of filings from each Trustee\u2019s office. We have no basis to judge the accuracy of that assertion."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Each Report\u2019s Analysis Was Based on Different Proposed Legislation", "paragraphs": ["Each of the four reports used different proposed legislation as the basis for its analysis of debtor repayment capacity.

The EOUST report was based on a mix of the provisions in specific versions of H.R. 3150 and S.1301, two bills Congress considered in 1998. The basic similarities and differences in the \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions of the proposed legislation used in the Ernst & Young, Creighton/ABI, and EOUST reports are shown in table 1. Basic differences include the median income thresholds used to select debtors for repayment capacity analyses and the two key tests used to identify the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Determination of Debtors\u2019 Median Income", "paragraphs": ["Each report relied on annual household median income data as reported by the U.S. Census Bureau to select debtors for further analysis of their repayment capacity. Each debtor\u2019s annual gross household income was compared with the median national annual gross household income for a household of comparable size\u2014one person, two persons, and so forth. However, in making this comparison, the reports used different national median income thresholds from the Census Bureau and data for different calendar years (1993, 1996, or 1997).  These differences reflect the different median income tests in the different proposed legislative provisions used in various reports\u2019 analyses and the different years from which each report\u2019s sample was drawn.", "The Census Bureau reports annual gross median incomes for different types of households by household size. Generally, for each household size, incomes for nonfamily households of two or more are less than incomes for family households of two or more. The Census Bureau table chosen for analysis can also make a difference. For example, the 1997 annual gross median income for a household with one earner was $29,780. This was $11,018 more than the 1997 annual gross median income of $18,762 for a 1- person household. The Census Bureau defines a household as all persons, related and unrelated, occupying a housing unit. The Census Bureau defines a family household as a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who reside together. Thus, the table chosen for comparison can affect whether a debtor\u2019s income is determined to be above or below the national median for a household of comparable size.", "To illustrate the effect of each report\u2019s median household income test, table 2 compares the median annual gross household incomes each report would have used had all the reports used the 1997 Census Bureau tables. For example, the 1998 Ernst & Young report determined median income using household income by household size. Debtors would have been selected for further repayment analysis if their incomes were more than 75 percent of the Census Bureau amounts shown in table 2. Thus, debtors in four--person households would have been selected for further analysis if their 1997 annual gross household incomes were more than $39,874 (75 percent of $53,165). In the other three reports, debtors in four-person households would have been selected for further analysis if their 1997 gross annual incomes were at least $53,350\u2014a difference of $13,476.", "As shown in table 2, in the Census Bureau tables, national median incomes peak at households of four and decline for households of more than four. Three of the reports made adjustments for this fact. Each used a different method, based on the specific proposed legislative provisions used in its analysis. For family households of four or more, the Creighton/ABI report used the median income for a family of four. For each additional household member over four, the 1999 Ernst & Young and EOUST reports used the median income for a family of four, plus $583 annually (Ernst & Young) or $583 monthly (EOUST) for each additional family household member over four. Table 2 shows the difference these adjustments would make. Had each report used the 1997 Census tables, the median income used for a family of six would have ranged from $34,849 (1998 Ernst & Young) to $67,342, (EOUST).", "As would be expected, the higher the median household income used for comparison, the lower the percentage of debtors whose household incomes met or exceeded the income level used for comparison. Almost half of the debtors in the 1998 Ernst & Young report sample passed the median income test, while less than 20 percent passed the test in the 1999 Ernst & Young and EOUST reports (see table 3). Because the Ernst & Young reports used the same debtor sample and 1996 median income data, the different pass rates for the two reports reflect solely the different median income thresholds used. For the Creighton/ABI and EOUST reports, the different pass rates may reflect, to some degree, differences in the debtors in each report\u2019s sample and the each report\u2019s use of median income tables for different calendar years\u20141993 and 1997, respectively.", "Table 3 also shows the percentage of debtors in each report\u2019s sample that passed each major repayment capacity test. The final estimates of the percentage of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors in each sample ranged from 3.6 percent to 15 percent. EOUST provided three estimates\u201415 percent if debtors used all their available net income, no matter how small, to pay their unsecured nonpriority debt; 12.2 percent if the can-pay debtors paid at least 20 percent of their unsecured priority debt; and 13.4 percent if they paid $5,000 or 25 percent, whichever was less.", "Under the \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions used in these analyses, two principal variables affected each report\u2019s estimate of the percentage of debtors who had sufficient income to pay the minimum specified percentage of their unsecured nonpriority debts. These were the (1) total amount of the debtor\u2019s nonhousing secured and unsecured priority debts and (2) debtor\u2019s allowable living expenses. Under the \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions of the proposed legislation used in the two Ernst & Young reports and the Creighton/ABI report, payments on nonhousing secured debt and unsecured priority debt plus allowable living expenses were deducted from income to determine whether the debtor had any net income available for payment of unsecured nonpriority debts. For debtors with the same living expenses, the higher the payments on secured debt and unsecured priority debt were relative to income, the less income the debtor would have for payment of unsecured nonpriority debt. Conversely, the lower such payments were relative to income, the greater the net income available for payment of unsecured nonpriority debts. Further, under the proposed needs-based legislation, debtors would be allowed housing allowances in excess of the IRS standards if necessary for payment of home mortgage debt. Thus, assuming that all other living expenses were the same, debtors whose mortgage payments exceeded the IRS housing allowance would be permitted higher living expenses than debtors whose mortgage payments were less than the IRS housing allowance or who were renters."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in Interpreting the IRS Expense Standards for Allowable Living Expenses", "paragraphs": ["The two Ernst & Young reports and the Creighton/ABI report used the IRS collection financial standards as the basis for determining debtors\u2019 allowable living expenses. These standards and their application in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI reports are discussed in more detail in appendix I. EOUST did not use the IRS standards to determine debtors\u2019 allowable living expenses, concluding that they were cumbersome and difficult to apply consistently across debtors. The EOUST report assumed that debtors would (1) pay their home mortgage and other secured debts from that portion of their income that was at or below the national median for a family of comparable size and (2) pay their unsecured priority and unsecured nonpriority debts from that portion of their income that was above the national median. The EOUST report\u2019s methodology is described in detail in appendix II.", "The IRS uses its collection financial standards to help determine a taxpayer\u2019s ability to pay a delinquent tax liability.

However, the IRS has not established specific dollar allowances for \u201cother necessary expenses,\u201d such as taxes, health care, court-ordered payments (e.g., child support or alimony), child care, and dependent care. Since there are no specific dollar standards, the IRS determines whether individual expenses in this category are reasonable and necessary on a case-by-case basis. The IRS guidance notes that some of these \u201cother necessary expenses,\u201d such as taxes, health care, and court-ordered payments, are \u201cusually considered to be necessary.\u201d However, the taxpayer may be required to substantiate the amounts and justify expenses for other expense items, such as child care, dependent care, and life insurance.", "Each of the proposed \u201cneeds-based\u201d bankruptcy bills used in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI analyses provided that debtors would be permitted the IRS allowances for national and local necessary expenses (housing and utilities; transportation; and food, clothing, and other expenses), and for other necessary expenses. However, none of the proposed bills specified how the discretionary allowances for \u201cother necessary expenses\u201d were to be determined.", "There are also other provisions of the IRS collection standards that are not mentioned in the bills. For example, the IRS standards permit a taxpayer 1 year in which to modify or eliminate excessive necessary or unallowable conditional expenses, if the tax liability cannot be paid within 3 years.", "The \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions of the proposed legislation used in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI reports provided that debtors\u2019 monthly debt repayment expenses were to include whatever amounts were necessary to pay monthly mortgage payments and to pay in full over 5 years all nonhousing secured debts (such as auto loans) and all unsecured priority debts (such as child support and certain back taxes). Thus, by implication, debtors were to be permitted expenses in excess of the maximum IRS allowances where necessary to repay debt. For example, if a debtor\u2019s total monthly vehicle debt payment exceeded the maximum applicable IRS transportation ownership allowance, the higher debt payment would be used as the ownership allowance.", "A basic description of the IRS collection financial standards is presented in table 4. With the exception of debt repayment, both Ernst & Young reports and the Creighton/ABI report generally used the IRS standards as expense ceilings. The principal difference was in the methods used to determine the debtors\u2019 transportation allowances.", "The IRS transportation allowance is divided into two categories\u2014 ownership costs and operating costs, which includes an allowance for debtors with no vehicles. The IRS ownership allowance is a single national standard for payments on leased or purchased vehicles\u2014currently, $372 for the first car and $294 for the second car, with a maximum of two cars allowed. According to the IRS, the \u201cownership costs provide maximum allowances for up to two automobiles if allowed as a necessary expense.\u201d The operating portion of the IRS standard is derived from Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data. The operating allowance varies by census region and metropolitan statistical area. The current allowance for Boston, Massachusetts, for example, is $220 (no vehicles), $274 (one vehicle), or $328 (two vehicles). IRS regulations describe the application of the ownership and operating allowances as follows: \u201cIf a taxpayer has a car payment, the allowable ownership cost added to the allowable operating cost equals the allowable transportation expense. If a taxpayer has no car payment, or no car, only the operating cost portion of the transportation standard is used as the allowable expense.\u201d"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Differences in the Ownership Allowances Used", "paragraphs": ["Each report used different methods to assign the ownership portion of the transportation allowance.

Ernst & Young totaled all vehicle debt, added 10 percent for interest (equivalent to 9 percent for 2 years), and amortized the resulting total over 60 months.

The resulting monthly vehicle debt payment was used as the ownership allowance if it was equal to or more than the maximum IRS ownership allowance for a household of the same size and number of vehicles as the debtor\u2019s. If the monthly secured debt payment was less than the maximum IRS ownership allowance for a household of the same size and number of vehicles as the debtor\u2019s household, Creighton/ABI added the difference to the debtor\u2019s transportation ownership allowance. For example, the IRS ownership allowance for a one-vehicle household is a maximum of $372 a month. This allowance applies to any one-vehicle household regardless of size. If a debtor in a one-vehicle household had a monthly payment for secured vehicle debt of $333, Creighton/ABI would have allowed an additional monthly allowance of $39, for a total ownership allowance of $372. Both the IRS standards and Ernst & Young would have allowed $333.", "It is important to note that the IRS standards permit an ownership allowance for vehicle lease payments. Similar to secured vehicle debt payments, monthly lease debt payments that exceeded the IRS transportation ownership allowances would be permitted under needs- based bankruptcy. However, both Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI found the data on vehicle leases to be inconsistently reported among the debtors in their samples and sometimes inconsistently reported on the schedules of an individual debtor. Debtors did not necessarily show on their schedules the total amounts remaining to be paid on unexpired vehicle leases or the amount of the monthly payments on such leases. Therefore, neither report may have accurately captured the amount remaining to be paid on unexpired leases and the monthly vehicle lease costs.", "The other principal difference in the treatment of the transportation ownership allowance was that the Creighton/ABI report provided an ownership allowance for debt-free vehicles. The IRS standards would include only an operating allowance for debt-free vehicles. Because there were no secured debt payments for debt-free vehicles, Ernst & Young did not include an ownership allowance for such cars. Creighton/ABI included the maximum IRS ownership allowance for debt-free cars\u2014one allowance for one person households, one allowance for households of two or more with one vehicle, and two allowances for households of two or more with two or more vehicles."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differences in the Operating Allowances Used", "paragraphs": ["Crieghton/ABI\u2019s and Ernst & Young\u2019s methods of assigning vehicle operating allowances were the same except for households of two or more persons with more than two vehicles.

However, debtors are not required to provide information on their bankruptcy financial schedules regarding whether any or all of their vehicles are necessary for producing income.", "Both Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI determined the number of debtor vehicles by using the larger of the number of vehicles shown on schedules B or D.

Based on this report, the Creighton/ABI report assumed that debtor attorney fees would add about $800, or $13 per month, to the debtor\u2019s monthly expenses. The 1999 Ernst & Young report assumed that debtors who were required to file under chapter 13 would incur an average attorney fee of $1,281.

The differences between the two estimate were the result of two changes in the methodology used in the March 1999 report\u2014both resulting from the different \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions of H.R. 833 compared with those of H.R. 3150.

Ernst & Young used the H.R. 3150 as introduced in early 1998, while Creighton/ABI used the version that passed the House in June 1998. One of the differences between the two versions of the bill was the median household income test used to screen debtors for further repayment capacity analysis. The later version of H.R. 3150 used in the Creighton/ABI report (1) included different Census Bureau tables with generally higher household incomes and (2) required that \u201ccan- pay\u201d debtors have at least 100 percent of the median household income used for screening debtors.

For example, in its estimates, the 1998 Ernst & Young report did not include any allowance for debtor attorney fees and chapter 13 administrative costs that accompany chapter 13 repayment plans.

EOUST has an interest in a simplified approach, since it would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of a needs-based approach to personal bankruptcy. EOUST\u2019s estimate of the percentage of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors was closer to that of Ernst & Young than to Creighton/ABI\u2019s, but its estimate of the amount of debt that could actually be repaid was closer to Creighton/ABI\u2019s\u2014about $1 billion. EOUST also provided data to us that illustrated the impact of changed assumptions on the estimate of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors in a sample.

As a result, EOUST thought it likely that the actual amount that could be collected from the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors in its sample was closer to $1 billion than $3.76 billion.

First, they stated that our draft report did not sufficiently focus on the similarities in the findings of the four reports and, specifically, that each of the four reports found that \u201ctens of thousands of above-median income chapter 7 debtors could repay a significant portion of their debts under needs-based bankruptcy proposals.\u201d Second, Ernst & Young noted that our discussion focused on the variables that could affect each report\u2019s estimates rather than on distinguishing which report\u2019s estimates were based on reasonable adherence to proposed legislation and reasonable assumptions. Third, Ernst & Young asserted that we should have assessed the reports based on which one(s) most closely modeled the \u201creasonable\u201d impact of the proposed legislation as drafted. Fourth, Ernst & Young said that we did not make clear that the Creighton/ABI\u2019s estimates cannot be projected nationally and also criticized the Creighton/ABI method of determining transportation ownership allowances. Finally, Ernst & Young provided information on its sample of 1997 chapter 13 case filings that it said showed that, when combined with the provisions of needs-based bankruptcy, would probably result in a significantly higher repayment plan completion rate for \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors.", "With regard to Ernst & Young\u2019s comment that we did not sufficiently highlight the similarities in the reports, we believe our report fully discusses the similarities and differences in the methodologies in the four reports that affected their respective estimates. As we noted, a change in a single assumption or variable could have a significant effect on each of the report\u2019s estimates. Although each report found that some portion of the chapter 7 debtors in their samples were \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors, the reports did not agree on whether these \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors could in fact repay the specified minimum portion of their unsecured nonpriority debts over 5 years. The Creighton/ABI and EOUST reports specifically asserted that the formula used to determine the amount of debts that \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors could potentially repay was unrealistic and that the actual return to unsecured nonpriority creditors would be less than the formula indicated.", "With regard to our focus on the variables and assumptions used in each report, we believe that the combined effect of the three assumptions used in the \u201ccan-pay\u201d formula may lead to a somewhat optimistic estimate of the amount of debt \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would repay. Two of these assumptions were particularly important in each report\u2019s analysis: (1) \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors\u2019 living expenses, as determined under the formula, would remain unchanged for the entire 5-year repayment period, and (2) 100 percent of the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would complete their repayment plans without modification. These two assumptions were based on the means-testing criteria specified in proposed legislation for use in identifying \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors. However, there is no empirical basis for either assumption.", "Historically, about 36 percent of chapter 13 debtors have completed their repayment plans. There is no basis for assuming that the implementation of needs-based bankruptcy would raise that rate to 100 percent. It seems likely that the financial circumstances of at least some of the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would change during the 5-year repayment period. These changes could increase or decrease the debtor\u2019s ability to pay his or her debts. At least some debtors are unlikely to be able to complete their repayment plans for such reasons as death, divorce, or unemployment. Since many economic factors can change in a debtor\u2019s financial situation during 5 years, it would seem prudent to base any policy decisions on a wider range of assumptions than the somewhat optimistic set of assumptions used for the principal estimates in these reports. Therefore, we continue to believe that any estimates based on these assumptions should be viewed with caution.", "Ernst & Young stated that we should have assessed each report with regard to which report most closely modeled the \u201creasonable\u201d impact of proposed legislation as drafted, and that its reports meet that criterion. The Ernst & Young statement is principally based on the differences between its interpretation and Creighton/ABI\u2019s interpretation of the IRS transportation ownership allowance. Creighton/ABI\u2019s interpretation led to a lower estimate of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors than did Ernst & Young\u2019s interpretation. This issue is fully discussed in our report, including appendix I. We believe it is important that policymakers have the information necessary to fully understand the methodologies of each report and the effect the similarities and differences have on each report\u2019s estimates. Moreover, each report made assumptions that were not specifically required by the underlying proposed legislation used in its analysis. For example, Ernst & Young\u2019s method of calculating interest on secured debts was not specified in either H.R. 3150 or H.R. 833.", "In addition, not every provision of proposed needs-based legislation that could have affected each report\u2019s analysis and estimates was found within the needs-based formula itself. For example, H.R. 833 as drafted provides in general that for personal property purchased within 5 years of filing for bankruptcy, the amount of the secured creditor\u2019s claim would not be less than the total amount remaining to be paid under the terms of the loan contract, including interest. This is the amount of the secured creditor\u2019s claim that would have to be paid in full under needs-based bankruptcy. Yet this may not be the same amount as the amount affected debtors listed on their financial schedules. To the extent that the amount of such debt listed by any affected debtors did not include the remaining unpaid interest owed under the contract, Ernst & Young would have understated the amount of the secured claims for such debtors, understated secured debt payments and, thus, overstated the amount of income available for payment of unsecured nonpriority debts. Ernst & Young did not mention this provision in its March 1999 report or its potential effect on the estimates in that report.", "With regard to the Creighton/ABI sample, our report clearly states that the sample cannot be used to make national estimates. However, contrary to Ernst & Young\u2019s statement in its comments, the Creighton/ABI sample is a statistically valid probability sample from the seven districts used in its analysis. Consequently, the results of the sample can be projected to the population of cases in those seven districts. In this characteristic, the Creighton/ABI sample is different from the Credit Research Center sample, also mentioned in Ernst & Young\u2019s comments. That sample was not a statistically valid probability sample from the 13 districts used in the sample.", "With regard to Ernst & Young\u2019s new data on chapter 13 cases and their relevance to the likelihood that a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d percentage of can- pay debtors would complete their chapter 13 plans, we note that these chapter 13 data had not been previously provided to us or publicly available. Consequently, we have not had an opportunity to review them. Ernst & Young stated that its data showed the median income of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors was substantially higher than that for the chapter 13 debtors in its 1997 sample. Ernst & Young states that this higher income, combined with the \u201cneeds-based\u201d restrictions on debtors\u2019 ability to move from chapter 13 to chapter 7, would probably result in a \u201csignificantly higher\u201d chapter 13 completion rate for \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors.", "Although we have not had an opportunity to review these data, we have two basic observations. First, current bankruptcy law provides that chapter 13 repayment plans will be for 3 years unless for cause the bankruptcy court approves a period not to exceed 5 years. The repayment estimates of the four reports were based on a 5-year repayment plan, 2 years longer than is now the case unless extended for cause. This provides 2 additional years in which debtors could experience a change in financial circumstances that could affect their ability to complete their repayment plans.", "Second, the Ernst & Young data do not alter our basic point\u2014that the percentage of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors who complete their 5-year repayment plans is unlikely to be 100 percent. There is no empirical basis for assuming that debtors\u2019 financial circumstances would remain unchanged during the course of a 5-year repayment period, that none of the repayment plans would need to be modified during that 5-year period, and that 100 percent of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would complete their 5-year repayment plans (modified or not). No one knows why some debtors complete their repayment plans and others do not. One reason could be variations in the amount of debt that the repayment plans anticipate the debtors would repay. For example, in the historical study cited in our report, the bankruptcy district with the highest completion rate\u2014about 57 percent-- permitted debtors to enter into repayment plans in which they paid as little as 5 percent of the debt owed to creditors. This is substantially less than the percentage that would be required under needs-based bankruptcy. For those debtors who fail to complete their plans, the return to creditors is likely to be less than estimated in these four reports."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments of Creighton/ABI Report\u2019s Authors and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["The Creighton/ABI authors made several points in their comments. First, they discussed their sample of cases, noting that although theirs was not a national sample, it was a random sample for the seven districts that provided more information on the debtors in each district than did Ernst & Young for the debtors in its individual districts. Moreover, they continued, insistence on national samples for bankruptcy studies, which require extensive collection of case file data, would limit participation in public policy debate to those with the very deepest pockets. Second, the authors stated that they had reweighted their sample based on updated unpublished data we provided and noted that the reweighting had minimal effect on the report\u2019s weighted estimates.  Third, they stated that their method of calculating interest on secured claims, rather than Ernst & Young\u2019s, was the correct approach as a matter of law and bankruptcy practice. Finally, they noted that reasonable people could differ over the interpretation of H.R. 3150 and the use of the IRS transportation ownership allowance. The authors noted that Ernst & Young\u2019s interpretation provided no allowance for leased vehicles, although the IRS expense allowances do provide an ownership allowance for leased vehicles.", "With regard to the Creighton/ABI sample, we agree that it is a statistically valid probability sample whose results can be projected to the population of all chapter 7 cases filed in 1995 in the seven districts from which the sample was drawn. Although it is likely the Creighton/ABI\u2019s sample included more cases in each of its seven districts than did Ernst & Young\u2019s sample, both reports focused their analysis on estimates projected to their respective populations, not to individual districts.", "We agree that statistically valid probability samples of less than national scope, such as Creighton/ABI\u2019s, can be useful for policymaking. The Creighton/ABI sample, based on data from a different year than Ernst & Young\u2019s, provides useful information. Moreover, it is possible to make some comparisons to the Ernst & Young sample\u2019s results. For example, the median income of the \u201ccan\u2019t pay\u201d and \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors in the Creighton/ABI sample and Ernst & Young sample are similar, although their data are for different years. The principal limitation of this comparison is that one cannot statistically estimate whether the results for the Creighton/ABI sample would be basically the same or different for the 1995 national population of chapter 7 debtors.", "Second, with regard to the reweighting of the Creighton/ABI sample, we agree that the results of the reweighting minimally affected the report\u2019s estimates. The reweighting changed Creighton/ABI\u2019s original weighted estimates by less than 0.1 percent.", "With regard to Creighton/ABI\u2019s assertion that the Ernst & Young method of imputing interest on secured claims is incorrect, whether the Ernst & Young method is incorrect depends upon the assumptions made about the repayment of secured debt. As the Creighton/ABI authors noted in their comments, under current bankruptcy law and practice the amount of interest paid on secured claims depends on the length of time in which the secured claim is repaid. Generally, the longer the repayment period, the greater the interest paid on the secured claim. If under needs-based bankruptcy, secured claims payments were spread over 60 months, Creighton/ABI\u2019s method is the appropriate one for imputing interest on secured claims. Given that the needs-based \u201ccan-pay\u201d formula amortizes secured claims over 60 months, it is not unreasonable to assume that such debts would be repaid over 60 months.", "However, if under needs-based bankruptcy secured claims were generally paid in less than 60 months, then the interest paid would be less. Essentially, the Ernst & Young method assumed that most secured debts would be paid in 24 months. This may or may not be true under needs- based bankruptcy. However, if it were true, the Ernst & Young method of imputing interest on secured claims would be appropriate. The difference in the two methods would have an effect on each report\u2019s estimates. Compared to the Creighton/ABI method of imputing interest for 60 months, the Ernst & Young method of imputing interest for 24 months would have resulted in lower secured debt payments and thus greater income available for unsecured nonpriority debt payments.", "With regard to Creighton/ABI\u2019s interpretation of the IRS transportation ownership allowance under H.R. 3150, we have noted that the Creighton/ABI method provided a higher ownership allowance than either the IRS would permit or Ernst & Young permitted for debt-free vehicles and for debtors whose vehicle debt payments are less than the applicable IRS maximum allowance. We agree it is possible that adjustments may need to be made in the 5-year repayment plans of debtors who incur major vehicle repair or replacement costs. To the extent that this proves necessary, Ernst & Young underestimated the amount of debt that would actually be repaid under needs-based bankruptcy. On the other hand, to the extent that such major repair and replacement costs prove to be less than those assumed in the Creighton/ABI report, that report would have underestimated the amount of income that would be available for debt repayment.", "Finally, it not clear that either Ernst & Young or Creighton/ABI was able to accurately capture vehicle lease costs because of the lack of consistent data in the debtors\u2019 schedules. The correct amount to include was the total amount remaining to be paid on the lease. To the extent that the amounts remaining to be repaid on unexpired vehicle leases were not listed on debtors\u2019 schedules of secured debt or unsecured priority debt, neither Ernst & Young nor Creighton/ABI captured the amount remaining to be paid on vehicle leases. As debt payments, the monthly lease payments under needs-based bankruptcy could exceed the IRS maximum transportation ownership allowances. In addition, neither Ernst & Young nor Creighton/ABI would have captured the appropriate amount of the unexpired lease where the debtor listed only the monthly lease payment on the debt schedules.

It reports annual gross median income for one-person households and for households with one earner. The median income for households with one earner is higher. The Census Bureau also reports annual gross median income for households of two or more and for family households of two or more. Households are defined as all persons, related and unrelated, occupying a housing unit. Family households are defined as all persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who reside together. Generally, annual gross median incomes for family households exceed those of nonfamily households. Thus, the table chosen for comparison can affect whether a debtor\u2019s income is determined to be above or below the national median for a household of comparable size.", "The 1998 Ernst & Young report used the lowest annual gross median household incomes for households of one and households of four or more for two reasons. First, it used Census Bureau tables that generally had lower median household incomes than the tables used in the other two reports. Second, based on its interpretation of H.R. 3150 as introduced, the 1998 Ernst & Young report selected for more detailed repayment analysis all debtors whose household incomes were more than 75 percent of the national median household income. In the other two reports, debtors were subject to further repayment analysis if their household incomes were at least 100 percent of the annual gross median household income for households of the same size. This higher standard was based on the median household income standards specified in the proposed legislation used in the other two reports\u2019 analyses.", "An example, which assumes that all the reports used 1997 Census Bureau income data, illustrates the differences. The median annual gross income for a household of one in 1997\u2014the measure used in the 1998 Ernst & Young report--was $18,762. In contrast, the 1997 annual gross median income for a household with one earner\u2014the measure used in the other two reports\u2014was $29,780. To pass the median income test, the 1998 Ernst & Young report required a one-person household to have income in excess of $14,072 (more than 75 percent of $18,762). However, to pass the median income test in the other three reports, the same debtor would have had to have income of at least $29,780\u2014100 percent of the higher median\u2014or more than double the amount required in the 1998 Ernst & Young report (based on 1997 Census Bureau data).", "The median incomes used for households of two to four persons were similar in all three reports, although the national medians used in the 1998 Ernst & Young report were higher for households of two and three persons. However, the incomes diverged again for families of more than four. In all the Census Bureau tables, median household income peaks at families of four and declines for families of five or more. The 1998 Ernst & Young report used the incomes reported in the Census tables for households of more than four. Thus, as family size increased above four, the median income used in the analysis declined. For family households of four or more, the Creighton/ABI report used the median income for a family of four. For family households of more than four, the 1999 Ernst & Young report used the median income for a family household of four, plus $583 annually for each additional household member over four. Each of these methods reflected the proposed legislation used in each report. Had each report used the 1997 Census Bureau tables, the median income used for a family of six would have been $34,849 (1998 Ernst & Young), $53,350 (Creighton/ABI), or $54,516 (1999 Ernst & Young).", "The impact of these different median income thresholds was reflected in each report\u2019s \u201cpass rate\u201d--the percentage of debtors who passed each report\u2019s median income threshold test. The pass rates reported were 47 percent (1998 Ernst & Young), 24.2 percent (Creighton/ABI), and 19 percent (1999 Ernst & Young).

Both reports were based on the same sample of debtors and used 1996 Census data on annual gross median household incomes. The different pass rates for the Creighton/ABI report and the EOUST report may reflect not only the different median income thresholds used, but also (1) differences in the annual household incomes of the sample of debtors each report used for analysis and (2) use of median household incomes for different years, 1993 and 1997, respectively.

Thus, by implication, debtors were to be permitted expenses in excess of the IRS allowances where necessary to repay debt. Consequently, for example, if a debtor\u2019s total monthly vehicle debt payments exceeded the applicable IRS transportation ownership allowance, the higher debt payment would be used as the ownership allowance.", "The Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI reports divided debtors\u2019 living expenses into several categories, including housing and utility expenses (separately for nonhomeowners and homeowners), transportation expenses, other living expenses, other necessary expenses, and business expenses.  While the three reports used the IRS expense standards for determining allowable living expenses in most of these categories, there were differences in how some of these standards were interpreted.

To the extent this occurred, the Ernst & Young analysis would have overstated debtors\u2019 homeowner expenses. The Creighton/ABI report also used the homeowner expenses listed on schedule J to determine a homeowner\u2019s housing and utility allowance. However, property taxes and homeowner insurance, if listed separately on schedule J, were included as expenses only where the schedule indicated that such expenses were not included in the mortgage payment.

IRS revised the ownership allowance in 1998 to base it on Federal Reserve Board of Governors\u2019 data on the 5-year average ownership or leasing costs for new and used cars. Because they are based on IRS standards prior to 1998, none of the three reports used the current standard.

The operating allowance varies by census region and metropolitan statistical area. The current allowance for Boston, Massachusetts, for example, is $220 (no vehicles), $274 (one vehicle), or $328 (two vehicles). IRS regulations describe the application of the ownership and operating allowances as follows: \u201cIf a taxpayer has a car payment, the allowable ownership cost added to the allowable operating cost equals the allowable transportation expense. If a taxpayer has no car payment, or no car, only the operating cost portion of the transportation standard is used to come up with the allowable expense.\u201d", "Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI used different methods to assign the ownership portion of the transportation allowance. There were essentially two differences---secured vehicle debt payments that were less than the applicable IRS maximum ownership allowance and ownership allowances for debt-free vehicles. The similarities and differences in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI methods of determining debtor transportation ownership allowances are shown in table I.2. Although in some cases Creighton/ABI provided a higher ownership allowance than the IRS standards or Ernst & Young, we found no evidence that the Ernst & Young reports or the Creighton/ABI report doubled-counted any portion of the transportation ownership allowance.", "Add remainder of maximum IRS allowance, if any $0 Schedule D\u2014Creditors Holding Secured Claims.

Ernst & Young stated that its review of 193 cases in its sample found that about 2 percent of chapter 7 debtors listed vehicles on schedule B only.", "Based on its interpretation of H.R. 3150 and H.R. 833, Ernst & Young in effect did not use the IRS ownership allowances. It totaled all secured vehicle debt, added 10 percent for interest (equivalent to 9 percent for 2 years), and amortized the resulting total over 60 months. The resulting monthly amount was used as the ownership allowance, whether it was more or less than the applicable IRS ownership allowance. Creighton/ABI totaled all vehicle debt, added 24 percent for interest (equivalent to 9 percent for 5 years), and amortized the resulting total over 60 months. Creighton/ABI used the resulting monthly vehicle debt payment as the ownership allowance if it was equal to or more than the maximum IRS ownership allowance for a household of the same size and number of vehicles as the debtor\u2019s. If the monthly secured debt payment was less than the maximum IRS ownership allowance for a household of the same size and number of vehicles as the debtor\u2019s, Creighton/ABI added the difference to the debtor\u2019s transportation expenses. For example, the maximum IRS ownership allowance for a one-vehicle household is $372 a month. If a debtor in a one-vehicle household had a monthly payment for secured vehicle debt of $333, Creighton/ABI would have allowed an additional monthly allowance of $39 (see table I.2).", "The other principal difference was the ownership allowance for debt-free vehicles. Because there were no secured debt payments for debt-free vehicles, Ernst & Young did not include an ownership allowance for such cars. Creighton/ABI included the IRS ownership allowance for debt-free cars\u2014one allowance for one-person households, one allowance for households of two or more persons with one vehicle, and two allowances for households of two or more persons with two or more vehicles.", "The Creighton/ABI report explained that its approach to the ownership allowance was based on the fact that the proposed \u201cneeds-based\u201d provisions penalize debtors with little or no secured vehicle debt. Debtors with older cars with little or no debt are allowed minimal or no ownership allowance under the IRS standards. The Creighton/ABI report noted that most of the cars in its sample were at least 5 model years old when the debtor filed for bankruptcy, and that debtors owed secured debt on 82 cars that were 10 or more years old. They observed that it was likely that such cars would need either major repairs or replacement during a 5-year debt repayment period, and that limiting the ownership allowance to secured debt payment made no provisions for this probability. To the extent that, during their 5-year repayment plans, debtors faced major vehicle repairs or had to replace their vehicles, the Creighton/ABI method may provide a somewhat more realistic measure of the actual return to unsecured nonpriority creditors. However, to the extent these expenses do not occur during the 5-years, the Creighton/ABI method would understate the amount of income debtors would have available for payments on unsecured nonpriority debt.", "The IRS standards include an ownership allowance for leased vehicles. The Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI reports generally treated costs for leased vehicles similarly. Neither report used the information from schedule G, where unexpired leases should be listed. The needed data on the amount remaining to be paid on unexpired leases were rarely listed on this schedule. Instead, each report treated leased vehicles as secured debt, unsecured priority debt, or unsecured nonpriority debt, depending on how the lease costs were listed on the debtors\u2019 schedules. If the cost of a leased vehicle was listed on schedule D, Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI treated the cost as any other nonhousing secured debt\u2014the amount of the debt was increased by the amount of estimated interest costs and amortized over 60 months. The one difference occurred when the leased vehicle was listed on schedule B only. In such cases, Creighton/ABI would have included an IRS ownership allowance for the vehicle (based on household size and the number of other vehicles reported). Ernst & Young would not have included an ownership allowance in such cases since there was no secured debt, and Ernst & Young used amortized secured debt as the ownership allowance.", "Because accurate data on the amount remaining to be paid on unexpired leases were not available from the debtors\u2019 schedules, Creighton/ABI and Ernst & Young simply used the amount of leased debt as listed on schedules D, E, or F. The amount listed may or may not have been the actual amount remaining to be paid on the unexpired lease. In some cases, debtors may have listed only the monthly lease payment on their schedules. Thus, it is not clear that either Ernst & Young or Creighton/ABI was able to accurately capture the amount of unexpired leases and the appropriate amount of monthly payments for those debtors who were leasing vehicles at the time they filed for bankruptcy.", "Crieghton/ABI\u2019s and Ernst & Young\u2019s methods of assigning vehicle operating allowances were different for households of two or more persons with more than two vehicles. Under the IRS collection financial standards, IRS\u2019 normal practice is to limit vehicle operating allowances to one for households of one and two for households of two or more, unless the taxpayer can demonstrate that any additional vehicles are necessary for producing income. However, debtors are not required to provide on their financial schedules information on whether any or all of their vehicles are necessary for producing income.", "Both Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI determined the number of debtor vehicles by using the larger of the number of vehicles shown on schedules B or D.

It was noted that it would be more helpful to policymakers if we had identified the \u201creasonable\u201d impact of the proposed needs-based legislation as drafted, rather than state that nothing could be known with certainty. Ernst & Young noted that estimates based on how the proposed law would have applied in the past, or future estimates based on reasonable assumptions, are more useful than waiting to validate every assumption.", "With regard to the first comment, our report clearly states that each of the reports found that some portion of chapter 7 debtors in their samples\u2014 ranging from 3.6 percent to 15 percent\u2014met all relevant means-testing criteria, including the potential ability to repay a specific minimum amount of their unsecured nonpriority debts. (see Results in Brief and table 3). We also note that there is some similarity in the median household incomes and median unsecured nonpriority debts of those debtors whom each report determined were \u201ccan\u2019t pay\u201d and \u201ccan pay\u201d debtors (table 5).", "However, our report also notes that both the Creighton/ABI and EOUST reports specifically asserted that the formula used to determine the amount of debt that \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors could potentially repay was unrealistic and that the actual return to unsecured creditors under needs- based bankruptcy would be less than the formula indicated.", "With regard to our emphasis on the variables that could affect the estimates in these four reports, we believe it is important that policymakers be provided information that can help them to understand and interpret the point estimates in these four reports. Whether there are \u201ctens of thousands\u201d of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors and what amount of debt such debtors could potentially repay are questions the answers to which are critically dependent upon the assumptions used to develop the answers. \u201cCan-pay\u201d debtors were defined in the proposed legislation used in the four reports\u2019 analyses as those debtors who (1) met a specific household income test and (2) could potentially repay a specific minimum amount of their unsecured nonpriority debt over 5 years. To determine whether the debtor could repay this minimum amount of unsecured nonpriority debt, each report used two assumptions based upon the means-testing criteria specified in proposed needs-based legislation: (1) the debtor\u2019s income and allowable living expenses would remain stable for the 5-year repayment period and (2) 100 percent of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would complete their 5- year repayment plans. Based on these criteria, the reports calculated whether the debtor\u2019s net monthly income available for payment of unsecured nonpriority debt multiplied by 60 months would be sufficient to pay the minimum total amount of unsecured nonpriority debt specified in the needs-based legislation used in the report\u2019s analysis. If so, the debtor was classified as a \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtor. This same 60-month total was the basis for estimating the total amount of unsecured nonpriority debt each \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtor could potentially repay.", "The fact that these assumptions were specified in proposed legislation for use in identifying \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors did not automatically validate them as empirically based or realistic. There is no empirical basis for assuming that debtors financial circumstances would remain unchanged during the course of a 5-year repayment period, that none of the repayment plans would need to be modified during that 5-year period, and that 100 percent of debtors would complete their repayment plans (modified or not). No one knows how many \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors will be able to complete their 5- year repayment plans on the terms under which bankruptcy court initially confirmed the plans. However, even if the completion rate were higher than the 36 percent for the 953,180 debtors studied by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), it is unlikely to be 100 percent. For those debtors who are unable to complete their repayment plans, the return to creditors is likely to be less than estimated in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI reports, and less than the largest estimate in the EOUST report. 2. Ernst & Young stated that its analyses were the only ones to apply the proposed legislation (H.R. 3150 and H.R. 833) as written. Ernst & Young suggested that we should have used \u201cadherence to the legislative language as a criterion for evaluating the reasonableness of the reports\u2019 methodology.\u201d Ernst & Young principally bases its assertion on the fact that its interpretation of the IRS transportation ownership allowance more closely followed the IRS Collection Financial Standards than did the Creighton/ABI interpretation.", "We clearly described the methodologies of each report, noted where they differed, and discussed the impact of those differences on each report\u2019s estimates. The difference in the Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI interpretation of the IRS transportation allowances are fully discussed in our report, including appendix I. We would only note here that Creighton/ABI, not Ernst & Young, more closely followed IRS practice with regard to the assignment of vehicle operating allowances for households of two or more persons with more than two vehicles.", "Moreover, all of the reports used some methods and assumptions that were not specifically required by proposed needs-based legislation. For example, neither H.R. 3150 nor H.R. 833, the bills used in Ernst & Young\u2019s March 1998 and March 1999 reports, specified any method of imputing the interest on secured claims. Ernst & Young used a lower imputed interest rate for secured debts (9 percent over 2 years) than did Creighton/ABI (9 percent over 5 years). Compared to Creighton/ABI\u2019s method, Ernst & Young\u2019s method would have resulted in lower payments on secured outstanding debts of the same amount. Consequently, the effect of Ernst & Young\u2019s method would have been to include more income than did Creighton/ABI for the payment of unsecured nonpriority debts. The two Ernst & Young reports offered no explanation for why both used a 2-year rather than 5-year period of interest when secured debts were amortized over 5 years in determining debtors\u2019 repayment capacity.", "Further, the proposed legislation did not require that the formula used to identify \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors consider the potential net return to creditors after administrative costs were deducted from debtors\u2019 payments to creditors. Yet this is an important policy consideration. Both the Creighton/ABI report and the second Ernst & Young report included an estimate of the total cost of administrative fees, such as debtor attorney and chapter 13 trustee fees. Payments to creditors would be reduced by the amount of such fees. The Ernst & Young report included estimates using three sets of assumptions. This type of sensitivity analysis would also have been useful in conjunction with the two Ernst & Young reports\u2019 discussion of their estimates of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors and the amount of debt such debtors could potentially repay over 5 years.", "Finally, Ernst & Young did not mention a provision of H.R. 833 that could have affected its estimates of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors and the amount of unsecured nonpriority debt they could repay. Under H.R. 833, the amount of the creditor\u2019s secured claim for personal property purchased within 5 years of filing for bankruptcy would generally be not less than the total remaining amount to be paid, including interest, under the terms of the loan contract. Under current bankruptcy law, the amount of the secured creditor\u2019s allowed claim is generally the market value of the property, which may be more or less than the total amount of principal owed under the loan contract. If it is less, the secured creditor has two claims\u2014(1) a secured claim for the market value of the collateral and (2) an unsecured nonpriority claim for the deficiency between the market value of the collateral and the debt owed on the collateral.", "Ernst & Young did not mention in its March 1999 report whether any of the debtors in its sample would have been affected by this provision of H.R. 833. To the extent that the amount of secured nonhousing debt listed by any affected debtors did not include the unpaid interest owed under the terms of the contract, Ernst & Young would have understated the amount of the secured claims for such debtors, understated secured debt payments and thus overstated the amount of income available for payment of unsecured nonpriority debts. 3. Ernst & Young offered a critique of the Creighton/ABI method of determining debtors\u2019 transportation ownership allowance.", "We believe our report fully discusses this issue, clearly demonstrating where the Creighton/ABI report\u2019s transportation ownership allowances would have varied from the amount that IRS would have provided under its Collection Financial Standards. 4. Ernst & Young also observed that the Creighton/ABI sample is a nonrandom sample whose results cannot be projected nationally. Moreover, the sample could have a very large margin of error that could well encompass Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate that 10 percent of chapter 7 debtors were \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors.", "Our report clearly states that the Creighton/ABI sample cannot be used for national projections. However, the Creighton/ABI sample is a statistically valid random sample for the seven districts used in its analysis. The results of that sample can be projected to the population of 1995 chapter 7 filings in those seven districts. We calculated that the estimates for the seven districts in the Creighton/ABI sample are subject to an error margin of about 1.8 percentage points. 5. Ernst & Young provided new data on a sample of chapter 13 cases filed in 1997 and compared these data with those for its sample of chapter 7 debtors who would be required to file under chapter 13. Ernst & Young stated that these new data, combined with provisions in the proposed \u201cneeds-based\u201d legislation, make it reasonable to expect that the percentage of debtors who would complete a required 5-year repayment plan was likely to be \u201csignificantly higher\u201d than the 36 percent rate shown in available historical data.", "The data presented by Ernst & Young in its comments had not been previously provided to us or available publicly. Therefore, we have had no opportunity to review the analysis and data on which Ernst & Young\u2019s statements are based. However, we do have two observations on the analysis presented.", "First, current bankruptcy law provides that chapter 13 repayment plans will be for 3 years unless for cause the bankruptcy court approves a period not to exceed 5 years. The repayment estimates in the four reports were based on a repayment period of 5 years, 2 years longer than provided for in current bankruptcy law unless extended for cause. This provides 2 additional years in which debtors could experience a change in their financial circumstances that could affect their ability to complete their repayment plans.", "Second, the Ernst & Young data do not alter our basic point\u2014that the percent of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors who complete their 5-year repayment plans is unlikely to be 100 percent. Ernst & Young noted that many current chapter 13 filers use chapter 13 as a temporary means of protecting their homes from creditors and then drop out of chapter 13 after their homes are no longer in danger. In our report, we stated that about 49 percent of chapter 13 cases filed between 1980 and 1998 were dismissed. Such cases would include those debtors who temporarily filed under chapter 13 to protect their homes from foreclosure. It is not clear that the proposed needs-based legislation would necessarily increase or decrease the number of such chapter 13 cases.", "In addition, the AOUSC report we cited found that the district with the highest completion rate\u201457 percent---permitted debtors to repay a very low percentage of their outstanding debt, as little as 5 percent. This is substantially less than the percentage required in any of the proposed needs-based legislation used in the four reports we reviewed.", "We agree with Ernst & Young that the characteristics of the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors required to file under chapter 13 may be different than those cited in the AOUSC study of chapter 13 debtors, or of those who currently file chapter 13 voluntarily. In addition, as we stated in our report, it is possible that the percentage of debtors who complete their required chapter 13 repayment plans under needs-based bankruptcy could increase. However, even if one assumes, for the reasons Ernst & Young states, that under needs-based bankruptcy the percentage of debtors who complete their chapter 13 plans were double to 72 percent\u2014twice the rate found in the AOUSC study\u201428 percent of debtors would not complete their plans. For that 28 percent of debtors, creditors would receive less than Ernst & Young\u2019s reports estimated. The amount of the reduced return to creditors would depend upon when within the 5-year period the court determined the debtor could not complete the plan and the amount of debt remaining to be repaid under the debtor\u2019s repayment plan. For those debtors who do complete their plans, creditors could receive more or less than these four reports estimated. For those debtors whose financial circumstances improve during the 5-year plan, creditors could receive more. For those debtors whose financial circumstances deteriorate, creditors could receive less. However, it is important to emphasize that there is no empirical reason to base repayment estimates on the assumption that 100 percent of those required to file under chapter 13 in a needs-based bankruptcy system would complete their repayment plans. 6. In the conclusion to its comments, Ernst & Young states that other organizations, such as the Congressional Budget Office, make reasonable estimates about the expected impact of proposed legislation using reasonable assumptions and available data. Ernst & Young concluded that its reports provided Congress with important information about the expected impact of the proposed legislation.", "As we have stated in our report, we recognize that using the data from the bankruptcy debtors\u2019 financial schedules, despite such problems as inconsistently reported data, was necessary for each report\u2019s analysis. The debtors\u2019 schedules are the only publicly available source of data about debtors income, expenses, and debts. However, it is equally important to clearly state the limitations of the data used and the implications of the assumptions used.", "We believe that each of the four reports provided Congress with important information about the potential impact of proposed \u201cneeds-based\u201d legislation. The Ernst & Young reports arguably provided an overall \u201cbest- case\u201d estimate of the results of needs-based consumer bankruptcy, if enacted. The Creighton/ABI report provided a lower estimate, principally because of its interpretation of the IRS transportation ownership allowance. In discussing the rationale for its approach, the report highlighted one of the potential problems that could reduce the amount of unsecured nonpriority debt that would be repaid under needs-based bankruptcy. For example, the older the debtors\u2019 cars when they enter chapter 13, the more likely it is that those cars will either need major repairs or replacing (albeit not necessarily with a new car). Moreover, the Creighton/ABI report\u2019s description of the \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors in its sample puts a \u201cpersonal face\u201d on needs-based bankruptcy, providing a partial picture of the variety of debtors who could be affected by needs-based bankruptcy. The EOUST report showed that a much simpler approach to identifying \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors would result in about the same percentage of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors as the more complex method used by Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Authors of the Creighton/ABI Report", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on specific issues included in the letter dated May 28, 1999, from Professors Marianne Culhane and Michaela White, authors of the Creighton/ABI report.

The authors stated that, although theirs was not a national sample, it nevertheless was randomly drawn within the seven districts used in the sample. Moreover, the sample included districts across the country, from rural and urban areas and from low-cost and high-cost areas. In addition, the sample provided a more complete picture of the debtors within each district used because it included a larger number of debtors from each district than did Ernst & Young\u2019s sample.", "We agree that the Creighton/ABI sample is a random sample whose results can be generalized to the population of chapter 7 cases in the seven districts used in its analysis. The districts in its sample are diverse and were initially chosen by the Creighton/ABI\u2019s authors in part because of that diversity. Although the Creighton/ABI sample may include more cases within each district in its sample than did Ernst & Young \u2018s sample, both reports focused on the estimates for the entire population in their respective samples. 2.  The authors stated that they reweighted their results based on data that we provided on converted chapter 7 cases. The results of this reweighting had minimal effect on the report\u2019s estimates.", "As we indicated in our draft report, we were uncertain about the impact of using only total cases filed initially under chapter 7 in each district as the basis for weighting the Creighton/ABI report\u2019s weighted estimates. The Creighton/ABI sample also included some cases that had been filed under chapter 13 but converted to and closed under chapter 7. We provided the authors of the report with updated unpublished data on the total number of cases in each district that had been filed in 1995 under chapter 7 and had been converted to chapter 7 from chapter 13. Based on these data, the authors reweighted their estimates. The new Creighton/ABI analysis provided to us shows that the revised weighting had minimal effect on its estimates. The reweighting did not change any of the report\u2019s weighted estimates by as much as 0.1 percent. 3. The authors state that Ernst & Young\u2019s interest calculations on secured debt are incorrect as a matter of law and practice, substantially overstating debtors\u2019 capacity to repay their unsecured nonpriority debts.", "The Ernst & Young method of calculating interest on secured debts (9 percent for 2 years) would have resulted in lower monthly payments on the same amount of outstanding secured debt than would Creighton/ABI\u2019s method of calculating such interest (9 percent for 5 years). The effect of the Ernst & Young method, compared with the Creighton/ABI method, is to decrease secured debt payments and, thus, increase the amount available for payment to unsecured nonpriority creditors. However, whether the Ernst & Young\u2019s method of imputing interest on secured claims was incorrect depends upon the assumptions made about the repayment of secured debt.", "Under current bankruptcy law, the amount of the creditor\u2019s allowed secured claim is the market value of the collateral securing the claim. The market value of the collateral may be more or less than the amount of the secured outstanding debt. Also, under current bankruptcy law, the secured creditor is entitled to the present value of the secured claim. Interest is usually added to the market value of the secured claim to determine its present value. As the authors of the Creighton/ABI study noted in their comments, the amount of the interest paid on secured claims depends on the length of the repayment period. Generally, the longer the repayment period, the greater the imputed interest on secured claims. In determining this interest on secured claims, Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI differed principally because they used different repayment periods for computing interest on secured nonhousing claims.", "The Creighton/ABI report assumed that secured nonhousing claims would be repaid over 60 months, and computed interest for this entire period. Given that the needs-based \u201ccan-pay\u201d formula amortizes secured claims over 60 months, it is not unreasonable to assume that such debts, including interest, would be repaid over 60 months. If secured claims payments were spread over 60 months\u2014that is, the entire repayment plan period--then Creighton/ABI\u2019s method is the appropriate one for imputing interest on secured claims. However, if it were assumed the secured claims would be paid in less than 60 months, then it would be appropriate to compute interest for a shorter period. Essentially, the Ernst & Young method assumed that most secured debts would be paid in 24 months. This may or may not be true under needs-based bankruptcy. However, if it were true, the Ernst & Young method would be appropriate and correct. 4. The Creighton/ABI authors state that reasonable people can differ over the interpretation of H.R. 3150 and how the IRS expense allowances were to be interpreted within the context of the bill.  The bill directed the use of the IRS allowances \u201cexcluding payments of debts.\u201d Ernst & Young interpreted this to mean that secured vehicle debt payments were to be used as the ownership allowance. Because vehicle lease payments are not secured debt, the Ernst & Young method provided no allowance for vehicle lease payments. Creighton/ABI gave the debtor the IRS ownership allowance, less the amount of secured vehicle debt payments.", "Our report states that the IRS ownership allowance is used by IRS as a \u201ccap.\u201d The allowance includes monthly loan or lease payments for no more than two purchased or leased vehicles. As we noted in our report, the Creighton/ABI interpretation provided a higher transportation ownership allowance than IRS would permit or Ernst & Young permitted for debtors with debt-free vehicles or whose secured vehicle debt payments were less than the maximum applicable IRS allowance.", "The determination of actual lease payments was problematical for Ernst & Young and Creighton/ABI because the data in Schedule G (unexpired leases) were not generally useful for determining the amount remaining to be paid on the vehicle lease. As we discussed in our report, neither Creighton/ABI nor Ernst & Young found the data on leased vehicles in their samples to be particularly consistent. Ernst & Young did not include a transportation ownership allowance for vehicle lease payments unless they were listed as secured debt. If the lease payments, or the amount remaining to be paid on the lease, were listed as unsecured priority or unsecured nonpriority debt, no ownership allowance was included.", "We agree that it is possible that adjustments may need to be made in the 5- year repayment plans of debtors who incur substantial major vehicle repairs or are required to replace a vehicle. To the extent this occurs, the actual amount the debtor repaid to creditors could be less than anticipated at the beginning of the repayment plan, or in the \u201ccan-pay\u201d formula as interpreted by Ernst & Young. On the other hand, to the extent this need does not arise, the Creighton/ABI method of determining transportation ownership allowances would understate the amount of income that would be available for debt repayment. 5. The authors stated that there are questions about the Ernst & Young database that we did not address in our report. These include the high percentage of asset cases in the chapter 7 debtor sample, the fact that the sample was not strictly proportional to the chapter 7 filings in each district, and that Ernst & Young excluded what appears to be a high number of sample cases from its analysis.", "Ernst & Young\u2019s report did not discuss whether the asset cases in its sample had a higher proportion of \u201ccan-pay\u201d debtors than did the no-asset cases in its sample. To be statistically valid, a sample need not be designed so that sample sizes are strictly proportional to the sizes of known subgroups within the population from which the sample was drawn. However, if a sample design is intentionally disproportionate to the size of known subgroups, projections to the population from which the sample was drawn must be appropriately weighted. It appears that Ernst & Young did such reweighting. Although the number of cases excluded from the analysis was higher than Creighton/ABI experienced, it is not necessarily an unusually high number of cases to exclude."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments From the Executive Office for U.S. Trustees", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": ["In addition to those named above, David Alexander, Anne Rhodes-Kline, Sidney Schwartz, Wendy Ahmed, and Geoffrey Hamilton made key contributions to this report.", "The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
