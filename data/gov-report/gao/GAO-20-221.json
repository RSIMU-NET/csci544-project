Of this $6 billion, $5.1 billion was obligated for emergency work projects such as debris removal and temporary power restoration. However, FEMA and Puerto Rico faced challenges in developing long-term, permanent work projects under the Public Assistance program. The large number of damaged sites and delays in establishing cost estimation guidance specific to Puerto Rico have also presented challenges to developing projects, according to FEMA and Puerto Rico officials. Both parties must agree to fixed cost estimates for these projects before work can begin. FEMA and Puerto Rico had approved fixed cost estimates for 19 projects as of September 2019, out of 9,344 damaged sites in Puerto Rico, such as schools, hospitals, and roads. FEMA and Puerto Rico have recently taken actions, including extending the deadline for fixed cost estimates, to address these challenges.

Accurate and reliable cost estimating is especially  important in Puerto Rico where all large permanent Public Assistance  projects are being developed under the alternative procedures, which  require a fixed cost estimate that cannot be revised once the award is  made.

For example, it does not discuss the  risk of an assumption being incorrect and the resultant effect on the cost  estimate. Additionally, FEMA guidance substantially met the step to  \u201cdocument the estimate\u201d because it contains, among other things, basic  information about the project and the estimate; a description of the scope  of work; the basis for the estimate; and supporting backup information.  However, we assessed this step as substantially met instead of fully met  because FEMA policy does not require documentation to include a  discussion of high risk areas.", "Further, we found that FEMA\u2019s guidance for cost estimating does not fully  or substantially meet three steps: (1) conduct a sensitivity analysis; (2)  obtain the data; and (3) conduct a risk and uncertainty analysis.", "Sensitivity analysis (Minimally met): We found that FEMA\u2019s cost  estimating guidance only minimally met the best practice regarding  sensitivity analysis. A sensitivity analysis addresses some of the  uncertainty in a cost estimate by testing assumptions and other factors  that could change cost. By examining each assumption or factor  independently, while holding all others constant, the cost estimator can  evaluate the results to discover which assumptions or factors most  influence the estimate. A sensitivity analysis also requires estimating the  high and low uncertainty ranges for significant cost driver input factors.  According to the GAO Cost Guide, when an agency does not identify the  effect of uncertainties associated with different assumptions, this  increases the chance that decisions will be made without a clear  understanding of these impacts on costs.", "According to FEMA officials, FEMA\u2019s cost estimating guidance accounts  for construction, cost, and market risks over time which allows FEMA to  plan and estimate costs for unknown or unforeseen circumstances such  as cost escalation or overhead. In addition, FEMA officials stated that  their use of RSMeans unit costs, a benchmark industry standard based  on ongoing iterative analysis of construction costs nationwide, allows  FEMA to account for fluctuations and uncertainties in the market.  However, we rated this step as minimally met because FEMA guidance  does not indicate that cost estimators are to conduct a sensitivity analysis  as part of FEMA\u2019s cost estimating process. Specifically, the guidance  does not require that an estimator examine the effect of changing  assumptions and the effect these changes could have on a cost estimate.  Since the guidance does not direct estimators to conduct a sensitivity  analysis, estimators may not fully understand which variable most affects  the cost estimate and FEMA risks making decisions without a clear  understanding of the impact of costs.", "Obtaining the data (Partially met): We found that FEMA\u2019s cost  estimating guidance only partially met the best practice for obtaining  data\u2014assembling information to serve as the foundation of a cost  estimate. The quality of the data obtained affects a cost estimate\u2019s overall  credibility. Depending on the data quality, an estimate can range from a  mere guess to a highly defensive cost position. We found that FEMA did  not meet some of the best practices for obtaining data. Specifically,  FEMA\u2019s guidance did not outline procedures for making sure data was  validated using historical data as a benchmark for reasonableness. In  addition, FEMA\u2019s guidance did not stipulate that data be normalized to  remove the effects of inflation or analyzed with a scatter plot to determine  trends and outliers. As mentioned previously, FEMA used a city cost  index based on San Juan as an interim measure to estimate costs  throughout Puerto Rico until September, 2019 when FEMA began using  additional cost indices to target costs in particular regions of Puerto Rico.  Similarly, FEMA has been using a static future price factor as an interim  measure until a more dynamic and iterative future price curve is finalized.  FEMA does not plan to adjust cost estimates developed using these  interim measures. Without adjusting these costs when better data  becomes available consistent with the obtaining the data step, FEMA  risks creating estimates that may not be based on accurate data.", "According to FEMA, estimates are developed based on historical costs or  nationally available industry standard data. In addition, FEMA officials  stated that FEMA does not revisit cost estimates to reflect updated  market conditions or newly available cost information because FEMA  uses an industry standard cost database that is updated quarterly. FEMA  officials stated that the interim measures used to estimate costs are  intended to enable work to continue and cost estimates to be developed  while the future cost curve is being developed. However, we rated the  step relating to obtaining data as partially met because without finalizing  the future cost curve, and updating estimates to reflect this information,  estimates may not be based on accurate data. Additionally, while the use  of industry standard cost estimating resources addresses some best  practices for this step such as data normalization and data validation,  industry data is only one of many sources referenced in FEMA\u2019s  guidance. For other data sources identified, FEMA guidance does not  describe a process to analyze the data for cost drivers or to adequately  document the data.", "Risk and uncertainty analysis (Partially met): We found that FEMA\u2019s  cost estimating guidance does not include best practices consistent with  performing a statistical analysis of risk to determine a range of possible  costs and the level of confidence in achieving the estimate. By conducting  a risk and uncertainty analysis, a cost estimator can model the effect of  schedules slipping and missions changing, allowing for a known range of  potential costs. Having a range of costs around a point estimate is useful  to decision makers because it conveys the level of confidence in  achieving the most likely cost and informs estimators about potential  risks. We found that FEMA\u2019s cost estimating guidance does not require  a statistical analysis of risks to be performed to determine a range of  possible costs. While contingencies are accounted for within the  guidance, they are not derived from a statistical analysis, nor do they  reflect a level of confidence in the estimate.", "According to FEMA, risks associated with changing costs and conditions  over the life of a Public Assistance alternative procedures construction  project is not a risk that the federal government takes on. Rather, the risk  is transferred to the recipient and subrecipients responsible for executing  work using Public Assistance alternative procedures funding. In addition,  FEMA officials told us that alternative procedures funding is not always  used to restore facilities to pre-disaster condition, and therefore may not  represent the final cost of work completed. In addition, the procedures are  designed to incentivize subrecipients to manage grants and use excess  funds for eligible work, as described earlier. However, GAO\u2019s Cost Guide  states that point estimates alone are insufficient for good decision- making. For management to make good decisions, the program estimate  must reflect the degree of uncertainty, so that a level of confidence can  be given about the estimate regardless of the entity holding the risk. In  the case of alternative procedures projects in Puerto Rico, where actual  costs that exceed the estimate are borne by the recipient or subrecipient,  estimates that accurately reflect the degree of uncertainty are important in  establishing a level of confidence about the estimate.", "While FEMA fully or substantially met nine of the 12 steps in the GAO  Cost Guide, FEMA could improve its cost estimating guidance to ensure  that all best practices in the 12 steps in the GAO Cost Guide are fully met.  In doing so, FEMA could further enhance the reliability of its cost  estimating guidance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FEMA Has Developed Public Assistance Program Policies and Guidance over Time for Puerto Rico, but Recovery Partners Reported Challenges", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA Public Assistance Program Policies and Guidance for Puerto Rico", "paragraphs": ["In response to the complexity of the recovery, as well as the nature of  change in a recovery environment, FEMA has developed and issued  guidance that is specific to the implementation of the Public Assistance  program in Puerto Rico.

Therefore, according to FEMA officials, the  standard guidance for the Public Assistance program, Public Assistance  Policy and Procedures Guide (Policies and Procedures Guide), generally  applies in Puerto Rico.", "FEMA has also developed policies and guidance to address the specific  recovery circumstances in Puerto Rico. For example, in April of 2018 and  September of 2019, FEMA published the Public Assistance Alternative  Procedures Guide for Permanent Work to clarify how FEMA would  implement the program in Puerto Rico. This guidance describes the  scope and limitations of the alternative procedures; highlights changes to  aspects of the Public Assistance program to which these procedures  apply; identifies responsibilities for certain activities; and documents  timelines for key actions and decisions. FEMA also issued a policy on the  agency\u2019s implementation of section 20601 of the Bipartisan Budget Act as  it applies in Puerto Rico in September of 2018, detailing the applicability  of the section to specific critical services and outlining eligible industry  standards for purposes of authorized projects, among other things.  Following the Supplemental Relief Act, FEMA issued guidance in  September 2019 that includes additional information on eligibility and  applicable industry standards.

Officials from the  central recovery office and four Puerto Rico government agencies we  spoke with stated that they did not consistently have the guidance they  needed to implement the Public Assistance program. For example, an  official from one Puerto Rico agency said that they delayed starting on  any large Public Assistance projects through alternative procedures  because they were waiting for FEMA to issue additional guidance.  Similarly, we reported in March 2019 that four municipal officials stated  that they were waiting on additional instruction from FEMA to establish  more clear and consistent guidance to begin projects in Puerto Rico.", "According to FEMA officials, the agency works with Puerto Rico  government officials and subrecipients to provide relevant guidance and  technical assistance throughout the Public Assistance project  development process. However, we found that pertinent guidance may  not be shared with key recovery partners. For example, FEMA officials  told us that the Standard Operating Procedure for Alternative Procedures  (SOP) was available as of March 2019, but remains in draft form as of  October 2019, pending finalized information about cost estimating  procedures. This SOP provides instruction on specific procedures to  implement the Public Assistance alternative procedures guide. In April  2019, FEMA officials described the SOP as a \u201cliving document\u201d; they also  stated that the draft SOP is in effect and has been sent to the central  recovery office for further dissemination to subrecipients. While the SOP  document is still in draft, according to FEMA officials, it is operative  guidance that FEMA expects the central recovery office to disseminate to  subrecipients. However, in June 2019, central recovery office personnel  told us they did not view the SOP as being in effect as it was still in draft  form. As such, central recovery office officials stated they had not  distributed the SOP to subrecipients. FEMA officials stated that they rely  on the central recovery office to disseminate at least some FEMA  guidance and policy to subrecipients in Puerto Rico, including  municipalities and government agencies. As the recipient for all Public  Assistance funding in Puerto Rico, the central recovery office is  responsible for monitoring and providing technical assistance to  subrecipients to ensure that federal funding is used in accordance with  federal statutes, regulations, and the requirements of the grant. FEMA  officials also stated that subrecipients have an assigned FEMA point of  contact to assist them through the project development process, including  communicating policy information and updates. However, municipal and  Puerto Rico agency officials we spoke to said that confusion persisted in  part due to changing points of contact.", "FEMA\u2019s reliance on the central recovery office or individual FEMA staff to  deliver and distribute FEMA guidance poses a risk that the guidance is  not made accessible to all partners involved in recovery, including  subrecipients. While FEMA officials told us that FEMA assigns a point of  contact to subrecipients to provide guidance and other necessary  information throughout the project development process, Puerto Rico  officials described a significant amount of \u201cback and forth\u201d with FEMA  regarding requests for clarification, guidance, or instruction. FEMA  officials acknowledge that FEMA has faced difficulties in disseminating  information in Puerto Rico. According to FEMA officials, FEMA does not  maintain a repository of Public Assistance policies and guidance available  to all relevant recovery partners. The accessibility of FEMA guidance is  especially important because FEMA releases iterative guidance to  respond and adapt to changing recovery circumstances, such as updated  legislation, among other things. Misunderstandings across recovery  partners about guidance applicability raise concerns that subrecipients do  not understand which guidance is currently in effect or how they should  proceed in accordance with FEMA policy.

This  plan outlines the central recovery office\u2019s management and oversight  activities as well as the procedures that Puerto Rico must follow in  implementing the programs. Puerto Rico is responsible, as required in the  FEMA State Agreement, to ensure that subrecipients are in compliance  with the conditions of the disaster grant award. For example, the plan  emphasizes FEMA\u2019s requirement that Puerto Rico submit quarterly  progress and financial reports on the status of projects. Further, the plan  describes Puerto Rico\u2019s specific roles and responsibilities for managing  and overseeing the program. For example, according to the Puerto Rico  2019 Public Assistance Administrative Plan, the central recovery office is  responsible for, among other things, processing requests for time  extensions to complete projects and conducting quarterly reviews, site  inspections, and audits to ensure program compliance.", "Third, in addition to the administrative plan, in March 2019, the central  recovery office released the Disaster Recovery Federal Funds  Management Guide (management guide) that includes an internal  controls plan and other policies and procedures for managing recovery  funds. The management guide\u2019s 14 chapters outline roles,  responsibilities, policies and procedures on various recovery functions  including procurement, payment and cash management, and subrecipient  management and oversight, among other things. FEMA officials told us  that they reviewed portions of the management guide, including sections  on the central recovery office\u2019s payment and cash management plan and  subrecipient oversight.

For example,  agency officials at one government agency we spoke with stated that they  were performing their own federal grants management and had prior  experience managing large federal funds. Other Puerto Rico government  officials we interviewed reported that central recovery office contractors  have helped augment capacity to oversee federal funds. For example,  officials from one subrecipient, a Puerto Rico public corporation, said that  their agency did not have prior experience managing federal funds on  such a large scale. The official told us that in order to bolster the capacity  of the agency to oversee these grant funds, central recovery office  contractors work closely with the agency to help them manage Public  Assistance funding.

According to the procedures outlined in the central recovery office\u2019s  management guide, each subrecipient is to be assessed annually to  determine whether they are at a low, moderate, or high risk for  noncompliance. The central recovery office is to place additional award  conditions on subrecipients with risk factors identified through the risk  assessment process.
