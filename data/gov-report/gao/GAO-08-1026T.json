However, agencies have made less progress in getting their managers' to use performance information in their decision making. GAO was asked to testify on the preliminary results of ongoing work looking at (1) trends in federal managers' use of performance information to manage, both governmentwide and at the agency level; (2) how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to improve results; and (3) lessons learned from prior management reforms for the next administration. Our statement is based on prior GAO reports and surveys we conducted in 1997, 2000, 2003, and 2007. For the results of our 2007 survey, see e-supplement GAO-08-1036SP .

However, despite having more performance measures available, federal managers' reported use of performance information in management decision making has not changed significantly. For the collection of performance information to be considered more than meaningless paperwork exercises, it must be useful to and used by federal decision makers at all levels--including Congress. To reach this state, GAO believes that the next administration should promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the last 10 years: (1) demonstrate leadership commitment to results-oriented management; (2) develop a clear \"line of sight\" linking individual performance with organizational results; and (3) build agency capacity to collect and use performance information. In addition to encouraging agencies to employ these practices, the next administration should: (1) adopt a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing governmentwide performance; (2) improve the relevance of performance information to Congress; and (3) build agency confidence in assessments for use in decision making."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the results of our 2007 Survey on  Performance and Management Issues and lessons learned over the past 15  years through legislative and executive efforts to improve the management  and performance of the federal government. Recent events, such as lead  paint in imported children\u2019s products, tainted meat, predatory mortgage  lending, contract fraud, and national disasters like Hurricane Katrina and  the attacks of September 11, 2001, raise questions among the American  people about the capacity of the federal government to meet their most  pressing needs. Additionally, the nation\u2019s long-term fiscal imbalance drives  the need for federal agencies to allocate increasingly scarce resources in  the most efficient and effective way possible. The next administration can  continue to bring a greater focus on improving the performance of federal  programs and ensuring that federal funds are allocated effectively by  building on the strengths of prior performance improvement initiatives.", "Over the past 15 years, various reform efforts have attempted to shift the  focus of federal government management from a preoccupation with  activities to the results or outcomes of those activities. Congress enacted  the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) to inform  congressional and executive decision making by providing objective  information on the relative effectiveness and efficiency of federal  programs and spending. That same year, the Clinton administration  launched the National Performance Review (NPR), which was intended to  make the government \u201cwork better and cost less.\u201d The current  administration has also attempted to resolve long-standing federal  management weaknesses through its five governmentwide management  priorities under the President\u2019s Management Agenda (PMA), which was  first announced in 2001. A central element in the Performance  Improvement Initiative of the PMA is the Office of Management and  Budget\u2019s (OMB) Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART), which was  created in 2002 and serves as a diagnostic tool that is intended to provide a  consistent approach for evaluating federal programs as part of the  executive budget formulation process. Through PART, OMB has sought to  create better ties between program performance and the allocation of  resources. Prior to these efforts, our work on performance measurement  in the federal government showed that federal agencies generally lacked  the infrastructure needed to manage and report on the results of federal  programs in a way that was transparent to Congress and the American  people.", "Based on over a decade of work in this area, we can say that there has  been a transformation in the capacity of the federal government to manage  for results. This capacity includes an infrastructure of outcome-oriented  strategic plans, performance measures, and accountability reporting that  has significantly increased over time and provides a solid foundation for  improving the performance of federal programs. However, we have found  that progress is still needed to further integrate information about program  performance into federal managers\u2019 decision making and ensure continued  progress.", "You asked us to discuss: (1) the trends in federal managers\u2019 reported use  of performance information governmentwide and at the agency level as  identified through four surveys we conducted over the past 10 years; (2)  how agencies can encourage greater use of performance information to  improve federal program management; and (3) lessons learned to be  considered by the next Congress and administration for future  performance improvement initiatives.", "In summary, our surveys show that, while significantly more federal  managers\u2019 have performance measures for their programs and some  agencies have shown greater use of information, overall the use of  performance information in management decision making has not  changed over the last 10 years. To remedy this situation, the next  administration should focus its efforts on ensuring that performance  information is both useful and used. First, the next administration should  promote three key practices that we have identified in our work over the  last decade to ensure that the performance information gathered is used in  making management decisions: (1) demonstrating leadership commitment  to results-oriented management; (2) developing a clear \u201cline of sight\u201d  linking individual performance with organizational results; and (3)  building agency capacity to collect and use performance information. In  addition, the next administration should focus its attention on: (1)  adopting a more strategic and crosscutting approach to overseeing  governmentwide performance; (2) improving the relevance of  performance information to Congress; and (3) building agency confidence  in assessments for use in decision making.", "Our statement is based on survey data collected in response to your  request that we examine the extent to which federal agency managers are  using performance information and how selected agencies could improve  their use of performance information to achieve results. We will be issuing  a report at a later date that addresses both these questions, including an  analysis of practices at selected agencies. Our survey, which included a  random, stratified, governmentwide sample of federal managers at the GS- 13 level and above, was conducted from October 2007 through January  2008, and is comparable to surveys we conducted in 1997, 2000, and 2003.  Our 2000 and 2007 surveys included a larger sample of government  managers\u2014over 4,000 in 2007\u2014that allowed for analysis of individual  agency-level results. Significant differences are reported at the 95 percent  confidence interval. In reporting federal managers\u2019 positive responses to  survey questions asking about the extent to which a condition or practice  was present (ranging in five categories from \u201cno\u201d to \u201cvery great\u201d extent),  we are reporting responses that indicated to a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cvery great\u201d  extent. Concurrently with this statement, we are issuing an electronic  supplement that shows the responses to all survey items. In addition to  the survey results, we also drew from our extensive prior work on GPRA,  PART, transformational change, and performance management. We  conducted our work from March 2007 to July 2008, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governmentwide Use of Performance Information in the Past 10 Years Remains Unchanged Although Some Agencies Show Improvements", "paragraphs": ["Based on federal managers\u2019 responses on our four governmentwide  surveys conducted over the past 10 years, performance planning and  measurement have slowly, yet increasingly, become a part of agencies\u2019  cultures. In particular, as shown in figure 1, significantly more federal  managers today report having the types of performance measures called  for by GPRA and PART than they did 10 years ago.", "However, unless federal managers use performance data to make  management decisions and to inform policymakers, the benefit of  collecting performance information cannot be realized and real  improvement in management and program results are less likely to be  achieved. We have found that despite having more performance measures,  the extent to which managers make use of this information to improve  performance has remained relatively unchanged. As shown in figure 2,  seven of the nine categories of management activities we asked about  showed no significant change over the past 10 years.", "In particular, despite efforts through GPRA and PART to help government  better inform resource allocation decisions with performance information,  over the past decade, there has been no significant shift in the percent of  managers reporting they use information obtained from performance  measurement when allocating resources. In addition, contract  management remains the management activity with the least reported use  of performance information, despite recommendations for better  management of federal contracts from Congress and GAO and efforts to  improve contract management through the PMA Competitive Sourcing  Initiative. In 2007, 41 percent of managers reported that they use  performance information when developing and managing contracts, a 3  percentage point increase from 2000, when we first asked the question.  Given the growing fiscal imbalance, the government must get the best  return it can on its investment in goods and services by improving its  development, management, and assessment of contracts; using  performance information in these activities can help to focus contract  management on results.", "Of interest, there were two areas relating to managers\u2019 use of performance  information in management decision making that did change significantly  between 1997 and 2007. First, there was a significant decrease in the  percentage of managers who reported that their organizations used  performance information when adopting new program approaches or  changing work processes. Performance information can play a valuable  role in highlighting the need to take a closer look at the effectiveness of  existing approaches and processes. Such an examination could lead to  identifying needed changes to bring about performance improvements.  Second, there was a significant increase in the percentage of managers  who reported that they reward the employees they manage or supervise  based on performance information. We believe this is an important  development that can play a role in getting managers to pay attention to  their performance; we will discuss this in more detail later in this  statement.", "While in general there has been little change in federal managers\u2019 reported  use of performance information governmentwide, agency level  comparisons between 2000 and 2007 reveal that some agencies have made  notable progress. For example, over the last 7 years, the Nuclear  Regulatory Commission (NRC) showed a significant increase in positive  responses to eight questions related to use of performance information in  management activities. At the same time, DOD showed no change in their  responses to questions related to the use of performance information and  the Small Business Administration (SBA) reported significantly lower use  of performance in 2007 than 2000 on two questions.", "As seen in table 1, the range of use also varied considerably among  agencies with Forest Service (FS) and Department of the Interior  (Interior) managers among the lowest users, and the Social Security  Administration (SSA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration  (NASA) among the highest.", "The PART has been used by the current administration to increase the  government\u2019s focus on improving program performance results.  Specifically, OMB includes an assessment of whether programs use  performance information for program management as one element of its  overall program assessment. In judging agency progress on the  Performance Integration Initiative of the PMA, OMB also considers  whether PART findings and performance information are used  consistently to justify funding requests, management actions, and  legislative proposals. However, of the federal managers familiar with  PART, a minority\u201426 percent\u2014indicated that PART results are used in  management decision making, and 14 percent viewed PART as improving  performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Practices for Improving Government through the Use of Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["As our survey results show, despite legislative and administration efforts  to focus federal management decisions on the achievement of results and  maximize the use of federal funds, changing the way federal managers  make decisions is not simply a matter of making program performance  information available. Based on our work on management reform efforts  as well as analysis of federal managers\u2019 responses to our surveys over the  past 10 years, we have identified three key practices that can contribute to  greater attention to results when making management decisions.  Regardless of the form of future initiatives, the next administration should  take steps to ensure that agencies emphasize these practices to make sure  that performance information is used in management decision making:  1.  demonstrate leadership commitment to results-oriented management;  2.  create a clear \u201cline of sight\u201d linking individual performance with  3.  build agency capacity to collect and use performance information."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Demonstrate Leadership Commitment to Results- Oriented Management", "paragraphs": ["Perhaps the single most important element in successfully implementing  organizational change is the demonstrated, sustained commitment of top  leaders. Leaders can demonstrate their support for results-oriented  management and facilitate the use of performance information by agency  managers through frequent and effective communication of performance  information. On our survey, we found a positive relationship between  agency managers who reported that performance information is effectively  communicated on a routine basis and managers\u2019 reported use of  performance information in key management activities\u2014in other words,  greater communication of performance information is associated with  greater use. Leaders can communicate performance information in their  organizations by promoting the use of visual tools such as poster displays,  performance scorecards, and intranet sites. In prior reviews, officials have  told us that publicizing performance information can inspire a greater  sense of ownership on the part of employees in their unit\u2019s performance; it  can also spur competition between units. Additionally, we found that  frequently reporting performance information can help to identify program  problems before they escalate, identify the factors causing the problems,  and modify services or processes to try to address problems. Leaders can  play a key role in this process by following up on problems identified  during discussions of performance information and by holding managers  accountable for addressing the problems.", "From 1997 to 2007, we saw a significant increase in the percent of  managers\u2014from 57 to 67 percent\u2014-who reported that top leadership  demonstrates a strong commitment to achieving results (see fig. 3.). Our  survey results confirm the relationship between leadership commitment to  results-oriented management and managers\u2019 reported use of performance  information in key management activities, such as developing program  strategy and making decisions about funding or allocating resources.  Similarly, managers who believed their immediate supervisor paid  attention to the use of performance information in decision making also  perceived that managers at their level made greater use of performance  information. Regarding the contribution of PART to improving this  practice, 37 percent of federal managers familiar with PART reported that  upper management has paid greater attention to performance and  achieving results. More than any other items we asked about concerning  the effect of PART, this item received the greatest degree of endorsement  from federal managers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Create a Clear \u201cLine of Sight\u201d Linking Individual Performance with Organizational Results", "paragraphs": ["To be successful, governmentwide performance improvement initiatives  must ensure that all employees involved in the process understand the  rationale for making the changes and their role and responsibility in the  process. Performance management systems are a vital tool for managing  and directing such organizational transformations because they create a  \u201cline of sight\u201d showing how team, unit, and individual performance can  contribute to overall organizational results. Additionally, performance  management systems can be used to hold employees accountable for  achieving and incorporating results into management and employee  decision making.", "Over the past 10 years, we found positive trends in federal managers\u2019  responses to several questions relating to how agencies are managing their  employees, which agencies can build upon to further emphasize the  importance of managing by results (see fig. 4.). Specifically, we saw a  statistically significant increase\u2014from 53 percent in 1997 to 61 percent in  2007\u2014in the percentage of federal managers that reported using  performance information when rewarding government employees they  manage. Additionally, a significantly higher number of federal managers  reported that employees in their agency receive positive recognition for  helping the agency accomplish its strategic goals from 1997 to 2007.", "At the same time, an increasing portion of senior executives report they  are being held more accountable for results. In recent years, Congress and  the administration modernized the performance appraisal and pay systems  for senior executives by requiring a clearer link between individual  performance and pay. Specifically, agencies are allowed to raise Senior  Executive Service (SES) base pay and total compensation caps if their  performance appraisal systems are certified by the Office of Personnel  Management (OPM) with concurrence by the Office of Management and  Budget (OMB) as, among other things, linking performance for senior  executives to the organization\u2019s goals and making meaningful distinctions  based on relative performance.", "In our past work on performance management and pay issues, we have  reported that performance-based pay cannot be simply overlaid on most  organizations\u2019 existing performance management systems. Rather, as a  precondition to effective pay reform, individual expectations must be  clearly aligned with organizational results, communication on individual  contributions to annual goals must be ongoing and two-way, meaningful  distinctions in employee performance must be made, and cultural changes  must be undertaken. Most important, leading organizations have  recognized that effective performance management systems create a \u201cline  of sight\u201d showing how unit and individual performance can contribute to  overall organizational goals and can help them drive internal change and  achieve external results. Effective performance-management systems  that hold executives accountable for results can help provide continuity  during times of leadership transition, such as the upcoming change in the  administration, by maintaining a consistent focus on organizational  priorities.", "Interestingly, since our 2003 survey, SES responses regarding  accountability show a significant increase. Between 2003 and 2007, there  was a 14 percentage point increase in the number of SES who responded  that managers/supervisors at their level are held accountable for  accomplishment of agency strategic goals. In 2007, there was a 12  percentage point increase in the number of SES who reported that they  are held accountable for the results of the programs, operations, or  projects for which they are responsible as compared to 2003 (see fig. 5.).  There was no significant change in responses from 2003 to 2007 in non- SES level responses to either of these questions.", "As we have previously reported, it is important to ensure that managers  have the authority to implement changes to the programs for which they  are held accountable. Our 2007 survey results, however, indicate a  growing gap between senior executives\u2019 perceptions of their  accountability for program performance as opposed to their decision- making authority (see fig. 6). In 2007, 81 percent of senior executives  reported that they are held accountable for the results of the programs for  which they are responsible, while 62 percent reported that they have the  decision-making authority they need to help the agency achieve its  strategic goals, a 19 percentage point difference.

In  earlier work, we found a positive relationship between agencies providing  training and development on setting program performance goals and the  use of performance information when setting or revising performance  goals. While our survey found a significant increase in training since 1997,  only about half of our survey respondents in 2007 reported receiving any  training that would assist in strategic planning and performance  assessment. We previously recommended that OMB ensure that agencies  are making adequate investments in training on performance planning and  measurement, with a particular emphasis on how to use performance  information to improve program performance. However, OMB has not yet  implemented our recommendation.", "In addition to building agency capacity by educating staff on how to use  performance information, it is also important to ensure that the  information gathered meets users\u2019 needs for completeness, accuracy,  consistency, timeliness, validity, and ease of use. Our survey results  indicate that those federal managers who felt they had sufficient  information on the validity of the performance data they use to make  decisions were more likely to report using performance information in key  management activities. Interestingly, this question regarding managers\u2019  perception of the validity of performance data was more strongly  associated with managers\u2019 reported use of performance information than  it was with any other question on the survey. Additionally, we found a  significant relationship between federal managers reporting that managers  at their level are taking steps to ensure that performance information is  useful and appropriate and their reported use of performance information  in key management activities.

Additionally, focusing  decision makers\u2019 attention on the most pressing policy and program issues  and on how related programs and tools affect broader outcomes and goals  may better capture their interest throughout the process. The current  administration\u2019s PART initiative focuses on individual programs, which  aligns with OMB\u2019s agency-by-agency budget reviews, but has been used  infrequently to address crosscutting issues or to look at broad program  areas in which several programs or program types address a common goal.  Crosscutting analysis looking at broad program areas is necessary to  determine whether a program complements and supports other related  programs, whether it is duplicative and redundant, or whether it actually  works at cross-purposes to other initiatives. While OMB has reported on a  few crosscutting assessments in recent budget requests, we have  suggested that OMB adopt this approach more widely and develop a  common framework to evaluate all programs\u2014including tax expenditures  and regulatory programs\u2014intended to support common goals.", "We have previously reported GPRA could provide OMB, agencies, and  Congress with a structured framework for addressing crosscutting  program efforts. OMB, for example, could use the provision of GPRA that  calls for OMB to develop a governmentwide performance plan to integrate  expected agency-level performance. Unfortunately, this provision has not  been implemented fully. OMB issued the first and only such plan in  February 1998 for fiscal year 1999. Without such a governmentwide focus,  OMB is missing an opportunity to assess and communicate the  relationship between individual agency goals and outcomes that cut across  federal agencies and more clearly relate and address the contributions of  alternative federal strategies. The governmentwide performance plan also  could help Congress and the executive branch address critical federal  performance and management issues, including redundancy and other  inefficiencies in how the government does business. It could also provide  a framework for any restructuring efforts.", "In addition to the annual performance plan, a governmentwide strategic  plan could identify long-term goals and strategies to address issues that  cut across federal agencies. Such a plan for the federal government could  be supported by a set of key national outcome-based indicators of where  the nation stands on a range of economic, environmental, safety/security,  social, and cultural issues. A governmentwide strategic plan combined  with indicators could help in assessing the government\u2019s performance,  position, and progress, and could be a valuable tool for governmentwide  reexamination of existing programs, as well as proposals for new  programs. Further, it could provide a cohesive perspective on the long- term goals of the federal government and provide a much needed basis for  fully integrating, rather than merely coordinating, a wide array of federal  activities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improve the Relevance of Performance Information to Congress", "paragraphs": ["In order for performance improvement initiatives to hold appeal beyond  the executive branch, and to be useful to the Congress for its decision  making, garnering congressional buy-in on what to measure and how to  present this information is critical.

However, a mechanism to systematically  incorporate a congressional perspective and promote a dialogue between  Congress and the President in the PART review process is missing. As a  result of this lack of consultation, there have been several areas of  disagreement between OMB and Congress about this executive branch  tool, resulting in most congressional staff we spoke with not using the  PART information. Most congressional staff reported that they would  more likely use the PART results to inform their deliberations if OMB (1)  consulted them early in the PART process regarding the selection and  timing of programs to assess, (2) explained the methodology and evidence  used or to be used to assess programs, and (3) discussed how the PART  information can best be communicated and leveraged to meet their needs.", "OMB has recently taken some steps to more succinctly report agency  performance information. In 2007, OMB initiated a pilot program that  explores alternative approaches to performance and accountability  reporting, including a \u201chighlights report\u201d summarizing key performance  and financial information. However, more work could be done to better  understand congressional information needs and communication  preferences. We have reported previously that congressional staff  appreciate having a variety of options for accessing the information they  need to address key policy questions about program performance or to  learn about \u201chot\u201d issues. In a case study we conducted on FAA\u2019s  communication of performance, budgeting, and financial information with  Congress, congressional committee staff from the House Transportation  and Infrastructure Committee were interested in better using technology  to gain additional agency data in a timely manner. For example, staff  reported that agencies could create a For Congress page on their Web site  dedicated to serve as a single repository of data for congressional  requesters. In future initiatives, OMB could explore alternative  communication strategies and data sources to better meet congressional  needs and interest and ensure that the valuable data collected for  performance improvement initiatives is useful and used.", "Additionally, Congress could consider whether a more structured  oversight mechanism is needed to permit a coordinated congressional  perspective on governmentwide performance issues. Just as the executive  branch needs a vehicle to coordinate and address programs and  challenges that span multiple departments and agencies, Congress might  need to develop structures and processes that better afford a coordinated  approach to overseeing agencies and tools where jurisdiction crosses  congressional committees. We have previously suggested that one possible  approach could involve developing a congressional performance  resolution identifying the key oversight and performance goals that  Congress wishes to set for its own committees and for the government as  a whole. Such a resolution could be developed by modifying the annual  congressional budget resolution, which is already organized by budget  function. This may involve collecting the input of authorizing and  appropriations committees on priority performance issues for programs  under their jurisdiction and working with crosscutting committees such as  the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs,  the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the  House Committee on Rules. This year, Congress issued its budget  resolution for fiscal year 2009 containing a section directing Committees  of the House of Representatives and the Senate to review programs\u2019  performance within their jurisdiction for waste, fraud, and abuse and  report recommendations annually to the appropriate Committee on the  Budget."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Build Agency Confidence in Assessments for Use in Decision Making", "paragraphs": ["As the primary focal point for overall management in the federal  government, OMB plays a critical role in the planning and implementation  of the President\u2019s initiatives.

However, regardless of the  mechanism that the next administration employs to oversee agency and  program performance, OMB\u2019s efforts could be enhanced by building  agency confidence in the credibility and usefulness of its assessments for  management decision making.

Adopting the key practices we have  highlighted\u2014demonstrating leadership commitment to performance,  aligning individual performance with the goals of the organization, and  building the capacity to use information\u2014would be an important first step,  and OMB can play an important role in fostering these practices across  government. OMB could also adopt some of these practices in its own  engagement with agencies\u2014particularly, by helping to provide the training  and development that both OMB analysts and agency program managers  will need to make sure that any OMB-led performance review is useful and  used.", "Beyond this, Congress and the administration can help bring a more  strategic approach to how government performance is monitored and  measured. As we have noted repeatedly in our work, a governmentwide  strategic plan, underpinned by a set of key national indicators (KNI),  would, in defining outcomes shared by multiple agencies and programs,  help keep sight of how well agency programs are working collectively to  produce intended results. Whatever performance improvement initiatives  the next administration adopts, it will be vital to engage the Congress in  helping to identify the meaningful measures of success, as well as the form  in which performance information will be useful to Congress itself in  carrying out its oversight, legislative, and appropriations roles.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.

The  sample was drawn from the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM)  Central Personnel Data File (CPDF) as of March 2007, using file  designators indicating performance of managerial and supervisory  functions. In reporting the questionnaire data, when we use the term  \u201cgovernmentwide\u201d and the phrase \u201cacross the federal government,\u201d we are  referring to these 24 CFO Act executive branch agencies, and when we use  the terms \u201cfederal managers\u201d and \u201cmanagers,\u201d we are referring to both  managers and supervisors. The questionnaire was designed to obtain the  observations and perceptions of respondents on various aspects of such  results-oriented management topics as the presence and use of  performance measures, hindrances to measuring performance and using  performance information, and agency climate. In addition, the  questionnaire included a section requesting respondents\u2019 views on the  Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB) Program Assessment Rating  Tool (PART) and the priority that should be placed on various potential  improvements to it.", "With the exception of the section of the questionnaire asking about OMB\u2019s  PART, most of the items on the questionnaire were asked in three earlier  surveys. The earliest survey was conducted between November 1996 and  January 1997 as part of the work we did in response to a Government  Performance and Results Act (GPRA) requirement that we report on  implementation of the act. The second survey, conducted between January  and August 2000, and the third survey, conducted between June and  August 2003, were designed to update the results from each of the  previous surveys. The 2000 survey, unlike the other two surveys, was  designed to support analysis of the data at the department and agency  level as well as governmentwide.", "Similar to the three previous surveys, this survey covered the CFO Act  agencies and the sample was stratified by whether the manager or  supervisor was Senior Executive Service (SES) or non-SES. The  management levels covered general schedule (GS), general management  (GM), or equivalent schedules at levels comparable to GS/GM-13 through  career SES or equivalent levels of executive service. Similar to our 2000  and 2003 surveys, we incorporated special pay plans, for example, Senior  Foreign Service executives, into the population and the sample to ensure  at least a 90 percent coverage of all managers and supervisors at or  comparable to the GS/GM-13 through career SES level at the departments  and agencies we surveyed.", "One purpose of this survey was to update the information gathered at the  departmental and agency level for the survey done in 2000. Similar to the  design of the 2000 survey, stratification was also done by the 24 CFO Act  agencies with an additional breakout of five selected agencies from their  departments\u2014Forest Service, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services  (CMS), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Internal Revenue Service  (IRS), and Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). The first four  agencies were selected for breakout in our 2000 survey on the basis of our  previous work, at that time, identifying them as facing significant  managerial challenges. FEMA, which was an independent agency at the  time of our 2000 survey, became part of the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) when the department was created. The intent of this  survey was to cover the same set of entities examined in the 2000 survey  with the addition of DHS, which was created in 2003, in order to examine  possible change in managerial perceptions of performance measurement  and use over time at the department and agency level between 2000 and  2007. The PART section was included to obtain feedback from managers  that would help inform the transition and management agenda of the next  administration.", "Most of the items on the questionnaire were closed-ended, meaning that,  depending on the particular item, respondents could choose one or more  response categories or rate the strength of their perception on a 5-point  extent scale ranging from \u201cto no extent\u201d at the low end of the scale to \u201cto a  very great extent\u201d at the high end. For the PART questions about  improvement priorities, the 5-point scale went from \u201cno priority\u201d to \u201cvery  great priority.\u201d On most items, respondents also had an option of choosing  the response category \u201cno basis to judge/not applicable.\u201d", "We sent an e-mail to members of the sample that notified them of the  survey\u2019s availability on the GAO Web site and included instructions on  how to access and complete the survey. Members of the sample who did  not respond to the initial notice were sent up to four subsequent  reminders asking them to participate in the survey. The survey was  administered from October 2007 through January 2008.", "During the course of the survey, we deleted 199 persons from our sample  who had either retired, separated, died, or otherwise left the agency or had  some other reason that excluded them from the population of interest. We  received useable questionnaires from 2,943 sample respondents, or about  70 percent of the remaining eligible sample. The eligible sample includes  42 persons that we were unable to locate and therefore unable to request  that they participate in the survey. The response rate across the 29  agencies ranged from about 55 percent to 84 percent.", "The overall survey results are generalizable to the population of managers  as described above at the CFO Act agencies. The responses of each  eligible sample member who provided a useable questionnaire were  weighted in the analyses to account statistically for all members of the  population. All results are subject to some uncertainty or sampling error  as well as nonsampling error. As part of our effort to reduce nonsampling  sources of error in survey results, we checked and edited (1) the survey  data for responses that failed to follow instructions and (2) verified the  programs used in our analyses. In general, percentage estimates in this  report for the entire 2007 sample have confidence intervals ranging from  about +1 to +6 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence interval.  Percentage estimates in this report for individual agencies have  confidence intervals that range from +3 to +18 percentage points. An  online e-supplement GAO-08-1036SP shows the questions asked on the  survey with the weighted percentage of managers responding to each item.", "As part of our analyses of the 2007 survey data, we identified a set of nine  items from the questionnaire that inquired about uses of performance  information that we identified in a previous GAO report. Using those  items we developed an index that reflected the extent to which managers\u2019  perceived their own use of performance information for various  managerial functions and decisions as well as that of other managers in  the agency. To obtain this overall index score of reported use of  performance information, we computed an average score for each  respondent across the nine items we identified. By using this average  index score, which yields values in the same range as the 5-point extent  scale used on each item, we were able to qualitatively characterize index  score values using the same response categories used for the items  comprising the index. We refer to this index as the \u201ccore uses index\u201d in  that it indicates managers\u2019 perceptions about the extent to which  performance information is used across a core set of management  decision-making areas.", "Because a complex sample design was used in the current survey as well  as the three previous surveys, and different types of statistical analyses are  being done, the magnitude of sampling error will vary across the particular  surveys, groups, or items being compared due to differences in the  underlying sample sizes and associated variances. The number of  participants in the current survey is slightly larger than the 2000 survey  (2,510) and much larger than the 1996\u20131997 survey (905) and the 2003  survey (503), both of which were designed to obtain governmentwide  estimates only. Consequently, in some instances, a difference of a certain  magnitude may be statistically significant. In other instances, depending  on the nature of the comparison being made, a difference of equal or even  greater magnitude may not achieve statistical significance. We note  throughout the report when differences are significant at the .05  probability level. Also, as part of any interpretation of observed shifts in  individual agency response between the 2007 and the earlier 2000 survey,  it should be kept in mind that components of some agencies and all of the  Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) became part of the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS).", "We conducted our work from March 2007 to July 2008, in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. Those standards  require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained  provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our  audit objectives.", "This is a work of the U.S. government and is not subject to copyright protection in the  United States.
