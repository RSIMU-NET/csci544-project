The Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990, as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act (GMRA) of 1994, and the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA), are among recent laws that mandate reforms on how agencies manage programs and report on the results of operations. Beginning with fiscal year 1996, the Navy and other federal departments and agencies are required to produce and have audited financial statements. These agencies\u2019 ability to produce auditable financial statements will be crucial to meeting the mandate for audited governmentwide financial statements for fiscal year 1997. Furthermore, accurate financial data are needed for measuring performance under GPRA. One key factor in agencies being able to achieve these objectives will be having trained and experienced financial management staff in key positions. In the Navy, comptrollers serve in positions of critical importance for ensuring that the Department achieves its financial management objectives as well as meets requirements of the recent reform acts.", "We issued a report in October 1996 that cited several advantages of converting military financial management and other support positions to civilian status. These advantages include (1) dollar savings because civilians are less expensive than military members of equivalent rank and (2) the stability of personnel because military staff frequently rotate in and out of positions.", "We testified in November 1995 on long-standing, serious financial management deficiencies in the Navy. We stated that the Navy\u2019s financial reports were of little value in assessing its operations or the execution of its stewardship responsibilities. Our work identified substantial misstatements in almost all of the Navy\u2019s major accounts and $225 billion in errors in the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1994 financial reports. These problems are caused by a complex set of process and system issues, and to some extent by the Navy\u2019s personnel practices. This report focuses on personnel practices and the education and experience of Navy officers serving in comptroller positions and options for strengthening these practices.

The comptroller is the CFO\u2019s technical expert who oversees and manages the day-to-day operations. As such, the comptroller in any agency, including the military services, is a key financial manager.", "As of October 1, 1996, the Navy had 100 military officers filling key comptroller jobs. These jobs have responsibilities involving a significant range of Navy resources, and are designated to be staffed by officers who range in rank from captain to lieutenant. For example, the comptroller of the Pacific Fleet, billeted for a Navy captain, is responsible for financial management and financial reporting of an annual budget of about  $5 billion, comparable in size to a Fortune 500 corporation; whereas a comptroller at a small installation, billeted for a lieutenant, manages an annual budget of about $5 million. \u201cDirects formulation, justification and administration of fiscal and budgetary management policies, plans and procedures.

JFMIP stated that federal financial managers need to be well equipped to contribute to financial management activities such as: the preparation, analysis, and interpretation of consolidated financial statements; the formulation/execution of budgets under increasingly constrained resource caps; and the development and implementation of complex financial systems.", "In defining core competencies needed to effectively perform as a senior accountant and financial manager, which includes positions such as military service comptrollers, JFMIP emphasizes the need for a broad range of knowledge, skills, and abilities, including: accounting education with updated knowledge of accounting principles and federal accounting concepts; knowledge of agency financial statements, internal control environment, and agency business practices; strategic vision for implementation of GPRA and formulation of budgets; resource and program management skills, with knowledge of appropriation structure and agency management control systems; and human resource skills to effectively manage a workforce.", "These core competencies suggest that individuals filling key comptroller positions in the federal government need to come to their jobs with a broad range of knowledge, skills, and abilities, including a strong foundation of experience and education in accounting. Accordingly, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) has required that individuals in civilian accounting positions in the federal government, which are in the GS-510 series, meet a minimum qualification standard of 24 semester hours of college-level accounting courses plus an appropriate number of years of experience for the specific position. We recognize that there are always individuals who may lack the educational background desired but who have developed the technical competencies needed through actual experience.

Recent changes in law and policy have made this a more demanding task and require staffs to acquire new knowledge and skills.\u201d", "We agree with the ASN/FM&C that financial management staff need to acquire new knowledge and skills. One of the more critical positions in a strong financial management function is the comptroller. However, we found that the Navy\u2019s present staffing practices for military officers fail to provide a career path for the critically important comptroller function. Under present practices, Navy officers filling fiscal administration jobs, including comptrollers, devote most of their careers to either operational command positions or logistics functions. About half of the key comptroller positions are staffed by line officers and half by officers in the supply corps. Line officers are generally individuals who are eligible to command at sea, and whose primary occupational specialty is surface warfare, aviation, or submarines. Line officers may also include individuals not eligible to command who serve in various operational staff positions. The supply corps officers are considered by the Navy to be the Navy\u2019s business managers and they serve in a wide variety of logistics and financial management positions.", "By contrast, the Air Force and the Army offer a career path in comptrollership. Under the Air Force\u2019s career program in financial management and comptrollership, many Air Force officers devote their entire careers to financial management. The Army has designed its own unique approach to developing a cadre of financial management officers. All Army officers are required to spend at least the first 5 years of their careers in positions in either comptrollership or one of the operational branches of the Army, such as infantry, artillery, or armor. Army officers can elect to serve in comptrollership positions under one of two programs. In the single track program, an officer can stay exclusively in financial management as a specialty. In the dual track program, an officer can rotate between financial management jobs and command positions in the operational branch.", "To illustrate, we judgmentally selected and reviewed the career experiences of a Navy captain, an Air Force colonel, and an Army colonel, each currently serving as the comptroller of a major command. Each of these comptrollers carries significant responsibility for the financial management and financial reporting of activities with annual budgets ranging from around $1 to $5 billion. The profiles show that the Air Force and Army comptrollers have significant career experiences that are important in developing core competencies needed by a military comptroller.

The NPS degree program in financial management includes approximately 11 semester hours of accounting and has the objective of preparing Navy officers for assignments to positions in budgeting, accounting, business and financial management, and internal control and auditing. However, after graduating with their masters degrees in business, many line officers do not rotate directly to a financial management position where they could immediately apply their education. Navy data on officers serving in comptroller positions show that line officers selected for financial management positions spend only a small percentage of their career in finance. Navy data on a broader universe of all officers who obtain a masters degree in financial management at NPS show that 49 percent of line officers do not use their training for at least 6 years after graduation and 40 percent never use their education in a Navy financial management job.

For example, one captain now serving as the comptroller of a major Navy command has 25 years in the Navy, and he has spent 10 of the past 13 years in comptroller positions. However, we believe most of the supply corps officers in comptroller positions would fall short of meeting JFMIP\u2019s core competencies because their career paths have not been concentrated in fiscal administration. As stated earlier in this report, recent reform initiatives aimed at addressing long-standing and severe federal financial management problems, including the CFO Act and GPRA, have placed demands on comptrollers in the 1990s that are substantially greater than in the past.

Examples of career fields that contain positions that might be converted are information and financial management, which would include comptroller positions.", "DOD guidance on civilian versus military staffing of positions was written in 1954. It requires that civilians be used to staff positions wherever possible.

Increased demands and challenges faced by government financial managers resulting from financial management reform legislation of the 1990s warrants a closer look at staffing these key positions.", "To identify candidates for conversion in our October 1996 report, we developed criteria based on the above DOD directive and service implementing guidance. The criteria consisted of four questions that reflect the substance of the DOD criteria. Answering \u201cno\u201d to all four questions would be one approach to identifying positions that could be converted to civilian status. The questions were as follows. (1) Is the primary skill or knowledge required in the position uniquely available in the military? (2) Does the position have a mission to deploy to a theater of operations in wartime or during a contingency? (3) Does any law require that the position be staffed by a military person? (4) Is the position needed to support the normal rotation of service members deployed overseas or afloat to assignments in the continental United States?", "DOD\u2019s response to our October 1996 report acknowledged the potential savings and other advantages of military-to-civilian conversions. DOD also noted impediments to placing civilians in certain positions, such as the lack of consistent funding for the hiring of civilian replacements, the ongoing civilian personnel draw-down, and military strength floors. DOD, in its response to the report\u2019s recommendation, said the issue of military-to-civilian conversion is an important component of DOD manpower requirements determination and the issue is currently being discussed in planning for the Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR).", "We recognize the difficulties DOD and the Navy face while operating in fiscally constrained times.

As the Air Force and the Army have recognized, financial management and comptrollership is a professional career track that requires highly trained and skilled individuals. In the military combat operations environment one would not expect an officer with only 3 to 4 years experience to command a ship, squadron, or fleet. Similarly, one would not expect a comptrollership, responsible for billions of dollars, to be staffed temporarily by a less than fully experienced financial manager. This would be true whether the comptroller was a military officer or a civilian. However, that in effect is the unintended consequence of the Navy\u2019s present personnel practices with respect to assigning its military officers to comptroller positions.

This recommendation is aimed at ensuring that Navy military officers develop the technical competencies needed to be effective comptrollers through training and experience. The Navy does not believe a formal career program in comptrollership is feasible because of the small number of officers in this field combined with a need for extensive experience in fleet operations. While fleet experience may help to develop a better understanding of operational issues, a comptrollership function demands a high level of financial management expertise for an individual to be effective in today\u2019s complex environment. Further, the relative number of military comptrollers is not the issue, rather the issue is that these officers should have the technical competencies necessary to perform in these key Navy comptroller positions.", "Although DOD did not concur with our recommendation, the Department acknowledged that some naval officers may have been assigned as comptrollers without a strong background in some aspects of financial management. To address this problem, DOD plans to take steps to increase the number of tours or months of experience required to become a financial management subspecialist and upgrade all comptroller billets to proven subspecialist billets. These steps should increase the amount of experience that Navy officers bring to the comptroller positions. However, the Navy needs to ensure that its comptroller positions are filled with individuals who bring a strong background of financial management experience to those positions. We are concerned that simply increasing the number of months necessary to qualify as a subspecialist or adding a tour of duty, though a positive step, will not fully achieve the desired goal. We continue to believe that a career path, similar to the Air Force or Army, is the best approach.", "We are also pleased that the Navy plans to enhance its training for military officers who will serve in comptroller positions. A critical aspect of such training is that officers completing the course should be assigned to a comptroller position within a relatively short period of time so that the benefits of the training are not lost before being put into application for the benefit of the Navy.
