The model called for the management and funding responsibility for production, operation, and sustainment of a capability to be transferred to a military service when a BMDS element or major component is technically mature and plans for production are well developed. The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) was given responsibility for developing the BMDS and recommending the transfer of management and funding responsibilities to the services. In 2004, MDA emplaced an initial missile defense capability, but DOD did not transfer management and funding responsibility for that capability. Because a formal transfer did not occur, GAO was asked to (1) identify DOD's criteria for deciding when a missile defense capability should be transferred to a service and (2) determine how DOD is managing the costs of fielding a BMDS capability."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["There is currently uncertainty as to which assets may eventually be transferred to each military service and under what conditions those transfers should occur. This uncertainty makes it difficult for the services to plan to address the requirements of DOD acquisition regulations and realign their budgets to support the missile defense mission. According to MDA and other DOD officials, when transfer criteria were established in 2002, the Department did not fully understand the complexity of the BMDS and how it could affect transfer decisions. For example, it has been difficult to determine whether MDA or a military service will be responsible for managing and funding some assets, such as stand-alone missile defense radars, because these assets are not integrated on service platforms or do not perform core service missions. MDA officials suggested that these components could be operated by either contractors or military personnel and MDA might fund their operation and sustainment. A team that includes representatives from the military services, the combatant commands, MDA, and other DOD offices was established early this year to address transfer issues. However, because MDA and the services have been unable to reach agreement on the transfer of some missile defense assets, a unit under the Joint Chiefs of Staff was tasked in July 2005 with recommending revisions to the existing transfer criteria. MDA budgeted $1.5 billion of its fiscal year 2005 research and development funds to acquire interceptors and radars and upgrade various BMDS components. It expects to continue to acquire and upgrade BMDS assets through 2011 and beyond. However, MDA and the services disagree as to who should pay for operating and sustaining the initial defensive capability after fiscal year 2005. Additionally, although DOD has budgeted $68.5 billion to develop, procure, operate, and sustain a missile defense capability between 2005 and 2011, it has not completely determined whether additional operation and sustainment funds will be needed, and it has not included all known operation and sustainment costs in its budget. Until DOD decides who will fund these costs, the services will likely continue to provide only the funding that they have been directed to provide. As a result, some needs--for which neither MDA nor the services have planned--will go unfunded. Additionally, if the funds budgeted for some purposes, such as logistical support for the BMDS, turn out to be insufficient, DOD will either have to take funds from other programs or spend less on missile defense."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the Secretary of Defense directed the Department of Defense  (DOD) to adopt a new acquisition model for acquiring a missile defense  capability.

The findings of these reviews led  the Secretary of Defense to declare the need for a new strategy to acquire  and deploy missile defenses and to issue direction in January 2002 to  improve the leadership, management, and organization of missile defense  activities.", "Specifically, the Secretary delegated to MDA the authority to manage all  ballistic missile defense systems under development and shifted programs  being executed or developed by the military services to MDA. Figure 1  below describes some of the missile defense programs whose execution or  development was transferred from the military services into MDA.", "The Secretary also instructed MDA to develop a single integrated system,  to be called the Ballistic Missile Defense System, capable of intercepting  enemy missiles launched from all ranges and in all phases of their flight.  The systems transferred from or executed by the services and new  systems whose development MDA initiates are considered to be elements  of the BMDS and are managed by MDA. In 2002, drawing on research and  development efforts that were ongoing for years, MDA established the  Command, Control, Battle Management, and Communications system as  an element to provide connectivity between other BMDS elements and to  manage their operation as an integrated, layered missile defense system.", "In his direction to MDA and the military services, the Secretary called for a  capabilities-based requirements process and an evolutionary development  program. In a capabilities-based program, the system developer\u2014MDA\u2014 designs a system based on the technology available, rather than designing  a system to meet requirements established by those that will use the  system. Additionally, in an evolutionary program, a baseline capability is  developed that is improved over time. Therefore, the BMDS has no fixed  design or final architecture. Each evolution, or block, as MDA calls such  increments, is meant to take advantage of advancing technology so that  over time the BMDS is enhanced. MDA\u2019s capabilities-based evolutionary  approach to development is meant to provide a capability to the users as  quickly as possible while also maintaining flexibility. MDA is in the  process of developing the first BMDS block, which is known as Block  2004. This block consists of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense, Aegis  Ballistic Missile Defense, Patriot Advanced Capability\u20133, and Command,  Control, Battle Management, and Communications elements, as well as the  Forward-Based X-Band Radar.", "The Secretary also established a procedure for making developmental  assets available for operational use. On the basis of assessments of the  BMDS\u2019s military utility, progress in development, and a recommendation  by the Director, MDA, and the military services, the Secretary, with input  from the DOD Senior Executive Council, decides whether assets whose  development is ongoing should be fielded. When such a decision is made,  the Secretary directed that the military departments provide forces to  support the early fielding and budget resources to procure and operate the  planned force structure. In December 2002, the President directed DOD to  begin fielding an initial set of missile defense capabilities to meet the near- term ballistic missile threat to our nation. MDA responded by emplacing  Block 2004 developmental assets for use against limited attacks. However,  the Secretary has not yet activated this capability by placing it on alert.", "The Secretary\u2019s 2002 direction intended that acquisition of missile defense  elements and components be completed in three phases. In the first phase,  MDA develops ballistic missile defense elements and components using  research, development, test, and evaluation funds. When appropriate, the  MDA Director recommends and the Senior Executive Council approves  the entry of an element or major component into the second phase, known  as the transition phase. This phase allows the military services to prepare  for the element\u2019s or component\u2019s transfer. During the third phase, a  military service\u2014using procurement, operation and maintenance, and  personnel funds\u2014procures, operates, and sustains the element or  component.

For example, the requirements for acquisition program  baselines and independent cost estimates, generally applicable by statute  to major defense acquisition programs and implemented by the DOD  regulations, will not be applied until a BMDS element or component is  transferred to a military service concurrent with Milestone C. Milestone C,  the point at which a decision is made to begin initial production, is the  point at which the service is to assume management and funding  responsibility for an element or component of the BMDS.", "Once elements or components are transferred, the Secretary directed MDA  to continue to fund modifications to fielded systems and to manage  development activities for new missile defense capabilities. The Secretary  also gave MDA approval authority over any engineering changes that the  military services might want to make to transferred BMDS elements. This  process, known as configuration control, is meant to ensure that changes  do not degrade the interoperability of the BMDS.", "MDA has recommended and DOD approved the transfer of one missile  defense element to a military service since 2002.

According  to officials in MDA\u2019s Business Management Office, continued management  of some system elements and components by MDA may be necessary to  fully develop the overall effectiveness of the BMDS. For example, if the  missile-tracking capability of the Space Tracking and Surveillance System  is going to be added to the BMDS, MDA will need to test it with other  BMDS elements to determine how to make all elements work together  most effectively. To do this, MDA believes it must have the authority to  pull back elements or components that are fielded so that the elements  and components can be utilized in developmental efforts.", "The MDA officials also indicated that full transfer of elements and  components could threaten the priority that the President and DOD have  given to missile defense. The officials told us that the military services  could subordinate missile defense missions to service missions, funding  service programs at the expense of the missile defense program. Service  acquisition officials and officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense  agreed that the military services have many competing priorities and that  should missile defense programs be transferred to a service, those  programs would likely have to compete with service programs for  procurement, operations, and sustainment funds.", "Officials in MDA\u2019s transition office offered examples of how management  and funding responsibility of elements and components currently in  development might be handled.", "Management responsibility for some elements and components might  never be transferred to a military service because these assets are not  integrated on service platforms or do not perform core service missions.   Examples include the Cobra Dane radar, the Forward-Based X-Band  radars, and the Sea-Based X-Band radar.  MDA officials suggested that  these components could be operated by either contractors or military  personnel, and MDA might fund their operation and sustainment.", "However, discussions are still ongoing as to whether these components  will eventually be transferred to the military services.", "MDA and a military service might be collaboratively involved in the  management of other assets, such as the Airborne Laser, the Kinetic  Energy Interceptor, the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, and  Terminal High Altitude Area Defense because these elements are not yet  technically mature and MDA needs to manage their development. The  services will remain closely involved to provide feedback on the  development process. As the capability of these elements is ready to be  demonstrated, MDA will acquire them in limited quantities. For example,  MDA plans to acquire two Terminal High Altitude Area Defense fire units,  which include 48 missiles. If early tests are successful, MDA will turn the  first fire unit over to the Army in 2009.  The Army will operate it and  provide feedback on its performance. Once any of these assets are  available for operational use, MDA believes that the services should accept  some responsibility for funding their operation and sustainment costs.", "Officials in MDA\u2019s transition office told us that management responsibility  for assets in this group may eventually be handed over to a military  service. The officials said that the transition status of an element is a  function of technical maturity, programmatic achievement, time, and  relative stakeholder involvement.", "Management and funding responsibility for other systems already have or  likely will be transitioned to a military service because they have reached  or are nearing technical maturity. As mentioned above, MDA transferred  responsibility for the Patriot Advanced Capability-3 to the Army in 2003,  and it is likely that in the future MDA will transfer responsibility for Aegis  Ballistic Missile Defense to the Navy. Officials in MDA\u2019s transition office  told us that Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense is reaching technical maturity,  as demonstrated by its being fielded operationally on Navy ships.

Several things have to be  done for a service to operate and maintain a system. For example,  personnel have to be assigned and trained, a command structure has to be  organized, and facilities may have to be provided for the system and its  operators. Also, because transferred elements of the BMDS will enter  DOD\u2019s acquisition cycle at Milestone C, other activities have to be  completed in advance of the milestone to ensure compliance with DOD  acquisition regulations. For example, the documentation required by the  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Capabilities Integration and  Development System must be completed and an independent cost  estimate must be obtained. Service officials estimated that it takes at least  a year and a half to complete all of the tasks needed to meet Milestone C  requirements of the DOD acquisition regulations.", "Sufficient advance notice is also needed for budgeting purposes. One DOD  official said that until responsibilities are established and transition plans  are in place, it is difficult for the services to plan their budgets. If transfers  take place with little advance notice, DOD will either have to provide the  services with additional funds for the production, operation, and  sustainment of BMDS elements or direct the services to support the BMDS  assets with funds reserved for service missions.

The official said funds were also included in  the budgets for the following fiscal years (2007-2011) to sustain the  devices. However, the official told us that a new cost estimate shows that  it is likely to cost more to procure and install the devices than first  estimated. Without the detection devices, Air Force officials estimate that  additional security personnel will be needed, but funds for these personnel  are not included in the Air Force\u2019s budget. Because the Air Force has not  added all security forces needed, the security at Vandenberg is not at the  level directed by U.S. Strategic Command. Additionally, because the Air  Force had no funds set aside in fiscal year 2005 for missile defense active  duty security personnel, the Air Force is mostly relying upon Air Reserve  volunteers to provide some additional security for missile defense assets  located at Vandenberg and Schriever Air Force Bases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDA Pays Most Installation Services and Support Costs in 2005", "paragraphs": ["MDA is paying for other installation services and support costs that the  DOD memorandum did not direct the military services to fund.

This uncertainty makes it difficult for the services to  plan the activities that are necessary to apply the requirements of DOD  acquisition system regulations and to consider how to best realign their  budgets to support the missile defense mission. DOD needs to establish  clear and complete transfer criteria to better guide those making the  difficult decisions for allocating management and funding responsibilities  for missile defense assets.", "DOD also needs to clarify whether MDA or the services will be responsible  for sustaining missile defense capabilities that have not been transferred  to the services. The Secretary\u2019s direction did not clearly spell out whether  MDA or the military departments would be responsible for sustaining the  early capability, and it is this cost that has become most contentious. If  sustainment costs are much higher than expected and the number of  assets being made available to the warfighter grows, as MDA expects, the  use of research and development dollars to procure and sustain a missile  defense capability will begin to affect MDA\u2019s primary mission of  developing new capabilities and enhancing existing ones. On the other  hand, the military services will not want to fund the operation and  sustainment of a missile defense capability if its cost cannot be accurately  estimated. Nor will they want to fund the capability if they are not given  the time to determine how to do so with the least impact on service  missions. While the team established by MDA to develop transition plans  includes working-level representatives from MDA, the military services,  and the combatant commands, it will be difficult to reach full agreement  as to who should pay sustainment costs for these assets because the  representatives do not have the authority to make binding financial  decisions for their organizations. MDA and the services may continue to  disagree as to which component will bear sustainment costs for the early  capability until DOD directs one or the other to do so. Because the  services and MDA will begin to plan their 2008-2013 budgets in 2006, a  decision as to who will fund these costs should be made in time for the  budget deliberations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition,  Technology and Logistics revise the criteria for deciding when  management and funding responsibility for missile defense assets should  be transferred from MDA to a military service so that those criteria are  clear and complete.", "We also recommend that the Secretary of Defense ensure that a decision is  made as to which DOD organization will fund the operation and  sustainment of missile defense assets that are part of the initial defensive  capability but have not been transferred from MDA to a military service  and direct that organization, or those organizations, to budget for those  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report (see app. III), DOD agreed  that the criteria for making decisions to transfer missile defense assets  from MDA to the services must be clear.

DOD recognized that Eareckson is an unusual base  because the Air Force does not maintain a presence there.
