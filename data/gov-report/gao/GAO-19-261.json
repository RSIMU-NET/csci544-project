CCDF administrators in most of the 15 states GAO interviewed said they have elected to apply certain requirements for caregivers subsidized under CCDF to all state licensed child care providers. For example, child care providers may be subject to monitoring and professional development requirements, whether or not they care for children receiving subsidies.

In fiscal year 2016, the most recent year for which data are  publicly available, CCDF provided child care assistance to about 1.4  million children each month. Discretionary funding for CCDF is  authorized by the Child Care and Development Block Grant (CCDBG) Act  of 1990, as amended, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS) administers the funds to states. In addition to authorizing  funding, the CCDBG Act of 2014 included various requirements for  states, among them ones designed to improve child care for all children  receiving child care, including children who do not receive child care  subsidies (nonsubsidized children). For example, the law requires states  to conduct comprehensive background checks for all licensed and  regulated child care providers, which includes providers who may  exclusively serve nonsubsidized children. In addition, the law requires  states to certify that they have certain policies, including making the  results of monitoring and inspection reports available electronically in a  consumer-friendly format. In March 2018, the Consolidated  Appropriations Act, 2018 was enacted, which provided $5.2 billion in  discretionary CCDF funding for fiscal year 2018, nearly twice the amount  provided in fiscal year 2017.", "You asked us to review states\u2019 use of CCDF funds and their potential  impact on nonsubsidized children.

First, we surveyed CCDF administrators in  the 50 states and the District of Columbia (D.C.) using a Word-enabled  questionnaire in May and June 2018 and received a 100 percent  response rate. We asked state CCDF administrators about certain child  care activities, including the proportion of all funds used by the state in  fiscal year 2017 to support each activity that came from CCDF and  whether the activity affects nonsubsidized children receiving child care.  We selected 10 activities that states may use to improve the quality of  their child care services. We also asked about additional child care  activities in their states that affect nonsubsidized children. In addition, we  asked states about their plans to use the new CCDF funds appropriated  under the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018, for those and other  state child care activities, including ones related to other CCDBG Act  requirements. We took several steps to minimize measurement error and  data collection and processing errors. Specifically, we pre-tested draft  versions of the questionnaire with CCDF administrators in three states to  check the clarity of the questions and layout of the questionnaire, and  made revisions, as appropriate. Second, we conducted semi-structured  interviews with CCDF administrators in 15 states, including D.C., in May  and June 2018 to collect in-depth information about the ways in which  state child care activities may affect nonsubsidized children and states\u2019  plans to use the new funding. We selected states that reflected variation  in the level of CCDF funding set aside for quality activities, according to  the most recently available data from HHS, and geography (see appendix  I for a list of these states). Through our interviews and follow-up, we also  obtained information from states on the potential impacts of not having  received the new funds and challenges associated with the new funding.  While information obtained during these interviews is not generalizable  and may be preliminary and subject to change, it provides point-in-time  insight into state plans for these funds from a variety of states.

The 10 child care activities included in our survey, components of which  are also required by CCDF, are key means through which states may  choose to improve the quality of their child care services (i.e., quality  activities). They also represent diverse aspects of a state\u2019s child care  system.", "Among states that relied on CCDF funding to support the quality  activities, we found that, on average, states funded 6 of the 10 activities  entirely or mostly with CCDF. Nearly one-third of states (16) funded at  least 8 of the 10 to that degree.", "States reported that they relied on CCDF funding most frequently for the  following activities: child care resource and referral systems, consumer  education, and health and safety standards establishment and training.", "Child care resource and referral systems. More than three-quarters of  states (40) reported in our survey that all (22) or most (18) of the funding  they used for their child care resource and referral systems in fiscal year  2017 came from CCDF. Statewide systems of child care resource and  referral agencies can serve an important role in supporting state quality  improvement efforts, though not all states have them, according to HHS.  For example, child care resource and referral agencies may provide  training and technical assistance to child care providers and share  consumer education with families, among other things. States may use  CCDF funds to establish or support a system of local or regional agencies  that is coordinated by a lead child care resource and referral  organization. Officials in the states we interviewed described various  ways in which their child care resource and referral agencies support  child care providers and parents, such as:", "Delivering professional development, including training and technical  assistance, to child care providers, regardless of whether or not the  providers accept subsidized children, according to several CCDF  administrators interviewed.", "Supporting parents by determining eligibility for subsidies, providing  referrals for care, and offering information on child care quality,  according to state officials. For example, one state houses eligibility  specialists in regional child care resource and referral agencies,  through which families apply for subsidies, while another state uses  these agencies to refer families to child care providers and support  families with specialists, including mental health consultants and  infant specialists, as needed.", "Consumer education. About 70 percent of states (36) reported that all  (12) or most (24) of the funding they used for consumer education  activities in fiscal year 2017 came from CCDF. Consumer education  activities are intended to help parents seeking child care make informed  decisions and improve access to information that supports child  development. States must certify that they have policies to make public  the results of child care providers\u2019 monitoring and inspection reports, as  well as certify that they will collect and disseminate information on child  care services available through CCDF, research and best practices  concerning child development, and state policies regarding the social- emotional and behavioral health of children, among other requirements.  Moreover, many of the 15 states we interviewed used child care resource  and referral agencies to do this. Examples from our state interviews  illustrate that:", "One state promotes awareness of its quality rating and improvement  system for child care providers through materials available from the  state\u2019s child care resource and referral agencies, according to its  CCDF administrator.", "Another state\u2019s child care resource and referral system has a public  awareness campaign aimed at the parents of infants, toddlers, and  preschoolers to help families understand and identify quality child  care, according to the head of the state\u2019s child care resource and  referral network.", "Parents in a third state can obtain information on child development  through resources available from lending libraries, according to the  state\u2019s CCDF administrator.", "Health and safety standards. About 70 percent of states (36) also  reported entirely funding (15) or mostly funding (21) the development or  deployment of training for health and safety standards with CCDF in fiscal  year 2017. According to the CCDBG Act, states are required to certify  that they have health and safety standards in specific topic areas, such as  the use of safe sleeping practices and pediatric first-aid, and certify that  all CCDF providers will receive minimum health and safety training in  these areas. Most of the 15 states that we interviewed went beyond  CCDBG Act requirements and elected to apply their health and safety  training requirements to all licensed child care providers in the state, and  in some cases, to child care providers that are exempt from licensing. In  doing so, officials described how their requirements served to elevate the  health and safety of children in care regardless of whether they receive  CCCF subsidies. Several state officials specifically credited the CCDBG  Act as the impetus for their states\u2019 changes. State officials we interviewed  also described taking various approaches, including offering financial  incentives, to facilitate child care providers in meeting training  requirements. Examples of these approaches and their impact include the  following:", "One state official said that while the state child care agency had  wanted to increase health and safety requirements for child care  providers for years, the reauthorization of the CCDBG Act propelled  the state forward in its efforts to increase child care quality and require  the same health and safety training of all licensed and license-exempt  providers.", "One state offers health and safety grants to child care providers to  meet these requirements, while another is considering increasing  child care provider payment rates to a level that will allow them to  meet the updated health and safety requirements, according to state  officials.", "CCDF administrators in two states told us they are developing online  training modules for the required health and safety training so child  care providers can access the modules more easily and for free or  have mailed training DVDs to every child care program in the state.", "CCDF administrators in almost all of the 15 states we interviewed told us  their states set aside more than the minimum amount that CCDF required  to support quality in 2017. They described how their states use quality  set-aside funds to support child care licensing programs, accreditation,  and quality rating systems for child care providers, among other things.  Some state officials we interviewed also described specific supports for  infants and toddlers, such as partnerships to provide training for child  care providers around the care of this age group, and increases in  provider payment rates for infant and toddler care, which is costly to  provide, from the infant and toddler-specific set-aside. According to one  state CCDF administrator, the ability to divert funds to activities that  benefit infants and toddlers is critical as this is the neediest age\u2014a time  when children and parents need the most support."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Report That Consumer Education, Licensing, and Professional Development, Among Other Quality Activities, Also Affect Children Not Receiving Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["A range of CCDF quality activities, including consumer education, child  care licensing, and professional development of the child care workforce  affect the care of children not receiving subsidies (nonsubsidized  children), according to our 51-state survey of CCDF administrators (see  fig. 2). On average, states reported that 9 of the 10 activities included in  our survey affect nonsubsidized children receiving child care in the state,  with more than 40 percent of states (22) reporting that all of the activities  affect nonsubsidized children, according to our analysis of the survey  data. As previously noted, the activities serve as key supports for building  quality in state child care systems.", "Of these activities, CCDF administrators unanimously cited three in our  survey as affecting nonsubsidized children: consumer education;  licensing, monitoring or background checks for child care; and  professional development. Below are some specific examples of the way  nonsubsidized children are affected by these activities, as discussed with  CCDF administrators in our 15 state interviews.", "Consumer education. During our interviews, state officials discussed  ways in which their CCDF programs share important information on child  care quality and child development with all families, including those not  receiving subsidies. As previously noted, many of the 15 states we  interviewed rely on their child care resource and referral agencies to  provide such information to the public. HHS requires states to have a  website that includes, among other things, a searchable list of licensed  child care providers and information about the provider\u2019s quality rating, if  available. States we interviewed use these and other consumer  education tools, such as billboards, public service announcements, and  commercials in an effort to reach a wide-ranging audience.", "Licensing, monitoring, or background checks. According to the  CCDBG Act, states must certify they have policies to annually conduct  unannounced inspections of all licensed CCDF providers for compliance  with all child care licensing standards, including health, safety, and fire  standards, with at least one pre-licensure inspection. But most of the 15  states we interviewed have elected to apply certain CCDBG Act  requirements for CCDF providers, including those pertaining to monitoring  and inspections, to all licensed providers in the state, according to their  states\u2019 CCDF administrators. Officials in several states suggested that  updating their requirements for all licensed providers with the CCDF  requirements establishes a high-quality foundation for child care that  reflects the importance of a healthy and safe environment for all children  receiving care, regardless of whether children receive a subsidy.  Examples from some states that we interviewed are:  In one state, where subsidized children make up about 20 percent of  children in licensed care, the state\u2019s CCDF administrator estimated  that significant numbers of nonsubsidized children benefit from higher  quality care, including from more extensive monitoring of all licensed  providers.", "Another state applied the requirements for CCDF providers to all  license-exempt child care providers (including those not serving  subsidized children), which helps ensure that all children in care  benefit from the updated monitoring, health and safety, and  background check requirements.", "An official from another state that does not apply CCDBG Act  requirements more broadly said that, because nonsubsidized children  share classrooms with subsidized children, requirements that apply to  subsidized providers, in turn, also still benefit the nonsubsidized  children in their classrooms. In particular, he said that the requirement  that all CCDF providers that serve subsidized children be inspected  has opened up child care centers that previously, as license-exempt  providers, were not inspected, and has resulted in improvements in  some centers.", "Professional development. CCDF administrators we interviewed  recognize professional development as key to high-quality child care for  all children, including nonsubsidized children. The CCDBG Act requires  states to describe the training and professional development  requirements designed to enable CCDF providers to promote the social,  emotional, physical, and cognitive development of children. According to  HHS, states must also require ongoing training for CCDF providers that is  accessible, appropriate to the age and setting of the children served, and  aligned to a progression of professional development that includes a  minimum number of annual hours of training for the child care workforce.  As with certain other CCDBG Act requirements, a majority of states we  interviewed have established the same professional development  requirements for all licensed child care providers, whether or not they  care for subsidized children, according to state officials. One CCDF  administrator said that the updated CCDF requirements for subsidized  providers were an impetus for her state to raise the training requirements  for providers that do not care for children receiving subsidies and that are  unlicensed. She said the updated, more comprehensive training requirements help ensure that all children are in care with child care  providers that parents can trust.", "CCDF administrators also highlighted characteristics of their states\u2019  professional development activities that serve to positively impact  nonsubsidized children as well\u2014namely, availability, accessibility, and  affordability of professional development opportunities to child care  providers. For example, state officials told us of making these  opportunities available to all child care providers through online training  courses, training and onsite consultation from child care resource and  referral agencies, technical assistance and coaching, and resource  lending libraries. Nearly all states we interviewed use their states\u2019 quality  set-aside funds to support such training, technical assistance, and/or  coaching opportunities. Where training may not be free, CCDF  administrators told us of financial incentives that assist child care  providers in their efforts to increase quality through professional  development. For example, several states use their quality set-aside  funds to offer scholarship grant programs available to child care providers  to help increase their qualifications, whether or not they care for  subsidized children. One state offers incentive payments based on a  provider\u2019s level of attainment in the state\u2019s career ladder, for which all  providers are eligible to apply, according to its CCDF administrator, and  can result in provider development that benefits the nonsubsidized  children in their care.", "In addition to spending on quality activities, states reported through our  interviews that nonsubsidized children also indirectly benefit from state  spending on subsidies. According to officials in many of the 15 states that  we interviewed, states\u2019 spending on subsidies helps increase the  economic stability of CCDF providers, which, in turn, also benefits  nonsubsidized children in their care. Officials said that subsidizing  providers to help pay for the cost of care for eligible families can provide a  consistent source of revenue for CCDF providers that allows them to  continue stable operations, invest in professional development, and  increase teacher pay, for example. Such spending, in turn, can lead to  improved child care quality as well as access (i.e., by helping providers  stay in business) to nonsubsidized children, too, who are in their care,  according to state officials.", "However, officials in many states we interviewed also noted that CCDF  subsidies or related policies may negatively impact nonsubsidized  children and families. For example, several said that state increases in  payment rates for CCDF providers may lead providers to similarly  increase the rates they charge for the nonsubsidized children in their  care, which, some noted, could drive families for whom such care is no  longer affordable to alternative, unregulated providers that may have  lower quality standards. Rate increases can be particularly difficult for  middle-income families who do not qualify for CCDF and are struggling to  meet the current market rate of child care, according to one state\u2019s CCDF  administrator. CCDF administrators from several other states also noted a  drop in CCDF child care providers in recent years due to various factors,  including low payment rates, extensive CCDF requirements for  inspections and background checks, and an insufficient number of  children to sustain operating costs, for example. In much of one state\u2019s  neediest areas, local elementary schools often provide the highest quality  care, according to the state\u2019s CCDF administrator; however, with the  addition of background checks that some school districts have found  administratively burdensome and duplicative, the official said that many  districts have dropped out of the CCDF program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Most Often Report Plans to Spend the New CCDF Funds on Quality Activities That Affect All Children in Care, Despite Funding Uncertainty", "paragraphs": ["Among quality activities, states most often reported plans to spend the  new discretionary CCDF funding from the Consolidated Appropriations  Act, 2018 on three\u2014licensing, consumer education, and professional  development\u2014the same activities that all states reported affect  nonsubsidized children, according to our survey of CCDF administrators  in the 50 states and D.C. (see fig. 3).", "Licensing, monitoring, or background checks. More than two thirds of  states we surveyed (34) plan to spend the new CCDF funds on child care  licensing or related activities of monitoring and background checks.  During our interviews, many state CCDF administrators provided  examples of how they plan to use new funds on licensing-related  activities, such as hiring or increasing pay of licensing staff or making  administrative or system improvements to facilitate the interstate  background checks required under the CCDBG Act. For example, one  state plans to enhance its online background check portal to streamline  interstate coordination while another state plans to help providers pay for  the interstate background check fees by offsetting the increased cost for  the next 1 or 2 years. A third state, which has been operating under an  HHS waiver that allowed for delayed implementation of the interstate  background check requirements, now plans to use new funds to conduct  the required checks, according to the state\u2019s CCDF administrator. Without  the new funds, officials from two states said that they may have had to  reduce funding to other child care activities, including subsidies, in order  to allocate the additional resources needed to comply with licensing,  monitoring, or background check requirements.", "Consumer education. More than half of states we surveyed (30) said  they plan to spend new funds on consumer education activities. Some  state officials we interviewed described plans to enhance public state  child care websites to make them more user-friendly or available in other  languages, such as Spanish. For example, one state plans to improve  online access to provider information by featuring a dashboard with a  snapshot of each provider\u2019s license history, including inspection  violations. Officials from another state said they plan to use new funds to  launch a public engagement campaign to provide timely and important  information about child care and state-based child care services. In the  absence of the new funding, officials from two states said they would  likely need to reduce their efforts to better educate families statewide  about important child development information and the states\u2019 publicly- available tools that can help parents identify high-quality child care.  Specifically, officials from one state said they would have to forgo plans to  make their public child care website more sophisticated and consumer- friendly and officials from another state said they would not be able to  conduct their planned public education campaigns.", "Professional development. More than half of states we surveyed (30)  said they plan to fund professional development activities for child care  providers. Officials we interviewed in several states told us about plans to  use the new funds to implement or improve online professional  development systems, such as by increasing online course offerings or  creating training applications accessible by cellphone, which can improve  accessibility for all child care providers. We also heard about plans in five  states to use some new funds to provide specialized training, including  training focused on infant and toddler-specific topics, caring for children  exposed to trauma, and emergency planning and response. CCDF  administrators from two other states described plans to fund more  scholarships for child care workforce training and certification programs,  including Child Development Associate credential programs. Lastly,  officials in one state told us they plan to create a mentorship program  whereby high-quality licensed providers mentor licensed-exempt  providers in order to help providers who are interested in becoming  licensed improve their quality and professional development  qualifications. Without the new funds, officials from one state said they  would not have been able to continue to support as many professional  development opportunities that support both subsidized and  nonsubsidized children, such as conferences, networking events, and  coaching. Another CCDF administrator expressed concern that in the  absence of the new funds, her state may have struggled to implement a  new workforce registry system that tracks child care providers\u2019 education  and credentials.", "Most states reported plans to allocate the new funds to multiple state  child care activities, according to our analysis of the survey data.  Specifically, we found that more than two thirds of states plan to fund at  least three of the activities, and half of states plan to fund at least five  activities.", "Moreover, according to our survey, about 40 percent of states (20) also  plan to spend at least some of the new funds to increase the proportion of  funding set aside for quality activities beyond the required minimum for  the year\u2014which, as described earlier, they can use to fund these  activities. During our interviews, we heard about states\u2019 plans to spend  new funds on a variety of qualifying activities, including child care  resource and referral systems, accreditation of child care providers, and  development of high-quality program standards. In the absence of the  new funds, one state CCDF administrator told us that the state would  likely have had to eliminate some optional quality activities, such as  financial support to help providers become accredited. She further  explained that the state is more willing to cut back on quality activities  when there is insufficient funding than to disenroll families from the CCDF  program.", "Aside from quality activities, states we surveyed also reported plans to  spend new CCDF funds toward subsidies. More than half of states (31)  plan to spend at least some of the new funds on increasing payment rates  for CCDF providers or lowering parental copayments. For example, one  state official we interviewed told us about plans to increase payment rates  for infant and toddler care, with a goal to increase access to child care for  infants and toddlers across the state. In addition, about half of states (25)  we surveyed reported plans to spend new funds to implement two  requirements that allow families to continue receiving subsidies for a  longer period of time\u2014the 12-month eligibility period and the graduated  phase-out of assistance. Lastly, nearly one-third of surveyed states (16)  reported plans to use new funds to pay for subsidies for children on their  wait lists to receive child care. CCDF administrators in all of the states  we interviewed that use a wait list (5) stated that they might have had to  expand their wait lists in the absence of the new funds.", "However, several state CCDF administrators expressed uncertainty about  their states\u2019 plans for using the new CCDF funds in interviews (conducted  in May and June 2018). Officials from more than a third of the 15 states  we interviewed (6) said their spending plans were still in flux. In some of  these states, officials said they were still developing and reviewing their  funding proposals as part of their state\u2019s legislative and budgeting  process and they were awaiting future legislative approval or spending  authorization. For example, in one state, the CCDF administrator said  she was awaiting information on how much money the state would  receive before she planned to convene stakeholder groups to discuss  potential funding proposals. In another state, the CCDF administrator said  her office needed to wait for other local budget appropriation decisions  before her office could commit the new CCDF funds to specific priorities.  Officials in more than half of the 15 states we interviewed also told us  they faced challenges making spending decisions because they were  unclear whether the new funds would be provided on an ongoing basis.  For example, CCDF administrators in two states that plan to expand  subsidies to children on their wait lists expressed concerns about having  to disenroll children from the program if funding is discontinued. Officials from several states suggested that they are proceeding cautiously with  spending decisions given there is no guarantee that the increased funds  will be provided in the future, while an official from another state told us  they are operating under the assumption that the new funds will be  provided on an ongoing basis and do not have a contingency plan in the  event that the funds are not continued."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to HHS for review and comment.
