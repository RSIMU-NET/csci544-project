These codes define work roles and tasks for cybersecurity specialty areas such as program management and system administration. Further, the act required DHS to identify and report its cybersecurity workforce critical needs.", "GAO was asked to testify on the extent to which DHS has (1) identified, categorized, and assigned employment codes to its cybersecurity positions and (2) identified its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need. To do so, GAO summarized the findings discussed in its February 2018 report on DHS's cybersecurity workforce ( GAO-18-175 )."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has taken actions to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity positions, as required by the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Workforce Assessment Act of 2014 ; however, its actions have not been timely and complete. For example, DHS did not establish timely and complete procedures to identify, categorize, and code its cybersecurity position vacancies and responsibilities. Further, DHS did not complete efforts to identify all of the department's cybersecurity positions and accurately assign codes to all filled and vacant cybersecurity positions. In August 2017, DHS reported to Congress that it had coded 95 percent of the department's identified cybersecurity positions. However, the department had, at that time, coded approximately 79 percent of the positions. DHS's 95 percent estimate was overstated primarily because it excluded vacant positions, even though the act required DHS to report these positions.", "In addition, although DHS has taken steps to identify its workforce capability gaps, it has not identified or reported to Congress on its departmentwide cybersecurity critical needs that align with specialty areas. The department also has not reported annually its cybersecurity critical needs to the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), as required, and has not developed plans with clearly defined time frames for doing so. (See table).", "Without ensuring that its procedures are complete and that its progress in identifying and assigning codes to its cybersecurity positions is accurately reported, DHS will not be positioned to effectively examine its cybersecurity workforce, identify critical skill gaps, or improve its workforce planning. Further, until DHS establishes plans and time frames for reporting on its critical needs, the department may not be able to ensure that it has the necessary cybersecurity personnel to help protect the department's and the nation's federal networks and critical infrastructure from cyber threats. The commitment of DHS's leadership to addressing these matters is essential to helping the department fulfill the act's requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["In its February 2018 report, GAO recommended that DHS take six actions, including ensuring that its cybersecurity workforce procedures identify position vacancies and responsibilities; reported workforce data are complete and accurate; and plans for reporting on critical needs are developed.

This work included comparing the department\u2019s actions  to identify, categorize, and assign employment codes to its cybersecurity  positions and to identify its cybersecurity workforce areas of critical need  with the required activities specified in the act. We analyzed that  information, including data on the coding of cybersecurity workforce  positions, and also administered a data collection instrument to six  components of DHS.

The revision  defined work roles in specialty areas and cybersecurity tasks for each  work role, as well as the knowledge, skills, and abilities that a person  should have in order to perform each work role. Also, in 2017, OPM  issued guidance creating a unique 3-digit employment code for each  cybersecurity work role.

In addition, OCHCO officials  acknowledged that they had not reviewed the components\u2019 procedures  and had not developed a process for conducting such reviews.", "OCHCO officials stated that several factors had limited their ability to  develop the procedures and to review component-developed procedures  in a timely and complete manner. These factors were (1) a delayed  departmental decision until April 2016 as to whether certain positions  should be considered cybersecurity positions; (2) a belief that each  component had the best understanding of their human capital systems,  so procedure development was best left up to each component; (3) a  condition where each of the six selected DHS components recorded and  tracked vacant positions differently; and (4) cybersecurity specialty areas  for vacant positions were not known until a position description was  developed or verified and a hiring action was imminent.

However, the document  did not adequately help components identify their critical needs by  aligning their gaps with the NICE framework because it did not provide  clear guidance to help components determine a critical need in cases in  which a skills gap is mapped to multiple work categories.", "According to OCHCO officials, DHS had not identified department-wide  cybersecurity critical needs that aligned with the framework partly  because OPM did not provide DHS with guidance for identifying  cybersecurity critical needs. In addition, OCHCO officials stated that the  components did not generally view critical skills gaps in terms of the  categories or specialty areas as defined in the NICE framework, but  instead, described their skills gaps using position titles that are familiar to  them. In the absence of relevant guidance to help components identify  their critical needs, DHS and the components are hindered from  effectively identifying and prioritizing workforce efforts to recruit, hire,  train, develop, and retain cybersecurity personnel.", "DHS also did not report cybersecurity critical needs to OPM in September  2016 or September 2017, as required. Instead, the department first  reported its cybersecurity coding progress and skills gaps in a March  2017 report that it sent to OPM and Congress to address several of the  act\u2019s requirements.

Implementing the six recommendations we made in our February 2018  report should better position the department to meet the requirements of  the 2014 act.
