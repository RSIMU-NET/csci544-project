These settings were: (1) the operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants; (2) the cleanup of sites with radiological contamination; (3) the use of medical equipment that produces radiation; and (4) accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation. Specifically, the agencies relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the use of a model that assumes the risk of cancer increases with every incremental radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation. For example, NRC requires nuclear power plants to consider measures for limiting workers' exposure below NRC's regulatory dose limit, such as by using robots for maintenance work in radiation areas.", "GAO identified seven federal agencies that funded research on low-dose radiation's health effects. In fiscal years 2012 to 2016, DOE, NRC, EPA, and four other federal agencies obligated about $210 million for such research . Although the agencies have collaborated on individual projects on radiation's health effects, they have not established a collaborative mechanism to set research priorities. GAO's previous work has shown that federal agencies can use such mechanisms to implement interagency collaboration to develop and coordinate sound science policies. In the past, DOE took a leading role in this area because DOE provided stable funding and advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation's health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, DOE has phased out funding for one of its main research programs in this area. This has created a void in coordination efforts among federal agencies, and no other agency has stepped forward to fill this void. Because of DOE's prior experience as a leader in this area of research and its research responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, it could play an important role in helping federal agencies establish a coordinating mechanism for low-dose radiation research.", "Dollars are in millions and have not been adjusted for inflation", "Source: GAO analysis of agency data. | GAO-17-546"]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss federal agencies\u2019 requirements  and guidance for protecting workers and the public from the harmful  effects of ionizing radiation and agencies\u2019 support for research on the  health effects of radiation at low doses. Radiation comes from natural  sources as well medical, commercial, and industrial activities. It has  beneficial uses, such as treating cancer, but a large amount of exposure  can cause sickness or even death within days, according to the  Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). In contrast, low levels of  exposure are not known to cause acute health effects but may increase a  person\u2019s risk of developing cancer.", "To protect against cancer and other harmful effects associated with  exposure to radiation, EPA, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC),  and other federal agencies have established requirements and issued  guidance that apply to a wide range of settings in which such exposure  can occur. For example, these requirements include limits on  occupational dose, such as for workers in nuclear power plants, and limits  on the dose that a facility, such as an industrial site with radiological  contamination, can cause to members of the public.", "The Department of Energy (DOE) and other federal agencies have also  funded research to determine the health effects of exposure to low levels  of radiation. However, uncertainties remain about these effects, as DOE\u2019s  Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee recognized  in 2016, when it issued a report stating that further research on the  cancer risk from low-dose radiation could decrease uncertainty in cancer  risk estimates.", "My statement today summarizes our September 2017 report on low-dose  radiation, which examined (1) how selected federal agencies have developed and applied radiation protection requirements and guidance for  workers and the public and (2) the extent to which federal agencies have  funded and collaborated on research on the health effects of low-dose  radiation. For our report, we reviewed agency documentation and  interviewed agency officials on the development of their radiation  protection requirements and guidance. In particular, we identified four  federal agencies\u2014EPA, NRC, DOE, and the Food and Drug  Administration (FDA) within the Department of Health and Human  Services (HHS)\u2014that have developed requirements or guidance for four  settings in which radiation exposure can occur: operation and  decommissioning of nuclear power plants, cleanup of sites with  radiological contamination, use of medical equipment that produces  radiation, and accidental or terrorism-related exposure to radiation.  Findings from our reviews of these four agencies in the four settings we  selected cannot be generalized to all agencies and settings in which  radiation exposure can occur but provide illustrative examples. We also  collected and examined data on support for low-dose radiation research  from seven federal agencies that fund this research\u2014the Centers for  Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) within HHS, the Department of  Defense (DOD), DOE, EPA, the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA), the National Institutes of Health (NIH) within HHS,  and NRC. In particular, we requested these seven agencies to provide  data on obligations for low-dose radiation research for fiscal years 2012  through 2016 and information on the type of research funded.", "More detailed information on the scope and methodology of our work can  be found in our September 2017 report. We conducted the work on which  this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan  and perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide  a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives. We believe that the evidence obtained provides a reasonable  basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.", "In summary, we found that EPA, NRC, DOE, and FDA have generally  used the advice of scientific advisory bodies to develop and apply  radiation protection requirements and guidance for workers and the public  for the four radiation settings in our review. Specifically, the agencies  relied on the advice of three scientific advisory bodies that supported the  use of the linear no-threshold model for such requirements and guidance.  This model assumes that the risk of cancer increases with every  incremental increase in radiation exposure. Accordingly, the agencies  have set regulatory dose limits and issued guidance to confine exposure  to levels that reduce the risk of cancer, while recognizing that scientific  uncertainties occur in estimating cancer risks from low-dose radiation.", "We also found that, for fiscal years 2012 through 2016, seven federal  agencies\u2014CDC, DOD, DOE, EPA, NASA, NIH, and NRC\u2014obligated  about $210 million for research on the health effects of low-dose  radiation, but annual funding decreased by 48 percent. During the period  we reviewed, the seven federal agencies that funded this research  collaborated on particular projects, but they did not use a collaborative  mechanism to address overall research priorities, such as research needs  that advisory bodies identified regarding health effects of low-dose  radiation. In the past, DOE provided leadership in this area and  advocated for greater coordination on research on low-dose radiation\u2019s  health effects. However, since fiscal year 2012, its leadership role and  funding have decreased because it has phased out funding for its main  research program in this area, and no other agency stepped forward to fill  this role. We recommended that DOE lead development of a mechanism  for interagency collaboration on research on low-dose radiation\u2019s health  effects. DOE disagreed with our recommendation, stating that agencies  set their own research priorities. We continue to believe that DOE is in the  best position to lead such an effort."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to NRC\u2019s website, the higher the radiation dose, the sooner the  effects of radiation will appear, and the higher the probability of death.  Radiation doses such as those received by survivors of the atomic bombs  in Japan can cause cancers such as leukemia and colon cancer and, if  levels are high enough, acute radiation syndrome. The symptoms of this  syndrome range from nausea, fatigue, and vomiting to death within days  or weeks. In contrast, the effects of low-dose radiation are more difficult to  detect. In particular, below about 100 millisieverts (mSv) (10 rem)\u2014the  level below which the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and  Medicine\u2019s (National Academies) 2006 report on radiation and human  health considered radiation to be low dose\u2014data do not definitively  establish the dose-response relationship between cancer and radiation  exposure."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Agencies Generally Used Advice from Scientific Advisory Bodies to Develop and Apply Radiation-Protection Requirements and Guidance", "paragraphs": ["In developing and applying radiation protection requirements and  guidance for workers and the public\u2014specifically, limits on dose or  increased health risk and guidance levels on exposure\u2014EPA, NRC,  DOE, and FDA have generally taken the advice of scientific advisory  bodies. In particular, they have relied on the advice of the International  Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Council on  Radiation Protection and Measurements, and the National Academies\u2019  Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board. This advice includes the use of  the linear no-threshold model, which assumes that the risk of cancer  increases with every incremental increase in radiation exposure. For  example, the National Academies published a report in 2006 stating that  the balance of evidence from various types of studies tends to favor a  simple proportionate relationship between radiation at low doses and  cancer risk. According to the National Academies, the availability of new  and more extensive data since the publication of its previous report in  1990 strengthened confidence in the 2006 report\u2019s estimates of cancer  risk.", "The advisory bodies have recognized challenges in accurately estimating  cancer risks from very low doses of radiation exposure when using the  linear no-threshold model. For example, much of the data on health  effects of radiation exposure come from non-U.S. populations, such as  Japanese atomic bomb survivors. These individuals received a large  exposure to radiation over a short period of time (an acute exposure), and  there is uncertainty about the extent to which the health effects for these  populations can be extrapolated to a U.S. population that is regularly  (chronically) exposed to low-dose radiation.", "Nevertheless, NRC officials told us that, in the absence of convincing  evidence that there is a dose threshold below which low levels of  radiation are beneficial or not harmful, NRC will continue to follow the  recommendations of scientific advisory bodies to use the linear no- threshold model. Similarly, officials from EPA told us that they would  consider changing the use of the linear no-threshold model as the basis  of their requirements and guidance only if there were a strong  recommendation from scientific advisory bodies on radiation protection as  well as an endorsement of the change by the National Academies.", "Under this model, federal regulations set dose limits for radiation  exposure that are below the level in the National Academies\u2019 2006 report  on radiation and human health for defining low-dose radiation. For  example, NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public (excluding  natural, or background, sources of radiation) from operation of nuclear  power plants is a hundredth of the level the National Academies  considers low dose. NRC based the dose limit on an advisory body  recommendation that the cancer risk to the general public from exposure  to radiation should be comparable to the public\u2019s risk from everyday  activities, such as taking public transportation.", "The low-dose radiation limits and guidance that federal agencies have  developed and applied vary depending on the settings in which exposure  can occur. For example, NRC has established limits on occupational dose  that apply to nuclear power-plant workers; these limits are higher than  NRC\u2019s annual dose limit for members of the public but are still below the  level the National Academies considers low dose. In keeping with  advisory body recommendations, NRC also applies the principle that  doses should be kept as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA). NRC  defines ALARA to mean making every reasonable effort to maintain  exposures to radiation as far below dose limits as is practical. At a  nuclear power plant we visited as part of our work, representatives told us  that under their ALARA plan, the plant set its own dose limit for workers at  40 percent of the NRC\u2019s regulatory limit. Moreover, officials at the plant  told us that they have been able to keep exposures below the plant\u2019s own  limit by continuously seeking opportunities to reduce unnecessary worker  exposure to radiation, such as using robots to perform maintenance work  in radiation areas.", "In contrast to radiation exposure received from nuclear power plants, FDA  officials stated that the agency regulates the maximum radiation output of  medical equipment, instead of setting limits on the total amount of  radiation exposure to patients. According to FDA officials, FDA does not  generally have the authority to regulate the total amount of radiation  exposure a patient receives from medical imaging equipment. However,  in keeping with the principle that radiation exposure should be kept as low  as reasonably achievable, FDA encourages voluntary measures by health  care providers, such as to investigate and determine whether it is  possible to reduce radiation exposure to patients from the use of medical- imaging equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Seven Agencies Have Funded Research on the Health Effects of Low-Dose Radiation but Have Not Collaborated on Overall Research Priorities", "paragraphs": ["From fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2016, seven federal agencies  obligated $209.6 million for research on the health effects of low-dose  radiation, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to address  overall research priorities in this area.

The five other agencies\u2014NRC, NASA, DOD, EPA, and  CDC\u2014obligated the remaining $4.7 million, or about 2 percent of the  total.", "DOE has two offices that have funded research on the health effects of  low-dose radiation\u2014the Office of Science and the Office of Environment,  Health, Safety and Security\u2014according to funding information DOE  provided. The Office of Science established the Low Dose Radiation  Research Program in 1998 and funded it through fiscal year 2016. A  primary focus of this program was radiobiological research, which  examines molecular and cellular responses to radiation exposure.  According to DOE\u2019s website for the program, the program provided data  and information about the low-dose range of exposure, producing 737  peer-reviewed publications as of March 2012. The Office of Environment,  Health, Safety and Security provided funding for epidemiological studies,  including studies involving Japanese atomic bomb survivors.", "NIH has funded and conducted both epidemiological and radiobiological  studies on low-dose radiation, according to NIH officials. The officials  stated that the studies are conducted through the National Cancer  Institute\u2019s internal research program for radiation epidemiology, as well as  through NIH\u2019s research programs for external funding of investigator- initiated research. Other institutes of NIH, including the National Institute  of Environmental Health Sciences, also fund research related to the  health effects of radiation exposure as part of NIH\u2019s overall mission to  fund medical research.", "Among the other agencies that provided some funding to low-dose  radiation studies, several provided funding to the Epidemiological Study  of One Million U.S. Radiation Workers and Veterans (Million Person  Study)\u2014an ongoing study headed by the National Council on Radiation  Protection and Measurements. DOE also provided funding for this study.", "In fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the seven agencies who provided  funding for research on health effects of low-dose radiation collectively  decreased their annual funding obligations in this area by 48 percent,  from $57.9 million in fiscal year 2012 to $30.4 million in fiscal year 2016.  DOE accounted for a large portion of this overall decrease in annual  funding. Specifically, over this 5-year period, DOE reduced its annual  funding obligations for this area of research by 45 percent\u2014from $32.6  million in fiscal year 2012 to $18.0 million in fiscal year 2016. According to  DOE, the decrease was primarily due to DOE\u2019s reduction in funding for its  Low Dose Radiation Research Program. According to DOE officials,  decreases in funding for the program reflected a shift toward bioenergy  and environmental research. Similarly, over the 5-year period, NIH\u2019s  funding for low-dose radiation research decreased by 48 percent\u2014from  $23.1 million in fiscal year 2012 to $12.0 million in fiscal year 2016. NIH  officials explained that funding levels for a particular disease or research  area can fluctuate depending on several factors, including the number  and quality of research proposals submitted and the outcome of NIH\u2019s  peer reviews of the proposals, as well as the overall research budget.", "The seven agencies that funded research on health effects of low-dose  radiation for fiscal years 2012 through 2016 collaborated on particular  research projects through various mechanisms, including joint funding of  individual projects, but they did not use a collaborative mechanism to  address overall research priorities. As previously noted, the 2016 report  of DOE\u2019s Biological and Environmental Research Advisory Committee  provided information about research needs in low-dose radiation and  found that further research could decrease uncertainty in predicting  cancer risk from low-dose radiation. The report stated that other  agencies\u2014including NRC, NIH, EPA, DOD, and NASA\u2014could benefit  from the reduction in uncertainty that could be obtained by this research.", "In our September 2017 report, we recommended that the Secretary of  Energy lead the development of a mechanism for interagency  collaboration to determine roles and responsibilities for addressing  priorities related to research on the health effects of low-dose radiation.  We made this recommendation because our previous work has shown  that collaborative mechanisms can serve multiple purposes, such as  leading interagency efforts to develop and coordinate sound science and  technology policies across the federal government. Although collaborative  mechanisms differ in complexity and scope, they all benefit from certain  key features, such as leadership.", "We directed this recommendation to DOE for several reasons. In the  past, DOE took a leading role in advocating for greater communication  and coordination between the fields of radiation biology and  epidemiology. In addition, DOE is the federal agency that currently has  primary responsibility under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 for research  related to the protection of health during activities that can result in  exposure to radiation. DOE is well positioned to lead an effort to ensure  that federal agencies have a mechanism for interagency collaboration to  address overall research priorities related to low-dose radiation health  effects because of the agency\u2019s past experience as a leader in this area  of research. Such an effort could help DOE and the collaborating  agencies determine roles and responsibilities, including leadership when  addressing shared research priorities.", "DOE did not agree with our recommendation. In particular, DOE stated  that EPA and NRC also have legal mandates to research low-dose  radiation exposure and that these agencies establish their research  priorities in accordance with their respective budget authorities and  recommendations from independent advisory bodies. DOE stated that as  a result, it would not be appropriate for DOE to lead the development of a  mechanism for interagency collaboration.", "We believe that DOE\u2019s concerns stem from a misinterpretation of our  recommendation, and we made several changes to our report and our  recommendation to clarify DOE\u2019s role. We noted that we did not  recommend that a mechanism for interagency collaboration serve as a  replacement for agencies\u2019 legal mandates, budget authorities, and  recommendations from independent advisory bodies. Instead, this  mechanism would help agencies address shared research priorities. In  making our recommendation, we did not specify the coordinating  mechanism that agencies should use and instead left it to DOE to lead  the development of an appropriate mechanism. We continue to believe  that an interagency coordination mechanism for low-dose research is  needed and that DOE is in the best position to lead agencies in  developing the most appropriate mechanism.", "Chairman Weber, Ranking Member Veasey, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this concludes my prepared statement.
