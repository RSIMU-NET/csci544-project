Government officials cited many obstacles to increasing federal contracting with WOSBs, including a reduced contracting personnel force and the absense of a targeted WOSB government program. These contracting officers offered suggestions for increasing WOSB participation in federal contracting, including a strengthened outreach program and expanded excess to contract financing."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Concerned that women-owned small businesses (WOSB) were receiving  contracts for only 2.2 percent\u2014less than one-half of the 5-percent  governmentwide goal\u2014of the almost $200 billion in goods and services the  federal government purchases each year, the Congress mandated that we  review the progress the federal government has made to increase its  contracting with WOSBs and identify any measures that could improve the  government\u2019s performance in contracting with WOSBs. This report  responds to the mandate by providing information on   trends in federal contracting with WOSBs since fiscal year 1996,   obstacles that federal contracting officials perceive to contracting with   suggestions from these officials to help increase federal contracting   concerns of these officials about the WOSB contracting goals  established for individual agencies.", "The mandate also required that, after taking into consideration the  suggestions we received from federal contracting officials, we include in  our report any recommendations for action that we believe could improve  procurement opportunities for WOSBs. To provide perspective, we also  obtained views from representatives of four national women business- owner organizations on issues pertaining to government contracting with  WOSBs.", "For information on trends in federal contracting with WOSBs, we analyzed  data collected since fiscal year 1996 from the Small Business  Administration (SBA) and the General Services Administration\u2019s (GSA)  Federal Procurement Data System (FPDS), which contains information  reported by federal agencies about their contracting activities. For  information on obstacles to contracting with WOSBs and suggestions on  how to increase contracting with them, we obtained the views of numerous  officials involved in federal contracting policies and practices. We  conducted group discussions and individual interviews with officials from  the Procurement Executive Council (PEC), representatives from the Office  of Small and Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU) within  numerous agencies, 30 contracting officers (from four federal agencies that  account for over 80 percent of the government\u2019s contract purchases each  year), and officials from the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s (OMB)  Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP) and SBA. While we analyzed  the information gathered and applied insights from a body of related work  we previously performed, we did not validate the obstacles identified by  the individuals we interviewed, nor did we evaluate the potential  effectiveness or feasibility of the suggestions they provided. Further details  about the scope and methodology of our review can be found in appendix I.", "After we completed our analysis, the Small Business Reauthorization Act of  2000 was enacted in December 2000. The act authorized a limited  procurement program of restricted competition for WOSBs. This program  will become effective after SBA completes a study identifying industries in  which WOSBs have been underrepresented and guidance is developed for  agencies\u2019 implementation of the program, including the certification and  waiver provisions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to information contained in the mandate for this report, the  number of WOSBs in the United States increased by 78 percent between  1987 and 1996, almost twice the rate of growth of all U.S. businesses. Also,  approximately 8 million WOSBs in the United States provide jobs for over  15 million individuals and generate almost $1.4 trillion in sales each year.  The administration and the Congress have long been concerned about the  disparity between WOSBs\u2019 prevalence in the economy and the level of  government procurements of their products and services. In 1979, when an  executive order first made SBA responsible for negotiating WOSB  contracting goals with federal agencies, WOSBs received only 0.2 percent  of all federal procurements. By 1988, this percentage had grown to only 1  percent, and although legislation was enacted to provide a program of  assistance and support to WOSBs, no statutory goal for their participation  in federal procurements was established until 1994. Section 7106 of the  Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 (FASA) amended the Small  Business Act to require establishment of a governmentwide goal for  participation by WOSBs in procurement contracts of not less than 5  percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for  each fiscal year.  The goal was implemented by procurement regulations  effective in fiscal year 1996. The FASA conference report indicated that the  5-percent goal was not intended to create a new set-aside or program of  restricted competition for WOSBs, but rather to establish a target that  would result in greater opportunity for WOSBs to compete for federal  contracts. The report recognized that, given the slow progress toward  increasing contracting with WOSBs, it could take some time before the goal  would be reached.", "Through FASA, the governmentwide goal of 5 percent for WOSBs joined  the existing governmentwide contracting goals in the Small Business Act  for small business concerns (then no less than 20 percent of the total value  of all prime contract awards for each fiscal year)  and small disadvantaged  businesses (SDB) (no less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime  contract and subcontract awards each year). Under the Small Business  Act, all small business goals are to represent for each procuring agency, the  \u201cmaximum practicable opportunity\u201d for small businesses\u2019 participation in  that agency\u2019s contracts. In addition, an agency\u2019s goals are to \u201crealistically  reflect the potential of small business concerns\u201d to perform such contracts  and subcontracts. At the same time, the cumulative annual goals for all  agencies are to meet or exceed the annual governmentwide goal. Also,  agencies are to make a consistent effort to annually expand participation  by small business concerns in their contracts. Agencies are to report each  year to SBA on the extent of participation by small businesses, including  WOSBs, as well as any justifications for failure to meet the goals. SBA, in  turn, is required to report this information to the President.", "FASA added WOSBs to the existing policy that small businesses and small  disadvantaged businesses have the maximum practicable opportunity to  become subcontractors for federal contracts exceeding $100,000 and to  receive timely payment from prime contractors. FASA also included  WOSBs in the requirement that for contracts exceeding $500,000 (or $1  million for construction contracts) prime contractors prepare  subcontracting plans that provide the maximum practicable opportunity  for small businesses to participate in the performance of the prime  contract.", "FASA also required agencies to report contracts over a certain dollar  threshold with WOSBs to the Federal Procurement Data Center (FPDC).  Quarterly, approximately 70 executive branch agencies report contracting  data either by individual contract for acquisitions above $25,000 or as  summary data for acquisitions at or below $25,000 to FPDC. Twenty of  these agencies account for over 99 percent of federal contract  expenditures, 4 account for over 85 percent, and 1\u2014the Department of  Defense\u2014accounts for over 64 percent.", "If a business submitting an offer for a federal procurement represents that  it is a small business concern, and meets the definition of a WOSB, it can  \u201cself-certify\u201d as a WOSB when it completes the small business program  representations required in solicitations for procurements above $2,500. In  doing so, the business represents (by checking the appropriate box) that it  is, or is not, a WOSB. Generally, a contracting agency will accept the self- representation to be accurate. The federal government does not currently  require that WOSBs submitting offers as prime contractors on federal  procurements receive certification (from SBA or an outside entity) of their  status as WOSBs. However, if a WOSB submits an offer for a federal  subcontract, the prime contractor may, according to SBA, require  certification that the business is in fact woman-owned. Furthermore, a  WOSB submitting an offer as an SDB, 8(a) firm, or HUBZone small business  will be required to meet the certification requirements for those  programs.", "Both the Congress and the Administration have recently reiterated concern  about the continued disparity between the number of WOSBs in the  economy and the extent of the government\u2019s contracting with them. As of  fiscal year 1999, when women-owned businesses made up 38 percent of all  businesses in the United States, WOSBs received 2.5 percent of the  approximately $189 billion in federal prime contracts awarded that year.  This discrepancy led the Senate to adopt Resolution 311 on May 23, 2000,  which urged the President to adopt a policy supporting the 5-percent  WOSB contracting goal, encouraged agencies to make concerted efforts to  meet the goal before the end of fiscal year 2000, and holds agencies  accountable for achieving the goal.", "Also on May 23, President Clinton, in culmination of work by the  Interagency Committee on Women\u2019s Business Enterprise, issued  Executive Order 13157 to reaffirm the government\u2019s commitment to  increasing opportunities for WOSBs in the federal procurement market.  The order reiterated executive branch policy to take the steps necessary to  meet or exceed the 5-percent governmentwide WOSB contracting goal and  to implement this policy by establishing separate 5-percent  governmentwide goals for both prime contract awards and subcontract  awards each fiscal year. The order requires each agency with procurement  authority to develop a long-term comprehensive strategy to expand  opportunities for WOSBs. The order lists methods and programs these  agency strategies should include, such as  designating a senior acquisition official who will work with SBA to  identify and promote contracting with WOSBs;  requiring contracting officers, to the maximum extent practicable, to  include WOSBs in competitive acquisitions;  implementing procedures for acquisition planners to structure  acquisitions (including multiple award contracts) and provide guidance  to facilitate competition among small businesses, HUBZone small  businesses, SDBs, and WOSBs;  implementing mentor-prot\u00e9g\u00e9 programs that include WOSBs; and  offering outreach, training and technical assistance programs to assist  WOSBs in developing their products, skills, business planning practices,  and marketing techniques.", "The order further directs agencies, when feasible and consistent with the  effective and efficient performance of their missions, to establish 5-percent  WOSB goals for both prime and subcontract awards each fiscal year. SBA  informs us that as a result of this executive order, it is moving from a  negotiated agency goal process to an assigned process whereby SBA will  set goals with possible input from the agencies. SBA may start setting all  agencies\u2019 goals at 5 percent, although officials believe the 5-percent goal is  unattainable for some agencies, which means that other agencies will have  goals set at a higher point for the federal government to meet the 5- percent  governmentwide goal.", "The executive order further establishes certain responsibilities for SBA and  instructs SBA to establish an Assistant Administrator for Women\u2019s  Procurement (within SBA\u2019s Office of Government Contracting). This  official will head the Office of Federal Contract Assistance for Women  Business Owners and coordinate agencies\u2019 efforts to achieve the WOSB  goals. Specifically, this office will be responsible for  working with each agency to develop and implement policies to achieve  WOSB contracting goals and advising agencies on how to increase  WOSB contracting;  evaluating whether agencies are meeting their WOSB contracting goals  on a semiannual basis and preparing a report to the President (through  the SBA Administrator, the Interagency Committee on Women\u2019s  Business Enterprise, and OFPP) on findings regarding contract awards  to WOSBs;  making recommendations and working with agencies to increase WOSB  contracting and taking corrective actions with those agencies not  meeting the 5-percent goal; providing a program of training and development seminars and  conferences to instruct WOSBs on participation in SBA\u2019s 8(a), SDB, and  HUBZone programs, and other small business contracting programs for  which WOSBs might be eligible; and  developing and implementing a single uniform federal governmentwide  Web site that is linked to other acquisition, small business, and women- owned business sites and provides current procurement information to  WOSBs and other small businesses.", "A recent change to the government\u2019s procurement program for WOSBs  emerged from the Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000, which  amended the Small Business Act to give federal agencies authority to  restrict competition for certain contracts to certified WOSBs that are  economically disadvantaged. The authority, which is permissive, not  mandatory, is limited to contracts not exceeding $3 million ($5 million for  manufacturing) in those industries SBA identifies as underrepresented by  WOSBs in federal procurement. The act requires SBA to conduct a study to  pinpoint such industries. Federal contracting officers must also have a  reasonable expectation that two or more WOSBs will submit offers and  that the contract can be awarded at a fair and reasonable price before the  officers may exercise their new authority. SBA may waive the requirement  for businesses owned by women who are economically disadvantaged if  the business is in an industry in which small businesses owned and  controlled by women are \u201csubstantially\u201d underrepresented. The new  legislation will require WOSBs participating in the program to be certified  as such by a government or outside entity and requires SBA to establish  procedures to verify the WOSBs\u2019 eligibility and the accuracy of any  certifications.", "SBA currently has several initiatives under way in coordination with  federal agencies and departments to work towards meeting the WOSB  goals. For example, SBA offers training workshops for women business  owners and designates agency liaisons (Federal Agency Advocates for  Women) who are to strive to expand the pool of WOSBs receiving federal  contracts. In addition, according to SBA, its Office of Federal Contract  Assistance to Women Business Owners has been working with the newly  appointed senior acquisition officials in each agency who have been  selected to help their respective agencies increase federal procurement  opportunities for WOSBs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Trends Reveal Little Progress in Federal Contracting With WOSBs", "paragraphs": ["We examined a number of trends pertaining to government contracting  with WOSBs since fiscal year 1996 to determine changes, patterns, and  progress towards increasing federal contracting and meeting both the  governmentwide and agency-specific goals for both prime and  subcontracting with WOSBs.

Some increased their  share of prime or subcontract expenditures for WOSBs from fiscal year  1996 through fiscal year 1999 but never reached their goals, whereas others  decreased their share each year and still met or exceeded their WOSB  goals. For example, EPA increased its share of expenditures for prime  contracts with WOSBs by about 50 percent between fiscal year 1996 and  fiscal year 1999, yet it never met its WOSB prime contracting goal (which  doubled over the period). On the other hand, VA\u2019s share of prime contract  expenditures for WOSBs decreased from 5.8 percent in fiscal year 1996 to  5.6 percent in fiscal year 1999, yet VA met its goal each year, as its goal  increased from 4 percent to 5 percent over the period.", "The same inconsistency emerged in these agencies\u2019 shares of subcontracts  with WOSBs.

Moreover, there was not always a  correlation between an agency\u2019s level of procurement from WOSBs and its  goals. For example, some agencies with relatively low shares of prime  contracts awarded to WOSBs appear to have been able to negotiate lower  goals with SBA. NASA, with a historically low level of procurements from  WOSBs, had a WOSB prime contracting goal of 1.4 percent in fiscal year  1999 (and exceeded its goal by awarding 1.64 percent of prime contracts to  WOSBs). In the same year, Justice had a goal of 3 percent and exceeded its  goal by awarding 3.27 percent to WOSBs.

Table 2 shows the share of total prime contract  expenditures and WOSB prime contract expenditures by the top 20  agencies (as well as all others combined) in fiscal year 1999. As shown in  the table, the four largest procuring agencies\u2014DOD, DOE, NASA, and  GSA\u2014together accounted for over 82 percent of all federal prime  contracts. The same four agencies accounted for about 71 percent of the  contracts with WOSBs. In fiscal year 1999, DOD alone accounted for over  64 percent, or nearly $120 billion, of all federal prime contract  expenditures. DOD awarded 1.9 percent of its prime contracts to WOSBs,  representing approximately $2.3 billion or about 50 percent of all federal  prime contract expenditures with WOSBs in 1999.", "For two of the top four agencies, their share of the total procurement from  WOSBs is smaller than their share of total federal procurement. For  example, DOD buys 50.2 percent of the total amount the government  purchases from WOSBs but it accounts for 64.4 percent of the value of all  federal procurements. Similarly, NASA, with its 4-percent share of total  procurements from WOSBs, accounts for 5.9 percent of total federal  procurements. The two other largest procuring agencies accumulated a  larger share of total procurements from WOSBs than their share of total  federal procurements. DOE accounts for 8.7 percent of federal purchases  from WOSBs while accounting for 8.4 percent of total procurement, and  GSA accounts for 7.7 percent of federal procurements from WOSBs while  accounting for 4 percent of federal procurements. Without benchmarks of  realistic WOSB contracting goals for individual agencies, it is unclear  whether the level of an agency\u2019s contracting with WOSBs represents  successful outreach efforts or a better match between what the agency  buys and what WOSBs produce in these industries.", "Nevertheless, the dominance of DOD in both total contracts and contracts  with WOSBs justifies special attention. The government\u2019s success or failure  in meeting the annual 5-percent governmentwide goals for prime and  subcontracting with WOSBs depends to a large extent on DOD\u2019s ability to  meet its WOSB goals. Because DOD achieved less than half of its 5-percent  goal for prime contracts with WOSBs in fiscal year 1999, the  governmentwide goal for prime contracting with WOSBs could not have  been met even if every other federal agency had reached its WOSB prime  contracting goal.

The act requires federal agencies to avoid unnecessary and  unjustified bundling of contract requirements that precludes small  businesses from participating in procurements as prime contractors. It also  requires each federal agency to promote small businesses\u2019 participation by  structuring its contracting requirements to facilitate competition by and  among small businesses.", "Representatives of WOSBs generally regard contract bundling as an  obstacle to increasing their contracting with the federal government.  However, we have been unable to confirm this. In conducting a review of  contract bundling earlier this year, we reported that data were not  currently available to determine its impact on small businesses. We  recommended that SBA develop a strategy setting forth how the agency  can best achieve the results desired from oversight of contract bundling by  considering the staffing resources and training needed, the timely  resolution of potential bundling cases, and constraints the agency faces in  implementing the strategy.

Also, some of these officials said they recognize that such a  program would not guarantee that the 5-percent governmentwide goals for  prime and subcontracts would be achieved. For example, not enough  qualified WOSBs might exist in those industries in which much federal  procurement occurs, meaning that a new contracting program might not be  sufficiently effective in increasing contracting with WOSBs to achieve the  governmentwide goals. In addition, officials said that because a number of  small business groups already must be considered for government  contracts, they would have to make choices between competing small  business groups and, ultimately, there might not be enough contracts to go  around. Thus, while WOSBs might benefit from a new targeted contracting  program, such a program might compete with existing programs for other  small business groups. To combat this problem, some officials suggested  broadening or combining existing programs to incorporate WOSBs (such  as broadening the definition of a small disadvantaged business to  encompass all WOSBs). Several of the representatives from the women\u2019s  groups we contacted believed that a targeted contracting program would  help to accelerate progress toward achieving the WOSB goals.", "The Small Business Reauthorization Act of 2000 authorized a targeted  contracting program for certain WOSBs.

We incorporated  these observations into the discussion of both barriers and suggestions for  increasing contracting with WOSBs.", "Finally, PEC officials emphasized that, notwithstanding the potential noted  above for some improvements in the efficiency of outreach efforts,  attempts to increase contracting within various small business contracting  programs is largely a zero-sum problem\u2014that is, increased efforts in one  area are likely to adversely affect other programs. They noted that the  workload pressures on contracting officers are contributing further to the  use of contracting practices that some have alleged limit opportunities for  small businesses to compete for federal contracts. We expanded our  discussion of these issues and added an observation about the value of  overseeing this trend and its possible adverse effects on WOSBs and other  small business groups.", "We also received oral comments from the co-chair of the OSDBU Council,  who represented the views of a number of their members. The Council  members were generally positive about the report and supported the  recommendation but expressed concern that the significant efforts and  successes of various agencies were not reflected in the report. They  believed the draft overemphasized the achievement of goals, particularly  noting that we described how no agency had met both its prime and  subcontract goals over the 4-year period examined. They stated that this  focus failed to recognize that some agencies set \u201cstretch\u201d goals and that  some agencies have continually achieved or exceeded procurement levels  for WOSBs above the 5-percent governmentwide goal. We retained our  observations about the achievement of agency goals since individual  agency goals (whether above or below 5 percent) are key to the  achievement of the governmentwide goal. However, we did incorporate a  reference to the one agency that has continually achieved or exceeded the  5-percent governmentwide goal. OSDBU Council members also provided  technical comments that we incorporated into the report as appropriate.", "We received written comments from DOD and NASA. DOD\u2019s Under  Secretary of Acquisition Technology and Logistics provided written  comments stating that DOD generally agreed with the facts in the report  and supports our recommendation to SBA, including that SBA officials  seek the active collaboration and support of DOD officials in the study.  Separately, DOD provided us with several technical comments, which we  incorporated into the final report as appropriate. DOD\u2019s letter to us appears  in appendix IV.", "A NASA Associate Deputy Administrator provided us with written  comments stating that NASA agreed with our recommendation to SBA. He  noted that when establishing the 5-percent goal for WOSBs, FASA specified  that the goal be no less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime and  subcontract awards for each fiscal year and it was not until November 1999  that OFPP interpreted the requirement to mean that there were separate 5- percent goals for prime and subcontracts. He recommended that we clarify  our report on this point. We agree and clarified our report accordingly.  NASA\u2019s letter to us appears in appendix V.", "We received oral comments from the executive director of WBC, the  president of WBENC, and both the current and immediate past president of  the Dallas-Ft. Worth Chapter of NAWBO. Each of these officials had  positive comments about the report and had no substantive or technical  disagreements with its content.", "We received written comments from the deputy director, NWBC. She said  that she did not believe the draft report was responsive to the mandate and  did not support our recommendation to SBA. She also provided a number  of general and technical comments on the draft report. She was particularly  concerned about our interpretation of certain requirements of the  legislative mandate for this report. She commented that our methodology  of focusing on the views of federal officials to discern the obstacles to, and  suggestions for, increasing contract awards to WOSBs was flawed and  indiscriminately repeated unverified assertions by federal officials. She  said that we should have talked with women-owned businesses in the  contracting arena and incorporated those discussions into the report  together with the comments we received from federal employees involved  in the federal procurement system. We disagree and believe the mandate  clearly specifies that we solicit views from federal employees involved in  the federal procurement system about their experiences pertaining to  obstacles and suggestions for increasing the number of contracts awarded  to WOSBs. In addition, we did contact representatives of four women- owned business organizations and solicited their views on any obstacles to  and suggestions for increasing federal contracts with WOSBs, although this  effort was not called for in the mandate.", "The deputy director of NWBC specifically said she disagreed with our  recommendation that SBA conduct a study to improve the analytical basis  of agency WOSB contracting goals and believes it is inconsistent with the  mandate calling for GAO recommendations to \u201cincrease contract awards\u201d  to WOSBs. We agree that this recommendation is not strictly a means to  increase awards to WOSBs. However, we found the evidence persuasive  that establishing an analytical foundation for the goals was relevant to the  credibility and performance of the program. Accordingly, we retained this  recommendation. We believe more realistic agency-specific WOSB  contracting goals can improve the integrity of this program, can provide a  solid basis for holding agencies accountable for achieving those goals, and  over time could contribute to increases in agency contracts with WOSBs.", "In her view, the mandate required us to make recommendations to increase  such awards. The mandate does state that we are to make  recommendations we consider appropriate after taking into consideration  any suggestions we received during our discussions with federal  contracting officials. However, an analysis of the benefits and effects of the  various suggestions put forth was not within the scope of our review, so we  cannot endorse any particular strategy. Nonetheless, considering the  breadth of consensus on the potential merit of various measures, we added  a discussion of some of the promising suggestions for increasing awards to  WOSBs and included a recommendation for SBA to further study their  potential. Finally, we incorporated as appropriate some of her general and  technical comments. Her complete written comments are included in  appendix VI.", "We performed our work from May 2000 through January 2001 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

We acquired data from FPDC on overall federal  procurement expenditures and procurement expenditures on small  businesses, small disadvantaged businesses (SDBs), 8(a) businesses, and  WOSBs for fiscal years 1996 (the first year the implementation of the 5- percent WOSB governmentwide goal was in effect) through 1999. We  acquired data from SBA on federal agencies\u2019 prime contracting and  subcontracting WOSB goals and the agencies\u2019 related annual contract  awards for fiscal years 1996 through 1999. We analyzed the FPDC data to  determine the overall trends of federal procurement expenditures and the  trends of federal contracting with WOSBs for the 4 fiscal years. We  analyzed the SBA data to determine the percentage of agencies\u2019 contracts  awarded to WOSBs each year, the number of agencies meeting their WOSB  goal, and the small business programs that WOSBs used to receive their  contract awards.", "To meet our other three objectives, we selected four agencies that  accounted for over 80 percent of all federal contracting expenditures for  fiscal years 1997 through1999: Department of Defense (DOD), Department  of Energy (DOE), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA),  and General Services Administration (GSA). We contacted procurement  officials, agency Small Business Office representatives, and 30 contracting  officers from these agencies to discuss any obstacles (legal or regulatory)  they encountered in awarding contracts to WOSBs and their suggestions  for increasing the number of contracts awarded to WOSBs, and meeting  agencies\u2019 annual WOSB contracting goals. We conducted focused  interviews and group discussions with officials from the Procurement  Executive Council (PEC) and numerous agencies\u2019 Office of Small and  Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU). We contacted officials from  the Office of Federal Procurement Policy (OFPP), Office of Management  and Budget (OMB), and SBA to discuss policy and regulations governing  federal contracting with WOSBs and their suggestions for increasing  contracts awarded to WOSBs and meeting WOSB contracting goals. We  contacted representatives from the Office of Small Disadvantaged Business  Utilization of 20 major agencies to determine why the agencies\u2019 WOSB  goals were or were not met for the fiscal years 1996 through 1999 and any  obstacles to and suggestions for awarding contracts to WOSBs and meeting  WOSB contracting goals. These officials were selected for the most part  based on their substantial experience in the field of federal contracting.", "In addition, we contacted representatives of four women business-owner  organizations to gain their perspective on obstacles to and suggestions for  increasing federal contract awards to WOSBs. We did not validate the  obstacles identified nor assess the benefits and effects of the suggestions  we received from the federal contracting officials and others we  interviewed.", "In addition, we analyzed the information gathered and applied insights  from a body of related work we previously performed.
