GAO was asked to provide information on emergency department crowding, including the extent hospitals located in metropolitan areas are experiencing crowding, the factors contributing to crowding, and the actions hospitals and communities have taken to address crowding. To conduct this work, GAO surveyed over 2,000 hospitals and about 74 percent responded.

For example, while 2 of every 3 hospitals reported asking ambulances to be diverted to other hospitals at some point in fiscal year 2001, a smaller portion--about 1 of every 10--reported being on diversion status for more than 20 percent of the year. Hospitals in areas with larger populations, areas with high population growth in recent years, and areas with higher-than-average percentages of people without health insurance reported higher levels of crowding. While no single factor stands out as the reason why crowding occurs, GAO found the factor most commonly associated with crowding was the inability to transfer emergency patients to inpatient beds once a decision had been made to admit them as hospital patients rather than to treat and release them. When patients \"board\" in the emergency department due to the inability to transfer them elsewhere, the space, staff, and other resources available to treat new emergency patients are diminished. Hospitals and communities reported a variety of actions to address crowding, including expanding their emergency departments and developing ways to transfer emergency patients to inpatient beds more efficiently. For the most part, these actions have not been extensively evaluated, so their effect is unknown. However, the widely varying characteristics between hospitals mean that no one approach is likely to emerge as a way to address this ongoing concern. Representatives from the American College of Emergency Physicians and the American Hospital Association and an independent reviewer provided comments on a draft of this report, which we incorporated as appropriate."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Open 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, hospital emergency departments are a  major part of the nation\u2019s health care safety net.

This pressure has led to  reports of crowding. For example, considerable attention has been given  to reports that emergency departments request that ambulances that  would normally bring patients to their hospitals go instead to other  hospitals that are presumably less crowded\u2014a practice known as  diversion.

You asked us to determine if  data could be assembled from a broader, more national scope in order to  provide more perspective on the issue. We conducted a review that  encompassed hospitals located in the nation\u2019s metropolitan statistical  areas (MSA). We excluded nonmetropolitan areas because available  information and contacts with rural health organizations indicated that  emergency department crowding is not a major problem in these areas.  Our work addressed the following questions:    To what extent are hospitals in MSAs experiencing crowded conditions in  their emergency departments, and is crowding more severe in some types  of MSAs than in others?", "What factors contribute to emergency department crowding?     What actions have hospitals and communities taken to address crowding?", "To conduct this work, we sent a mail questionnaire to all community  hospitals located in MSAs that reported having emergency departments in  2000\u2014more than 2,000 hospitals in all, of which about 74 percent  responded. The survey collected information related to three indicators of  crowding: (1) the number of hours on diversion, (2) the percentage of  patients who were boarding in the emergency department for 2 hours or  more and the average number of hours boarded, and (3) the proportion of  patients who left before a medical evaluation. In analyzing these  responses, we weighted responses to adjust for a lower response rate from  investor-owned (for-profit) hospitals to provide estimates for the universe  of hospitals. To examine which factors contributed to crowding, we  analyzed information provided by the surveyed hospitals and other data on  hospital and MSA characteristics. To provide information on actions taken  by hospitals and communities to address crowding, as well as emergency  medical services (EMS) systems and diversion at the community level, we  conducted site visits in six locations where problems had been reported  regarding crowded emergency departments\u2014Atlanta, Boston, Cleveland,  Los Angeles, Miami, and Phoenix. We selected these sites because they  varied in geographic location, proportion of people without health  insurance, population, and recent population growth. In these locations,  we interviewed EMS officials, professional associations, and hospital  officials, and we observed emergency departments in 24 hospitals. We  supplemented this work with analysis of existing national data and  reviews of relevant studies. We also interviewed persons knowledgeable  about the issues, including health services researchers; representatives  from hospital associations, provider associations, and emergency medical  associations; and federal, state, and local health officials.

Of these,  just over half were located in MSAs. From 1997 through 2000, while the  number of emergency department visits increased about 14 percent, the  number of hospitals with emergency departments decreased by about 2  percent. The result was that the average number of visits per emergency  department increased by 16 percent. Many hospitals expanded the  physical space and number of treatment spaces in their emergency  departments during that time.", "Recent reports have raised concern that many of the nation\u2019s emergency  departments are experiencing high demand and crowded conditions. An  April 2002 report for the American Hospital Association, while limited in  scope and the proportion of hospitals responding, found that officials at  many hospitals in urban areas described their emergency departments as  operating at or above capacity. While there are no comprehensive studies  on the consequences of crowded conditions, health care researchers and  clinicians report that crowding has multiple effects, including prolonged  pain and suffering for some patients, long patient waits, increased  transport times for ambulance patients, inconvenience and dissatisfaction  for the patients and their families, and increased frustration among  medical staff. In addition to delays in treatment, some emergency  department directors have reported that patient care was compromised  and patients experienced poor outcomes as a result of crowded conditions  in emergency departments.", "Because the medical conditions of patients who come to the emergency  department can range from mild injuries such as ankle sprains to serious  traumas such as from automobile accidents\u2014and can also include patients  with chronic conditions such as asthma or diabetes\u2014the space,  equipment, and medical personnel resources required to treat patients  vary. As a result, there are no specific criteria, such as a ratio of patients to  staff, to define when an emergency department is too crowded and its  providers are overloaded. Rather, emergency department administrators  and physicians say \u201cthey know it when they see it.\u201d In the absence of  specific criteria to define when an emergency department is crowded,  health care researchers suggest using several available indicators to point  to crowded conditions. Based on our review of studies and discussions  with experts, we chose three indicators of emergency department  crowding.

Under federal law, all hospitals that  participate in Medicare are required to screen\u2014and if an emergency  medical condition is present, stabilize\u2014any patient who comes to the  emergency department, regardless of the individual\u2019s ability to pay. Under  certain circumstances where a hospital lacks staffing or facilities to accept  additional emergency patients, the hospital may place itself on  \u201cdiversionary status\u201d and direct en route ambulances to divert to another  hospital. In general, hospitals ask EMS providers to divert ambulances to  other medical facilities because their emergency department staff are  occupied and unable to promptly care for new arrivals or specific services  within the hospitals, such as the intensive care units, are filled and unable  to accommodate the specialized needs of new ambulance arrivals.", "While on diversion, hospitals must still treat any patients who arrive by  ambulance, and in some cases, local community protocols allow  ambulances to go to a hospital that is on diversion when the patient asks  to go to that hospital or if the patient needs immediate medical treatment.  In addition, even while on diversion, the emergency department is still  required to screen and treat nonambulance patients\u2014those patients who  walk in or otherwise arrive at the hospital\u2014and these patients make up  the vast majority of visits to the emergency department. The Department  of Health and Human Service\u2019s (HHS) National Center for Health Statistics  estimates that in 2000 about 14 percent of emergency department visits  were made by patients who arrived by ambulance, while 78 percent of  visits were made by patients who arrived at the emergency department by  \u201cwalking in.\u201d For the remaining visits, the patients were brought in by the  police or social services (1.5 percent), or the mode of arrival was unknown  (6.3 percent).", "As a measure of crowding, diversion has limitations in that some hospitals,  even when crowded, do not have the option to divert ambulances due to  state or local regulations, because there are no other medical facilities  nearby, or because of individual hospital policies. Hospital practices may  vary regarding the threshold at which a hospital goes on diversion. Local  community or hospital policies may also differ regarding the length of time  a hospital may remain on diversion. (See app. II for the local community  policies for the six sites we visited).

Many  factors can contribute to the length of time a patient is boarded in the  emergency department, such as inpatient bed availability, staffing levels,  and the complexity of a patient\u2019s condition. Regardless of the reason,  while waiting for an inpatient bed or transfer, these patients still require  care and take up treatment space, equipment, and staff time in the  emergency department, shrinking the department\u2019s resources available to  treat other emergency patients. A limitation of using boarding as an  indicator is that many hospitals do not collect this information regularly  and can only estimate how often and how long patients board in their  emergency departments.

A limitation  to this indicator is that, because emergency department staff triage  patients, those with nonemergent conditions generally wait the longest  and may be most likely to tire of waiting and leave before a medical  evaluation. However, relatively mild conditions could potentially become  more serious if patients do not receive needed medical care because they  leave the emergency department before being evaluated and treated.

This practice limits a hospital\u2019s ability to meet  periodic spikes in demand. Hospital administrators, clinicians, and health  care researchers report that changes in the hospital economic climate  have contributed to this decline in \u201csurge capacity.\u201d For example, in a  report prepared for the Massachusetts Health Policy Forum, one health  policy researcher noted that the lower occupancy rates of the 1970s and  1980s became unacceptable in the 1990s when hospitals were increasingly  driven by market-based factors. In a market-based system, successful  hospitals run full, attract both elective and emergency patients, and are  staffed closer to average demand than to the peaks.", "Another factor sometimes cited that is related to insufficient bed capacity  involves staffing. Officials at some hospitals we visited said that they did  not staff more of the beds they already had or open new beds because they  were concerned they would not be able to staff them or could not afford  the cost of staffing them. These hospitals cited the costs and difficulties  recruiting nurses, particularly the cost of hiring nurses from agencies that  contract out nursing services.

One reason  that admissions from the emergency department are considered to be less  profitable is because these admissions tend to be for medical conditions,  such as pneumonia, rather than for those procedures that are considered  more profitable. Available data from the Agency for Healthcare Research  and Quality\u2019s (AHRQ) Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, Nationwide  Inpatient Sample, show that of hospital admissions from the emergency  department in 2000, most were for medical conditions (such as pneumonia  and heart failure). Further, 19 of the 20 most prevalent diagnosis related  groups (DRG) for these admissions were for medical conditions. In  contrast, half of the 20 most common DRGs for admissions that were not  from the emergency department were for surgical procedures (such as  orthopedic surgery and cardiac pacemaker implantation).", "Many hospital officials and researchers also said that emergency  department patients are less profitable because a larger proportion of  emergency admissions are patients for whom the primary payer source is  self-pay, which includes the uninsured, or Medicaid, which is generally  considered to provide lower reimbursement. As shown in figure 9,  available data from AHRQ\u2019s Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project show  that the proportion of admissions for uninsured patients or patients with  Medicaid as the primary payer source was higher for admissions from the  emergency department than for routine admissions in 2000. At the same  time, the proportion of admissions with private insurance as the primary  payer source was higher for routine admissions than for patients admitted  from the emergency department. Because self-pay patients and those  covered by Medicaid are viewed as providing lower reimbursement,  hospital officials and health care researchers said that hospitals have a  financial incentive to fill the limited number of available beds with  scheduled admissions rather than emergency department admissions.", "In addition, some hospital officials reported that surgeons bring in  business that generates revenues for the hospital and that hospitals may  not want to cancel or reschedule elective surgeries\u2014and disrupt their  surgeons and patients\u2014in order to make beds available for emergency  department patients.

In  addition, officials at some of the hospitals we visited said they thought that  the availability of physicians and other services, such as psychiatric  services, in their communities affected crowding in one or more instances.  For example, in Cleveland, the county psychiatric mobile health unit  recently stopped taking patients in the late evening and on weekends,  increasing the amount of time the emergency department had to care for  psychiatric patients during those times. One Cleveland hospital we visited  reported that boarding times for patients awaiting assessment by this unit  had increased for patients who arrived late at night."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Wide Range of Activities Under Way to Manage Crowding at Hospitals and in Communities, but Problems Persist", "paragraphs": ["At the six sites we visited, actions to address emergency department  crowding had been taken at both the hospital and community levels.

While our survey found that 59 percent of hospitals reported problems with on-call  specialty coverage, only about 5 percent of hospitals that went on diversion reported that  lack of on-call specialty coverage contributed to diversion to a moderate, great, or very  great extent, and only 7 percent of hospitals that boarded patients reported that problems  with on-call coverage contributed to boarding to a moderate, great, or very great extent. department patients to building new, larger emergency departments.

When patients cannot be moved efficiently through the emergency  department and into inpatient hospital beds, they occupy emergency  department space, staff, and services and reduce the capacity that might  otherwise be available to treat other patients waiting to be seen in the  emergency department. As shown in table 9, hospitals\u2019 approaches to  increase efficiency varied.

The task forces  generally addressed crowding and diversion in three ways: assembling  stakeholders to examine causes, bringing attention to the issue, and  developing methods to manage the problem (see table 10).", "Five of the six sites we visited had developed standard policies or  guidelines regarding diversion and operated or participated in electronic  systems for tracking ambulance diversion. The sixth site we visited\u2014 Miami-Dade County\u2014took a different approach.

In these  locations, diversion systems are used to provide a structure to  systematically try to spread the ambulance volume during times of peak  demand by redirecting ambulances to hospitals that are presumably less  crowded. At three of these sites, EMS agencies produce reports on the  number of hours each hospital was on diversion each month.

In addition, crowding appears to reflect the inability  of individual hospitals to meet the demand for inpatient beds, particularly  critical care and telemetry beds, both from emergency patients who need  to be admitted to the hospital and patients admitted for elective  procedures. When hospitals cannot accommodate peaks in demand, either  because they lack space or because they choose to operate at levels that  allow little excess capacity, the result is that emergency departments will  often board patients who are waiting for inpatient beds. When they do, the  capacity of the emergency department to treat additional patients is  diminished.", "While such issues as concerns about staffing inpatient beds and  availability of other providers in the community are similar across  communities, the solutions may differ by community and local health care  market. For example, one community may face crowding in the emergency  department largely because people have problems accessing physicians  and other providers in the community, and potential solutions could  involve steps to improve access to these other providers or establishing  fast-track systems to treat nonurgent conditions in the emergency  department. Another community may face crowding primarily because  facilities have closed or populations have increased and there are too few  hospital beds staffed and operated in the area. In this situation, the  solution could involve reopening beds in existing facilities that were not  set up and staffed. To address communitywide factors contributing to  crowding, hospitals may need to work collaboratively with other facilities  in their communities. Communitywide efforts such as task forces and  standardized procedures and diversion policies have improved  communications between hospitals and EMS providers and provided some  degree of sharing the load when multiple hospitals are crowded. However,  these efforts appear to only manage the problem of crowded conditions in  emergency departments, rather than eliminate it.", "Adding capacity, for both the emergency departments and for inpatient  beds, has been suggested as a solution, but no one solution is likely to fit  all circumstances. Crowding is clearly worse in some communities and  hospitals than in others, and the specific reasons for crowding need to be  better understood, particularly at the local level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from External Reviewers", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from the American College of Emergency Physicians and  American Hospital Association and an independent reviewer provided  comments on a draft of this report.
