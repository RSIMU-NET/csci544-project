The Department of Defense's (DOD) increased reliance on the private sector for depot maintenance support coupled with downsizing led to a deterioration of depots' capabilities and cost increases. In 2007, the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) directed each service to submit a depot maintenance strategic plan and provided direction for the content of those plans. The 2007 U.S. Navy Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan contained a separate plan for each of five functional areas and an executive summary. GAO used qualitative content analyses to determine the extent to which two of the plans address (1) elements of a results-oriented management framework and (2) OSD's direction for the plan's content. GAO examined the plans for Navy aviation (NAVAIR) and ships (NAVSEA), which account for 94 percent of Navy depot workload."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While the Navy's plans for aviation and shipyard depot maintenance focus efforts on weapon system and equipment availability, they do not fully address the elements of a results-oriented management framework. GAO's prior work has shown that seven elements of a results-oriented management framework are critical for comprehensive strategic planning. The NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans both fully address one of the elements by including mission statements that summarize their depots' major functions and operations, but the plans partially address or do not address the other six elements. For example, even though the plans describe goals for the depots' mission-related functions, they do not specify interim milestones or time frames for achieving the goals. Additionally, the plans include some measurable warfighter support metrics to gauge progress toward achieving the NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans' long-term goals; however, the plans do not describe how these metrics directly correspond to each long-term goal, desired levels for each, or how they will be used to evaluate each goal. Further, the Navy does not have an integrated Navy-wide depot maintenance strategic plan, but instead uses an overarching executive summary that does not have clear linkages to the separate plans and has the weaknesses resulting from the separate plans' missing or limited information on some elements. The NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans do not fully address these concerns because of weaknesses in oversight. Although OSD established an oversight body, which included senior representatives from OSD and the services, to review the services' plans, this body did not review the plans. Also, the Navy did not establish an oversight mechanism to review its plans. The plans' weaknesses may limit the Navy's ability to use its plan as a tool to meet future challenges effectively and efficiently. In addition, the NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans are not fully responsive to OSD's direction to the services that was designed to provide the services with a framework to meet future challenges. OSD directed the services to address 10 specific issues in four general areas: logistics transformation, core logistics capability assurance, workforce revitalization, and capital investment. Both plans partially address 8 of these issues and do not address the remaining 2. For example, both plans discuss management approaches for integrating public- and private-sector depot sources, but the plans are silent with regard to integrating joint, interservice, or multinational depot capabilities. The plans do not discuss the methods for estimating the amount of workload or the projected effects on depot workload caused by weapon system retirements and locating weapon systems at specific installations. The plans do not fully respond to OSD's direction for the plans' content in part because of weaknesses in oversight in both OSD and the Navy. As a result, these weaknesses could additionally limit the Navy's efforts to posture and resource its depots to meet future maintenance challenges."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Navy\u2019s 11 maintenance depots provide equipment repair and  sustainment services that are critical to supporting ongoing operations  around the world.

Downsizing efforts also affected the depots\u2019 abilities to obtain  investments in facilities, equipment, and human capital to support their  long-term viability and to ensure that they remained a key resource for  repair of new and modified systems. In 2001, DOD identified performance- based logistics as its preferred support strategy, further increasing  reliance on contractors to support many of its weapon systems.", "In 2003 and again in 2006, the House Armed Services Committee  encouraged DOD to develop a comprehensive depot maintenance  strategy. In March 2007, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for  Acquisition, Technology and Logistics (OUSD ) issued DOD\u2019s depot  maintenance strategic plan, which articulated the department\u2019s strategy  for posturing and resourcing the depots to meet the national security and  management challenges of the 21st century. In March 2007, the Office of  the Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Logistics and Materiel  Readiness, within OUSD (AT&L), directed each of the services to conduct  strategic planning for depot maintenance and submit plans that focus on  achieving DOD\u2019s strategy. In response, the Navy published its December  2007 U.S. Navy Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan, which consists of an  overarching executive summary and the individual depot maintenance  plans developed by the following Navy commands and centers: (1) the  Naval Sea Systems Command (NAVSEA), (2) the Naval Air Systems  Command (NAVAIR), (3) the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, (4) the  Naval Surface Warfare Center, and (5) the Space and Naval Warfare  Systems Command. According to Navy officials, together these five  documents and updates issued in 2009 collectively respond to OUSD  (AT&L)\u2019s direction. DOD\u2019s 2007 Depot Maintenance Strategy and  Implementation Plans also notes that the services would update their  depot maintenance strategic plans no later than 6 months after the  publication of an updated DOD depot maintenance strategic plan, which  will be published within 6 months of the publication of the February 2010  Quadrennial Defense Review Report.", "Our prior work has shown that organizations conducting strategic  planning\u2014as the Navy is doing for its maintenance depots\u2014need to  develop a comprehensive, results-oriented management framework to  remain operationally effective, efficient, and capable of meeting future  requirements. Such a framework includes seven critical elements: a  comprehensive mission statement; long-term goals; strategies to achieve  the goals; use of metrics to gauge progress; identification of key external  factors that could affect the achievement of the goals; a discussion of how  program evaluations will be used; and stakeholder involvement in  developing the plan. In its March 2007 call for strategic plans, OUSD  (AT&L) directed the services to address many of these elements in their  strategic plans. In addition, OUSD (AT&L) directed the services to address  10 specific issues in four general areas: logistics transformation, core  logistics capability assurance, workforce revitalization, and capital  investment. OUSD (AT&L) officials told us that the direction in these four  areas was designed to provide the services\u2019 plans with a framework to  meet future challenges.", "In September 2009, we issued a report on the Army\u2019s and Marine Corps\u2019  depot maintenance strategic plans. Subsequently, your office asked us to  review the Air Force\u2019s and Navy\u2019s depot maintenance strategic plans to  determine the extent to which the latter plans provided a comprehensive  strategy for meeting future requirements. In May 2010, we issued a report  on the Air Force depot maintenance strategic plan. As agreed with your  office, this report addresses two questions: (1) To what extent does the  Navy\u2019s depot maintenance strategic plan address key elements of a results- oriented management framework? and (2) To what extent does the Navy\u2019s  depot maintenance strategic plan address OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s direction that  was designed to provide a framework for the services to meet future  challenges? The Related GAO Products section at the end of the report  lists additional publications on related topics.", "We used the same set of methodological procedures to answer both  questions, and each type of procedure was performed simultaneously for  the two questions. Specifically, we reviewed the December 2007 U.S. Navy  Depot Maintenance Strategic Plan. Because the Navy does not have a  single Navy-wide plan, but rather a family of strategic planning documents,  we focused our review on plans developed by the two commands whose  maintenance depots collectively are responsible for 94 percent of the  Navy\u2019s depot maintenance workload. The two plans are NAVAIR\u2019s Naval  Aviation Industrial Strategy and NAVSEA\u2019s Naval Shipyard Business  Plan. We reviewed the 2007 NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans and their 2009  updates. We evaluated the NAVAIR and NAVSEA plans using qualitative  content analyses to compare information from them against criteria both  from the seven elements of a results-oriented management framework  and the 10 issues listed in the OUSD (AT&L) direction for depot  maintenance strategic plans. To conduct these analyses, we first  developed a data-collection instrument that incorporated these two types  of criteria. One team member then analyzed the plans using this  instrument. To verify the preliminary observations from this initial  analysis, a second team member concurrently conducted an independent  analysis of the plans. We compared the two sets of observations and  discussed any differences. We reconciled the differences with the  assistance of analysts from the team that was evaluating the Air Force  depot maintenance strategic plan. We met with Navy officials to confirm  our understanding of the plans and sought additional information where  our preliminary analyses revealed that one or both plans partially address  or do not address the criteria. We also interviewed and obtained  documentary evidence from relevant OUSD (AT&L) officials regarding its  oversight of the services\u2019 plans. Additionally, we interviewed depot leaders  and strategic planning personnel at three of the seven NAVAIR and  NAVSEA depots to obtain first-hand information on issues the depots face.  We also analyzed depot-level and servicewide depot maintenance data  such as workload, personnel, and depot capacity utilization and  determined that these data were sufficiently reliable for our report. More  detailed information on our scope and methodology is provided in  appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2009 through June 2010  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.

These Fleet Readiness Centers and Naval Shipyards are  responsible for over 94 percent of the Navy\u2019s depot maintenance  workload. Table 1 describes the location, principal work, workload, and  personnel for NAVAIR and NAVSEA depots.", "Depot maintenance activities are complex and require deliberate planning  in order to efficiently and effectively meet future requirements. Our prior  work has shown that organizations, like Navy depots, need sound strategic  management planning in order to identify and achieve long-range goals  and objectives. We have identified critical elements that should be  incorporated into strategic plans to establish a comprehensive, results- oriented management framework. A results-oriented management  framework provides an approach whereby program effectiveness is  measured in terms of outcomes or impact, rather than outputs, such as  activities and processes. Approaches to such planning vary according to  agency-specific needs and missions, but our work suggests that,  irrespective of the context in which planning is done, such a strategic plan  should contain the following elements:  1.  Mission statement: A statement that concisely summarizes what the  organization does, presenting the main purposes for all its major  functions and operations.  2.  Long-term goals: A specific set of policy, programmatic, and  management goals for the programs and operations covered in the  strategic plan. The long-term goals should correspond to the purposes  set forth in the mission statement and develop with greater specificity  how an organization will carry out its mission.  3.  Strategies to achieve the goals: A description of how the goals  contained in the strategic plan and performance plan are to be  achieved, including the operational processes; skills and technology;  and the human, capital, information, and other resources required to  meet these goals.  4.  Use of metrics to gauge progress: A set of metrics that will be applied  to gauge progress toward attainment of each of the plan\u2019s long-term  goals.  5.  External factors that could affect goals: Key factors external to the  organization and beyond its control that could significantly affect the  achievement of the long-term goals contained in the strategic plan.  These external factors can include economic, demographic, social,  technological, or environmental factors, as well as conditions or events  that would affect the organization\u2019s ability to achieve its strategic  goals.  6.  Evaluations of the plan to monitor goals and objectives: Assessments,  through objective measurement and systematic analysis, of the manner  and extent to which programs associated with the strategic plan  achieve their intended goals.  7.  Stakeholder involvement: Consideration of the views and  suggestions\u2014solicited during the development of the strategic plan\u2014 of those entities potentially affected by or interested in the  organization\u2019s activities.", "In addition to our work on strategic planning, recent legislation has  focused attention on DOD\u2019s and the military departments\u2019 maintenance  strategies and plans.

In 2003, we reported that DOD faced  significant management challenges in succession planning to maintain a  skilled workforce at its depot maintenance facilities. Among other  challenges, we reported that relatively high numbers of civilian workers at  maintenance depots were nearing retirement age. DOD\u2019s Depot  Maintenance Strategy and Implementation Plans makes a similar point.  It states that DOD\u2019s depot maintenance community, like the rest of the  federal government, faces increasing numbers of retirements as the \u201cbaby  boom\u201d generation reaches retirement eligibility. It goes on to state that the  retirement-eligible population within the depot maintenance workforce  and forecasted annual retirements are expected to increase annually for  the remainder of the decade. This dynamic\u2014coupled with the highly  skilled nature of some depot maintenance work and the length of time  required to train new employees\u2014creates hiring, training, and retention  challenges.

An OUSD (AT&L) official mentioned  that NAVSEA\u2019s citing of the 6 percent capital investment should be seen as  addressing the benchmark issue.

Both plans discuss an  infrastructure-investment prioritization process but do not describe the  method for prioritizing needed investments. In addition, the NAVAIR and  NAVSEA plans do not present quantitative data on the projected funding  (or shortfalls) for facilities and equipment, despite both plans noting  infrastructure shortfalls and funding limitations.

Key steps in modernizing facilities are articulating  investment priorities, quantifying shortfalls, and discussing how these  shortfalls may affect accomplishing strategic goals.", "Capital investment in DOD depots has been an issue of concern in our  prior work. For example, in 2001, we reported that capital investments in  depot facilities and plant equipment had declined sharply in the mid-1990s  as a result of defense downsizing, depot closures and consolidations, and  DOD\u2019s plan to increase its reliance on the private sector for logistics  support of new weapon systems.  As a result of DOD\u2019s lack of capital  investment, its depots did not keep up with the latest technologies. In  subsequent years, funding levels increased as the services recognized the  need to modernize their depots. As with any business, modernizing and  refurbishing plant and equipment for optimal operating efficiency, as well  as acquiring new capabilities and cutting-edge technologies linked to new  workloads, are important to the future viability of the military depots.

Further, DOD\u2019s  Depot Maintenance Strategy and Implementation Plans states that (1)  each service will conduct depot maintenance strategic planning that  focuses on achieving the DOD depot maintenance strategy and (2) the  DOD strategy will ensure that DOD is postured to meet the national  security and materiel readiness challenges of the 21st century. However,  NAVAIR\u2019s and NAVSEA\u2019s plans do not provide a comprehensive, results- oriented management framework to efficiently and effectively guide the  Navy\u2019s future actions, nor do they fully respond to OUSD (AT&L)\u2019s  direction that was designed to provide a framework for the services to  overcome four general areas of future challenges. Furthermore, focusing  on the development of separate command-level plans and an executive  summary, rather than a single Navy-wide plan, may have made it more  difficult to determine where additional information was needed to address  the elements and issues at the servicewide level. Another primary reason  for not correcting weaknesses in the plans is that OUSD (AT&L) and Navy  do not have effective oversight mechanisms in place to promptly identify  the weaknesses, communicate weaknesses to the plan developers, monitor  the revision of the plans to ensure that the weaknesses have been  addressed, and determine whether goals are being achieved. These  weaknesses in content, linkage, and oversight resulted in a missed  opportunity to identify a more complete Navy-wide vision for the effective  and efficient operation of its depots in the future. For example, had  NAVSEA and NAVAIR identified and implemented a systematic program  evaluation and a thorough set of metrics to directly assess goal  achievement, they and the Navy overall would have additional tools for  reacting in a timely manner to potential issues and challenges in executing  the strategies. Most importantly, integration of the plans could have  resulted in the Navy having more assurance that its depots are viably  positioned and have the maintenance workforce, equipment, facilities, and  funds they need to meet current and future requirements. On a closing  note, we previously made a recommendation to OUSD (AT&L) to develop  and implement procedures to (1) review revisions of the depot  maintenance strategic plan to ensure they fully address all key elements of  a results-oriented management framework, (2) explicitly address any  OUSD (AT&L) direction for the plans, and (3) periodically assess progress  and corrective actions to the extent needed in meeting the plans\u2019 goals.

To conduct these analyses, we first developed a data- collection instrument that incorporated these two types of criteria. One  team member then analyzed the plans using this instrument. To verify  preliminary observations from this initial analysis, a second team member  concurrently conducted an independent analysis of the plans. We  compared observations of the two analysts and discussed any differences.  We reconciled the differences with the assistance of analysts from the  team that was evaluating the Air Force depot maintenance strategic plans.  We subsequently met with Navy officials to confirm our understanding of  the plans and sought additional information where our preliminary  analyses revealed that the plans partially address or do not address the  criteria. We also interviewed and obtained documentary evidence from  relevant OUSD (AT&L) officials regarding the office\u2019s oversight of the  services\u2019 plans.
