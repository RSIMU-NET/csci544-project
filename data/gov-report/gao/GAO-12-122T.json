Loans outstanding for the emergency programs peaked at more than $1 trillion in late 2008. The Federal Reserve Board directed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (FRBNY) to implement most of these emergency actions. In a few cases, the Federal Reserve Board authorized a Reserve Bank to lend to a limited liability corporation (LLC) to finance the purchase of assets from a single institution. In 2009 and 2010, FRBNY also executed large-scale purchases of agency mortgage-backed securities to support the housing market. The Reserve Banks, primarily FRBNY, awarded 103 contracts worth $659.4 million from 2008 through 2010 to help carry out their emergency activities. A few contracts accounted for most of the spending on vendor services. For a significant portion of the fees, program recipients reimbursed the Reserve Banks or the fees were paid from program income. The Reserve Banks relied more extensively on vendors for programs that assisted a single institution than for broad-based programs. Most of the contracts, including 8 of the 10 highest-value contracts, were awarded noncompetitively, primarily due to exigent circumstances. These contract awards were consistent with FRBNY's acquisition policies, but the policies could be improved by providing additional guidance on the use of competition exceptions, such as seeking as much competition as practicable and limiting the duration of noncompetitive contracts to the exigency period. FRBNY took steps to manage conflicts of interest for its employees, directors, and program vendors, but opportunities exist to strengthen its conflict policies. In particular, FRBNY expanded its guidance and monitoring for employee conflicts, but new roles assumed by FRBNY and its employees during the crisis gave rise to potential conflicts that were not specifically addressed in the Code of Conduct or other FRBNY policies. As the Federal Reserve System considers revising its conflict policies given its new authority to regulate certain nonbank institutions, GAO recommended it consider how potential conflicts from emergency lending could inform any changes. FRBNY managed vendor conflict issues through contract protections and actions to help ensure compliance with relevant contract provisions, but these efforts had limitations. While the Federal Reserve System took steps to mitigate risk of losses on its emergency loans, opportunities exist to strengthen risk management practices for future crisis lending. The Federal Reserve Board approved program terms and conditions designed to mitigate risk of losses and one or more Reserve Banks were responsible for managing such risk for each program. Reserve Banks required borrowers under several programs to post collateral in excess of the loan amount. For programs that did not have this requirement, Reserve Banks required borrowers to pledge assets with high credit ratings as collateral. For loans to specific institutions, Reserve Banks negotiated loss protections with the private sector and hired vendors to help oversee the portfolios that collateralized loans. While the Federal Reserve System took steps to promote consistent treatment of eligible program participants, it did not always document processes and decisions related to restricting access for some institutions. GAO made seven recommendations to the Federal Reserve Board to strengthen policies for managing noncompetitive vendor selections, conflicts of interest, risks related to emergency lending, and documentation of emergency program decisions. The Federal Reserve Board agreed that GAO's recommendations would benefit its response to future crises and agreed to strongly consider how best to respond to them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["My statement today is based on our July 2011 report.

For example, we reviewed the  external auditor\u2019s key audit documentation including audit strategy,  planning, and accounting memoranda; internal control and account balance  testing audit procedures and results; and summary memoranda. We  evaluated the quality of this documentation against relevant auditing  standards. To evaluate the Reserve Banks\u2019 policies and practices for the  use, selection, and payment of vendors, we analyzed Reserve Banks\u2019  acquisition policies and guidance, vendor contracts, and vendor payment  information. To evaluate the effectiveness of Reserve Bank polices and  practices for managing conflicts of interest, we reviewed relevant Reserve  Bank policies, including FRBNY\u2019s Code of Conduct, and relevant statutory  prohibitions on conflicts of interest that apply to federal government and  Federal Reserve System employees and federal government guidance for  agencies\u2019 management of employee conflicts of interest. To assess the  effectiveness of security and collateral policies in place to mitigate risk of  losses, we reviewed relevant documentation to identify key features of  security and collateral policies and determine how these policies were  designed to mitigate risk of losses for each emergency program. We  obtained and analyzed documentation of steps taken by the Reserve  Banks to develop risk governance structures and practices needed to  manage the risks associated with the emergency programs. To examine  the extent to which program implementation resulted in consistent and  equitable treatment of eligible participants, we reviewed and analyzed  documentation of the basis for the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s decisions  about which types of institutions would be eligible to participate in the  emergency programs. To determine the extent to which the Reserve Banks  offered the same terms and conditions to all participants, which for some  programs included financial institutions affiliated with Reserve Bank  directors, we reviewed documentation of program terms and conditions and  obtained and analyzed program transaction data. For parts of our  methodology that involved the analysis of computer-processed data, we  assessed the reliability of these data and determined that they were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Each Reserve Bank is a federally chartered  corporation with a board of directors. The Federal Reserve Act authorizes  the Reserve Banks to make discount window loans, execute monetary  policy operations at the direction of the FOMC, and examine bank holding  companies and member banks under rules and regulations prescribed by  the Federal Reserve Board, among other things.", "The Federal Reserve Board and the Reserve Banks are self-funded  entities that deduct their expenses from their revenue and transfer the  remaining amount to Treasury. Federal Reserve System revenues  transferred to Treasury have increased substantially in recent years,  chiefly as a result of interest income earned from the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s large-scale emergency programs. To the extent that Reserve  Banks suffer losses on emergency loans, these losses would be  deducted from the excess earnings transferred to Treasury.", "Between late 2007 and early 2009, the Federal Reserve Board created  more than a dozen new emergency programs to stabilize financial  markets and provided financial assistance to avert the failures of a few  individual institutions. The Federal Reserve Board authorized most of this  emergency assistance under emergency authority contained in section  13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. Three of the programs covered by this  review\u2014the Term Auction Facility, the dollar swap lines with foreign  central banks, and the Agency Mortgage-Backed Securities Purchase  Program\u2014were authorized under other provisions of the Federal Reserve  Act that do not require a determination that emergency conditions exist,  although the swap lines and the Agency MBS program did require  authorization by the FOMC. In many cases, the decisions by the Federal  Reserve Board, the FOMC, and the Reserve Banks about the  authorization, initial terms of, or implementation of the Federal Reserve  System\u2019s emergency assistance were made over the course of only days  or weeks as the Federal Reserve Board sought to act quickly to address  rapidly deteriorating market conditions. FRBNY implemented most of  these emergency activities under authorization from the Federal Reserve  Board. In a few cases, the Federal Reserve Board authorized FRBNY to  lend to a limited liability corporation (LLC) to finance the purchase of  assets from a single institution. The LLCs created to assist individual  institutions were Maiden Lane, Maiden Lane II, and Maiden Lane III. In  2009, FRBNY, at the direction of the FOMC, began large-scale purchases  of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) issued by the housing government- sponsored enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, or guaranteed by  Ginnie Mae. Purchases of these agency MBS were intended to provide  support to the mortgage and housing markets and to foster improved  conditions in financial markets more generally.

The assistance provided to individual  institutions was generally secured by existing assets that either belonged  to or were purchased from the institution, its subsidiaries, or  counterparties. The Reserve Banks did not have sufficient expertise  available to evaluate these assets and therefore used vendors to do so.  For example, FRBNY used a vendor to evaluate divestiture scenarios  associated with the assistance to AIG. It also hired vendors to manage  assets held by the Maiden Lanes. For the broad-based emergency  programs, FRBNY hired vendors primarily for transaction-based services  and collateral monitoring. Under these programs, the Reserve Banks  purchased assets or extended loans in accordance with each program\u2019s  terms and conditions.

During the crisis, FRBNY expanded its guidance and  monitoring for employee conflicts. However, while the crisis highlighted the  potential for Reserve Banks to provide emergency assistance to a broad  range of institutions, FRBNY has not yet revised its conflict policies and  procedures to more fully reflect potential conflicts that could arise with this  expanded role. For example, specific investment restrictions in FRBNY\u2019s  Code of Conduct continue to focus on traditional Reserve Bank  counterparties\u2014depository institutions or their affiliates and the primary  dealers\u2014and have not been expanded to further restrict employees\u2019  financial interests in certain nonbank institutions that have participated in  FRBNY emergency programs and could become eligible for future ones, if  warranted.

The Federal Reserve Board\u2019s broad-based  programs launched in late 2008 and early 2009 employed more novel  lending structures to provide liquidity support to a broader range of key  credit markets. These later broad-based liquidity programs included Asset- Backed Commercial Paper Money Market Mutual Fund Liquidity Facility,  Commercial Paper Funding Facility, Money Market Investor Funding  Facility, and Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility. These liquidity  programs, with the exception of the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan  Facility, did not require overcollateralization. To help mitigate the risk of  losses, the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, as well as the  programs that did not require overcollateralization, accepted only highly- rated assets as collateral. In addition, Commercial Paper Funding Facility,  Money Market Investor Funding Facility, and Term Asset-Backed  Securities Loan Facility incorporated various security features, such as the  accumulation of excess interest and fee income to absorb losses, to  provide additional loss protection. Also, for the assistance to specific  institutions, the Reserve Banks negotiated loss protections with the  institutions and hired vendors to help oversee the portfolios collateralizing  loans. For each of the Maiden Lane transactions, FRBNY extended a  senior loan to the LLC and this loan was collateralized by the portfolio of  assets held by the LLC.
