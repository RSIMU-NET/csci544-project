In these cases, DOD acquires commercial  SATCOM bandwidth through several competitively selected vendors,  who are responsible for operating and sustaining their own systems.", "Military SATCOM architectures fall into three types: protected, which provides secure, assured communications; wideband, which supports worldwide capacity for high data rate  communications, including high-quality voice and imagery; and narrowband, which provides reliable and secure communications less  vulnerable to adverse weather conditions or other physical limitations,  such as distance, dense foliage, and terrain.", "DOD\u2019s primary wideband satellite communications system, WGS,  currently provides a portion of DOD\u2019s required SATCOM bandwidth, but  the Air Force estimates its satellite constellation\u2019s capabilities will begin to  degrade in the late 2020s. The Air Force is adding at least one more  satellite to the WGS constellation and plans for an enhanced WGS-11 to  provide the capacity of two satellites.

According to the Air  Force, there is potential for adding a 12th WGS satellite to the  constellation.", "Like other types of space systems, DOD\u2019s wideband SATCOM systems  generally involve four types of interrelated segments that make a space  capability fully functional. As illustrated in figure 1, they include (1) the  space segment\u2014namely the satellites; (2) the ground segment, with  network services and also including satellite and payload control systems  and data processing subsystems and facilities; (3) user equipment, such  as radios, terminals, and routers needed by the warfighter to use the  capability; and (4) launch vehicles and facilities.", "Within the space segment, satellites operate in several different types of  orbits to meet different communication and mission needs, as shown in  figure 2. The orbital location of a satellite can affect its capacity to  transmit data, or what parts of the Earth can receive its signal. For  example, highly elliptical orbits are necessary for providing long dwell  times over northern latitudes due to the curvature of the Earth, while other  orbits cover remaining latitudes.", "Wideband satellites operate in different radio frequency spectrum bands.  DOD typically relies on C, X, Ku, and Ka-bands to provide wideband  connectivity, determined by where and how users are operating. Each of  these frequency bands has advantages and disadvantages for various  applications. Satellite transponders operating at the lower C-band  frequencies are less susceptible to degradation from rain than other  bands. In the United States, the X-band is specifically designated for use  by the U.S. government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The  Ku-band operates at higher frequencies and can communicate with  smaller antennas and offer more flexibility. The still-higher-frequency Ka- band satellites can transmit more data than C, X, and Ku-band satellites,  but their signals are more susceptible to degradation from water vapor  and rain than satellites in lower frequency bands.

In particular, both the Air Force and Defense  Information Systems Agency recommended that DOD adapt to changing  business models, especially for managed services in commercial  SATCOM, in which DOD would purchase SATCOM services but would  not own or manage the systems and data rates. Changing business  models could also include greater coordination with the SATCOM  industry, so DOD can better incorporate commercial technology into  future systems. The Defense Information Systems Agency also  recommended that DOD pursue an alignment of common types of user  terminals and SATCOM architectures.

Consequently, the AOA study  team assessed alternatives that would expand DOD\u2019s use of emerging  commercial technologies.

In March 2019, DOD  established the Space Development Agency to unify and integrate  efforts across DOD to define, develop, and field innovative satellite  solutions, including communications. The Space Development  Agency is focused on a low-Earth-orbit constellation to provide  communications and other satellite-based operational support for  DOD, which could also provide information for selecting a post-WGS  architecture. As of this time, DOD has not determined how this new  organization will mesh with the Air Force Space and Missile Systems  Center that acquires satellite systems; the Defense Advanced  Research Projects Agency, which creates breakthrough technologies  and capabilities; and similar organizations within the department."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Wideband AOA\u2019s recommendations for gathering additional  information to reduce risk and inform DOD\u2019s decision-making are good  first steps to ensure any post-WGS architecture will effectively and  efficiently meet DOD\u2019s needs. The addition of one or two more WGS  satellites provides some extra time for DOD to field new satellites, avoid  capability gaps, and implement the AOA recommendations. However, given the typical 7-year development timelines for space systems, DOD  will need to decide on a way forward within the next several years so that  new satellites will be available when needed. Attempting to implement the  Wideband AOA recommendations without developing a plan for guiding  multiple knowledge-building efforts across DOD raises risk that  information gaps will not be closed in time to be useful or not closed at all.  Consequently, it is important for DOD to coordinate these efforts and  focus on how best to obtain a future wideband architecture that provides  critical communications for military operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["The Secretary of Defense should ensure that the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment develop and implement a plan  to guide and coordinate efforts to implement the Wideband AOA  recommendations to support timely, informed decisions on its next  wideband satellite communications architecture.

Investigate the impacts of WGS SV 11/12 to ground infrastructure,  mission management, and user terminals to understand necessary  modifications.  3.  Develop and implement a DOD Enterprise Satellite Communications  (SATCOM) Terminal Strategy that targets an approved Joint  Information Environment architecture, reduces complexity of terminal  diversity and programmatic governance, facilitates rapid  modernization, and drives innovating business reforms, optimizing  cost, schedule, and performance and interoperability.  4.  Fund a purpose-built capability post-WGS SV 11/12 meeting user  demands, including all weather capabilities, with a recommended start  in fiscal year 2020, including consideration of alternate orbital regimes  and approaches to cost-effectively meet needs while addressing  proliferation, protection, and resiliency. The purpose is to ensure  availability of DOD SATCOM resources to meet requirements where  anticipated commercial offerings fail to materialize or are insufficient.  5.  Continue efforts to invest in and shape commercial capabilities to  support future DOD needs, including protection features, resilience,  contested and all-weather capabilities, and polar coverage.  Additionally, invest in and shape commercial industry development  and risk reduction efforts focused on cybersecurity, terminal  militarization/weapon system integration, management and control,  technology assessment and development, and spectrum access.  6.  Continue to fund existing and new SATCOM risk reduction efforts,  evaluate blended commercial/military constellations, and expand the  scope of pilots to include development of architectural standards and  interface controls for enterprise management and control, terminal  recapitalization plans, and means for terminals and/or weapon system  platforms to transition satellite constellations and any DOD managed  services.  7.  Fund the design and implementation of a prototype wideband  enterprise SATCOM management and control capability based on an  approved Joint Information Environment architecture that integrates  the management of Military, Commercial, and International Partner- provided SATCOM services and networks and supports the  Enterprise Operational Management requirement in the Joint Space  Communications Layer Initial Capabilities Document Change 1.  8.  Plan for investment in Protected Tactical Waveform capabilities to  commercial and military band terminals to align with the Protected  Anti-Jam Tactical SATCOM planned ground and space milestones.  9.  Fund pilot efforts to identify risks and opportunities to use  commercially-managed services for Army\u2019s Combat Support Logistics  Very Small Aperture Terminals and ways to mitigate that risk.  10.
