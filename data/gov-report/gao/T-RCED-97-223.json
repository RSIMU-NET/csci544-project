The first annual performance plans, covering fiscal year 1999, are to be provided to the Congress after the President\u2019s budget is submitted to the Congress in January or February 1998.

In May 1997, the Chief of the Forest Service announced that the plan would be delayed for approximately 10 more months to ensure that it fully reflects the most appropriate paths and priorities to care for the land and provide benefits for the American people. He continued that during this period, the Forest Service will conduct additional analysis related to a number of important issues.

The May 1997 plan combines the first two strategic goals in the draft RPA plan into a single goal of restoring and protecting ecosystems, and it retains the other two draft RPA goals (providing multiple benefits for people within the capabilities of ecosystems and ensuring organizational effectiveness).", "Each of the three long-term strategic goals in the May 1997 plan is subdivided into objectives that the Forest Service believes are quantifiable and can be linked to the current budget structure. For example, the strategic goal of restoring and protecting ecosystems has been subdivided into objectives for aquatic, forestland, and rangeland ecosystems; for National Forest System lands and waters; and for threatened, endangered, and sensitive species. Similarly, the strategic goal of providing multiple benefits for people within the capabilities of ecosystems has been subdivided into objectives for specific multiple uses, such as outdoor recreation, wilderness, forage, timber, and mineral resources."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Forest Service Has Not Given Adequate Attention to Improving Its Performance", "paragraphs": ["Madam Chairman, let me briefly discuss why it is important to hold the Forest Service accountable for its performance.", "Our report on the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making identifies an organizational culture of indifference toward accountability. The agency\u2019s decentralized management and recently increased flexibility in shifting funds within a simplified budget structure have not been accompanied by sufficient accountability for expenditures and performance. The result is inefficiency and waste.", "For example, according to a November 1995 internal Forest Service report, inefficiencies within the agency\u2019s decision-making process cost up to $100 million a year at the individual project level alone. These costs are not borne by the Forest Service, but by the American taxpayer, since the agency accomplishes fewer objectives with its yearly appropriations.", "Moreover, as we pointed out in our report and in our April 29, 1997, testimony on the Forest Service\u2019s process for revising the Tongass National Forest plan, the increased costs of inefficiency at every decision-making level within the Forest Service should be measured not only in dollars but also in lost ecological and economic opportunities. A deteriorated aquatic or riparian ecosystem cannot be restored and the critical habitat of an endangered species cannot be protected until a decision is made. Similarly, a livestock grazing permit cannot be renewed and a timber sale cannot be offered until the agency reaches a decision. However, the most likely outcomes of the Forest Service\u2019s current decision-making process are indecision and delay.", "Delays in finalizing forest plans, coupled with delays in finalizing agencywide regulations and reaching individual project decisions, can total a decade or longer. For example, the agency spent almost 10 years revising the Tongass forest plan, and preparing a timber sale usually takes another 3 to 8 years. As a result, those who are economically dependent on the national forests are precluded from forming reasonable expectations about the future availability of the forests\u2019 uses. In addition, the forests\u2019 health and productivity over time\u2014whether measured by the diversity of species, the availability of commodities, or any other indicators of performance\u2014are affected by the missed opportunities for improvement.", "Past efforts by the Forest Service to improve its performance have been stymied by the organization\u2019s highly decentralized management. At every level, managers have considerable autonomy and discretion for interpreting and applying the agency\u2019s policies and directions. For example, in response to congressional concerns about the Forest Service\u2019s inability to deliver what is expected or promised, the Chief, in the fall of 1991, formed an agencywide task force to review the issue of accountability. The task force\u2019s 1994 report set forth a process and recommended changes to strengthen accountability.

The strategic goals in the Forest Service\u2019s plan reflect (1) an ongoing shift in emphasis under the agency\u2019s broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate from consumption (primarily producing timber) to conservation (primarily sustaining wildlife and fish) and (2) a significant change in the way the Forest Service considers and manages natural resources (from managing primarily along administrative boundaries to analyzing environmental issues and concerns along the boundaries of natural systems, such as aquatic, forestland, and rangeland ecosystems and the habitats of threatened, endangered, and sensitive species). The increasing emphasis on conservation and ecosystem management conflicts with the agency\u2019s older emphasis on producing timber and other commodities and will likely constrain future uses of the national forests, such as recreation.", "The Forest Service has been aware for some time of the controversy surrounding its increasing emphasis on conservation and ecosystem management and the likely effects of these changes in its management on the types, levels, and mixes of legislatively mandated uses on the national forests. These issues surfaced immediately after the Forest Service conducted a briefing in January 1996 on its October 1995 draft RPA plan (which includes the same strategic goals as the agency\u2019s May 1997 plan). The day after the briefing, the Chairman of the Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Lands, House Committee on Resources, and the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Forests and Public Land Management, Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, wrote to the Secretary of Agriculture stating, among other things, that (1) the justification for the plan was \u201cwoefully inadequate,\u201d (2) the plan represented an abandonment of the agency\u2019s multiple use and sustained yield principles, (3) the Chairmen would not endorse the goals contained in the draft plan, and (4) the final plan would require substantial changes to address their concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Forest Service\u2019s Plan Does Not Adequately Address Many Critical Components", "paragraphs": ["We recognize that Agriculture\u2019s final plan\u2014which will include the Forest Service\u2019s plan\u2014is not due to the Congress and OMB until September 30, 1997, and that the Results Act anticipates that the final plan will be continually refined as future planning cycles occur. We also recognize that a strategic plan is dynamic and that Forest Service, Agriculture, OMB, and congressional staff are continuing to revise the draft. However, given both the importance of strategic goals to the successful implementation of the act and the disagreement over the goals in the Forest Service\u2019s plan, we believe that the agency should have taken the opportunity presented by the act to consult with the Congress to better articulate its positions on controversial issues. Specifically, the Forest Service should have set forth (1) its rationale for emphasizing some legislatively mandated uses on the national forests more than other uses, (2) the logic underlying its reliance on ecosystem management, and (3) the likely effects of its policy choices on the types, levels, and mixes of multiple uses on its lands.", "The Forest Service seems to recognize the importance of reaching agreement on its strategic goals to the successful implementation of the act. For example, as the agency was drafting its plan, the Chief commented on a draft of our decision-making report, stating that (1) clarifying the agency\u2019s mission was one of the Forest Service\u2019s \u201chighest priorities,\u201d (2) the agency was taking actions to clarify its long-term strategic goals, and (3) the Forest Service intends to use the Results Act to articulate these \u201cmission principles.\u201d However, the May 1997 plan does less than the draft RPA plan to articulate the rationale for the agency\u2019s strategic goals and management approach. Furthermore, the May 1997 plan is silent on the likely effects of the goals and management approach on the legislatively mandated multiple uses on the national forests.", "In addition, we believe that the Forest Service\u2019s May 1997 plan falls short of adequately addressing critical components required by the Results Act, especially in identifying key external factors that could affect achievement of the plan\u2019s strategic goals and objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "A Comprehensive Agency Mission Statement and Agencywide Long-Term Strategic Goals", "paragraphs": ["The May 1997 plan captures the Forest Service\u2019s broad multiple-use and sustained-yield mandate, stating that the agency\u2019s mission is to \u201cachieve quality land management under sustainable multiple use management concepts to meet the diverse needs of the land and people.\u201d This mission allows the agency to be all things to all people. However, the Forest Service is increasingly unable to avoid, resolve, or mitigate conflicts among competing uses on national forests by separating them among areas and over time. As a result, the agency must make hard policy choices concerning which of the competing multiple uses to emphasize and how to resolve conflicts or make choices among these uses on its lands.", "The multiple-use laws which guide the management of the nation\u2019s forests provide little guidance for the Forest Service in resolving conflicts among competing uses. Often, the emphasis that the agency gives to particular uses responds to factors supplementing these acts, such as requirements in planning and environmental laws and their judicial interpretations. For example, section 7 of the Endangered Species Act represents a congressional design to give greater priority to the protection of endangered and threatened species than to the current primary missions of the Forest Service and other federal agencies. When proposing a project, the Forest Service bears the burden of demonstrating that its actions will not likely jeopardize listed species.", "The strategic goals included in the plan reflect hard policy choices that the Forest Service has made among competing uses. For example, in his April 21, 1997, written comments on a draft of our decision-making report, the Chief of the Forest Service stated that: \u201cSimply stated, the Forest Service believes that without first securing the health, diversity, and productivity of the land, we  simply cannot meet the needs of people.\u201d Hence, the goals are controversial.

Early in our review of the Forest Service\u2019s decision-making, agency officials voiced concern about the many external factors that affect the outcomes of the agency\u2019s decisions and can prevent the Forest Service from achieving its objectives. These factors include changes in natural conditions and in funding, as well as new information and events, such as the listing of a species as endangered or threatened. Because these factors can have such an important effect on its accomplishments and are largely beyond its ability to control, the Forest Service has proposed removing from its forest plans measurable objectives for goods and services, such as quantities of wood for lumber and forage for livestock and numbers of opportunities for recreation. However, the Forest Service discussed none of these external factors in its draft plan.", "Forest Service officials identified differences in the requirements of numerous planning and environmental laws, enacted primarily during the 1960s and 1970s, and differing judicial interpretations of the same statutory requirements that make it difficult for the agency to predict when any given decision can be considered final and can be implemented. This uncertainty reduces the agency\u2019s ability to achieve its objectives. In addition, as we emphasized in our April 29, 1997, testimony on revising the Tongass forest plan, disagreements with federal regulatory agencies over the best approaches to achieving environmental objectives and implementing laws and regulations have also delayed forests plans and projects.
