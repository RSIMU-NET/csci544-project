CMS oversees the effectiveness of state surveys through the federal monitoring survey program. In this program, federal surveyors in CMS's regional offices either independently evaluate state surveys by resurveying a home (comparative surveys) or directly observe state surveyors during a routine nursing home survey (observational surveys). GAO was asked to evaluate the information federal monitoring surveys provide on understatement and the effectiveness of CMS management and oversight of the survey program. To do this, GAO analyzed the results of federal monitoring surveys for fiscal years 2002 through 2007, reviewed CMS guidance for the survey program, and interviewed headquarters and regional office officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["A substantial proportion of federal comparative surveys identify missed deficiencies at the potential for more than minimal harm level or above. During fiscal years 2002 through 2007, about 15 percent of federal comparative surveys nationwide identified state surveys that failed to cite at least one deficiency at the most serious levels of noncompliance--actual harm and immediate jeopardy. Overall, nine states missed serious deficiencies on 25 percent or more of comparative surveys; in seven states federal surveyors identified no such missed deficiencies. During the same period, missed deficiencies at the lowest level of noncompliance--the potential for more than minimal harm--were more widespread: nationwide, approximately 70 percent of federal comparative surveys identified state surveys missing at least one deficiency at the lowest level of noncompliance, and in all but five states the number of state surveys with such missed deficiencies was greater than 40 percent. Undetected care problems at this level are a concern because they could become more serious if nursing homes are not required to take corrective action. The most frequently missed type of deficiency on comparative surveys, at the potential for more than minimal harm level and above, was poor quality of care, such as ensuring proper nutrition and hydration and preventing pressure sores. Federal observational surveys highlighted two factors that may contribute to understatement of deficiencies: weaknesses in state surveyors' (1) investigative skills and (2) ability to integrate and analyze information collected to make an appropriate deficiency determination. These factors may contribute to understatement because they directly affect the appropriate identification and citation of deficiencies. CMS has taken steps to improve the federal monitoring survey program, but weaknesses remain in program management and oversight. For example, CMS has improved processes to ensure that comparative surveys more accurately reflect conditions at the time of the state survey, such as requiring that comparative surveys occur within 30 working days of the state survey rather than within the 2 months set in statute. Despite these improvements, the management and oversight potential of the program has not been fully realized. For example, CMS has only begun to explore options for identifying understatement that occurs in cases where state surveys cite deficiencies at too low a level, for possible implementation in fiscal year 2009. In addition, CMS is not effectively managing the federal monitoring survey database to ensure that the regional offices are entering data accurately and reliably--CMS was unaware, for example, that a considerable number of comparative surveys had not been entered. Furthermore, CMS is not using the database to oversee consistent implementation of the program by the regional offices--for example, the agency is not using the database to identify inconsistencies between comparative and observational survey results."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1998, Congress has focused considerable attention on the need to  improve the quality of care for the nation\u2019s 1.5 million nursing home  residents, a highly vulnerable population of elderly and disabled  individuals for whom remaining at home is no longer feasible.

About 1 in 5 homes nationwide were cited for such serious  deficiencies on state inspections, known as surveys, in fiscal year 2007  (see app. I). Our previous work, however, demonstrated that state surveys  sometimes understated the extent of serious care problems and that  federal oversight of state survey activities had weaknesses.  Understatement can occur when a state surveyor fails to cite a deficiency  altogether or cites a deficiency at too low a level.", "The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is the federal agency  responsible for ensuring the effectiveness of state surveys.

You asked us to look at the understatement of serious  deficiencies by state surveyors nationwide. In this report we address two  questions: (1) what information do federal monitoring surveys provide  about understatement nationwide, and (2) how effective are CMS  management and oversight of the federal monitoring survey program?", "To answer the first question, we analyzed the results of comparative and  observational surveys nationwide for fiscal years 2002 through 2007 using  the federal monitoring survey database. During this period, federal  surveyors conducted 976 comparative surveys and 4,023 observational  surveys. To identify understatement on comparative surveys, we focused  our analysis on cases where federal surveyors determined that state  surveyors should have cited a deficiency but failed to do so or where state  surveyors cited a deficiency at too low a level. We analyzed the results of  observational surveys in order to better understand why understatement  might occur. Deficiencies identified during nursing home surveys are  categorized according to their scope (i.e., the number of residents  potentially or actually affected) and severity (i.e., the degree of relative  harm involved). Homes with deficiencies at the A though C levels are  considered to be in substantial compliance, while those with deficiencies  at the D through L levels are considered out of compliance. (See table 1.)  Throughout this report, we refer to deficiencies at the actual harm and  immediate jeopardy levels as serious deficiencies.", "To ensure reliability of the federal monitoring survey database, we  discussed data entry procedures with all 10 CMS regional offices, whose  staff enter information into the database. In addition, we conducted  several data reliability tests, including (1) automated checks of data fields  to ensure that they contained complete information and (2) manual  reviews of a random sample of all deficiencies cited by federal but not  state surveyors to ensure that federal surveyors had used the data fields  appropriately. We also eliminated a small number of deficiencies that did  not correspond to a defined severity level or contained illogical survey  dates\u2014such as a comparative survey that began prior to the state survey.  Based on these activities, we determined that the information was  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. Data on comparative surveys,  however, cannot be used to project the extent of understatement across all  state surveys because the state surveys selected for federal monitoring  surveys are not representative of all nursing home surveys or survey teams  within each state.", "To answer the second question, we reviewed CMS guidance for the federal  monitoring survey program and interviewed officials in CMS headquarters  and all 10 regional offices. Our work focused on CMS\u2019s (1) efforts to  improve the use of comparative surveys as an oversight tool; (2) ability to  track the understatement of deficiencies; and (3) management of the  federal monitoring survey database, including the use of the database to  oversee regional office implementation of the federal monitoring survey  program. We also analyzed (1) the comments entered into the federal  monitoring survey database by federal surveyors for certain discrepancies  between federal and state survey findings and (2) the consistency between  comparative and observational survey results within states and CMS  regional offices.

In contrast to a  standard survey, a complaint investigation generally focuses on a specific  allegation regarding a resident\u2019s care or safety and provides an  opportunity for state surveyors to intervene promptly if problems arise  between standard surveys.

Such sanctions include fines known as  civil money penalties, denial of payment for new Medicare or Medicaid  admissions, or termination from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.", "State surveys that miss serious deficiencies or cite deficiencies at too low  a scope and severity level have enforcement implications because a  nursing home may escape sanctions intended to discourage repeated  noncompliance. For example, facilities that receive at least one G through  L level deficiency on successive standard surveys or complaint  investigations must be referred for immediate sanctions. In addition, CMS  guidance calls for higher fines when a home has a poor compliance history  and requires that state survey teams revisit a home to verify that serious  deficiencies have actually been corrected (such revisits are not required  for most deficiencies cited below the actual harm level\u2014A through F)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Oversight of State Surveys", "paragraphs": ["Statutorily required federal monitoring surveys, which are conducted  annually in at least 5 percent of state-surveyed Medicare and Medicaid  nursing homes in each state, are a key CMS oversight tool in ensuring the  adequacy of state surveys.

Federal surveyors located in regional offices conduct federal monitoring  surveys. The surveys can be either comparative or observational, with  each offering unique advantages and disadvantages as an oversight tool.  For example, an advantage of comparative surveys is that they are an  independent evaluation of a nursing home recently surveyed by a state  survey agency team. A disadvantage is that the time lag between the two  surveys can make analysis of differences difficult.", "Comparative survey. A federal survey team conducts an independent  survey of a home recently surveyed by a state survey agency in order to  compare and contrast the findings. This comparison takes place after  completion of the federal survey. When federal surveyors identify a  deficiency not cited by state surveyors, they assess whether the deficiency  existed at the time of the state survey and should have been cited by  entering either yes or no to the question, \u201cBased on the evidence available  to the , should the  team have cited this ?\u201d  This assessment is critical in determining whether understatement  occurred because some deficiencies cited by federal surveyors may not  have existed at the time of the state survey. For example, a deficiency  identified during a federal survey could involve a resident who was not in  the nursing home at the time of the earlier state survey. By statute,  comparative surveys must be conducted within 2 months of the  completion of the state survey. However, differences in timing, resident  sample selection, and staffing can make analysis of differences between  the state and federal comparative surveys difficult. On the basis of our  prior recommendations, CMS has taken several steps to ensure that  comparative surveys more accurately capture conditions at the time of the  state survey. For example, CMS now calls for the length of time between  the state and federal surveys to be between 10 and 30 working days and  requires federal surveyors conducting a comparative survey in a nursing  home to include at least half of the state survey\u2019s sample of residents from  that nursing home in the comparative survey sample, making it easier to  determine whether state surveyors missed a deficiency. Furthermore,  federal comparative survey teams are expected to mimic the number of  staff assigned to the state survey. CMS also issued guidance in October  2002 defining the criteria for federal surveyors to consider when selecting  facilities for comparative surveys. These selection criteria can generally  be categorized as state survey team performance and facility  characteristics. Regional offices were given latitude in their use of these  criteria and may supplement them with other selection factors unique to  their regions. For example, some regions use statistics on the prevalence  of pressure sores in a nursing home\u2019s resident population as a comparative  survey selection factor.", "Observational survey. Federal surveyors accompany a state survey team  to a nursing home to evaluate the team\u2019s on-site survey performance and  ability to document survey deficiencies. State teams are evaluated in six  areas\u2014Concern Identification, Sample Selection, General Investigation,  Food-Borne Illness Investigation, Medication Investigations, and  Deficiency Determination\u2014and are rated in one of five categories for each  of the six measures. The rating categories\u2014from highest to lowest\u2014are  extremely effective, very effective, satisfactory, less than satisfactory, and  much less than satisfactory. CMS annual state performance reviews  require that state survey teams achieve an average rating of satisfactory.  Observational surveys allow federal surveyors to provide more immediate  feedback to state surveyors and to identify state surveyor training needs.  However, observational surveys are not independent evaluations of the  state survey. Because state surveyors may perform their survey tasks more  attentively than they would if federal surveyors were not present,  observational surveys may not provide an accurate picture of state  surveyors\u2019 typical performance.

For example, the agency issued written  guidance defining a standard process for resolving disagreements and a  new manual to increase consistency across observational surveys.", "The 976 federal comparative surveys conducted from fiscal year 2002  through 2007 ranged from as few as 10 in Vermont, which has about   40 facilities, to as many as 49 in California, which has about 1,300 facilities.

For example,  CMS is uncertain whether regions should only focus on differences that  would raise the scope and severity level to actual harm or immediate  jeopardy and not assess differences for understatement that occurs at  lower scope and severity levels."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Could More Effectively Manage the Federal Monitoring Survey Database and Use It for Regional Office Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis found that CMS headquarters was not effectively managing  the federal monitoring survey database or using the database to oversee  consistent implementation of the federal monitoring survey program by  regional offices. While CMS uses data from comparative and  observational surveys to provide feedback to state survey agencies during  state performance reviews, CMS officials told us that they recognized the  need to improve their management and use of the database for better  oversight of the agency\u2019s 10 regional offices.", "We identified two problems in CMS\u2019s management of the federal  monitoring survey database. CMS was not aware that (1) the results of a  considerable number of comparative surveys were missing from the  database and (2) the validation question for missed deficiencies was being  used by some regional offices to identify scope and severity differences,  contrary to CMS guidance.", "Missing data. In October 2007, we identified missing comparative surveys  for two regional offices dating back to 2005 and asked CMS to follow up  with officials in those regions. At least one of the regions had completed  the surveys but had failed to upload them into the national database. We  also found that CMS had not included data in the federal monitoring  survey database from 162 contractor-led comparative surveys conducted  between fiscal years 2004 and 2007.", "Use of validation question contrary to CMS guidance. Some regional  offices were using the missed deficiency validation question to make  determinations about whether scope and severity differences constituted  understatement, making it difficult to distinguish between missed  deficiencies and scope and severity understatement. In addition, we found  that the regional office answer to the validation question was not always  consistent with the information recorded in the comment box.", "Similarly, we identified weaknesses in CMS\u2019s use of the database for  regional office oversight. For example, CMS was not (1) examining  comparative survey data to ensure that regional offices comply with CMS  guidance intended to ensure that comparative surveys more accurately  capture the conditions at the time of the state survey and (2) using the  database to identify inconsistencies between comparative and  observational survey results.", "Ensuring regional office compliance. While CMS has provided  guidance to its regional offices to help ensure that comparative surveys  more accurately capture the conditions at the time of the state survey, the  agency is not fully using available data to ensure that the regional offices  implement the agency\u2019s guidance. For example, we found that the length  of time between state and comparative surveys varied broadly by CMS  region. In 2007, the average time gap ranged from a low of 15.4 working  days (22.5 calendar days) in the Boston region to a high of 38.5 working  days (54.4 calendar days) in the New York region. Furthermore, while   78 percent of comparative surveys from fiscal year 2003 through 2007  followed CMS\u2019s guidance to include at least half of the residents from state  surveys\u2019 investigative samples, 22 percent of comparative surveys did not  meet this threshold. Finally, when we contacted officials in CMS  headquarters to ask clarifying questions about the data variables needed to  conduct these analyses, the headquarters officials were not familiar with a  number of the variables and referred us to a CMS staff person in one of the  regional offices. Together, these three examples suggest that CMS is not  effectively using the data to hold regional offices accountable for  implementing guidance.", "Identify inconsistencies between comparative and observational  results. CMS officials told us that they have begun to explore regional  office differences in less than satisfactory ratings for state survey teams on  observational surveys. However, CMS officials told us that they do not  plan to use the database to identify inconsistencies between comparative  and observational surveys that may warrant follow-up to ensure that  regional offices are adhering to CMS guidance and consistently assessing  state surveyor performance. For example, some states that performed  below the national average in identifying serious deficiencies on  comparative surveys received above-average marks on observational  survey measures for Deficiency Determination and General Investigation.  Wyoming\u2019s 33.3 percent rate for surveys with missed serious deficiencies  was more than double the national average of about 15 percent for surveys  conducted during fiscal years 2002 and 2007. Yet Wyoming never received  a below satisfactory rating on its General Investigation or Deficiency  Determination measures during 18 observational surveys over that same   6-year period. We found similar inconsistencies in the results of federal  monitoring surveys for South Dakota and a few other states. Although  inconsistencies between comparative and observational surveys may not  necessarily indicate a problem, they may warrant investigation. For  example, in a small state like Wyoming it is likely that comparative and  observational surveys have evaluated the same group of state surveyors.  Further, Wyoming and South Dakota are two of six states whose federal  monitoring surveys are conducted by CMS\u2019s Denver regional office. Of the  140 observational surveys conducted from fiscal year 2002 through 2007,  federal surveyors from the Denver regional office gave one below  satisfactory rating on the Deficiency Determination measure. That   0.7 percent rate of below satisfactory performance was more than four  times lower than the regional office with the next-lowest percentage\u2014the  Chicago regional office\u2014which awarded below satisfactory ratings to   3.3 percent of state survey teams it observed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With about 1 in 6 comparative surveys concluding that state survey teams  had missed a serious deficiency or understated its scope and severity level,  it is evident that state survey agency performance limits the federal  government\u2019s ability to obtain an accurate picture of how often nursing  home residents face actual harm or are at risk of serious injury or death.  These missed serious deficiencies most frequently involved Quality of  Care, reflecting shortcomings in fundamental provider responsibilities  such as ensuring proper nutrition and hydration, accident prevention, and  preventing pressure sores. Observational survey results also underscore  problems state surveyors may face in identifying facility deficiencies;  about 1 in 11 state survey teams nationwide were rated as below  satisfactory by CMS surveyors on the Deficiency Determination measure.", "We found that comparative survey data may mask the true extent of  understatement because CMS\u2019s current protocol does not require regional  offices to track in the federal monitoring survey database when state  surveyors cite lower-than-appropriate scope and severity levels. As we  conducted our work, CMS officials recognized this problem and in  October 2007 began to experiment with a pilot program to measure  understated scope and severity. However, at the conclusion of the pilot,  scheduled for fiscal year 2008, CMS may decide not to implement a  validation question for all scope and severity differences. We believe it is  important to assess differences for understatement that occurs at the   D through L levels\u2014potential for more than minimal harm, actual harm,  and immediate jeopardy.", "We also found that CMS was not effectively managing the federal  monitoring survey database to ensure that regional offices were entering  data in a timely and consistent fashion. Lack of accurate and reliable data  hinders effective oversight. For example, we found that the database was  missing a considerable number of comparative surveys. Further, CMS has  not used the federal monitoring survey database to its full potential as an  oversight tool. For example, CMS is not fully using data on comparative  surveys to ensure that regional offices are implementing guidance  intended to improve federal monitoring surveys. Although CMS\u2019s Survey  and Certification Group assumed control of the database in January 2007,  headquarters staff often referred us to CMS regional office staff to answer  specific database questions, suggesting a lack of familiarity with the  organization and content of the database. In addition, agency officials told  us that they do not plan to follow up on inconsistencies between  comparative and observational survey results that could indicate  weaknesses in how regional offices evaluate state surveyors\u2019 performance.  Identifying and following up on such inconsistencies could help ensure  database reliability and hold regional office officials accountable for their  implementation of the federal monitoring survey program, a program  required by statute."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To address weaknesses in CMS\u2019s management of the federal monitoring  survey database that also affect the agency\u2019s ability to effectively track  understatement, we recommend that the Administrator of CMS take the  following two actions:    Require regional offices to determine if there was understatement when  state surveyors cite a deficiency at a lower scope and severity level than  federal surveyors do and to track this information in the federal  monitoring survey database.", "Establish quality controls to improve the accuracy and reliability of  information entered into the federal monitoring survey database.", "To address weaknesses that affect CMS\u2019s ability to oversee regional office  implementation of the federal monitoring survey program, we recommend  that the Administrator of CMS take the following two actions:    Routinely examine comparative survey data and hold regional offices  accountable for implementing CMS guidance that is intended to ensure  that comparative surveys more accurately capture the conditions at the  time of the state survey.", "Regularly analyze and compare federal comparative and observational  survey results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on our draft report, HHS indicated that it fully  endorsed and would implement our four recommendations intended to  strengthen management and oversight of the federal monitoring survey  program.

HHS\u2019s comments are reproduced in appendix VI.", "The majority of HHS\u2019s comments focused on its strategic approach to  improving oversight: (1) ensuring that all nursing homes are surveyed at  least once every 15 months, (2) improving surveyor understanding of  federal quality requirements through improved guidance and training,   (3) increasing the consistency of state surveys through the introduction of  a new nursing home survey methodology, and (4) improving the use of  data generated by federal monitoring surveys. Many of these strategies aim  to address the underlying causes of understatement, the topic of a  forthcoming GAO report. HHS also noted that limitations in the Medicare  survey and certification budget underscore the agency\u2019s need to target  resources effectively to maximize results. For example, HHS indicated that  the implementation of the new survey methodology will be dependent on  the level of funding in the overall survey and certification budget through  fiscal year 2014. Survey and Certification funding is the subject of another  forthcoming GAO report.", "Two of HHS\u2019s observations merit further discussion. First, HHS noted that  understatement that arises from a lack of understanding or confusion  about federal requirements would generally not be detected through  federal monitoring surveys because both federal and state surveyors  would be affected by the same limitation. We believe that the consistency  with which federal surveys have identified serious deficiencies missed by  state surveyors from fiscal year 2002 through 2007\u2014about 15 percent, on  average\u2014suggests that federal surveyors have a better understanding of  CMS quality requirements than do state surveyors. We have previously  reported that the limited experience level of state surveyors because of the  high turnover rate was a contributing factor to deficiency  understatement.", "Second, HHS questioned our use of \u201cone missed deficiency per survey\u201d as  a measure of understatement. We believe that this standard is appropriate  for serious deficiencies that result in harm or immediate jeopardy   (G through L level) because the goal of state surveys should be to identify  and require nursing homes to address all such deficiencies. CMS itself uses  this standard during annual state performance reviews. We also used this  standard to describe the proportion of comparative surveys that identified  missed deficiencies at the potential for more than minimal harm level   (D through F). Identifying and requiring nursing homes to correct such  deficiencies is important because if uncorrected they have the potential to  become more serious. Compared to missed serious deficiencies, we found  that understatement of potential for more than minimal harm deficiencies  was more widespread\u2014about 70 percent of comparative surveys identified  at least one state survey with such missed deficiencies. The number of  state surveys with missed deficiencies at the D through F level was greater  than 40 percent in all but five states, and state surveys selected for  comparative surveys failed to identify an average of 2.5 deficiencies in this  range per survey. In short, the magnitude of understatement at the  potential for more than minimal harm level should be a cause for concern.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as  appropriate.", "As arranged with your offices, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after its  issue date.
