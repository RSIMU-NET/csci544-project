Information about where and why such crashes occur is important in reducing this toll, both for identifying particular hazards and for planning safety efforts at the state and federal levels. Differences in the quality of state traffic data from state to state, however, affect the usability of data for these purposes. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) administers a grant program to help states improve the safety data systems that collect and analyze crash data from police and sheriff's offices and other agencies, and the Congress is considering whether to reauthorize and expand the program. The Senate Appropriations Committee directed GAO to study state systems and the grant program. Accordingly, GAO examined (1) the quality of state crash information, (2) the activities states undertook to improve their traffic records systems and any progress made, and (3) NHTSA's oversight of the grant program."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["States vary considerably in the extent to which their traffic safety data systems meet recommended criteria used by NHTSA to assess the quality of crash information. These criteria relate to whether the information is timely, consistent, complete, and accurate, as well as to whether it is available to users and integrated with other relevant information, such as that in the driver history files. GAO reviewed systems in 9 states and found, for example, that some states entered crash information into their systems in a matter of weeks, while others took a year or more. While some systems were better than others, all had opportunities for improvement. States reported carrying out a range of activities to improve their traffic safety data systems with the grants they received from NHTSA. Relatively little is known about the extent to which these activities improved the systems, largely because the documents submitted to NHTSA contained little or no information about what the activities accomplished. The states GAO reviewed used their grant funds for a variety of projects and showed varying degrees of progress. These efforts included completing strategic plans, hiring consultants, and buying equipment to facilitate data collection. NHTSA officials said their oversight of the grant program complied with the statutory requirements, but for two main reasons, it does not provide a useful picture of what states were accomplishing. First, the agency did not provide adequate guidance to ensure that states provided accurate and complete data on what they were accomplishing with their grants. Second, it did not have an effective process for monitoring progress. The agency has begun to take some actions to strengthen oversight of all its grant programs. If the Congress decides to reauthorize the program, however, additional steps are needed to provide effective oversight of this particular program. GAO also noted that in proposing legislation to reauthorize the program, one requirement was omitted that may be helpful in assessing progress--the requirement for states to have an up to date assessment of their traffic data systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Automobile crashes exact an enormous personal and economic toll on this  country. In 2003, 42,643 people died in automobile crashes in the United  States, and nearly 2.9 million more were seriously injured. In 2000, the most  recent year for which cost estimates are available, the economic cost of  fatalities and injuries from crashes totaled almost $231 billion. Reducing  this toll requires making informed decisions about safety problems. Traffic  safety data, which are compiled from police accident reports completed at  the scene of crashes and assembled largely at the state level, are key to  making these decisions. The states and the federal government use data  from state-level crash data systems to make many roadway-related  spending and policy decisions, ranging from deciding to fix particular  roadways to launching major national safety campaigns, such as preventing  alcohol-impaired driving or increasing seat belt use. There is known  variability in the quality of information in state traffic data systems, and  these differences impact the usefulness of data for these purposes.", "When the Congress was considering reauthorizing various transit and  highway programs earlier this year, both the House and Senate proposed  bills that would have expanded the section \u201c411 grant program,\u201d which was  initially authorized in the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century  (TEA-21). The 411 grant program was designed specifically to help states  improve their traffic safety data systems and provided states with $36  million over 6 years. The House and Senate proposals would have  authorized a similar grant program with a budget authority of up to $270  million over 6 years. However, an 8-month extension of TEA-21 was  passed on September 30, 2004, extending current highway and transit  programs through May 2005 when both bills may be reintroduced.", "The Senate Appropriations Committee Report accompanying the  Department of Transportation Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2004 (S.  1589) directed us to conduct a survey of state traffic safety data systems.  The committee also asked us to report on the extent to which the 411 grant  program has led to improvements in these systems. The grant program is  overseen by the Department of Transportation\u2019s (DOT) National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which has established six criteria  for assessing such systems when states request guidance from NHTSA.  Four criteria relate to the information itself (timeliness, consistency,  completeness, and accuracy); two relate to the use of the information  (accessibility to users and links to other related data). Accordingly, this  report examines (1) the quality of state crash information; (2) the activities  states undertook using 411 grant funds to improve their traffic safety data  systems, and the progress they made using the grant funds; and (3)  NHTSA\u2019s oversight of the grant program, including what changes in  oversight, if any, might help encourage states to improve their traffic data  systems and ensure accountability under a reauthorized program.", "To provide information on the quality of state crash data and state efforts to  improve these data, we conducted site visits, analyzed available traffic  safety data, and reviewed grant documentation. Using several criteria, we  selected 9 states to visit for detailed reviews and assessed the status of  their data systems on the basis of NHTSA\u2019s six quality criteria for crash  information. Eight of these 9 states had participated in the 411 grant  program. To identify variations in data structure and quality, we also  analyzed crash data for 17 states that currently participate in NHTSA\u2019s State  Data System (SDS) program. Finally, we reviewed the grant  documentation submitted by the 48 states that participated in the 411 grant  program, including grant applications, traffic records assessments,  strategic plans, progress reports, and highway safety plan annual  evaluation reports. To provide information about NHTSA\u2019s oversight of the  program, we interviewed NHTSA officials responsible for oversight and  administration and reviewed NHTSA guidance and policy. We conducted  our review from January 2004 through October 2004 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. See appendix I for  more details regarding our objectives, scope, and methodology. Because an  examination of data quality was one of the objectives of this report, we also  conducted an assessment of data reliability. A more complete discussion of  data reliability can be found in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Traffic safety data are the primary source of knowledge about crashes and  how they are related to the traffic safety environment, human behavior, and  vehicle performance. Most states have developed traffic safety data  systems and manage these data through the initial reporting of crashes by  law enforcement officers through data entry and analysis. Figure 1, which  is based on NHTSA\u2019s Traffic Records Highway Safety Program Advisorydepicts a model state traffic safety data system, including the collection  and submission of data, the processing of these data into state safety data  systems, and the potential uses for quality crash information. These data  are often not housed in a single file or on just one computer system;  however, users should have access to crash information in a useful form  and of sufficient quality to support the intended use.", "At the state level, state agencies use traffic safety data to make highway  safety planning decisions and to evaluate the effectiveness of programs,  among other uses. In those states where quality crash data on a range of  crashes are not available, officials use federal data such as that from  NHTSA\u2019s Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) to make programming  decisions. FARS data, while useful for some purposes, are limited because  they only include information about fatal crashes, thus preventing decision  making based on a range of crash severity or the entirety of a state\u2019s crash  situation. At the federal level, NHTSA provides guidelines,  recommendations, and technical assistance to help states improve their  crash data systems and is responsible for overseeing state highway safety  programs. Under TEA-21, NHTSA awarded $935.6 million in highway  safety incentive grants to improve safety. In 2003, NHTSA made improving  traffic safety data one of the agency\u2019s highest priorities.", "Since the early 1980s, NHTSA has been obtaining crash data files from  states, which in turn have been deriving the data from police crash reports.  These statewide crash data files are referred to as the SDS program.  Participation by states is voluntary, with 27 states currently participating.  These data include some of the basic information for the analyses and data  collection programs that support the NHTSA mission of identifying and  monitoring traffic safety problems.", "One of NHTSA\u2019s grant programs was specifically aimed at improving traffic  safety data. Administered through its 10 regional offices around the  country, the program provided about $36 million to states for improving  their crash data systems. This grant program was authorized under TEA-21  and was known as the \u201c411 grant program\u201d after the relevant section of the  U.S. Code. NHTSA administers a number of other grant programs besides  the 411 grant program; however, it was the only incentive grant program  that was specifically directed at improving state traffic safety data  systems. The grant program required states to establish a foundation for  improving their traffic safety data systems by first completing three  activities:", "Establish a coordinating committee of stakeholders to help guide and  make decisions about traffic safety data: The committee would ideally  include stakeholders from agencies that manage the various data files  (e.g., representatives from the state department of transportation  responsible for roadway information, and from the state department of  motor vehicles responsible for the management of vehicle licensing  information).", "Conduct an assessment of the current system: The assessment would  evaluate a state\u2019s system by identifying strengths and weaknesses and  providing a baseline from which the state could develop its strategic  plan to address data system needs.", "Develop a strategic plan that prioritizes traffic safety data system  needs and identifies goals: The strategic plan is to provide the \u201cmap\u201d  specifying which activities should be implemented in order to achieve  these goals. As with the assessment, the focal point for developing the  strategic plan, if a state did not already have one, would be the  coordinating committee.", "The level of funding available to a state was dependent on whether states  had already put these requirements in place. Additionally, states were  required to contribute matching funds of between 25 and 75 percent,  depending on the year of the grant. Three types of grants were awarded:", "A state received a start-up grant if it had none of the three requirements  in place. This was a one-time grant of $25,000.", "A state received an initiation grant if it had established a coordinating  committee, had completed or updated an assessment within the  previous 5 years, and had begun to develop a strategic plan. This grant  was a one-time grant of $125,000, if funds were available.", "A state received an implementation grant if it had all three  requirements in place and was positioned to make specific  improvements as indicated in its strategic plan. This grant was at least  $250,000 in the first year and $225,000 in subsequent years, if funds were  available.", "The Congress has extended TEA-21 until May 2005, and new House and  Senate bills will likely be introduced during the next congressional session.  The most recent House and Senate bills under consideration, which were  not passed in the 2004 session, included proposals to reauthorize the 411  grant program in a similar, but not identical, form to the original program.  The proposals included funding up to $270 million, which is over six times  the original funding amount. They also included (1) additional  requirements for documentation from states describing how grant funds  would be used to address needs and goals in state strategic plans and (2) a  requirement that states demonstrate measurable progress toward  achieving their goals. The proposals, however, did not include one of the  original program requirements\u2014that states have an assessment of their  traffic safety data systems that is no more than 5 years old when they  applied for the grant."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Quality of Data Systems Varied Greatly, with All States Examined Showing a Need for Improvement", "paragraphs": ["The 9 states we examined in detail varied considerably in the extent to  which their traffic safety data systems met NHTSA\u2019s recommended criteria  for the quality of crash information. NHTSA\u2019s six criteria (shown in table 1  below, along with an explanation of each criterion\u2019s significance) appear in  the agency\u2019s Traffic Records Highway Safety Program Advisory, the guide  used by NHTSA when it carries out traffic records assessments at the  request of state officials. These assessments are a technical assistance tool  offered to state officials to document state traffic safety data activities,  note strengths and accomplishments, and offer suggestions for  improvement. In addition, NHTSA released the report Initiatives to  Address Improvement of Traffic Safety Data in July 2004, which  emphasized these data quality criteria and provided recommendations to  states. We examined all six criteria for the 9 case-study states, and our  review of 17 states that participated in NHTSA\u2019s SDS program provided  additional information for three of these six criteria. None of the 9 states  in our case-study review met all six criteria, and most had opportunities for  improvement in many of the criteria. The sections below discuss each  criterion.  data available. Data processing times for the 9 states ranged from less than  1 month in 2 states to 18 months or more in 2 others. For example, to  develop their 2005 highway safety plans during 2004, 4 of the 9 states used  data from 2000, 2001, or 2002, and the remaining 5 states used 2003 data.  (See fig. 2.)", "For 6 of the 9 states, three factors accounted for their not meeting the  timeliness criterion: slow data entry, data integration delays, and lengthy  data edits. As a result, the state safety plans are unable to take recent crash  trends into account in these states. Generally, those states submitting data  electronically from local law enforcement agencies to the state traffic  safety data system had much faster entry of crash information into  centralized databases. In contrast, states that processed reports manually  by keying in information from paper forms at the state level had longer data  entry time frames. The availability of data was also sometimes delayed by  inefficient data completion processes. In states where this is not done  automatically, crash data and location information are often manually  entered into the traffic safety data system. In addition, checks for accuracy  also delayed data availability. For example, 1 of the states that had to use  data from 2000 to develop its highway safety plan, had used electronic  methods to enter more recent data, but detailed edit checks delayed the  data\u2019s release considerably."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consistency: Data Were Not Consistent Across States, Even for Basic Information", "paragraphs": ["Seven of the 9 states we visited had crash forms that could be used to  collect data across all jurisdictions within the state, helping to ensure that  data collected within the state are consistent. However, no state had forms  that met all of the consistency criteria recommended in the Model  Minimum Uniform Crash Criteria (MMUCC) guidelines that were  developed collaboratively by state and federal authorities. These guidelines  provide a recommended minimum set of data elements to be collected for  each crash, including a definition, attributes, and the rationale for  collecting each element. While variation in the crash data collected by  states can be attributed to varying information needs, guidelines help to  improve the reliability of information collected and also assist in state-to\u00ad state comparisons and national analyses. The variation between states can  be seen among the 17 states we analyzed that contribute to NHTSA\u2019s SDS  program. For example, the MMUCC guidelines recommend reporting on  whether alcohol was a factor in the crash by indicating the presence or  absence of an alcohol test, the type of test administered, and the test  results. However, several of the states collected information on impaired  driving without specifying the presence of an alcohol test, the test type, or  the test result; thereby making it difficult to determine whether alcohol-use  contributed to the crash. In addition, the states were not uniform in  collecting and reporting the VIN, another element recommended in the  MMUCC. A VIN is a unique alphanumeric identifier that is applied to each  vehicle by the manufacturer. The VIN allows for an effective evaluation of  vehicle design characteristics such as occupant protection systems. As  figure 3 shows, data about VINs were not available for all 17 states in  crashes for any year between 1998 and 2002. For example, although every  state had submitted crash data for 1998 and 1999, crash data for 6 of the 17  states did not include VINs.", "The lack of consistency limits the use of state crash data for most  nationwide analyses. For example, in a recent National Center for Statistics  and Analysis (NCSA)Research Note on child safety campaigns, only 3  states met the criteria to be included in the analysis, not nearly enough data  to statistically represent the nation. The criteria necessary for inclusion in  the report included collecting data on all vehicle occupants, including  uninjured occupants, and VINs for the relevant years (1995-2001). If state  systems matched the MMUCC, they would include this information.  Similarly, only 5 states qualified for use in a NCSA analysis of braking  performance as part of the New Car Assessment Program because only  these states collected VINs and had the necessary variables for the years  involved in the study.", "There is evidence that as states redesign their crash forms, they are  following the MMUCC guidelines more closely. Remaining differences from  the suggested guidelines often reflect the needs of individual states. Among  the 9 states we visited, 5 had redesigned their crash forms since 1997. All 5  used the guidelines as a baseline, although each of them tailored the form  to a degree. One state, for example, collected no data about the use of seat  belts for uninjured passengers, while another chose to collect additional  state-specific attributes, such as describing snow conditions (e.g., blowing  or drifting). Among the remaining 4 states we visited, 2 states are currently  using the MMUCC guidelines to redesign their forms."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Completeness: Gaps Existed in the Completeness of Reporting", "paragraphs": ["One factor affecting the degree of completeness is state reporting  thresholds\u2014that is, standards that local jurisdictions use to determine  whether crash data should be reported for a particular crash. These  thresholds include such things as the presence of fatalities or injuries or the  extent of property damage. Although all 9 of the states we visited had  reporting thresholds that included fatalities and injuries, the thresholds for  property damage varied widely. For example, some states set the property  damage threshold at $1,000, while 1 state did not require reporting of  property-damage-only crashes. In addition, it was not possible to determine  the extent that all reportable crashes had been included in the traffic safety  data system. Officer discretion may play a role. For example, capturing  complete documentation of a crash event is often a low priority when  traffic safety data are not perceived as relevant to the work of the law  enforcement officer or other public safety provider. In 1 state, for example,  the police department of a major metropolitan area only reported crashes  involving severe injuries or fatalities, although the state\u2019s reporting  threshold included damage of $1,000 or more.", "Variation in thresholds among states is not the only factor that affects the  completeness of crash data. For the crash information that does make it  into the state database, there are often gaps in the data, as we learned from  evaluating the records of 17 states participating in NHTSA\u2019s SDS program.  For 5 of these states, we analyzed data coded \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201cmissing\u201d for  24 data elements. The percentage of data coded as unknown or missing  was frequent for several key data elements, such as the VIN; the results of  alcohol or drug testing; and the use of seat belts, child car seats, and other  restraint devices. For example, the percentage of data coded as unknown  or missing for the use of seat belts and other restraints ranged between 1.5  and 54.8 percent for 4 of the 5 states. Such data can be inherently difficult  to collect.For example, when officers arrive at the scene of a crash,  drivers and passengers may already be outside their vehicles, making it  impossible to know if they were wearing seat belts. Asked if they were  wearing a seat belt, those involved in the crash may not tell the truth,  especially if the state has a law mandating seat belt use."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accuracy: States Varied Greatly in the Extent of Checks for Data Accuracy", "paragraphs": ["Six of the 9 states we visited made use of quality control methods to help  ensure that individual reports were accurate when they were submitted to  the traffic safety data system. Of these 6 states, for example, 4 linked crash  reports to other traffic safety data, including driver or vehicle files, to verify  or populate information on crash reporting forms. Table 2 contains  examples of other tools and checks that the states used to help ensure  accuracy.", "Four of the 9 states did quality checks at the aggregate level\u2014that is, when  crash reports are analyzed in batches to identify abnormalities in reporting  that may not be apparent looking at individual reports. Of these 4 states, for  example, 1 had staff analyze the reports to identify invalid entries and data  miscodings, while another conducted edit checks each year to check for  invalid vehicle types or other problems. Such aggregate-level analysis can  be useful to identify systematic problems in data collection that may lead to  erroneous investigation or false conclusions, such as when officers report  one type of collision as another. For instance, officers in 1 state were found  to be characterizing some car-into-tree crashes as head-on collisions. Once  identified, such data collection problems can often be resolved through  officer training.", "To test data accuracy, we analyzed crash data submitted by the 17 states to  NHTSA and found relatively few instances of data that had been coded as  \u201cinvalid\u201d\u2014generally 3 percent or less. Data classified as invalid were most  often for elements more likely to be transposed or miscopied, such as VINs.  However, because we could not observe crash-scene reporting and did not  examine or verify information on source documents (such as police  accident reports), we cannot assume that the other 97 percent of data were  accurately reported and entered correctly.

In addition, 8 states provided law enforcement agencies or  other authorized users with access to crash information within 6 months of  crashes. Such access was often via the Internet, and data analysis tools  were typically limited to a certain number of preestablished data reports.  Thus, any in-depth analysis was limited to the tools available online. Three  states had analysts available to provide information or complete data  queries upon request. In another state, which had the capability to conduct  data collection electronically, local law enforcement agencies had access to  analysis tools to use with their own data.", "If users wanted direct access to completed data for more detailed analysis,  they often had to wait somewhat longer, given the need for additional data  entry or the completion of accuracy checks.

In 1 state, for  example, crash files were sent from the central traffic records database  kept by the state department of safety to the state department of  transportation for manual entry of location information from the roadway  file. Once the state department of transportation completed these records,  however, there was no mechanism to export that information back into the  central database. Also, in some states data integration was limited because  data were not processed with integration in mind. In 1 state, for example,  state department of transportation officials noted that the new crash  system had been developed for state police use, and that efforts were still  under way to develop an interface to bring crash data into the department\u2019s  system. In contrast, a state official in another state noted that the housing  of several agencies involved in the traffic safety data system\u2014including  those responsible for the driver, vehicle, and roadway files\u2014in the state  department of transportation had facilitated the direct sharing of  information and the full integration of data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "NHTSA Continues to Emphasize Quality Criteria", "paragraphs": ["In support of these quality criteria and improved traffic safety data  systems, NHTSA released a report in July 2004 detailing steps that could be  taken by federal and state stakeholders to improve traffic safety data.

These states also improved the tools used by law  enforcement officers to input data into their crash systems, such as  software for mapping and graphing traffic crashes or laptop computers for  patrol cars so that law enforcement officers could collect and transmit  crash data electronically to statewide repositories.", "The remaining 4 states used funding on multiple activities, such as  obtaining technical support, adding capability for more data entry, or  attending conferences. Some also conducted pilot projects. For example, 1  state created a project that enabled electronic uploads of traffic citation  data from local agencies to the state department of motor vehicles.  According to state officials, this project helped considerably with both  timeliness and completeness in the uploading of conviction information to  driver files. In another example, the state used funding to pilot a project to  capture data about crashes electronically.", "States made improvements under both the single- and multiple-project  approaches. One state that focused on a single project, for example,  developed a new statewide electronic crash system that officials said had  improved data timeliness and completeness. Similarly, of the states that  spread funding among multiple activities, 1 state used funding for a data  project on driver convictions\u2014paying for traffic records staff\u2019s salaries and  hiring consultants to map crashes to identify roadway issues. As a result,  the quality and completeness of crash data improved overall, according to a  state official.", "One factor that affected state progress was the relative effectiveness of the  state\u2019s coordinating committee. In those states, where the state  coordinating committee did not actively engage all stakeholders or where  its level of authority was limited, projects did not fully address system  needs. For example, 1 state established a coordinating committee that  included few stakeholders outside the state police, and this committee  decided to concentrate funding on a new electronic crash data system. The  new system, acknowledged by many stakeholders as improving the  timeliness and completeness of crash data, resulted in a useful resource  allocation and crash-reporting tool for the state police to allocate resources  and report on crashes. According to officials at the state department of  transportation, however, improvements in the crash information did not  effectively serve to facilitate the state\u2019s use of crash data to identify unsafe  roadways because the state department of transportation was not fully  engaged in the coordinating committee\u2019s process.", "Similarly, in another state, the coordinating committee lacked the authority  needed to fully implement its efforts. The coordinating committee created  two subcommittees\u2014a technical committee and an executive committee.  While the executive committee was made up of higher level managers from  various agencies, the coordinating committee did not have the legislative  authority to compel agencies to participate in the process or to even use  the newly created statewide crash data system. To date, the state does not  have all key stakeholders participating in the process and is continuing to  have difficulty persuading the largest municipality in the state to use the  newly developed statewide electronic reporting system. As a result, the  municipality continues to lag behind other communities in having its crash  information entered into the state crash system. In contrast, another state\u2019s  coordinating committee had the authority to approve or reject proposals  for data system improvements as well as funding. This state was able to  complete several agreed-upon projects, including implementing an  electronic driver citation program, which improved the completeness and  timeliness of the state crash data."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "NHTSA\u2019s Limited Oversight of the 411 Grant Program Contributed to Incomplete Knowledge of How Funds Were Used", "paragraphs": ["NHTSA did not adopt adequate regulations or guidelines to ensure states  receiving 411 grants submitted accurate and complete information on  progress they were making to improve their traffic safety data systems.

Further, NHTSA\u2019s regulations required states to report on  progress as part of their 411 grant application, which in effect meant that  states did not have to report specifically on 411 activities after fiscal year  2001. According to NHTSA regulations, states were to include information  on progress through their highway safety plans and annual evaluation  reports after fiscal year 2001, which are part of the reporting for all of  NHTSA\u2019s highway safety grants. However, our analysis of these documents  found that they lacked the detail needed to adequately assess state  activities undertaken with 411 funds. Further, while NHTSA officials told us  they also informally obtained information about progress after fiscal year  2001, the available information about what the activities actually  accomplished was limited. Limitations in the information regarding states  activities were particularly significant given that states spent most of their  grant funds after fiscal year 2001.", "NHTSA regional offices supplemented the regulatory requirements with  their own guidance to states, but the guidance varied greatly from region to  region. Some of the regional offices said that their contact with states  about these requirements was informal, and that their primary contact with  states (1) was over the telephone or by e-mail and (2) was generally in  regards to technical assistance, such as training or referring states to  existing guidelines. Other regional office staff said they had additional  contact with states through participation in meetings of state coordinating  committees, where they were able to provide additional assistance.  However, we found this participation occurred most often for states in  proximity to NHTSA regional offices. Few regional offices provided written  guidance to states with specific direction on what to include in their  progress reports.

We also  found that assessments based on recent information reflected the dynamic  and often-changing reality of state systems.

When we  compared the information we had collected during our site visit, we found  much of the information from our visit reflected in the assessment.

The  quality of such decisions is tied to the quality of these data. Our review  indicates that there were opportunities for states to improve crash data.  However, because NHTSA exercised limited oversight over the 411 grant  program, it is difficult to say what the program as a whole specifically  accomplished or whether there was a general improvement in the quality of  these data over the program\u2019s duration. Nevertheless, information we  obtained from the 8 states we visited suggests the premise that the 411  program did help states improve their traffic safety data systems. Based on  our work in these 8 states, we believe that states undertook important  improvements in their data systems with the federal grant funds. The  potential reauthorization of the grant program and NHTSA\u2019s recent study of  state safety data provide an opportunity to include assurances that states  use these grants on effective and worthy projects. Furthermore, the  reauthorization may provide greater funding and, therefore, greater  opportunity for states to improve their traffic safety data systems.  However, a larger program would come with a greater expectation  regarding what states will accomplish as well as with a need to effectively  track the progress states are making.", "NHTSA\u2019s inability to provide key grant documentation and its deficiencies  in monitoring state progress with 411 grant funds could be minimized if  NHTSA (1) better managed grant documents, (2) had clearer requirements  and guidance for the grant program, and (3) had an effective oversight  process in place to monitor activities and progress. Requiring more specific  information on the improvements states are making in their data systems  would begin to address the problems we identified with regard to  inadequate reporting on the program. If the program is reauthorized,  NHTSA should develop an oversight process that does a better job of (1)  tracking state activities to their strategic plans and assessments, (2)  providing information about progress made in improving safety data, and  (3) ensuring that NHTSA can adequately manage the documentation it is  requiring. In addition, if NHTSA develops a plan to implement the  recommendations in its recent Integrated Project Team report on traffic  safety data systems, it could incorporate these recommendations through  improved oversight efforts.", "Finally, one requirement present in the earlier program\u2014up-to-date  assessments of state traffic safety data systems\u2014was not included in  recent proposals to reauthorize the 411 grant program.

First, officials voiced concern  regarding the use of data quality criteria from NHTSA\u2019s Traffic Records  Highway Safety Program Advisory to review the quality of data or the  performance of states. The department emphasized that these criteria are  voluntary and states are not required to meet them; therefore, states should  not be judged against them. We acknowledge that these criteria are  voluntary and clarified the report to emphasize this point more fully.

We adopted a case-study  methodology for two reasons. First, we were unable to determine the  status of state systems from our review of 411 documents. Second, while  the results of the case studies cannot be projected to the universe of states,  the case studies were useful in illustrating the uniqueness and variation of  state traffic safety data systems and the challenges states face in improving  them.
