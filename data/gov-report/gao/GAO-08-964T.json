To participate in the HUBZone program, small business firms must certify that their principal office (i.e., the location where the greatest number of employees work) is located in a HUBZone and that at least 35 percent of the firm's employees live in HUBZones. Given the Committee's concern over fraud and abuse in the HUBZone program, GAO was asked to (1) proactively test whether SBA's controls over the HUBZone application process were operating effectively to limit program certification to eligible firms and (2) identify examples of selected firms that participate in the HUBZone program even though they do not meet eligibility requirements. To perform its proactive testing, GAO created four bogus businesses with fictitious owners and employees and applied for HUBZone certification. GAO also selected 17 HUBZone firms based on certain criteria, such as receipt of HUBZone contracts, and investigated whether they met key program eligibility requirements."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified substantial vulnerabilities in SBA's application and monitoring process, clearly demonstrating that the HUBZone program is vulnerable to fraud and abuse. Considering the findings of a related report and testimony issued today, GAO's work shows that these vulnerabilities exist because SBA does not have an effective fraud-prevention program in place. Using fictitious employee information and fabricated documentation, GAO easily obtained HUBZone certification for four bogus firms. For example, to support one HUBZone application, GAO claimed that its principal office was the same address as a Starbucks coffee store that happened to be located in a HUBZone. If SBA had performed a simple Internet search on the address, it would have been alerted to this fact. Further, two of GAO's applications used leased mailboxes from retail postal services centers. A post office box clearly does not meet SBA's principal office requirement. We were also able to identify 10 firms from the Washington, D.C., metro area that were participating in the HUBZone program even though they clearly did not meet eligibility requirements. Since 2006, federal agencies have obligated a total of more than $105 million to these 10 firms for performance as the prime contractor on federal contracts. Of the 10 firms, 6 did not meet both principal office and employee residency requirements while 4 met the principal office requirements but significantly failed the employee residency requirement. For example, one firm that failed both principal office and employee residency requirements had initially qualified for the HUBZone program using the address of a small room above a dentist's office. GAO's site visit to this room found only a computer and filing cabinet. No employees were present, and the building owner told GAO investigators that nobody had worked there \"for some time.\" During its investigation, GAO also found that some HUBZone firms used virtual office suites to fulfill SBA's principal office requirement. GAO investigated two of these virtual office suites and identified examples of firms that could not possibly meet principal office requirements given the nature of their leases. For example, one firm continued to certify it was a HUBZone firm even though its lease only provided mail forwarding services at the virtual office suite."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to discuss our investigation of the  Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) program. Created in  1997 and managed by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the  HUBZone program is intended to provide federal contracting  opportunities to qualified small business firms in order to stimulate  development in the economically distressed areas in which the firms are  located. These areas, which are designated based on certain economic and  census data, are known as HUBZones. To ensure HUBZone areas receive  the economic benefit from the program, SBA is responsible for  determining whether firms meet HUBZone program requirements and then  later monitoring whether the firms maintain their eligibility. To participate  in the HUBZone program, small business firms generally must satisfy three  main requirements: (1) the firm must be owned and controlled by one or  more U.S. citizens; (2) at least 35 percent of its full-time employees must  live in a HUBZone; and (3) the principal office (i.e., the location where the  greatest number of qualifying employees perform work) must be located in  a HUBZone.", "Small business firms in the HUBZone program are eligible to bid on  federal prime contracts and subcontracts available exclusively to program  participants, in addition to benefiting from other contracting preferences.  According to procurement data from the Federal Procurement Data  System\u2013Next Generation (FPDS-NG), in fiscal year 2007 federal agencies  reported about $8 billion in obligations on prime contracts with HUBZone  firms. In awarding prime contracts and subcontracts, both federal  contracting officials and prime contractor officials rely on SBA\u2019s controls  to provide assurance that only eligible firms participate in the program.", "When applying for HUBZone status, firms are required to verify that the  information they submit to SBA is true and correct. If SBA approves an  application and grants a firm HUBZone certification, that firm is then  required to notify SBA of any material changes affecting the firm\u2019s  eligibility, such as changes in principal office location or number of  employees residing in a HUBZone. Further, to compete for government  contracts, HUBZone firms must verify in the government\u2019s Online  Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) that they are a  HUBZone firm and that there have been \u201cno material changes in  ownership and control, principal office, or HUBZone employee percentage  since it was certified by the SBA.\u201d There are criminal penalties for  knowingly making false statements or misrepresentations in connection  with the HUBZone program, including failure to correct \u201ccontinuing  representations\u201d that are no longer true.", "Although the HUBZone program can have positive economic outcomes for  small business firms and economically distressed communities, in January  2003 the SBA Office of Inspector General (OIG) reported that SBA\u2019s  internal controls were inadequate to ensure that only eligible firms were  allowed to participate in the HUBZone program. Given your concern over  program fraud and abuse, you requested that we perform an investigation  to (1) proactively test whether SBA\u2019s controls over the HUBZone  application process were operating effectively to limit program  certification to eligible firms and (2) identify examples of selected firms  that participate in the HUBZone program even though they do not meet  eligibility requirements.", "To proactively test whether SBA\u2019s controls over the HUBZone application  process were operating effectively, we set up four bogus firms and  submitted applications to SBA.

We used  publicly available guidance provided by SBA in preparing our applications.", "When necessary, we fabricated documents to support our applications  using commercially available hardware and software.", "To identify examples of firms that participate in the HUBZone program  even though they do not meet eligibility requirements, we first obtained  and analyzed a list of HUBZone firms from the SBA\u2019s Certification  Tracking System as of January 2008. We then obtained federal  procurement data from FPDS-NG for fiscal years 2006 and 2007. We  analyzed these data to identify HUBZone firms with a principal office  located in the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area for which federal  agencies reported obligations on HUBZone prime contracts totaling more  than $450,000 between fiscal years 2006 and 2007. Based on this process,  we selected 16 firms for further investigation. We selected an additional  firm for investigation based on a referral to GAO\u2019s FraudNet hotline. For  the 17 selected firms, we then used investigative methods, such as  interviewing firm managers and reviewing firm payroll documents, to  gather information about the firms and to determine whether they met  HUBZone requirements. We also reviewed information about each firm in  ORCA. While performing our proactive testing and investigative work, we  found other HUBZone firms using virtual office suites to fulfill SBA\u2019s  principal office requirement.

Our use of  bogus firms, fictitious employees, and fabricated explanations and  documents to obtain HUBZone certification demonstrated the ease with  which HUBZone certification could be obtained by providing fraudulent  information to SBA\u2019s online application system.

An Internet search on any of  the addresses we provided would have raised \u201cred flags\u201d and should have  led to further investigation by SBA, such as a site visit, to determine  whether the principal office address met program eligibility requirements.  Because HUBZone certification provides an opening to billions of dollars  in federal contracts, approval of ineligible firms for participation in the  program exposes the federal government to contracting fraud and abuse,  and moreover, can result in the exclusion of legitimate HUBZone firms  from obtaining government contracts. We provide specific details  regarding each application below.", "Fictitious Application One: Our investigators submitted this fictitious  application and received HUBZone certification 3 weeks later. To support  the application, we leased, at a cost of $250 a month, virtual office services  from an office suite located in a HUBZone and gave this address as our  principal office location. Specifically, the terms of the lease allowed us to  schedule use of an office space up to 16 hours per month and to have mail  delivered to the suite. Our HUBZone application also indicated that our  bogus firm employed two individuals with one of the employees residing  in a HUBZone. Two business days after submitting the application, an SBA  official emailed us requesting a copy of the lease for our principal office  location and proof of residency for our employee. We created the  documentation using publicly available hardware and software and faxed  copies to SBA to comply with the request.

However, the  firm failed the principal office requirement. Our site visits to the address  identified by the firm as its principal office found that it was a small room  that had been rented on the upper floor of a dentist\u2019s office where no more  than two people could work comfortably. No employees were present, and  the only business equipment in the rented room was a computer and filing  cabinet. The building owner stated that the president of the firm used to  conduct some business from the office, but that nobody had worked there  \u201cfor some time.\u201d Moreover, the president indicated that instead of paying  rent at the HUBZone location, she provided accounting services to the  owner at a no-cost exchange for use of the space. See figure 2 for a picture  of the building the firm claimed as its principal office (arrow indicates  where the office is located).", "Further investigation revealed that the firm listed its real principal office  (called the firm\u2019s \u201cheadquarters\u201d on its Web site) at an address in McLean,  Virginia. In addition to not being a HUBZone, McLean, Virginia, is in one of  the wealthiest jurisdictions in the United States. Our site visit to this  second location revealed that the majority of the firm\u2019s officers in addition  to about half of the qualifying employees worked there and indicated this  location was the firm\u2019s actual principal office. When we interviewed the  president, she claimed that the McLean, Virginia, office was maintained  \u201conly for appearance.\u201d See figure 3 for a picture of the McLean, Virginia,  building where the firm rented office space.", "Based on our review of payroll documents we received directly from the  firm, we also determined the firm failed the 35 percent HUBZone  residency requirement. The payroll documents indicated that only 15 of  the firm\u2019s 72 employees (21 percent) lived in a HUBZone as of December  2007. We also found that in January 2007 during SBA\u2019s HUBZone  recertification process the president self-certified that 38 percent of the  firm\u2019s employees lived in a HUBZone. However, the payroll documents  received directly from firm showed only 24 percent of the firm\u2019s  employees lived in a HUBZone at that time.", "In 2006 the Department of the Army, National Guard Bureau, awarded a  HUBZone set-aside contract with a $40 million ceiling to this firm based on  its HUBZone status.

Based on our analysis of FPDS-NG data,  between fiscal years 2006 and 2007 federal agencies obligated about $12.2  million for payment to the firm. Of this, about $4 million in HUBZone  contracts were obligated by the Department of the Air Force.

For its HUBZone certification in April 2006,  an address in a HUBZone in Rockville, Maryland, was identified as its  principal office location. We visited this location during normal business  hours and found the address was for an office suite that provided virtual  office services. According to the lease between the HUBZone firm and the  office suite\u2019s management, the firm did not rent office space, but paid $325  a month to use a conference room on a scheduled basis for up to 4 hours  each month. Absent additional services provided by the virtual office suite,  it would be impossible for this firm to meet the principal office  requirement under this lease arrangement. Moreover, the president of the  firm told us that no employees typically worked at the virtual office.  Additional investigative work revealed that the firm\u2019s Web site listed a  second address for the firm in McLean, Virginia, which as noted above is  not in a HUBZone. Our site visit determined this location to be where the  firm\u2019s president and all qualifying employees worked. In addition, the  payroll documents we received from the firm revealed that the percentage  of employees living in a HUBZone during calendar year 2007 ranged from a  low of 6 percent to a high of 15 percent\u2014far below the required 35  percent.", "Based on our analysis of FPDS-NG data, between fiscal years 2006 and  2007 federal agencies obligated about $3.3 million for payment to the firm.  Of this, over $460,000 in HUBZone contracts were obligated by the  Department of Veterans Affairs. Further, in addition to admitting the firm  did not meet the principal office requirement, the president was also very  candid about having received subcontracting opportunities from large  prime contracting firms based solely on the firm\u2019s HUBZone certification.", "According to the president, the prime contractors listed the HUBZone firm  as part of their \u201cteam\u201d to satisfy their HUBZone subcontracting goals.
