The commission resolved all of the previously reported weaknesses in security related activities and contingency planning, and made significant progress in resolving access control weaknesses. A key reason for its progress was that SEC's senior management was actively engaged in implementing information security related activities. Despite this progress, SEC has not consistently implemented certain key controls to effectively safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its financial and sensitive information and information systems. In addition to 13 previously identified weaknesses that remain unresolved, 15 new information security weaknesses were identified. By the conclusion of GAO's review, SEC took action to address 11 of the 15 new weaknesses. A primary reason for these control weaknesses is that SEC had not consistently implemented elements of its information security program. This included inconsistent implementation of agency policies and procedures, not sufficiently testing and evaluating the effectiveness of controls for a major system as required by its certification and accreditation process, and not consistently taking effective and timely action to correct deficiencies identified in remedial action plans.

Without proper safeguards,  systems are unprotected from individuals and groups with malicious intent  to intrude and use the access to obtain sensitive information, commit  fraud, disrupt operations, or launch attacks against other computer  systems and networks. These concerns are well founded for a number of  reasons, including the dramatic increase in reports of security incidents,  the ease of obtaining and using hacking tools, the steady advance in the  sophistication and effectiveness of attack technology, and the dire  warnings of new and more destructive attacks to come.", "Computer-supported federal operations are likewise at risk.

We  have designated information security as a governmentwide high-risk area  since 1997.", "Recognizing the importance of securing the information systems of federal  agencies, Congress enacted the Federal Information Security Management  Act (FISMA) in December 2002. FISMA requires each agency to develop,  document, and implement an agencywide information security program  for the data and systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency, using a risk-based approach to information security management.  Information security program requirements to be implemented include  assessing risk; developing and implementing policies, procedures, and  security plans; providing security awareness and training; testing and  evaluating the effectiveness of controls; planning, implementing,  evaluating, and documenting remedial actions to address information  security deficiencies; detecting, reporting, and responding to security  incidents; and ensuring continuity of operations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "SEC\u2019s Role as Protector of Securities Investors", "paragraphs": ["Following the stock market crash of 1929, Congress passed the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, establishing SEC to enforce securities laws,  regulate the securities markets, and protect investors. To carry out its  responsibilities and help ensure that fair, orderly, and efficient securities  markets are maintained, the commission issues rules and regulations that  promote adequate and effective disclosure of information to the investing  public. The commission also oversees and requires the registration of  other key participants in the securities industry, including stock  exchanges, broker-dealers, clearing agencies, depositories, transfer agents,  investment companies, and public utility holding companies. SEC is an  independent, quasi-judicial agency that operates at the direction of five  commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.", "In fiscal year 2006, SEC had a budget of about $888 million and staff of  3,590.

In fiscal year 2006, the commission collected $499 million in  filing fees and $1.8 billion in penalties and disgorgements. To support its  financial operations and store the sensitive information it collects, the  commission relies extensively on computerized systems interconnected by  local and wide area networks. To process and track financial transactions  such as filing fees paid by corporations and penalties from enforcement  activities, SEC relies on several applications\u2014Momentum, Electronic Data  Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system (EDGAR), and Case Activity  Tracking System 2000 (CATS). Momentum, a commercial off-the-shelf  accounting software product, is used to record the commission\u2019s  accounting transactions, to maintain its general ledger, and to maintain the  information SEC uses to produce financial reports. EDGAR is an Internet- based system used to collect, validate, index, and accept the submissions  of forms filed by SEC-registered companies. EDGAR transfers this  information to the general ledger nightly. The commission\u2019s Division of  Enforcement uses CATS, a modified commercial off-the-shelf database  application, to record enforcement data and create management reports.  CATS tracks enforcement-related data, including SEC-imposed fines and  penalties. In addition, the commission uses these systems to maintain  sensitive information, including filing data for corporations, and legal  information on enforcement activities.", "According to FISMA, the Chairman of the SEC has responsibility for  providing information security protections commensurate with the risk  and magnitude of the harm resulting from unauthorized access, use,  disclosure, disruption, modification or destruction of the agency\u2019s  information systems and information. The Chairman of the SEC delegated  authority to the chief information officer (CIO) to be responsible for  establishing and maintaining a comprehensive information security  program and governance framework. As part of its program, the CIO is to  (1) ensure that policies, procedures, and control techniques to address all  applicable information security requirements are effectively implemented  and maintained; (2) work closely with designated authorizing officials to  ensure that the SEC-wide program is effectively implemented and  managed; and (3) delegate authority to the agency chief information  security officer (CISO) to carry out information security responsibilities  and to ensure compliance with applicable federal laws, regulations, and  standards. The CISO serves as the CIO\u2019s liaison with system owners and  authorizing officials to ensure the agency security program is effectively  implemented.
