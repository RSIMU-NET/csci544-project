But IRS will not achieve the full benefits that electronic filing can provide because it does not have a comprehensive business strategy to reach or exceed its electronic filing goal, which is 80 million electronic filings by 2001. Today, IRS\u2019s estimates and projections for individual and business returns suggest that, by 2001, as few as 39 million returns may be submitted electronically, less than half of IRS\u2019s goal.", "Maximizing electronic filings is important because tax returns filed electronically do not have to move through IRS\u2019s labor-intensive operations. Paper filings have to be opened, sorted, reviewed, transcribed, shipped and stored, and then physically retrieved if IRS employees later need data on the returns that are not transcribed. IRS recognizes that increasing the number of electronic filings is essential to both improve its tax return processing and advance toward the virtually paperless environment envisioned by IRS under TSM.", "Creating a paperless environment, though, will involve making significant changes to improve IRS\u2019s information management and will require new processes and new ways of doing business. Private and public sector organizations that have successfully improved their performance have found that to move away from the status quo, an organization must recognize opportunities to change and improve its fundamental business processes. Without well-conceived business strategies to capitalize on opportunities, meaningful change may be slow, the quality of service may not improve, and modernization may be impossible.", "Consequently, one of IRS\u2019s most pressing modernization issues is the efficient processing of vast quantities of information received on tax returns, which in 1994, amounted to about 205 million returns. In 1995, IRS expects total tax returns from individuals and businesses to increase by 2 million, and by 2001, to reach 224 million filings.", "To help process its avalanche of paperwork more efficiently, in 1990, IRS introduced nationwide electronic filing to selected groups of taxpayers as a means of using modern technology to streamline its business processes. Looking to the future, IRS set a goal to receive 80 million tax filings electronically by 2001. IRS based this goal, which accounts for about 35.7 percent of all tax filings expected in 2001, on a projection of electronic filing of 70 million individual returns and 10 million business returns.", "In working toward this goal, in 1994, about 16 million tax returns, or 7.8 percent of all returns, were filed electronically, with about 50 percent of these being 1040A forms. In 1995, IRS expects that electronic filings will decrease to about 15 million, or 7.2 percent of all tax returns.", "On the basis of the current rate of electronic filings for individuals, IRS now estimates that in 2001 only about 29 million electronic returns will by filed by individuals. Combined with the projected 10 million electronic filings from businesses, IRS may receive only 39 million electronic returns in 2001. This is only about 17.4 percent of the 224 million tax returns anticipated in 2001, less than half of IRS\u2019s goal. Table 2.1 summarizes IRS\u2019s electronic filing activity for 1994 and projections for the future.", "IRS\u2019s current business strategy focuses primarily on promoting faster refunds to clients of businesses that prepare and electronically transmit tax returns. Tax return preparers and transmitters do not pay a fee to IRS for electronic filings, but they charge a fee to taxpayers. Consequently, IRS\u2019s business strategy for promoting electronic filing is directed primarily at taxpayers who file using third parties, are willing to pay to file electronically, file simple tax returns, and are due refunds.", "IRS has no comprehensive business strategy for promoting the benefits of electronic filing to other taxpayers. In doing this, IRS should consider all segments of the taxpaying population, including those who (1) are unwilling to pay for tax preparer and transmitter services, (2) owe IRS for balances due, and (3) file complex tax returns. These taxpayers represent considerable potential for making substantially greater use of electronic filing.", "Moreover, IRS is not taking advantage of opportunities afforded by personal computers to increase electronic filings. In recent years, these computers have become a common fixture in many households. In this regard, when personal computers are used to prepare tax returns, taxpayers who are not willing to pay commercial transmitting fees must print their electronically produced returns on paper and mail them to IRS to be manually processed. This results in the redundant, counterproductive conversion of the same data by both taxpayers and IRS: taxpayers convert electronic data to paper returns, IRS then laboriously converts information on the paper returns back to electronic data.", "Unless IRS attracts all potential electronic filers, it will never achieve its vision of virtually paperless processing and will be forced to process increasingly large workloads of paper tax returns. Further, IRS\u2019s paper processing systems are not planned to accommodate the large volume of paper returns that will result if taxpayers file fewer returns electronically. For example, IRS is designing the Document Processing System for use at five service centers based on the assumption that, by 2001, at least 61 million of the 224 million returns will be filed electronically, that is, 163 million paper returns will be processed through the Document Processing System.", "As table 2.1 shows, by 2001, since only 39 million tax returns may be filed electronically, 185 million taxpayers could submit paper returns, or about 22 million more returns than IRS is designing the Document Processing System to process.

Even though TSM has been underway for 10 years, complete, clear, and concise planning for TSM and its multibillion dollar investment is not evident. As a result, it is difficult for IRS to identify and effectively focus on completing priority aspects of TSM.", "Public and private sector organizations that have been successful in developing major systems have found that, to be successful, once the organization has made a serious commitment to change its management of information and technology, it is paramount to adopt a strategic planning approach. Their experience is that strategic business and information system plans must have a tight link to mission goals and must be predicated on satisfying explicit, high-priority customer needs. This orientation helps to ensure that information technology projects are delivered on time and within budget and that they produce meaningful improvements in cost, quality, or timeliness of service.", "We identified several different efforts by IRS to prepare plans to delineate a vision for the future and actions required to realize that vision. These planning documents include the Business Master Plan, which reflects the business priorities set by IRS\u2019s top executives and links IRS\u2019s strategic objectives and business vision with the tactical actions needed to implement them; the IRS Future Concept of Operations, which articulates IRS\u2019s future business vision so that the Congress, IRS employees, and the public can see and better understand IRS\u2019s plans for serving the public; and the Integrated Transition Plan and Schedule, which provides a top-level view of the modernization program\u2019s tasks, activities, and schedules and is the primary tool used for accountability for delivering the products and services necessary to implement modernization.", "We found, however, that these documents are incomplete and inconsistent. For example, as of May 1995, 4 volumes of the 10 volume IRS Future Concept of Operations had not been completed. These volumes covered (1) national and regional offices, (2) workload distribution management, (3) area distribution centers, and (4) process flows. While the six completed volumes include critical areas, the incomplete documents are necessary for a comprehensive vision of IRS\u2019s future operations.", "Also, of the 27 action items identified in the Business Master Plan that relate to information systems, 15 could not be identified in the Integration Transition Plan and Schedule. Further, the Business Master Plan\u2019s actions and performance measures have not been changed to reflect recent electronic filing trends, which indicate that IRS will fall far short of its electronic filing goal.", "We found other indications of weak planning processes as well. Specifically, IRS did not have a fully integrated planning and budgeting process for TSM, although the Office of Economic Analysis is moving in that direction. For example, this office is developing a new TSM cost model for IRS. Steps such as this are positive because a strong tie between TSM plans and IRS budgets will be especially important to ensure that information is available to IRS managers and the Congress to show TSM\u2019s future funding needs and the results of past investments.", "While IRS has undertaken fundamental TSM planning, stronger overall strategic planning for TSM is still needed. This would involve (1) defining the information technology capabilities required to support reengineered business processes, (2) identifying, assessing, and mitigating the risks involved in developing both TSM as a whole, as well as individual component projects, (3) formulating schedules and milestones for development, and (4) allocating needed resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Information Technology Is Not Managed as an Investment", "paragraphs": ["Currently, IRS does not have a process to manage TSM information systems projects as investments, even though IRS expects the government\u2019s past and future investment in TSM to exceed $8 billion. Foremost, at the time of our review, IRS lacked comprehensive decision criteria for controlling and evaluating TSM projects throughout their life cycles.", "When organizations use strategic information management best practices, they manage information systems projects as investments, rather than expenses. These organizations view projects as efforts to improve mission performance, not as efforts to implement information technology. For public and private sector organizations that have been successful in developing major systems, the basis for making decisions on information technology investments has been an explicit set of criteria that are used to evaluate the expected mission benefits, potential risks, and estimated cost of each project. This investment focus systematically reduces inherent risks while maximizing benefits of complex projects.", "IRS maintains that all TSM projects have equal priority and must be completed or the modernization will fail. An \u201call-or-nothing\u201d approach to large information technology projects is usually unrealistic and generally unattainable. Instead, a reasoned and an explicit framework for managing information technology investments is essential.", "IRS currently holds program control meetings to assess and control information technology. However, these meetings have generally focused on the costs and implementation schedules of individual projects, rather than on comprehensively evaluating and prioritizing risks and returns expected from these investments. Instead of using explicit criteria to measure risks and returns, IRS evaluates each project\u2019s progress using a time-line.", "At the completion of our review, IRS had developed draft criteria for TSM projects. These criteria included risk and return factors (e.g., cost, project size, and mission benefit), which it plans to use for the first time during top management\u2019s review of the fiscal year 1997 budget. However, these factors were not defined so they could be used consistently to assess projects. For instance, IRS characterized project size as small, medium, large, and very large, but did not quantify these terms. Similarly, IRS has not yet defined decision criteria and quantifiable measures to assess mission benefits, risk, and cost, all of which are important to enable IRS managers to adequately select, control, and evaluate information systems projects. IRS is currently developing better decision criteria.", "Managing TSM as an investment would require IRS to assess, prioritize, control, and evaluate its investment in current and planned TSM information technology projects based on explicit and consistently applied decision criteria. By adopting this approach, top management\u2019s attention would be drawn to assessing and managing risk and making the tradeoffs between continued funding of existing operations and developing new capabilities.

However, IRS\u2019s overall cost projection is unreliable for several reasons. For example, IRS based the projection on an October 1992 TSM cost model, which IRS did not adequately update to reflect systems that have since been added to TSM, IRS\u2019s more recent business visions, and changes in TSM systems development methods.", "The benefits estimate also had shortcomings. For instance, in some cases, IRS attributed to TSM the savings associated with reducing staff resources; in other cases, IRS computed benefits based on additional revenues expected if staff were reassigned to tax collection. Although a decision to use these staff for collections may increase revenue, the additional staff\u2014not the system\u2014will provide this benefit. This point becomes clear when the following scenarios are considered: (1) IRS could assign additional staff to collections independent of the information system and (2) if IRS reassigns to other nonrevenue producing activities the staff years saved, the revenue benefits would evaporate even though the information system would not change. A convincing benefits analysis for a system must compare operational costs with and without the system, other variables being held constant.", "IRS recognizes that it has not adequately assessed TSM costs and benefits and is currently working with a contractor on an economic analysis to better reflect the cost and benefits of TSM.
