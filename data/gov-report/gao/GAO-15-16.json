Generally, taxpayers with IRA balances greater than $5 million tend to have adjusted gross incomes greater than $200,000, be joint filers, and are age 65 or older. Large individual and employer contributions sustained over decades and rolled over from an employer plan would be necessary to accumulate an IRA balance of more than $5 million. There is no total statutory limit on IRA accumulations or rollovers from employer defined contribution plans.", "A small number of taxpayers has accumulated larger IRA balances, likely by investing in assets unavailable to most investors\u2014initially valued very low and offering disproportionately high potential investment returns if successful. Individuals who invest in these assets using certain types of IRAs can escape taxation on investment gains. For example, founders of companies who use IRAs to invest in nonpublicly traded shares of their newly formed companies can realize many millions of dollars in tax-favored gains on their investment if the company is successful. With no total limit on IRA accumulations, the government forgoes millions in tax revenue. The accumulation of these large IRA balances by a small number of investors stands in contrast to Congress's aim to prevent the tax-favored accumulation of balances exceeding what is needed for retirement.", "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has enforcement programs covering specific aspects of IRA noncompliance, such as excess contributions and undervalued assets. As recommended by an internal task team, IRS plans to collect data identifying nonpublicly traded assets comprising IRA investments.

However, research on those taxpayers and IRA assets at risk will hinge on getting resources to effectively compile and analyze the additional data. IRS officials said IRA valuation cases are audit-intensive and difficult to litigate because of the subjective nature of valuation. Additionally, the 3-year statute of limitations for assessing taxes owed can pose an obstacle for IRS pursuing noncompliant activity that spans years of IRA investment."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider revisiting its legislative vision for the use of IRAs.

This is a  strong indicator that the individuals able to accumulate such large  balances have not done so through steady contributions and investments  in publicly traded stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. Instead, these  individuals likely use alternate strategies involving investments not  available to most taxpayers. In addition to access, to generate a large  IRA, investments must have a low initial value and the potential for  unusually high investment returns. The low initial value of these  investments: (1) allows the individual to purchase a quantity within IRA  contribution limits sufficient to generate tens of millions of dollars if the  investments are successful; and (2) protects the individual against  financial loss, given the increased likelihood that these investments end  up worthless.

He added that the rest of his clients, even those  whose wealth surpasses $100 million, were unlikely to have an IRA  exceeding $5 million because of the IRA contribution limits. The share of  profits paid by outside investors, known as limited partners, to the general  partner as a performance fee is referred to as the general partner\u2019s  carried interest in a fund.

A profits interest has the potential to provide a key employee investment  returns that are disproportionate to his or her invested capital if the fund is  a success, according to six industry stakeholders who represent private  equity firms and hedge funds or advise private equity professionals.

IRS provided  guidance on treatment for the receipt of a profits interest for services,  saying that the grant of a profits interest is generally not a taxable event.Some industry stakeholders may have taken this to mean that profits  interests can have an initial value of as low as $0.00, referred to as a  liquidation value.", "As with nonpublicly traded shares, key employees at private equity firms  and hedge funds may use IRAs to purchase profits interests from the  general partner.

A rollover to an IRA can include  both cash and noncash assets, such as a profits interest that is not done  yielding distributions of carried interest.

The result is a revenue loss to the federal  government through a circumvention of the longstanding rationale for IRA  contribution limits. However, Congress can reorient existing laws to  address the excesses of these strategies, so that all taxpayers have  similar opportunities to reap the benefits of IRAs. Congress could, for  example, address the build-up of unnecessarily large IRAs in a variety of  ways: by limiting the types of investments held in IRAs, enforcing  standards such as a minimum required value for investments in an IRA,  or by setting a ceiling on accumulations in an IRA and requiring an  immediate distribution of balances above that ceiling. Without such a  readjustment, the intended broad-based tax benefits of IRAs will continue  to be skewed towards a select group of investors.", "With respect to individual taxes, IRS has dedicated enforcement  resources to identifying taxpayers who may be building IRA balances  improperly. It is critical to collect data on alternative IRA assets with a  higher risk of noncompliance, given that the valuation issues at the heart  of the strategies to build large IRAs pose high costs for IRS enforcement  and carry a risk of IRS failing to prove wrongdoing in court.

Positioning IRS to take full advantage  of the new Form 5498 data hinges on IRS digitizing the data for  compliance case selection and examination. While IRS estimates  capturing the data for the relatively few paper filing would add small costs  to processing the forms, the benefits\u2014in terms of less forgone revenue, a  greater perception of a fair tax system, and better use of enforcement  resources\u2014would outweigh those costs.", "Existing data from DOL and SEC on employer-sponsored plans and the  performance fees charged by private equity firms and hedge funds  provide information that could also assist IRS in assessing the valuation  of assets in IRAs.

Providing this information is important because it helps  regulators better understand the types of assets held in tax-favored  retirement accounts. If DOL were required to improve the transparency of  assets held in employer-sponsored plans, IRS could have better  information on where the assets in a large IRA may have originated.

The figure  uses a simplified model to show the after-tax rates of return that result  from these scenarios over a 20-year period. Each case assumes  earnings of $1,000 before taxes for contribution in year 1 and distribution  of the accumulated balance in year 20. Investment earnings over the 20- year period are assumed to be a constant pretax 5 percent. Assuming a  constant federal ordinary income tax rate of 25 percent, the traditional  IRA and Roth IRA achieve similar results although the tax benefits have  different paths. For the traditional IRA, the individual can invest a $1,000  tax-deductible contribution in year 1, and taxes on the contribution and  investment earnings are deferred until distribution. For the Roth IRA, the  individual can invest $750 after tax with investment earnings tax-exempt  at later distribution. While the amount contributed to the account is  greater in the first year for the traditional IRA owner, the amount that is  available for the taxpayer for consumption after taxes on distribution is the  same for the traditional owner and the Roth owner. The traditional IRA  owner puts the tax saving in the account to grow to ultimately pay the tax  on the account; the Roth owner pays the tax upfront and has no further  tax liability. For both Roth and traditional IRA accounts, the after-tax rate  of return is 5 percent. In contrast, the taxable account, which is subject to  taxes on both the original earnings contributed as well as the annual  investment earnings, has an annual after-tax rate of return of 3.75  percent. If an investment were held outside of a retirement account and  subject to capital gains taxes only, there would be no initial deduction of  amounts invested. Similar to the case of a traditional IRA account where  tax on income is deferred until distribution, no capital gains tax would be  owed until the asset was sold and gain was realized, which in the  example happens at the end of the 20-year period. Upon sale, any gain  would be subject to the capital gains tax rate. The capital gains tax rate is  generally lower than the ordinary income tax rate that is applied to  distributions from a traditional IRA. As a result of the deferral of tax until  sale and the preferential capital gains tax rate, the after-tax rate of return  for the capital gains asset would be 4.5 percent, less than if the asset  were held in an IRA of either type but higher than if the investment had  been made in a taxable account where income earned was taxed  annually at ordinary income tax rates.", "The simplified example above showed how contributions to traditional and  Roth accounts can earn the same rate of return after taxes if tax rates do  not change over time. If tax rates vary over time, this equivalence may not  hold. For example, if an individual or household is subject to a relatively  high tax rate when a contribution is made and a low tax rate when  earnings are distributed, a traditional account would result in a higher rate  of return. On the other hand, if tax rates are low when a contribution to a  Roth account is made and rates are higher when funds are distributed,  the Roth account would result in a higher rate of return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Tables from Statistics of Income Data for Tax Year 2011", "paragraphs": ["This appendix shows the confidence intervals for our analysis of the  Statistics of Income (SOI) data about individual retirement accounts  (IRA)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Examples of Strategies to Accumulate Large Individual Retirement Accounts", "paragraphs": ["The two examples below demonstrate how a small number of individuals  could generate large individual retirement account (IRA) balances by  leveraging their access to nonpublicly traded shares and profits interests."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Example 1: onpublicly Traded Shares", "paragraphs": ["Figure 11 illustrates an example of how founders of successful  companies can generate IRA balances of tens of millions dollars by  investing in nonpublicly traded shares in their newly created company.
