GAO's analysis of PEPFAR planning documents and national HIV/AIDS strategies, as well as discussions with PEPFAR officials in the four countries GAO visited, showed overall alignment between PEPFAR activities and the national strategy goals. In addition, statements by global and country-level PEPFAR stakeholders indicate that PEPFAR activities support the achievement of partner countries' national strategy goals. PEPFAR officials noted that a number of factors may influence the degree to which PEPFAR activities align with national strategy goals, including the activities of other donors, the size of the PEPFAR program, and policy restrictions. PEPFAR may also support activities not mentioned in the national HIV/AIDS strategies but that are addressed in relevant sector- or program-specific strategies. PEPFAR officials reported various efforts to help ensure that PEPFAR activities support the achievement of national strategy goals, including assisting in developing national strategies, participating in formal and informal communication and coordination meetings, engaging regularly with partner country governments during the annual planning process, and developing a new HIV/AIDS agreement, known as a partnership framework, between PEPFAR and partner country governments. PEPFAR stakeholders highlighted several challenges related to aligning PEPFAR programs with national HIV/AIDS strategies or promoting country ownership of U.S.-supported HIV/AIDS programs. First, PEPFAR indicators, including indicator definitions and timeframes, sometimes differ from those used by partner countries and other international donors. Second, gaps may exist in the sharing of PEPFAR information with partner country governments and other donors. Third, limitations in country leadership and capacity, such as lack of technical expertise to develop strategies and manage programs, affect country teams' ability to ensure that PEPFAR activities support achievement of national strategy goals. Fourth, Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) guidance to country teams regarding development of partnership frameworks does not include indicators for establishing baseline measures of country ownership prior to implementation of partnership frameworks. Without baseline measures, country teams may have limited ability to measure the frameworks' impact and make needed adjustments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of State direct OGAC to develop and disseminate a methodology for establishing baseline measures of country ownership prior to implementing partnership frameworks.

PEPFAR country programs are planned with  consideration of other donors\u2019 and groups\u2019 activities in the countries, and  therefore PEPFAR activities may not address all national strategy goals. In  many PEPFAR countries a number of other bilateral and multilateral  development partners also fund and implement programs to support the  national program. Country team officials noted that in planning PEPFAR  programs, they coordinate with other partners so that PEPFAR and  partner activities will complement, rather than duplicate, one another and  together support the national program. For example, the PEPFAR Malawi  team explained that although the Malawi national strategy contains a goal  of expanding workplace programs on HIV and AIDS in the public and  private sectors and civil society, the 2010 PEPFAR Malawi COP does not  include activities that directly address this goal because other donors and  groups are implementing programs that address it.", "Size of PEPFAR program. The portion of a national strategy supported by  PEPFAR activities also depends in part on the size of the PEPFAR  program in that country relative to other donors\u2019 activities in the country.  For example, OGAC and country team officials told us that PEPFAR is  more likely to cover larger portions of the national strategy in former  focus countries where PEPFAR is generally the largest donor of HIV/AIDS  funds. This corresponds with our finding that in the 2010 COPs for former  focus countries Uganda and Vietnam, where U.S. funding makes up a large  share of the national HIV/AIDS response\u201475 percent in Uganda and 59  percent in Vietnam from 2004 to 2008\u2014the activity descriptions directly  address most national strategy goals and objectives. OGAC and PEPFAR  country team officials also noted that in non-focus countries, PEPFAR  programs may support the achievement of priority goals, rather than cover  every national strategy goal. For instance, in the non-focus countries  Cambodia and Malawi, where U.S. funding makes up a smaller share of the  national HIV/AIDS response\u201447 percent in Cambodia and 22 percent in  Malawi from 2004 to 2008\u2014we found that PEPFAR activities generally  supported national strategy goals by filling resource gaps and focusing on  interventions in which country teams have technical expertise.", "Policy restrictions. PEPFAR may not support particular activities because  of PEPFAR policy restrictions or other conflicts. For example, according  to country team officials in Vietnam, until recently PEPFAR funds could  not be used to support needle exchange programs for intravenous drug  users. As a result, PEPFAR has not supported this component of Vietnam\u2019s  national strategy.", "PEPFAR programs also may involve activities that are not specifically  addressed in the national strategy but that support national strategy goals.  In the four countries we visited, PEPFAR officials, government officials,  donors, and PEPFAR implementing partners generally agreed that national  strategies outline broad principles, goals, and objectives rather than  specific programs or activities. According to these officials, the general  nature of the national strategies allows flexibility to support specific  programs to achieve these goals and respond to countries\u2019 evolving  HIV/AIDS epidemics. For example, according to PEPFAR officials, the  Malawi PEPFAR program has prioritized male circumcision for many  years as an effective means of preventing the spread of HIV, although this  activity was not mentioned in Malawi\u2019s previous national strategy.  However, PEPFAR officials told us that these programs support Malawi\u2019s  broad goal to reduce the number of new infections. Moreover, as a result  of the country team\u2019s working with the Malawi government and sharing  information and data, male circumcision has since been incorporated into  Malawi\u2019s most recent strategy. Similarly, in Uganda, PEPFAR supports  prevention and treatment activities for a potentially high-risk target group,  men who have sex with men, although Uganda\u2019s national strategy does not  address prevention and treatment for this group. PEPFAR officials told us  they consider these activities aligned with Uganda\u2019s high-level goal to  reduce the number of new infections and treat HIV-positive patients.  PEPFAR team officials in the four countries we visited told us they take  into account sector- or program-specific subcomponents of national  strategies\u2014such as a protocol for prevention of mother-to-child  transmission of HIV\u2014as well as relevant epidemiological and evaluation  data, all of which may be more up to date or detailed than the broad  national HIV/AIDS strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "PEPFAR Stakeholders Reported Various Efforts to Align PEPFAR Activities with National Strategy Goals", "paragraphs": ["PEPFAR country teams and other stakeholders described several means  by which the country teams work to achieve alignment of PEPFAR  activities with partner country HIV/AIDS goals.", "Participation in development of national strategies. PEPFAR country  teams actively participate in the development and revision of partner  countries\u2019 national HIV/AIDS strategies, according to PEPFAR officials,  partner government officials, and civil society groups. When host  governments are developing or reformulating their strategies, they often  invite HIV/AIDS stakeholders in the country, including bilateral and  multilateral donors and civil society and private sector groups, to  participate in the strategy\u2019s development. As part of this process,  according to PEPFAR officials in headquarters, the PEPFAR country team  often participates heavily in the development of such strategies through  direct advising as well as technical assistance through implementing  partners. For example, the CDC officials in-country often help with  surveillance activities and providing data to the host government in order  to base the strategy on the most updated information on the epidemic.  PEPFAR officials and other stakeholders in three of the four countries we  visited also spoke about heavy PEPFAR involvement in the development  of the strategies in those countries. These officials told us that PEPFAR\u2019s  participation in these processes both improves the quality of the national  strategy and creates buy-in among program stakeholders, ultimately  enhancing PEPFAR alignment with national strategies. PEPFAR country  team officials also told us that national strategy time frames may affect  PEPFAR\u2019s ability to align its programs. For example, in Malawi, PEPFAR  country officials were able to generate the 2010 COP based on Malawi\u2019s  newly revised and updated multisectoral national strategy. Conversely,  PEPFAR officials in Cambodia told us that Cambodia\u2019s outdated strategy,  which was undergoing revision at the time of COP development and  submission, complicated the country team\u2019s ability to base the current  year COP on the dated strategy.", "Meetings with partner governments and other stakeholders. PEPFAR  country team participation in periodic meetings with partner country  government officials, other donors, and civil society organizations helps to  ensure that PEPFAR program activities support national strategies,  according to PEPFAR officials and other HIV/AIDS stakeholders.  Country team officials, partner government officials, and other donor  representatives in the four countries we visited told us that PEPFAR  country team officials participate in periodic advisory and technical area  meetings with government officials and other donor representatives. For  example, in the four countries we visited, we heard that PEPFAR officials  participate in HIV/AIDS or health sector committees, which generally are  led by the host government and include other relevant donors. In addition,  PEPFAR officials participate in government-led technical working groups  focused on specific HIV/AIDS-related areas, such as prevention of mother- to-child transmission or monitoring and evaluation.", "Informal engagement with partner government officials. Regular  informal engagement with partner country government officials helps  PEPFAR country teams to be aware of the needs and goals of the national  HIV/AIDS program, according to PEPFAR country team officials. For  example, the officials noted that in-country CDC staff are embedded in the  Ministry of Health and thus have daily interaction with partner  government officials. This daily communication helps the PEPFAR team  focus on the needs of the partner government and align its activities with  such needs. Country team officials also noted the importance of other  regular interaction and communication between PEPFAR officials and  partner government officials. For example, regular interaction with a  number of ministry officials involved in the national HIV/AIDS program  enables the PEPFAR team to better coordinate with the national program.", "COP development process. PEPFAR country teams engage with country  officials and implementing partners throughout the annual COP  development process, according to PEPFAR officials, partner government  officials, and civil society groups. PEPFAR guidance states that developing  the annual COP provides an opportunity to share information with partner  government officials, which is an essential aspect of effective planning.  In the four countries we visited, officials from ministries including the  national AIDS authority and Ministry of Health told us that they had  discussed the fiscal year 2010 COP with PEPFAR officials. PEPFAR  country team officials and implementing partners in the four countries  also told us that the country teams share information with their  implementing partners in a collaborative process during the annual COP  development process. For example, in the four countries we visited,  PEPFAR officials told us they convened technical working group meetings  of PEPFAR, partner government, and implementing partner officials  throughout the COP process. Through these technical working groups and  ongoing collaboration throughout the COP development process,  implementing partners are able to provide input on the PEPFAR program  and alignment with national strategies.", "Partnership framework development. Development of partnership  frameworks has had a positive effect on PEPFAR alignment and  coordination with other donors, according to OGAC, USAID, and CDC  officials and other PEPFAR stakeholders. OGAC officials reported in June  2010 that 24 countries and two regions had been invited to develop  partnership frameworks and that 7 of these countries, as well as both  regions\u2014Angola, Caribbean, Central America, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho,  Malawi, Swaziland, and Tanzania\u2014had completed and signed a framework  document. PEPFAR officials\u2014including OGAC, USAID, and CDC  officials\u2014told us that partnership framework development in these  countries created a vehicle for more open dialogue among PEPFAR, the  country governments, and other donors. PEPFAR officials also stated that  alignment of PEPFAR activities with these countries\u2019 national HIV/AIDS  strategies improved as a result of close interaction with a range of  stakeholders. Likewise, during our visit to Malawi, PEPFAR and  government officials, as well as other donors, noted improvement in  PEPFAR alignment with national strategies as well as coordination with  other donors\u2019 HIV/AIDS programs as a result of the partnership framework  development process. In addition, our review of the Malawi partnership  framework showed that the goals and objectives are closely aligned with  those laid out in the national strategy.

In addition, other HIV/AIDS  stakeholders and experts noted that PEPFAR often relies on indicators  that can be compiled to report globally but may differ from those used by  individual countries. A PEPFAR official also noted that national strategy  indicators may not always align with international indicators.", "Moreover, PEPFAR\u2019s 5-year strategy states that PEPFAR\u2019s extensive  performance reporting requirements were not always harmonized with  other international indicators. The PEPFAR strategy also states that  PEPFAR will support transition to a single, streamlined national  monitoring and evaluation system. To address this problem, OGAC  published an updated guide for indicators in August 2009, intended to  increase both the inclusion of quality PEPFAR indicators and the  alignment of such indicators with those of other development partners.  OGAC collaborated with international donors and organizations including  the Global Fund, UNAIDS, WHO, and UNICEF to align most PEPFAR- essential indicators with international standards. Specifically, OGAC is  working internationally with multilateral partners to achieve a minimum  core set of global reporting indicators that provides standardized data for  comparison across countries and allows for aggregation at the global level.  According to PEPFAR guidance, through the UNAIDS Monitoring and  Evaluation Reference Group, OGAC and 18 other international multilateral  and bilateral agencies have agreed on a minimum set of standardized  indicators. In addition, PEPFAR will continue to work with this group on  global harmonization of indicators.

In addition, in one country we visited,  officials from some ministries told us they had not received copies of the  COP.

OGAC also expects the development of partnership frameworks to  ultimately enhance alignment of PEPFAR programs with national  HIV/AIDS strategies.

Our  analysis involved several steps.  1.  For each of the four case study countries, we reviewed the national  multisectoral HIV/AIDS strategy to identify goals and objectives. We  then analyzed the technical assistance narratives, which describe the  ongoing and planned activities for each PEPFAR technical area, in the  fiscal year 2010 COP for each of the four countries. Our analysis of the  COP narratives focused on whether each objective and goal in the  national strategy was fully, partially, or not addressed by activities  described in the technical assistance narratives of the 2010 COP. Two  of our staff independently analyzed the COP narratives to identify  areas of alignment between the PEPFAR activities and the national  strategy goals and objectives.  2.  During our visits to the four countries, we discussed our analysis of  national HIV/AIDS strategies and PEPFAR COPs with PEPFAR  officials to identify reasons for identified areas of divergence between  the documents. In particular, we discussed every goal and objective in  the national strategy that our analysis deemed only partially or not  supported by activities described in the technical assistance narratives  of the COP. These conversations enabled us to identify four general  reasons why the technical assistance narratives did not describe  activities that fully support the particular goal or objective: (a) The  goal was being supported by activities of other donors, so PEPFAR  had chosen not to focus in that area. (b) The goal was generally the  responsibility of the national government, or the national government  was not interested in receiving PEPFAR support in that area. (c)  PEPFAR policy restrictions prevented PEPFAR from supporting  certain areas of the national program. (d) PEPFAR activities fully  supported the goal, but owing to space limitations for COP reporting,  these activities were not described in the COP or were described in a  different area of the document, such as the activity descriptions. One  of these four explanations by the PEPFAR team applied in each  instance where we found no or partial alignment between the COP and  the national strategy. We did not find any national strategy goals and  objectives that were accidentally or deliberately not considered or  supported by PEPFAR for reasons other than the four listed above.  3.
