Specifically, GAO determined the extent to which DOD has (1) identified initiatives to reduce health care costs and applied results-oriented management practices in developing plans for implementing and monitoring them and (2) implemented its seven medical governance initiatives approved in 2006 and employed key management practices. For this review, GAO analyzed policies, memorandums, directives, and cost documentation, and interviewed officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, from the three services, and at each of the sites where the governance initiatives were under way."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has identified 11 initiatives aimed at slowing its rising health care costs, but has not fully applied results-oriented management practices in developing plans to implement and monitor its initiatives. Results-oriented management practices include developing plans that identify goals, activities, and performance measures; resources and investments; organization roles, responsibilities, and coordination; and key external factors that could affect goals, such as a decrease of funding to a program. At the conclusion of GAO\u0092s review, DOD had completed and approved a detailed implementation plan, including a cost savings estimate, for just 1 of its 11 initiatives. Developing cost savings estimates is critical to successful management of the initiatives for achieving the 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review\u0092s call for reduced growth in medical costs. DOD also has not completed the implementation of an overall process for monitoring progress across its portfolio of health care initiatives and has not completed the process of identifying accountable officials and their roles and responsibilities for all of its initiatives. Without comprehensive, results-oriented plans, a monitoring process, and clear leadership accountability, DOD may be hindered in its ability to achieve a more cost-efficient Military Health System, address its medical readiness goals, improve its overall population health, and improve its patients\u0092 experience of care.", "Additionally, DOD has another set of initiatives, which were approved in 2006 to change aspects of its medical governance structure. GAO found that DOD had implemented some of the initiatives but had not consistently employed several key management practices that would have helped it achieve its stated goals and sustain its efforts. DOD approved the implementation of the seven governance initiatives with the goal of achieving economies of scale and operational efficiencies, sharing common support functions, and eliminating administrative redundancies. Specifically, DOD expected the initiatives to save at least $200 million annually once implemented; however, to date, only one initiative has projected any estimated financial savings. DOD officials stated that the other governance initiatives have resulted in efficiencies and have significant potential for cost savings. Further, the governance initiatives that are further developed were driven primarily by requirements of Base Realignment and Closure Commission recommendations and their associated statutory deadlines for completion. Additionally, GAO found that DOD had not consistently employed several key management practices, which likely hindered the full implementation of the initiatives. For example, the initiatives\u0092 initial timeline was high-level and generally not adhered to, a communication strategy was not prepared, an overall implementation team was never established, and performance measures to monitor the implementation process and achievement of the goals were not established. With more emphasis on the key practices of a successful transformation, DOD will be better positioned in the future to realize efficiencies and achieve its goals as it continues to implement the initiatives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD (1) complete and fully implement comprehensive results-oriented plans for each of its medical initiatives; (2) fully implement an overall monitoring process across the portfolio of initiatives and identify accountable officials and their roles and responsibilities; and (3) complete its governance initiatives and employ key management practices to show financial and nonfinancial outcomes and evaluate interim and long-term progress.

DOD\u2019s total  medical costs have more than doubled from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001  to its fiscal year 2013 budget request of $48.7 billion. The Secretary of  Defense stated that the cost of the MHS continues to increase and there  is a need to explore all possibilities to control the costs of military health  care. DOD\u2019s health care system serves about 9.6 million beneficiaries\u2014 including active duty, reserve, and National Guard troops and their  dependents as well as military retirees and their dependents. According  to a 2011 Congressional Budget Office report, DOD\u2019s health care costs  are projected to reach $59 billion by 2016 and nearly $92 billion by 2030.", "Under the current structure, the responsibilities and authorities for the  management of DOD\u2019s MHS are distributed among several organizations,  including the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, who  serves as the principal advisor to the Secretary of Defense and the Under  Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. Health Affairs is  responsible for submitting the Unified Medical Budget a single combined  medical budget for itself and the services\u2019 health operations, and centrally  manages Defense Health Program funds for the military services through  the TRICARE Management Activity, while each of the military services  manages its respective medical personnel and programs. In 2007, the  Defense Health Board stated in its report, Task Force on the Future of  Military Health Care, that DOD\u2019s MHS does not function as a fully  integrated health care system and this lack of integration diffuses  accountability for fiscal management, results in misalignment of  incentives, and limits the potential for continuous improvement in the  quality of care delivered to beneficiaries. Further, we previously identified  DOD\u2019s health care system as an example of a key challenge facing the  U.S. government in the 21st century and an area in which DOD could  improve delivery of services by combining, realigning, or otherwise  changing selected support functions and could achieve economies of  scale.", "Congressional leaders have also raised questions regarding rising military  health costs and DOD\u2019s MHS governance structure. For example, the  House Committee on Armed Services\u2019 Print accompanying the Ike  Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 noted  that the department had not yet developed a comprehensive plan to  enhance quality, efficiencies, and savings in DOD\u2019s MHS, and it  encouraged the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the potential  operational, organizational, and financial benefits of a unified medical  command. We previously identified in our March 2011 report  opportunities to reduce potential duplication in government programs by  realigning DOD\u2019s military medical command structures and consolidating  common functions that could increase efficiencies and reduce costs. We  noted that DOD could potentially save from approximately $281 million to  $460 million annually depending upon the governance option chosen. We  also reported that DOD had actions under way for a concept approved in  November 2006 that directed seven incremental reorganizational  initiatives designed to minimize duplicative layers of command and  control, among other things. For this review, we evaluated Health Affairs\u2019  cost saving efforts and the status of its seven governance initiatives.  Specifically, we determined the extent to which DOD has (1) identified  initiatives to reduce health care costs and applied results-oriented  management practices to develop plans for implementing and monitoring  them and (2) implemented its seven medical governance initiatives  approved in 2006 and employed key management practices.", "To determine the extent to which DOD has identified initiatives to reduce  health care costs, we reviewed documentation and interviewed officials  from the Health Budgets and Financial Policy Office and from the Office  of Strategy Management, within Health Affairs, as well as officials in the  TRICARE Management Activity. Additionally, to determine the extent to  which DOD applied results-oriented management practices to develop  plans for implementing and monitoring its initiatives, we evaluated the one  implementation plan for reducing health care costs that had been  completed at the time of our review. The analyses included comparing the  implementation plan for the completed initiative with results-oriented   and  management practices on which we have previously reporteddrawing conclusions from a consensus of the analyses. To determine the  extent to which DOD has implemented its seven medical governance  initiatives approved in 2006, we visited the locations where DOD\u2019s MHS  governance initiatives were being implemented to collect relevant  documents, interview agency officials, and observe any physical changes  to the locations. We also reviewed cost estimates, budget documents,  business plans, and other instructions, policy statements, and documents  related to progress made. Additionally, we interviewed officials within the  Office of the Secretary of Defense and the military services concerning  the initiatives\u2019 implementation status. Further, to determine the extent to  which DOD employed key management practices in implementing its  seven medical governance initiatives approved in 2006, we identified prior  reports that documented key management practices of successful  transformational efforts. Using these practices as a guide, as well as  documentation and discussions with MHS officials, we assessed DOD\u2019s  actions taken and processes employed while implementing its seven  governance initiatives. Throughout this report, we used financial data for  illustrative purposes to provide context on DOD\u2019s efforts and to make  broad estimates about potential costs savings.

Health Affairs issues policies, procedures, and  standards that govern management of DOD medical programs and has  the authority to issue DOD instructions, publications, and directive-type  memorandums that implement policy approved by the Secretary of  Defense or the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness.  It integrates the services\u2019 budget submissions into a unified medical  budget that provides resources for DOD\u2019s MHS operations. However,  Health Affairs lacks direct command and control of the services\u2019 military  treatment facilities. See figure 2 for the current organizational structure of  DOD\u2019s MHS.", "Operationally, DOD\u2019s MHS has two missions: supporting wartime and  other deployments, known as the readiness mission, and providing  peacetime care, known as the benefits mission. The readiness mission  provides medical services and support to the armed forces during military  operations, including deploying medical personnel and equipment  throughout the world, and ensures the medical readiness of troops prior  to deployment. The benefits mission provides medical services and  support to members of the armed forces, retirees, and their dependents.  DOD\u2019s dual health care mission is delivered by the military services at 59  military treatment facilities capable of providing diagnostic, therapeutic,  and inpatient care, as well as hundreds of clinics and private sector  civilian providers. The military treatment facilities make up what is known  as DOD\u2019s direct care system for providing health care to eligible  beneficiaries. The Departments of the Army and the Navy each have a  medical command, headed by a surgeon general, who manages each  department\u2019s respective military treatment facilities and other activities  through a regional command structure. The Navy\u2019s Bureau of Medicine  and Surgery supports both the Navy and Marine Corps. The Air Force  Surgeon General, through the role of medical advisor to the Air Force  Chief of Staff, exercises similar authority to that of the other surgeons  general. Each service also recruits, trains, and funds its own medical  personnel to administer the medical programs and provide medical  services to beneficiaries. For the management of military treatment  facilities within the National Capital Region and the execution of related  Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) actions in that area, an  additional medical organizational structure and reporting chain was  established in 2007. This structure is known as the Joint Task Force  National Capital Region Medical, whose Commander reports to the  Deputy Secretary of Defense, and the two inpatient medical facilities in  the area are considered joint commands assigned to the task force.

DOD\u2019s initiatives generally reflect broader  concepts that were discussed by health care experts, business leaders,  and public officials at two separate forums convened by GAO in 2004 and  2007 on ideas for responding to cost and other challenges in the health  care system. For example, in the 2004 forum, 55 percent of participants  strongly agreed that the U.S. health care system is characterized by both  underuse of wellness and preventive care and overuse of high-tech  procedures. In addition, the plenary speakers at the 2004 forum observed  that unwarranted variation in medical practices nationwide points to  quality and efficiency problems. Similarly, DOD developed initiatives that  seek to increase the productivity of and to ease access to primary care  and encourage wellness, preventive, and evidence-based health care.  Further, in the 2007 forum, 77 percent of participants strongly agreed that  the federal government should revise its payment systems and leverage  its purchasing authority to foster value-based purchasing for health care  products and services. Similarly, MHS officials discussed potential  changes that led to the fourth and fifth initiatives as listed in table 2. Both  initiatives involve changes to payment for medical care to reward quality  of care and health outcomes instead of volume of services rendered.  Another of the 11 initiatives aims to reduce costs by keeping patients as  healthy as possible during treatment and recovery.

While DOD acknowledged that some staff will  be committed full-time to working on this initiative, it did not show in the  plan, as prescribed, the number of personnel needed in total to implement  the initiative. A DOD official noted that the section in the plan that asks for  the number of personnel needed was intended for officials to show if  additional personnel and funding beyond the current level were needed.  However, the absence of information concerning DOD\u2019s use of current  staff renders the size of the initiative\u2019s impact on utilization of personnel  unclear. In addition, the Patient Centered Medical Home implementation  plan\u2019s annual cost savings estimate did not reflect net losses when they  occur in a given fiscal year.

While it provided an extensive overview of internal and external  challenges, DOD did not outline a specific process for monitoring such  developments. Further, the implementation plan does not fully explore the  effect of such challenges on the program\u2019s goals or explain how it takes  such challenges into account, such as by outlining a mitigation strategy to  overcome them.", "As DOD further develops its dashboards and implementation plans and  incorporates the desired characteristics, it will be in a stronger position to  better manage its reforms and ultimately achieve cost savings. For  example, DOD was experiencing a 5.5 percent annual increase in per  capita costs for its enrolled population according to data available as of  December 2011, but DOD had set its target ceiling for per capita health  care cost increases for fiscal year 2011 at a lower rate of 3.1 percent.  According to DOD calculations using 2011 enrollee and cost data, if DOD  had met its target ceiling of 3.1 percent increase as opposed to a 5.5  percent increase, the 2.4 percent reduction would have resulted in  approximately $300 million in savings.

We have also reported that clearly defining areas of  responsibility is a key process that provides management with a  framework for planning, directing, and controlling operations to achieve  goals. In addition, as MHS leaders develop and implement their plans to  control rising health care costs, they will need to work across multiple  authorities and areas of responsibility. As the 2007 Task Force on the  Future of Military Health Care noted, the current MHS does not function  as a fully integrated health care system. As we reported in October  2005, agreement on roles and responsibilities is a key step to  successful collaboration when working across organizational boundaries,  such as the military services. Committed leadership by those involved in  the collaborative effort, from all levels of the organization, is also needed  to overcome the many barriers to working across organizational  boundaries.

Further, BRAC implementation  requirements drove implementation progress for a number of initiatives.  At a GAO forum in September 2002, leaders with experience managing  large-scale organizational mergers, acquisitions, and transformations  identified at least nine key practices and lessons learned from major  private and public sector organizational mergers, acquisitions, and  transformations. During the course of our work examining DOD\u2019s health  care initiatives, we determined that six of the key practices identified at  our 2002 forum were especially important to ensure that DOD has the  framework needed to implement its governance initiatives: (1) a focus on  a key set of principles and priorities that are embedded in the  organization to reinforce the new changes, (2) coherent mission and  integrated strategic goals to guide the transformation, (3) implementation  goals and a timeline to build momentum and show progress from day  one, (4) a communication strategy to create shared expectations and  report related progress, (5) a dedicated implementation team with the  responsibility and authority to drive the department\u2019s governance  initiatives, and (6) committed and sustained leadership.", "To its credit, DOD developed a set of guiding principles to facilitate its  transformation of DOD\u2019s medical command structure. A clear set of  principles and priorities can serve as a framework to help the agency  create a new culture and drive employee behavior. For example, a set of  core values can become embedded in every aspect of the organization  and can serve as an anchor that remains valid and enduring while  organizations, personnel, programs, and processes change. Senior DOD  officials developed a set of guiding principles to direct efforts throughout  the governance transformation. These principles and goals were included  in the November 2006 memorandum: (1) provide a healthy, fit and  protected force; (2) create a trained, ready, and highly capable medical  force that delivers superior medical support; and (3) ensure efficient  delivery of a comprehensive health benefit to eligible beneficiaries.", "Although DOD provided initial guidance and strategic goals in its  November 2006 memorandum, it did not follow leading results-oriented  strategic planning guidance by establishing performance measures. As  we have previously reported, effective implementation includes adopting  leading practices for results-oriented strategic planning and reporting,  such as establishing specific and measurable performance measures for  the transformed organization. In addition, intermediate measures can be  used to provide information on interim results and show progress toward  intended results. DOD provided initial guidance, which includes strategic  goals to assist in the implementation of the governance transformation.  For example, the memo provided that lessons learned from the  consolidation and realignment of health care delivery within the National  Capital Region and San Antonio be used as the basis for establishment of  similar structures in other multiservice medical markets. However, MHS  officials stated that Health Affairs did not fully monitor and evaluate the  progress of its governance initiatives using performance measures.  Specifically, DOD leaders stated that specific measures to evaluate the  outcomes of the different governance approaches taken in these two  locations had not been established. Therefore, DOD lacked information  that would be useful in deciding if governance changes are needed in  other multiservice medical markets. Such measurable outcomes provide  the information DOD needs to determine if it is meeting its goals, make  informed decisions, and track the progress of the governance  transformation activities.", "The November 2006 memorandum provided a brief, initial 3-year  timetable for the implementation of the governance transformation  initiatives; however, this timetable is high level and did not contain interim  dates indicating progress. Besides meeting the approval date of the  memorandum, MHS officials did not meet any of the other major dates  that were set in the timetable. We have reported that establishing  implementation goals and a timeline is critical to ensuring success, as  well as pinpointing performance shortfalls and gaps and suggesting  midcourse corrections. A transformation, such as changing DOD\u2019s MHS  governance, is a substantial commitment that could take years before it is  completed and therefore must be carefully managed and monitored to  achieve success. At a minimum, successful mergers and transformations  should have careful and thorough interim plans in place well before the  effective implementation date. However, the timetable lacked any  interim goals. While DOD has made progress in implementing the three  initiatives that were related to BRAC recommendations, this is most likely  because DOD was required by law to complete most implementation of  BRAC recommendations by September 15, 2011, and to have a  monitoring process in place to support these efforts. These three  initiatives are (1) create governance structures to command, control, and  manage the combined operations at the military treatment facilities in the  National Capital Area and in the San Antonio, Texas, area; (2) create a  governance structure to command, control, and manage the Joint Medical  Education and Training Campus in San Antonio, Texas; and (3) colocate  Health Affairs, TMA, and the services\u2019 medical headquarters staff.  However, the latest completion date for the colocation of the Health  Affairs, TMA, and the services\u2019 medical headquarters staff is the summer  of 2012. DOD\u2019s governance initiatives may have been better implemented  if MHS officials had maintained a long-term focus on the transformation  by setting both short- and long-term goals to show progress and  developing a more complete and specific timetable to guide the efforts.", "DOD has not established an effective and ongoing communication  strategy to allow MHS officials to distribute information about its  governance changes early and often. Key practices suggest that a  transforming organization develop a comprehensive communication  strategy that reaches out to employees, customers, and stakeholders and  seeks to genuinely engage them in the transformation process. This  includes communicating early and often to build trust, ensuring  consistency of message, encouraging two-way communication, and  providing information to meet specific needs of employees. While MHS  officials communicated their transformation initiatives in the 2007  TRICARE Stakeholders\u2019 Report, subsequent reports did not contain any  references to the governance initiatives. In addition, the 2008 Military  Health System Strategic Plan references a goal to \u201cimprove governance  by aligning authority and accountability\u201d as a strategic priority; however,  the plan does not elaborate on how this goal will be met, and it has not  been reissued since. Furthermore, the lack of a communication strategy  is evident based on the fact that officials in San Antonio responsible for  the initiatives related to establishing the Joint Medical Education and  Training Campus and San Antonio Military Health System told us they  were unaware of the approved governance initiatives. DOD has not  developed an approach to communicate its governance transformation  initiatives with stakeholders to ensure that they have a basic  understanding of their role and involvement. Without a comprehensive  communication strategy, MHS officials will remain limited in their ability to  gain support for the governance transformation. Further, this lack of  communication can create confusion or a lack of awareness among  stakeholders, which can place the success of DOD\u2019s initiatives at risk.", "DOD did not form an overarching implementation team for all seven of its  initiatives to direct their progress. Our prior work has shown that a  dedicated team vested with necessary authority and resources to help set  priorities, make timely decisions, and move quickly to implement   As we have  decisions is critical for a successful transformation.previously reported, a strong and stable implementation team responsible  for day-to-day management is important to ensuring that a transformation  effort receives the focused, full-time attention needed to be sustained and  successful. The Deputy Secretary of Defense\u2019s November 2006  memorandum directed DOD to build such a team by 2007. Instead,  according to a DOD official, it initiated independent transition teams to  guide the implementation of some of its initiatives, such as the Joint Task  Force National Capital Region Medical and the colocation of the MHS\u2019s  and the services\u2019 medical headquarters staff. The lack of an overarching  implementation team likely hampered progress and contributed to uneven  progress in the implementation of the initiatives.", "GAO-03-669.", "Defense internal efficiencies review. Further, officials told us that the lack  of Senate-confirmed, presidentially appointed leadership also presented  challenges in moving forward with governance changes. For example, the  position of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness  was vacant from January 2009 to February 2010, and the position of  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs was vacant from April  2009 to January 2011. According to officials, these vacancies hindered  progress toward greater unification, as someone temporarily filling the  position may be reluctant to make major decisions to change the strategic  direction of the MHS. Without involved and sustained military and civilian  leadership being held accountable to guide and sustain progress of its  initiatives, it may be difficult for the department to fully and successfully  achieve its governance transformation.", "Overall, DOD did not consistently employ key management practices to  help improve the implementation of its MHS governance initiatives or to  evaluate the extent to which it accomplished the initiatives\u2019 costs savings  and other performance goals. As a result, the gaps we identified may  have created risks that undermined DOD\u2019s efforts as it began to  implement its plans.

MHS  medical-related and governance-related initiatives represent potential  opportunities to implement more efficient ways of doing business, reduce  overhead, and slow the rate of cost growth while continuing to meet the  needs of military personnel, retirees, and their dependents. While DOD  has developed a number of medical initiatives aimed at slowing health  care cost increases, successful implementation will depend upon  incorporating characteristics of results-oriented management practices,  sustaining top military and civilian leadership that holds officials  accountable for achieving agency goals, and establishing clear cost  savings targets where applicable. By fully employing the characteristics of  results-oriented management with greater attention to its investments and  resources and key external factors that could affect the achievement of its  goals, DOD will gain more assurance that it is effectively managing its  health care initiatives and saving money. Additionally, opportunities exist  for an improved governance structure that can result in direct cost  savings but also help to drive clinical savings. As DOD moves forward  with its governance, clinical, and other initiatives, significant financial  savings as well as other efficiencies may be possible with the appropriate  level of management attention to ensure success. With sound decision  making and analysis and by consistently employing key management  practices throughout their implementation, DOD officials will be in a  position to make informed decisions, to better measure DOD\u2019s progress  toward its cost and performance goals, and to be more assured that their  efforts yield necessary improvements and achieve efficiencies within the  MHS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to enhance DOD\u2019s efforts to manage rising health care costs and  demonstrate sustained leadership commitment for achieving the  performance goals of the MHS\u2019s strategic initiatives, we recommend that  the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness direct the  Assistant Secretary of Defense for Health Affairs, in conjunction with the  service surgeons general, to take the following three actions:", "Complete and fully implement, within an established time frame, the  dashboards and detailed implementation plans for each of the  approved health care initiatives in a manner that incorporates the  desired characteristics of results-oriented management practices,  such as the inclusion of performance metrics, investment costs, and  cost savings estimates.", "Complete the implementation of an overall monitoring process across  DOD\u2019s portfolio of initiatives for overseeing the initiatives\u2019 progress  and identifying accountable officials and their roles and  responsibilities for all of its initiatives.", "Complete the implementation of the governance initiatives that are  already under way by employing key management practices in order  to show financial and nonfinancial outcomes and to evaluate both  interim and long-term progress of the initiatives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["In written comments provided in response to a draft of this report, DOD  concurred with our findings and recommendations.

To perform this comparison, we developed a data collection  instrument that contained desirable characteristics and elements that help  establish comprehensive strategies using information from prior GAO  work examining national strategies and logistics issues. The data  collection instrument included the following six desirable characteristics:  1.  Mission statement: A comprehensive statement that summarizes the  main purposes of the plan. 2.  Problem definition, scope, and methodology: Presents the issues to  be addressed by the plan, the scope of its coverage, the process by  which it was developed, and key considerations and assumptions  used in the development of the plan. 3.  Goals, objectives, activities, milestones, and performance measures:  The identification of goals and objectives to be achieved by the plan,  activities or actions to achieve those results, as well as milestones  and performance measures. 4.  Resources and investments: The identification of costs to execute the  plan and the sources and types of resources and investments,  including skills and technology and the human, capital, information,  and other resources required to meet the goals and objectives. 5.  Organizational roles, responsibilities, and coordination: The  development of roles and responsibilities in managing and overseeing  the implementation of the plan and the establishment of mechanisms  for multiple stakeholders to coordinate their efforts throughout  implementation and make necessary adjustments to the plan based  on performance. 6.  Key external factors that could affect the achievement of goals: The  identification of key factors external to the organization and beyond its  control that could significantly affect the achievement of the long-term  goals contained in the plan.

The six key practices we used in our analysis were ensure top leadership drives the transformation, establish a coherent mission and integrated strategic goals to guide  the transformation,  focus on a key set of principles and priorities at the outset of the  transformation,  set implementation goals and a timeline to build momentum and show  progress from day one, dedicate an implementation team to manage the transformation establish a communication strategy to create shared expectations and  report related progress.", "We decided to exclude the following three practices: (1) the use of the  performance management system to define responsibility and assure  accountability for change, (2) the involvement of employees to obtain their  ideas and ownership for the transformation, and (3) the adaptation of  leading practices to build a world-class organization. Rather, we  assessed DOD\u2019s use of each of the six of the practices because DOD  either employed a practice to some degree or the practice was  appropriate given DOD\u2019s position in the transformational process.
