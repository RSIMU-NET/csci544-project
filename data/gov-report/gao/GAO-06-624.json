To maximize their use of wood, forest product companies rely on research into new methods for using wood. At least 12 federal agencies have provided support to wood utilization research and product development activities, including the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service and Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (CSREES)-funded wood utilization research centers, which historically have specifically targeted support to these activities. GAO was asked to identify (1) the types of wood utilization research and product development activities federal agencies support and how these activities are coordinated; (2) the level of support federal agencies made available for these activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and changes in the level of support at the Forest Service and at the CSREES-funded wood utilization research centers for fiscal years 1995 through 2005; and (3) how the federal government transfers the technologies and products from its wood utilization research and product development activities to industry. GAO provided a draft of this report to the 12 federal agencies for review and comment. Some of the agencies provided technical comments, which were incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal wood utilization research and product development span a broad spectrum of activities. These activities fall into five categories: harvesting, wood properties, manufacturing and processing, products and testing, and economics and marketing. Of the 12 federal agencies that provided support to wood utilization research and product development, only the Forest Service and the CSREES-funded wood utilization centers had activities in all five categories; although all the agencies had activities in manufacturing and processing. Coordination of these activities is both informal and formal. Scientists informally coordinate their activities by conferring with each other and sharing information at conferences and professional meetings and through publications. In some cases, coordination occurs through more formal mechanisms, such as cooperative arrangements and other joint ventures. During fiscal years 2004 and 2005, the 12 federal agencies made available at least $54 million annually for wood utilization research and product development activities, measured either in budget authority or expenditures. (Dollars are reported in either budget authority or expenditure data, depending on the availability of agency data.) The Forest Service made available about half of these funds. In addition, the Forest Service--the only agency that directly employs scientists and support staff to conduct wood utilization research and product development--reported having almost 175 full-time equivalent scientists and support staff in each of these years. For fiscal years 1995 through 2005, the Forest Service's budget authority for wood utilization research and product development activities fluctuated moderately from year-to-year (in inflationadjusted dollars). In contrast, overall, CSREES' budget authority for the wood utilization research centers increased over the period (in inflation-adjusted dollars), in part because of the addition of four new wood utilization research centers between fiscal years 1999 and 2004. To transfer technologies and products to industry, federal agencies generally rely on scientists and technology transfer specialists, who use methods such as information sharing, technical assistance, and demonstration projects. For example, applying research from the Forest Products Laboratory, Forest Service technology transfer specialists assisted a small forest products company in producing flooring from small trees by, among other things, providing solutions to product imperfections like warping and discoloration."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More wood is consumed every year in the United States than all metals,  More wood is consumed every year in the United States than all metals,  plastics, and masonry cement combined.

For  reporting purposes, we primarily relied on the CRIS summary information  to describe the selected research activities presented in appendix III.", "To identify other CSREES wood utilization research and product  development activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, CSREES officials  queried the CRIS database using key search codes to identify the wood  utilization research and product development activities being conducted  under other CSREES-funded grant programs. At the time of our review,  the CRIS database did not contain complete information for fiscal year  2005. We reviewed the grant projects\u2014104\u2014that fell within our definition  of wood utilization research and product development.", "To collect information on wood utilization research and product  development from the remaining 10 agencies, we interviewed agency  officials and reviewed and summarized available information on the  research activities for fiscal years 2004 and 2005.", "To obtain information on the coordination of wood utilization and product  development activities among the 12 federal agencies, we interviewed  agency officials to obtain their views on the use of informal and formal  coordination mechanisms. For all agencies, we obtained this information  through interviews with program officials and scientists. In the case of  CSREES wood utilization research centers, we obtained this information  through a data collection instrument sent to the program leader at each  center. In addition, we obtained documents on selected formal  coordinating mechanisms, such as interagency agreements. We also  attended the \u201cAgenda 2020\u201d meeting sponsored by the Forest Service in  2005, which is held annually to exchange information between industry  and Forest Service scientists performing wood utilization research and  product development activities. The Forest Service uses these meetings to  seek industry views on research results and future research needs. We also  examined relevant laws, regulations, and agency polices related to  coordination for wood utilization research and product development.", "To address the second objective\u2014describe the level of support federal  agencies made available for wood utilization research and product  development activities in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and changes in the  level of support at the Forest Service and CSREES wood utilization  research centers from fiscal years 1995 through 2005\u2014we collected  budget authority or expenditure information from the 12 agencies for  fiscal years 2004 and 2005, and from the Forest Service and CSREES\u2019  wood utilization centers for fiscal years 1995 through 2005. We reported  dollars in either budget authority or expenditure data, depending on the  availability of agency data. We analyzed these data in both nominal  (actual) dollars and dollars adjusted for inflation (real). Most agencies  and programs received congressional committee-directed budget authority  for wood utilization research and product development or allocated a  portion of their budget authority for these activities. Those budget  authority amounts are reported when available. However, the only data  available for the other CSREES grants and for the National Science  Foundation were expenditure data.", "For information on CSREES\u2019 budget authority for the wood utilization  research centers for fiscal years 1995 to 2005 for the grants awarded to the  wood utilization research centers, the CSREES official explained how the  funds were allocated across the 10 wood utilization research centers over  the 11-year period. These data were used to show the historical trends of  investment dollars for wood utilization research and product development  over the past 11 years. (See app. IV.)", "In addition to the budget authority for the CSREES wood utilization  research centers, we obtained expenditure data for the wood utilization  research and product development activities conducted under the  authority of the McIntyre\u2013Stennis Act, the Hatch Act, the National  Research Initiative, the Small Business Innovation Research Grants, and  other small grants, which can fund wood utilization research and product  development. We obtained specific expenditure amounts for these  activities for fiscal year 2004 from the CRIS database system. Fiscal year  2005 data were not available for these CSREES activities.", "For the Forest Service, we obtained information on budget authority from  an internal agency review of research stations and research work units.  We used this information to provide an overview of the changes in budget  authority for wood utilization research and product development for fiscal  years 1995 through 2005. See appendix IV for the budget authority for each  research work unit over this period. In addition, we interviewed Forest  Service budget officials in headquarters, the Forest Products Laboratory,  and the State and Private Forestry Program on budget and other funding  issues, such as the allocation of funds and setting of research funding  priorities. We concluded that the data provided in the agency survey were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our review.", "We also reviewed and summarized information from Forest Service  documents on the number of scientists and research support staff at the  Forest Service\u2014the only agency that has full-time federal employees who  directly conduct wood utilization research and product development  activities. We reported the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) staff at  each of the 27 research work units that conducted research on wood  utilization and product development for fiscal years 1995 through 2005.  (See app. IV.)", "To collect funding information from the remaining agencies, we asked  budget and program officials for budget authority or expenditure  information for fiscal years 2004 and 2005 for wood utilization research  and product development. Specifically, the National Science Foundation  provided us with expenditure information from its Project Reports  Summary and Search and Awards databases because that is the only way it  could identify the amounts devoted to wood utilization research and  product development. We interviewed knowledgeable agency officials  regarding the reliability of these data. We used the data for descriptive  purposes only, and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  these purposes.", "The funding for Defense\u2019s Army, Corps of Engineers, and Office of Naval  Research; and the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Coast Guard were  congressional committee-directed funds or budget authority. However, for  the Office of Naval Research and the Coast Guard, we reported  expenditures because those amounts were applicable to our time period\u2014 fiscal years 2004 and 2005.", "To respond to objective three\u2014how the federal government transfers  technologies and products from its wood utilization research and product  development activities to industry\u2014we obtained and reviewed relevant  legislation and policies and procedures on federal technology transfer  activities. At the Forest Service, we interviewed and obtained examples of  successful technology transfer from project leaders at the 27 research  work units that are responsible for wood utilization research and product  development; a patent attorney; technology transfer program managers at  the Technology Marketing Unit located at the Forest Products Laboratory;  and technology transfer specialists in the State and Private Forestry  Program. At CSREES, we had discussions with program research officials  and extension specialists. In addition, we sent a short data collection  instrument to the 10 wood utilization research centers to obtain  information on how they transfer the results of their research to industry,  as well as to obtain examples of successful transfer efforts. We did not  assess the success of these agencies\u2019 reported efforts, nor did we try to  quantify the results of these efforts.", "We also conducted site visits at a limited number of federal, university,  and industrial facilities\u2014the Forest Products Laboratory; Forest Service  facilities in Virginia, West Virginia, and Oregon; the wood utilization  research center at Oregon State University; the Western Wood Producers  Association; the APA Engineered Wood Association; and a Weyerhaeuser  Company research laboratory in Washington State. We also visited a  sawmill, a manufacturer of wooden steps and stair posts, a manufacturer  of engineered products, and a cabinet maker, and attended the 2005  Northeast Utilization and Marketing Council\u2019s conference.
