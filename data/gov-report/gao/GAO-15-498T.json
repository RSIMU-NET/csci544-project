Since 2007 when GAO last reported on airport funding, airports of all sizes have experienced significant changes in aviation activity. Financing for airport capital improvements is based on a mix of federal AIP grants, federally authorized but statutorily-capped PFCs, and locally generated aviation-related and non-aviation-related revenues. As deliberations begin in advance of FAA's 2015 reauthorization, Congress is faced with considering the most appropriate type, level, and distribution of federal support for development of the National Airspace System.", "This testimony discusses trends in (1) aviation activity at airports since 2007, (2) forecasted airport capacity needs and airports' planned development costs, and (3) financing for airport development. This testimony is based on previous GAO reports issued from June 2007 through December 2014, with selected updates conducted through April 2015. To conduct these updates, GAO reviewed recent information on FAA's program activities and analyses outlined in FAA reports, including the 2015 aviation forecast, and the 2015\u20132019 planned airport-development estimates."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Economic factors, since 2007, have led to fewer scheduled commercial flights, a trend more pronounced for some types of airports. These economic factors include not just the volatile fuel prices and the 2007 to 2009 recession but also evolving airline practices, such as airline mergers and the adoption of business models that demonstrate capacity management. For example, as GAO reported in June 2014, the number of scheduled flights at medium- and small-hub airports has declined at least 20 percent from 2007 to 2013, compared to about a 9 percent decline at large-hub airports. General Aviation (GA) has also declined in activity, as measured by the number of GA aircraft operations and hours flown, due to similar economic factors. In recent years, however, passenger growth has rebounded. According to the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) projections, U.S. airline passenger growth is predicted to grow 2 percent per year through 2035\u2014a growth rate that is slightly lower than that of past forecasts.", "According to FAA estimates, the number of airports that require additional capacity to handle flight operations to avoid delays has declined since 2004. Similarly, the future cost of planned airport development has also declined in recent years. Earlier this year, FAA projected that 6 airports will be capacity constrained in 2020 compared to 41 in the 2004 projection. Even with this improvement, some airports\u2014like those in the New York City area region\u2014will remain capacity constrained, according to FAA. The overall improved capacity situation is also reflected in reduced estimates of future airport-development costs that are eligible for federal grants. In September 2014, the FAA estimated that for the period 2015 through 2019, airports have about $33.5 billion in planned development projects eligible for federal Airport Improvement Program (AIP) grants\u2014a 21 percent reduction from the $42.5 billion estimate for the time period 2013 through 2017. The biggest decline in planned development costs among project categories is in capacity projects such as new runway projects. However, an airport industry association estimated planned airport capital project costs, both those eligible and not eligible for AIP, of $72.5 billion for 2015 through 2019, an increase of 6.2 percent from the association's prior 5-year estimate for 2013 through 2017.", "As traditional funding sources for airport development have generally declined, airports have increasingly relied on other sources of financing. Specifically, federal AIP grants and Passenger Facility Charges (PFC) are two primary sources of federally authorized funding for airports. The amount made available for AIP decreased from over $3.5 billion for fiscal years 2007 through 2011 to less than $3.4 billion for fiscal year 2015. Further the President's 2016 proposed budget calls for additional reductions in AIP, though it would be offset with a proposed increase in the PFC cap, which is currently $4.50 per flight segment. Airports have sought additional opportunities to collect non-aviation revenues. As a result, according to FAA, non-aviation revenue has increased each year from 2008 through 2014. For example, airports have 1) partnered with the private sector to fund airport improvements; 2) identified new business ventures on airport property including the development of commercial retail, leisure activities, and medical facilities; and 3) explored options for privatization."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss airport capacity and funding  issues in light of a changing aviation industry.

While  passenger activity has rebounded close to 2007 levels, the total number  of operations has not, leaving many airports with reduced activity. Even  so, airport capacity\u2014that is, the maximum number of flight operations an  airport can handle over a period of time\u2014is still a problem for some  airports, resulting in significant delays for passengers throughout the  National Airspace System (NAS). While, according to Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA), only nine new commercial service airports have  been built in the United States over the last three decades, billions of  dollars have been invested in expanding new capacity, such as runways,  and in maintaining and upgrading existing airports during that time.  However, since 2007, federal financing sources for airport development  have seen small declines, especially when considering inflation. The FAA  forecasts that the NAS will need to accommodate more than 1 billion  passenger enplanements and almost 57 million aircraft operations  annually by 2029\u2014an increase from 756 million enplanements and 49  million aircraft operations in 2014\u2014as FAA forecasts aviation activity to  grow by an average of 2 percent per year over the next 20 years.

Of these, roughly  3,300 airports are designated by FAA as part of the national airport  system and thus are eligible for federal assistance.", "The national airport system consists of two primary types of airports\u2014 commercial service airports, which have scheduled service and enplane  2,500 or more passengers per year, and general aviation (GA) airports,  which have no scheduled service and enplane fewer than 2,500  passengers annually. FAA divides commercial service airports into  primary airports (enplaning more than 10,000 passengers annually) and  commercial service nonprimary airports. The 395 current primary airports  are classified by hub type\u2014large-, medium-, small-, and nonhub\u2014based  on passenger traffic. Passenger traffic is highly concentrated: 88 percent  of all passengers in the United States enplaned at the 63 large- or  medium-hub airports in 2013 (see fig. 1).", "More than 2,900 airports in the national system are designated as GA  airports. These airports range from large business aviation and cargo  shipment centers that handle thousands of operations a year to small  rural airports that may handle only a few hundred operations per year but  may provide important access to the national transportation system for  their communities.", "Generally, the level of aviation activity, whether commercial passenger  and cargo or general aviation business and private aircraft, helps to  generate the funds that finance airport development. The three primary  sources of funding for airport development are Airport Improvement  Program (AIP) grants, PFCs, and locally generated revenue. All three  sources of funds are linked to passenger aviation activity.", "AIP is supported by the Airport and Airway Trust Fund (AATF), which  is funded by airline ticket taxes and fees; GA flights contribute to the  AATF through a tax on aviation jet fuel. Airports included in FAA\u2019s  NPIAS are eligible to receive AIP entitlement (apportionment) grants  based on airports\u2019 size and can also compete for AIP discretionary  grants. AIP grants can only be used for eligible capital projects,  generally those that enhance capacity, safety, and environmental  conditions, such as runway construction and rehabilitation, airfield  lighting and marking, and airplane noise mitigation. The amount  made available in AIP appropriations totaled $3.35 billion in fiscal year  2014. The grants generally require matching funds from the local  match ranging from 10 to 25 percent depending on the size of the  airport and type of project.", "PFCs, another source of funding for airport development projects, are  a federally authorized, statutorily-capped, airport-imposed fee of up to  a maximum of $4.50 per enplaned passenger per flight segment, and  a maximum of $18 per round trip ticket. The PFC is collected by the  airline on the passenger ticket and remitted to the airports (minus a  small administrative fee retained by the airline). Introduced in 1991,  and capped at $3.00 per flight segment, PFC collections can be  used by airports for the same types of projects as AIP grants, but also  to pay interest costs on debt issued for those projects. Since its  inception, landside development projects\u2014including, for example,  new terminal projects\u2014and interest payments on debt used to finance  eligible projects have each accounted for 34 percent of total PFC  collections spent. The maximum level of PFCs was last increased in   Collections totaled almost $2.8 billion in calendar year 2014.  2000.According to FAA, 358 commercial service airports are collecting  PFCs as of February 2015.", "Airports also fund development projects from revenues generated  directly by the airport. Airports generate revenues from aviation  activities such as aircraft landing fees and terminal rentals, and non- aviation activities such as concessions, parking, and land leases.  Aviation revenues are the traditional method for funding airport  development and, along with PFCs, are used to finance the issuance  of local tax-exempt debt. Because of the size and duration of some  airport development projects\u2014for example, a new runway can take  more than a decade and several billion dollars to complete\u2014long-term  debt can be the only way to finance these types of projects.", "FAA\u2019s main planning tool for identifying future airport-capital projects is  the NPIAS. FAA relies on airports, through their planning processes, to  identify individual projects for funding consideration. According to FAA  officials, FAA reviews input from individual airports and state aviation  agencies and validates both eligibility and justification for the project over  the ensuing five-year period. Because the estimated cost of eligible  airport projects that airports plan to perform greatly exceeds the available  grant funding available for these projects, FAA uses a priority system  based on airport and project type to allocate the available funds. The  Airports Council International-North America (ACI-NA), a trade  association for airports, also estimates the cost of planned airport capital  projects.", "While almost all airport sponsors in the United States are states,  municipalities, or specially created public authorities, there is still a  significant reliance on the private sector for finance, expertise, and control  of airport assets. For example, we have previously reported that the  majority of airport employees at the nation\u2019s major airports are employed  by private sector firms, such as concessionaires, and some airports are  also operated by private companies. Pursuant to statutory authorization,  since 1996, FAA has been piloting an airport privatization program that  relaxes certain restrictions on the sale or lease of airports to private  entities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Aviation Activity at Many Airports Has Slowed Since 2007", "paragraphs": ["A variety of factors has had a substantial impact on the airline industry.

Specifically, Delta acquired Northwest  in 2008, United and Continental merged in 2010, Southwest acquired  AirTran in 2011, and US Airways and American Airlines merged in 2014.  Although passenger traffic has generally rebounded as the economy has  recovered, the number of commercial aircraft operations has not returned  to 2007 levels as airlines are flying larger and fuller aircraft.", "In June 2014, we found that one outcome of economic pressures and  industry changes had been reductions in U.S. passenger aircraft  operations as measured by scheduled flight operations. Many airports  lost both available seats and flights since 2007 when aircraft operations  last peaked. However, medium- and small-hub airports had proportionally  lost more service than large-hub or nonhub airports, as major airlines  merged and consolidated their flight schedules at the largest airports. In  June 2014, we found\u2014based on our analysis of Department of  Transportation\u2019s (DOT) data\u2014that there were about 1.2 million fewer  scheduled domestic flights in 2007 as compared to 2013 at large-,  medium-, small-hub, and nonhub airports. The greatest reduction in  scheduled flights occurred at medium-hub airports, which decreased  nearly 24 percent from 2007 to 2013, compared to a decrease of about 9  percent at large-hub airports and about 20 percent at small-hub airports.  Medium-hub airports also experienced the greatest percentage reduction  in air service as measured by available seats (see fig. 2). While 2014  passenger activity as represented by the number of passengers onboard  aircraft departing U.S. airports has rebounded nearly back to 2007 levels  (down 4 percent), the total number of commercial passenger and cargo  aircraft departures (operations) in 2014 is still down 18.5 percent since  2007. Declining operations reduces pressure on airports\u2019 airside capacity,  while rebounding passenger traffic could put pressure on airports\u2019  terminals and gates to accommodate passengers.", "We found in June 2014 that air service to small airports, which generally  serve small communities, has declined since 2007 due, in part, to volatile  fuel costs and declining populations in small communities. According to  a study by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), regional  aircraft\u2014those mostly used to provide air service to small communities\u2014 are 40 to 60 percent less fuel efficient than the aircraft used by mainline  carriers at larger hub airports. Further, from 2002 to 2012, fuels costs  quadrupled and became the airlines\u2019 largest expense at nearly 30 percent  of airlines\u2019 operating costs. While more recently oil prices have dropped, it  remains uncertain whether currently low oil prices will continue. The  second major factor affecting small community service is declining  population in many regions of the country over the last 30 years. As a  result, in previous work, we have found that population movement has  decreased demand for air service to certain small communities. For  example, geographic areas, especially in the Midwest and Great Plains  states, lost population from 1980 through 2010, as illustrated in figure 3  below. As a result, certain areas of the country are less densely  populated than they were 35 years ago when the airlines were  deregulated and the Essential Air Service (EAS) was created. For small  communities located close to larger cities and larger airports, a lack of  local demand can be exacerbated by passengers choosing to drive to  airports in larger cities to access better service and lower fares. The EAS  program was created in 1978 to provide subsidies to some small  communities that had service at the time of deregulation. We reported last  year that EAS has grown in cost but did help stem the declines in service  to those communities as compared to other airports.", "In June 2014, we reported that GA activity has also declined since 2007,  particularly affecting airports that rely on general aviation activity for a  large share of their revenue. For GA airports\u2014which generate revenues  from landing fees, fuel sales, and hangar rents\u2014the loss of traffic can  have a significant effect on their ability to fund development. A 2012 MIT  study that examined trends for GA operations at U.S. airports with air-  traffic control towers indicated that from 2000 to 2010, total GA operations  dropped 35 percent. According to the MIT study, the number of annual  hours flown by GA pilots, as estimated by FAA, has also decreased over  the past decade. Numerous factors affect the level of GA operations  including the level of fuel prices, the costs of owning and operating  personal aircraft, and the total number of private pilots and GA aircraft.  For example, we recently reported on the availability of airline pilots and  found that the GA pilot supply pipeline has decreased as fewer students  enter and complete collegiate pilot-training programs and fewer military  pilots are available than in the past."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Airport Capacity Needs and AIP- Eligible Planned Development Costs Have Mostly Declined", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Projected Number of Future Capacity Constrained Airports Has Declined", "paragraphs": ["Earlier this year, FAA reported on airport capacity needs through 2030.
