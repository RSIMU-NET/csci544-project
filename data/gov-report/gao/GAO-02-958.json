Approval times have shortened both for priority drugs--those that FDA expects to offer significant therapeutic benefits beyond drugs already on the market--and standard drugs, which are not thought to have significant therapeutic benefits beyond available drugs. Although the act has increased the funds available for FDA's drug and biological reviews, funds for other activities, such as the regulation of foods and medical devices, have shrunk as a share of FDA's overall budget. The 1997 amendments to the act, which shortened review schedules and set new performance goals to reduce overall drug development time, have increased reviewer workload at FDA. GAO found that some drug reviewers may have forgone training and professional development opportunities to ensure that the new goals were met. FDA officials said that the agency continues to experience high turnover rates among these employees. GAO found that a higher percentage of drugs has been withdrawn from the market for safety reasons since the act was enacted but the that the size of the increase in withdrawal rates differs depending on the period examined. The higher rate of drug withdrawals suggests that FDA needs to strengthen its postmarket surveillance efforts.

Under PDUFA, FDA collects  user fees from the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries to  supplement its annual appropriation for salaries and expenses. PDUFA  requires FDA to use the additional funds for the review of applications.  The original act was set to expire in 1997, but the FDA Modernization Act  of 1997 (FDAMA) extended the PDUFA user fee program for an additional  5 years. The Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2002 extended  PDUFA for 5 more years, effective October 1, 2002.", "As FDA endeavors to reduce its review time under the user fee program,  concerns have been raised about the effects the program may be having on  the resources available to other FDA programs, which set and enforce  safety standards for such products as medical devices, blood products,  cosmetics, and all foods except for meat and poultry. Concerns have also  been raised about the effects of the expedited process on FDA staff  involved in the review process.

Within FDA, CDER and CBER are responsible for  reviewing applications for new drugs and biologics, respectively. The  centers also are responsible for reviewing efficacy supplements,  manufacturing supplements, labeling supplements, and investigational  new drugs. Efficacy supplements are applications for new or expanded  uses of already approved products, including addition of a new indication,  a change in the dosing regimen such as increase or decrease in daily  dosage, or a change in the patient population. Manufacturing supplements  to new drug applications are used to notify the centers in advance of  certain drug manufacturing changes. Investigational new drug applications  are submitted for new drugs or new indications for already approved  drugs that are to be used in clinical investigations.", "The review process for both centers requires evaluating scientific and  clinical data submitted by manufacturers to determine whether the  products meet the agency\u2019s standards for approval. The first decision a  center must make in its review process is whether to accept a new drug  application (NDA) or biologics license application (BLA). FDA can issue  one of several action letters. If the application is not sufficiently complete  to allow a substantive review, the center issues a \u201crefuse-to-file\u201d letter.  Once the center has accepted the application, it designates the product as  either \u201cpriority,\u201d for products that would provide significant therapeutic  gains compared to any existing products on the market, or \u201cstandard,\u201d for  products that would provide no significant therapeutic advantage over  other drugs already on the market. After a thorough assessment of the  information in the application and any supplemental information  requested, the center decides whether to approve the drug based on the  product\u2019s intended use, effectiveness, and the risks and benefits for the  intended population. All medical products are associated with some level  of risk, and a product is considered safe if its risks are determined to be  reasonable given the magnitude of the benefit expected. For decisions on  drugs, CDER may approve the product for marketing (in an \u201capproval  letter\u201d) or it may indicate (in an \u201capprovable letter\u201d) that it can approve  the drug if the sponsor resolves certain issues. Alternatively, it may issue a  \u201cnonapprovable letter\u201d that specifies the issues that make the application  ineligible for FDA approval. The review process is similar for biologics;  however, CBER issues a \u201ccomplete response letter\u201d that specifies all  outstanding issues that would need to be addressed by the sponsor to be  considered for FDA approval.", "The review process may consist of more than one review cycle. The first  review cycle begins when an NDA or a BLA is initially submitted to FDA,  and it ends when FDA has completely reviewed the application and issued  some form of an action letter. If the application is approved in the first  cycle, the \u201capproval time\u201d is recorded as the length of that cycle. The next  cycle of review, if necessary, begins when the application is resubmitted to  FDA.

According to FDA,  approval times for these two types of applications went up in 2000 because  many of them had to go through several review cycles before they were  approved. Multiple review cycles have occurred for several reasons. For  example, after its initial review of an application, FDA may ask the  sponsor to provide new information, such as new clinical trials or data  analyses, to address deficiencies in the initial application. Once the  sponsor provides the requested information, FDA undertakes another  review cycle to examine the information. Also, if FDA completes its  assessment late in the review cycle, it can be difficult to resolve issues  with the sponsor before the review decision deadline. In these cases, FDA  may issue an approvable letter that advises the sponsor that the  application will be approved if certain issues are resolved. Issuing an  approvable letter enables FDA to meet its performance goals without  making a final decision on the application. It also results in the application  going through another review cycle.", "Both FDA and the pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry have  acknowledged that to allow FDA to meet PDUFA review goals, drug and  biologic applications are going through more review cycles. While the  industry\u2019s goal is to obtain approval of an application, FDA can meet the  PDUFA goal by completing its review and issuing an action letter. Our  analysis of approvals confirms that an increased proportion of  applications are going through several review cycles. A smaller percentage  of drugs was approved in the first review cycle in 2001 than in previous  years (see fig. 4). For example, in 1998, 54 percent of standard new drugs  and biologic applications were approved in the first review cycle. In 2001,  37 percent of standard new drugs and biologic applications were approved  in the first review cycle. In response to industry\u2019s concerns, FDA and the  pharmaceutical/biotechnology industry have agreed that the agency will  notify an applicant of deficiencies identified within a specified time frame  after an application is filed with FDA. While an application may be  sufficiently complete for FDA to do a substantive review, the purpose of  FDA\u2019s communication is to alert a company early to deficiencies in its  application that will prevent FDA approval so that it can start addressing  them.", "Additional factors may affect approval times for biologic products. A  CBER official stated that the complexity of cutting-edge technology  involved in developing and manufacturing biologics, such as gene therapy  and bioengineering, may increase approval time. In addition, an FDA  official told us that some biotechnology companies have had difficulties  demonstrating their ability to consistently manufacture products  comparable to those used in their human studies, while others have filed  applications with significant clinical and safety issues that had to be  resolved. According to a CBER official, the center plans to issue more  refuse-to-file letters in such situations at the start of the review cycle to  obtain better-quality applications. CBER officials believe that initiating a  review of an application that is substantially incomplete, for example,  because it omits critical data, or one that raises significant issues is  inherently inefficient and extends review time. A refuse-to-file letter alerts  a company to corrective actions that need to be taken so that the FDA  review of an application proceeds more promptly and efficiently.", "As part of its performance goals established for PDUFA III, FDA agreed to  select and hire an outside consultant in fiscal year 2003 to conduct a  comprehensive review and analysis of the drug and biologic review  process and make recommendations for improvements.

First, PDUFA  requires that each year FDA spend increasing amounts from its annual  appropriation on the drug and biologic review process in order to collect  and spend user fee revenues. According to agency officials, FDA had  difficulty determining the amount spent until the end of the year. As a  result, FDA spent more than was required. Second, FDA officials said that  during fiscal years 1994 through 2001, the agency did not receive sufficient  increases in its annual appropriation for salaries and expenses to cover  annual pay increases for all employees.

FDA would then have  to initiate a reduction-in-force because the agency would not have  sufficient funds to pay the salaries of the reviewers. FDA officials stated  that it is difficult to determine exactly how much the agency has spent  from its appropriation until the end of the fiscal year when a final  accounting is completed. Therefore, the agency spends more on drug and  biologic review activities than the statutory minimum to ensure that it  spends enough to continue the user fee program. In 7 of the 9 years since  PDUFA was enacted, FDA has exceeded the spending baseline by from 3  to 10 percent (see table 1). In 1996 and 1997, the overspending was higher,  23 and 18 percent, respectively.

Some consumer and patient  groups have expressed concern that PDUFA\u2019s emphasis on faster review  times has increased the rate of withdrawals and compromised drug safety  by placing FDA reviewers under pressure to approve drugs rapidly to meet  performance goals.

According to FDA officials,  premarketing clinical trials in a few thousands patients (typically with  relatively uncomplicated health conditions) do not detect all of a drug\u2019s  adverse effects, especially relatively rare ones. In addition, they stated that  the rise in the number of newly approved drugs entering the market and  the higher consumption of medicines by the population increase the  probability of misprescribing, adverse effects, and subsequent drug  withdrawals. According to FDA officials, safety problems not detected in  clinical trials are more likely to be found first among U.S. patients because  they are increasingly first to have access to new drugs. The United States  was the first market for 49 percent of new drugs approved in the United  States from 1996 through 1998, according to a study.", "An examination of drug withdrawals, by itself, may not provide a complete  picture of drug safety. First, a drug withdrawal does not reflect a judgment  concerning the absolute safety of a drug but reflects a judgment about the  risks and rewards of a drug in the context of alternative treatments. For  instance, despite the documented deaths from liver failure among patients  taking Rezulin, the drug was not withdrawn from the market until FDA  approved new, safer medications with similar benefits. In contrast, Raxar  was withdrawn from the market on the basis of relatively few adverse  event reports because alternative treatments were readily available.  Second, drug withdrawals may occur because health professionals and  patients use the drugs incorrectly, not because the drugs are inherently  dangerous when used as approved. For example, the health risks  associated with Seldane occurred when the drug was taken in  combination with medications that were contraindicated on Seldane\u2019s  label. Third, the off-label use of drugs also can be problematic because  such use may not have been shown to be safe and effective. For example,  while Pondimin (fenfluramine) was approved for short-term use as an  appetite suppressant, it was increasingly prescribed and used in  combination with the appetite suppressant phentermine as a part of a  long-term weight loss and management program. The off-label use of this  combination, known as \u201cfen-phen,\u201d posed serious health risks.

FDA  informed the Congress in its performance goal letter for PDUFA III that it  will develop guidance documents to assist the industry in addressing good  risk assessment, risk management, and postmarketing surveillance  practices. As part of joint recommendations to the Congress for the  reauthorization of PDUFA, PhRMA and BIO agreed with FDA that the  agency should use user fees to fund a new risk management system for  newly approved drugs. Under the voluntary program, drug sponsors may  develop, and FDA will review, risk management plans for products while  the agency reviews the sponsor\u2019s NDA or BLA. By adding FDA\u2019s  postmarket safety team to the drug review process before a new drug or  biologic is approved, FDA officials believe that they will obtain better  information on the risks associated with the product much earlier in the  process and the sponsor will gain helpful feedback on how best to  monitor, assess, and control the product\u2019s risks.", "Funding from user fees will be used to implement risk management plans  for the first 2 years after a product is approved. For products that require  risk management beyond standard labeling, FDA may use user fees for  postmarket surveillance activities for 3 years. FDA officials believe that  more rigorous safety monitoring of newly approved drugs during the first  few years after they are on the market could help to detect unanticipated  adverse effects earlier. Historically, the vast majority of adverse effects  have been identified in the first 2 to 3 years after a new drug is marketed.  FDA anticipates that user fees for risk management will total  approximately $71 million over 5 years, and will permit the agency to add  100 new employees to monitor drug safety and track adverse effects from  drugs already on the market (see table 4)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The implementation of PDUFA has been successful in bringing new drugs  and biologics to the U.S. market more rapidly than before. However,  maintaining adequate funding for approving new drugs and biologics has  had the unintended effect of reducing the share of funding and staffing for  other activities. Fewer resources for non-PDUFA programs may affect  FDA\u2019s ability to ensure that the other products the agency regulates, such  as food and medical devices, comply with FDA safety standards. In  addition, PDUFA has increased reviewer workloads and may be a factor in  relatively high attrition rates among FDA\u2019s review staff.", "Rapid FDA approval of new drugs means that the United States has  become the first nation to approve many new medicines. Because drugs  and biologics are not risk-free, adverse events are to be expected once the  products are in the marketplace. As more new drugs and biologics are  brought to market, increased attention to postmarket risk management  will be even more important. The recent increase in the rate of drug  withdrawals also suggests the need for FDA to strengthen its postmarket  surveillance activities. Under PDUFA III, FDA will now be able to use user  fees for additional drug safety activities, something that was not permitted  under PDUFA I and II. By having more resources to review risk  management plans developed by drug sponsors and conduct postmarket  surveillance, FDA will be able to obtain better information on the risks  associated with newly marketed drugs more quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided FDA with a draft of this report for comment and FDA  provided technical comments.
