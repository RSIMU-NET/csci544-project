For example, 21 of 24  agencies had weaknesses in their ability to appropriately identify and  authenticate system users. To illustrate, although agencies are  required to uniquely identify users on their systems, some users  shared accounts at 1 agency, and administrators shared accounts for  multiple systems at another agency, making it difficult for the agencies  to account for user and administrator activity on their systems. Other  agencies had weak password controls, including systems with  passwords that had not been changed from the easily guessable  default passwords supplied by the vendor.

For example, 1 agency  had not disabled 363 user accounts for individuals who were no  longer employed by the agency, despite a department policy of  disabling these accounts within 48 hours of an employee\u2019s departure.  Further, 18 of 24 agencies had weaknesses in the protection of  information system boundaries. For example, although 1 agency  had established a program for remote access to agency systems, it  had not ensured that authentication mechanisms for remote access  meet NIST guidelines for remote authentication. Lastly, 11 of 24  agencies had weaknesses in their ability to restrict physical access or  harm to computer resources and protect them from unintentional loss  or impairment.

For example, 20 of 24 agencies had weaknesses in  processes for updating software to protect against known  vulnerabilities. One agency had not installed critical updates in a  timely manner for 14 of 15 systems residing on one if its networks  reviewed by the agency\u2019s inspector general. Another agency had  multiple database update-related vulnerabilities dating back to 2009.  In addition, 17 of 24 agencies had weaknesses in authorizing, testing,  approving, tracking, and controlling system changes.

According to OMB, these reviews resulted in a prioritized action plan  for the agency to improve overall agency performance. CyberStat  reviews were also conducted for seven agencies in fiscal year 2012.  According to OMB, these meetings focused heavily on the three  administration priorities and not specifically on FISMA requirements.  The top challenges raised by agencies in fiscal year 2012 included the  need to upgrade legacy systems to support new capabilities, acquire  skilled staff, and ensure that the necessary financial resources were  allocated to the administration\u2019s priority initiatives for cybersecurity.  According to DHS, OMB and NSS are now requiring a CyberStat  review of all 24 major federal agencies for fiscal year 2013\u2014a new  process that began in December 2012. However, in May 2013 OMB  officials stated that while conducting CyberStat reviews of all 24  agencies is their goal, they would not meet that goal this year, and in  July 2013 DHS officials stated that they do not have the capacity to  meet with all 24 agencies in 1 fiscal year.  conducted the first CyberStat reviews", "CIO and CISO interviews: In fiscal year 2011, DHS began  interviewing agency CIO\u2019s and chief information security officers  (CISO) on their agency\u2019s cybersecurity posture.

These  measures are effective at pointing out where improvements are  needed in implementing required policies and procedures but provide  only limited insight into the overall performance of an organization\u2019s  information security program.", "Control effectiveness measures, which characterize the extent to  which specific control activities within an organization\u2019s information  security program meet their objectives. Rather than merely capturing  what controls are in place, such measures gauge how effectively the  controls have been implemented.", "These categories are consistent with those laid out by NIST in its  information security performance measurement guide, which serves as  official guidance on information security measures for federal agencies  and which OMB requires agencies to follow. In addition, information  security experts, as well as NIST guidance, indicated that organizations  with increasingly effective information security programs should migrate  from predominantly using compliance measures toward a balanced set of  measures to include various types of measures.", "Further, we found that measures generally have key characteristics and  attributes. For example, measures are most meaningful to an organization when they, among other things, had targets or thresholds for  each measure to track progress over time and are linked to organizational  priorities.", "In our report we recommended that OMB, among other things, revise  annual reporting guidance to agencies to require (1) reporting on a  balanced set of measures, including measures that focus on the  effectiveness of control activities and program impact; and (2) inclusion of  all key attributes in the development of measures. OMB concurred with  our recommendations and revised its fiscal year 2010 reporting  instructions and metrics accordingly.", "For fiscal years 2011 and 2012, DHS, as part of its recently assigned  responsibilities for FISMA oversight, developed a revised set of reporting  metrics to assess agencies\u2019 compliance with the act. Specifically,  inspectors general were asked to report on 11 information system control  categories, and agency chief information officers were asked to report on  12 categories, as indicated in table 6.", "For each category, inspectors general and chief information officers were  required to answer a series of questions related to the agency\u2019s  implementation of these controls.", "The metrics developed for inspectors general and chief information  officers by DHS for fiscal year 2012 address compliance with six of the  eight components of an information security program as required by  FISMA. Specifically, the metrics address the establishment of information  security policies and procedures; security training; periodic testing and  evaluation of the effectiveness of information security policies,  procedures, and practices; remedial actions to address information  security deficiencies; procedures for detecting, reporting, and responding  to security incidents; and continuity of operations plans and procedures.  However, these metrics do not specifically discuss two of the eight  components\u2014agencies\u2019 processes for conducting risk assessments or  developing security plans. For example, while the metrics ask inspectors  general to report on their agency\u2019s policies and procedures for risk  management and its overall risk management program, they do not  specifically require inspectors general or agency chief information officers  to report on whether the agency has periodically assessed the risk and  magnitude of harm that could result from the compromise of information  and information systems that support the operations and assets of the  agency, as required by FISMA. The metrics also do not specifically  require agencies or inspectors general to comment on the development,  documentation, and implementation of subordinate plans for providing  adequate security for networks, facilities, and systems or groups of  systems, as appropriate. Without measuring agencies\u2019 compliance with  these FISMA requirements, DHS, OMB, and other stakeholders will have  less insight into the implementation of agencies\u2019 information security  programs.", "As highlighted in our 2009 report,measures in addition to compliance measures can provide additional  insight into how effectively control activities are meeting their security  objectives. According to OMB instructions for FISMA reporting, the DHS  metrics for inspectors general were also designed to measure the  effectiveness of agencies\u2019 information security programs, and OMB relied  on responses by inspectors general to these metrics to gauge the  effectiveness of information security programs.   the use of control effectiveness  While some of the metrics for inspectors general were intended to  measure effectiveness, many of them did not. The 2012 metrics ask  inspectors general to determine whether or not their agency has  established a program for each of the 11 information system control  categories, and whether or not these programs include key security  practices. Several of these metrics were intended to reflect the  effectiveness of agencies\u2019 program practices within the control categories.  For example, for the incident response and reporting category, inspectors  general were asked whether their agency responded to and resolved  incidents in a timely manner and whether it reported incidents to US- CERT and law enforcement within established time frames. However,  many of the metrics for inspectors general did not provide a means of  assessing the effectiveness of the program for control categories.  Specifically, the metrics focus on the establishment of the program but do  not require inspectors general to characterize the extent to which these  program components meet their objectives. For each control category,  the metrics ask whether the agency established an enterprise-wide  program that was consistent with FISMA requirements, OMB policy, and  applicable NIST guidelines. However, these metrics do not allow the  inspectors general to respond on how effectively the program is  operating. Instead, they capture whether programs have been  established.", "The lack of effectiveness metrics has led to inconsistencies in inspector  general reporting. The following examples illustrate that while inspectors  general reported, via responses to the DHS metrics, that their agency had  established programs for implementing control categories, they also  reported continuing weaknesses in those controls in the same year.", "One inspector general responded to the metric for plans of action and  milestones (i.e., remediation program) that its agency had a  remediation program in place that is consistent with FISMA  requirements, tracks and monitors weaknesses, includes remediation  plans that are effective at correcting weaknesses, remediates  weaknesses in a timely manner, and adheres to milestone  remediation dates. However, the inspector general audit of the  agency\u2019s information security program identified 4,377 unremediated  weaknesses, and the resulting report stated that component agencies  were not entering or tracking all information security weaknesses.", "Another inspector general reported in response to the contractor  systems metric that its agency updates the inventory of contractor  systems at least annually; however, a report we issued on this  agency\u2019s information security program identified a weakness in the  accuracy of the agency\u2019s inventory of systems, including those  systems operated by contractors. Specifically, the agency provided  three different information systems inventories and none of them had  the same information, reducing the agency\u2019s assurance that  information systems were properly accounted for.", "In response to the configuration management metric, an inspector  general at another agency stated that software scanning capabilities  were fully implemented. However, the inspector general\u2019s  independent evaluation showed that although the systems reviewed  had the capability for software scanning, none of the systems were  being fully scanned for vulnerabilities in accordance with agency  requirements.", "Without fully or consistently measuring the effectiveness of controls, DHS,  OMB, and other stakeholders will lack insight into the performance of  agencies\u2019 information security programs.", "In October 2011, we determined that of the 31 metrics for CIOs for fiscal  year 2010, 30 of them did not include performance targets that would  allow agencies to track progress over time. We recommended that the  Director of OMB incorporate performance targets for metrics in annual  FISMA reporting guidance to agencies and inspectors general. OMB  generally agreed with our recommendation.", "In fiscal year 2012, DHS included explicit performance targets for metrics  that were linked to the three cross-agency cybersecurity priority goals  discussed earlier. For example, agencies were to ensure that 75 percent  of all users were required to use personal identity verification cards to  authenticate to their systems. While this partially addresses our previous  recommendation, no explicit targets were established for metrics that did  not relate to the three cross-agency cybersecurity priority goals, such as  metrics related to data protection, incident management, configuration  management, incident response and reporting, and remediation  programs.", "DHS officials acknowledged that these targets were needed, but that  agency resources and the lack of DHS authority to establish targets have  prevented the department from establishing additional targets. The  officials also stated that only certain targets were included at this time in  order to focus agency resources and senior leadership attention on those  items that they believed would create the most change in federal  information security. They added that additional targets will be included  over time. Developing targets for additional metrics, as we previously  recommended, will enable agencies and oversight entities to better gauge  progress in securing federal systems.", "In June 2013, the DHS inspector general issued a report on the results of  its evaluation of whether DHS has implemented its additional  cybersecurity responsibilities effectively to improve the security posture of  the federal government. It found that DHS had not developed a strategic  implementation plan that describes its cybersecurity responsibilities or  establishes specific time frames and milestones to provide a clear plan of  action for fulfilling those responsibilities. The report also stated that DHS  had not established performance metrics to measure and monitor its  progress in accomplishing its mission and goals. According to the  inspector general, management turnover has hindered DHS\u2019s ability to  develop a strategic implementation plan. Specifically, three key  individuals essential to the DHS division overseeing FISMA compliance  have left the agency since July 2012. The inspector general  recommended that DHS coordinate with OMB to develop a strategic  implementation plan that identifies long-term goals and milestones for  federal agency FISMA compliance.", "In addition, the inspector general found that some agencies indicated that  DHS could make further improvements to the clarity and quality of the  FISMA reporting metrics. Specifically, five agencies indicated that some  of the fiscal year 2012 and 2013 metrics were unclear and should be  revised. In addition, two agencies stated that the reporting process was a  strain on personnel resources because there are too many metrics. Some  agency officials we interviewed echoed the need for clearer metrics and  agreed that the process was time consuming. The inspector general  recommended that DHS improve communication and coordination with  federal agencies by providing additional clarity regarding the FISMA  reporting metrics.", "DHS agreed with the recommendations and officials stated that they are  developing a strategic plan and documenting a methodology for metric  development with the specific aim of improving the quality of the metrics,  but did not state when the plan would be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inspectors General Conducted Independent Evaluations of Agency Information Security Programs", "paragraphs": ["FISMA requires that agencies have an independent evaluation performed  each year to evaluate the effectiveness of the agency\u2019s information  security program and practices.
