The Border Patrol uses vehicles and aircraft to patrol areas between the ports of entry and electronic equipment, such as sensors and low-light-level televisions, to detect illegal entry into the country. The Border Patrol carries out its mission in 21 sectors. Nine of these sectors are located along the southwest border with Mexico. As of September 30, 1994, about 3,747 agents were assigned to the 9 sectors, representing 88 percent of Border Patrol agents nationwide.", "The following other federal entities support land border control efforts between the ports of entry along the southwest border.", "El Paso Intelligence Center (EPIC), the nation\u2019s principal tactical drug intelligence facility, prepares assessments on the threat of drug smuggling.", "Operation Alliance prepares border control strategies and coordinates drug enforcement activities of 17 federal and numerous state and local law enforcement agencies combating drug smuggling.", "Joint Task Force Six (JTF-6), located in El Paso, coordinates military support for drug enforcement efforts.", "In September 1991, ONDCP tasked Sandia National Laboratories, through INS, to do a \u201csystematic analysis of the security along the United States/Mexico Border between the ports of entry and to recommend measures by which control of the border could be improved.\u201d ONDCP chose Sandia because of its expertise in designing physical security systems. In January 1993, Sandia issued its report entitled Systematic Analysis of the Southwest Border. We refer to this as the Sandia study throughout our report. According to the study, to conduct its analysis, Sandia personnel visited all nine Border Patrol southwest border sectors, toured various Border Patrol facilities, and interviewed both chief patrol agents and Border Patrol agents.

According to the report, between 50 and 70 percent of the cocaine smuggled into the United States transited Mexico, entering primarily by land across the southwest border. In addition, about 23 percent of the heroin smuggled into the United States originated in Mexico.", "INS data showed that Border Patrol narcotics seizures along the southwest border have risen over the last few years. Between fiscal years 1990 and 1993, the number of Border Patrol narcotics seizures rose from around 4,200 to around 6,400, an increase of about 50 percent. The amount of cocaine seized nearly doubled from about 14,000 pounds in 1990 to about 27,000 pounds in 1993.", "According to a June 1992 Operation Alliance report, the primary smuggling route across the southwest border was by land. The report pointed out that although cocaine was the primary drug threat, followed by marijuana, the heroin threat was growing. The report stated that in spite of law enforcement agencies\u2019 efforts to counter drug smuggling, the flow of drugs between the ports of entry along the southwest border continued due to vast open areas and a relatively low law enforcement presence. The report concluded that \u201cour successes are insignificant when compared to the threat. Our collective efforts are currently only a minor irritant to the smugglers.\u201d", "The Sandia study deemed drug smuggling a serious threat all along the southwest border.

Much of the inflow represented short-term visits to the United States.", "In June 1994, INS estimated there were about 3.8 million undocumented migrants residing in the United States. About half of the unlawful residents entered unlawfully across the borders, while the other half entered as visitors but did not leave. The estimates were based on an analysis of INS and Bureau of the Census data and, according to INS, experts have embraced these estimates as the best available.", "The 1993 Sandia study characterized the southwest border as \u201cbeing overrun.\u201d For example, in the San Diego sector, the study noted that as many as 6,000 aliens attempted to enter the United States illegally every night along the first 7-1/2 miles of border beginning at the Pacific Ocean. One of the reasons given in the study for this situation was that most of the border fencing in the San Diego sector and other urban areas was \u201cpoorly maintained\u201d and \u201ctotally ineffective\u201d (see fig. 3). However, as discussed on page 15, INS recently completed a new fence in the San Diego sector and plans additional fencing in other sectors.", "Border Patrol apprehensions along the southwest border declined between 1986 and 1989 but, although still below the 1986 level, apprehensions have gradually risen since then (see fig. 4).

In fiscal year 1993, these two sectors accounted for two-thirds of the 1.2 million southwest border apprehensions.", "Although the southwest border is approximately 1,600 miles long, much of it is difficult to cross by foot or vehicle due to rugged terrain, desert, or natural barriers such as some portions of the Rio Grande River. Our analysis of INS data showed that in fiscal year 1992 over half of all southwest border apprehensions occurred along only 18 of the 1,600 border miles\u201413 miles along the border between San Diego and Tijuana, Mexico, and 5 miles along the border between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, Mexico. However, as we discussed on pages 23 to 25, recent border control initiatives in San Diego and El Paso appear to have rerouted some illegal immigrants to other southwest border areas.", "Unless border control efforts become more effective, illegal immigration is expected to increase.

Consequently, the study recommended (1) multiple lighted barriers in urban border areas to prevent the entry of large volumes of drugs and illegal aliens, with patrol roads between the barriers and (2) enhanced checkpoint operations to prevent those drugs and illegal aliens that succeeded in crossing the border from leaving the border area. (See fig. 6 for an artist\u2019s illustration of the Sandia study\u2019s proposed three-fence barrier system.)", "According to the Sandia study, multiple barriers in urban areas would provide the Border Patrol a greater ability to (1) discourage a significant number of illegal border crossers, (2) detect intruders early and delay them as long as possible, and (3) channel a significantly reduced level of traffic to places where border patrol agents can adequately deal with it. The Sandia study recommended multiple barriers along approximately 90 miles, or less than 6 percent of the southwest border.", "Because of rugged terrain, segments of the southwest border cannot be controlled at the immediate border. The alternative the Sandia study recommended for these areas is to use highway checkpoints to contain those aliens who cross the border illegally. The study recommended more checkpoints be established and that all operate full time. The Border Patrol\u2019s use of part-time checkpoints allows violators to cross unobserved after the checkpoint is closed.", "Except for the proposed multiple-fence system, many of the Sandia study\u2019s recommendations were not new and, according to Border Patrol officials, had been made previously by their own personnel.

However, figure 8D shows that these gaps in the fencing have now been closed.", "In addition, according to San Diego sector officials, violent crime and confrontations between Border Patrol agents and illegal aliens have been reduced because the fencing has prevented large groups of aliens from gathering. For example, murders in the border areas adjacent to the fencing dropped from nine in 1990 to none between 1991 and June 1994. According to the sector\u2019s chief patrol agent, as of February 1994, there had not been any incidents during the last 2 years where San Diego Border Patrol agents had used deadly force against illegal aliens.

A July 1994 study requested by the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform found that the operation significantly reduced illegal crossings and had resulted in less crime and fewer allegations against Border Patrol agents in El Paso. In addition, the study found that the strategy has broad public support. However, the study also found that the redeployment of agents and longer work shifts have eroded morale among agents, and the strategy is labor-intensive. Any expansion without additional agents would stretch present resources.", "Although successful in significantly reducing illegal entry into El Paso, according to sector officials, the new strategy weakened some sector operations.
