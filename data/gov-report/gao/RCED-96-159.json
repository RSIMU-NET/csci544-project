Growth in air traffic operations and deteriorating equipment have strained the current ATC system and FAA\u2019s ability to sustain its exemplary safety record. These factors have increased the urgency for FAA to modernize ATC equipment.", "FAA began its program to modernize the ATC system in the early 1980s. The program included the acquisition of new radars and automated data processing, navigation, and communications equipment. As of March 1996, FAA estimated that from 1982 through 2003, the total cost of this modernization program will be about $35 billion.

The Advanced Automation System (AAS), the long-time centerpiece of the modernization program and the most costly project, was restructured in 1994 after costs tripled to an estimated $7.6 billion from the 1983 estimate of $2.5 billion and after the planned implementation of key components was up to 8 years behind the original 1983 schedule.", "The critical Initial Sector Suites System segment of the AAS project, intended to replace controllers\u2019 existing work stations at en-route centersand provide controllers with new hardware and software, including radar displays, was particularly troublesome. Before scaling back this segment, FAA was attempting to address several serious technical problems, such as (1) ensuring that 210 separate work stations would communicate in a stable network, (2) reducing the need to revise each software code (on average, every line of software needed to be rewritten once), and (3) converting a system for communicating flight information on printed paper strips to an electronic system.", "Unplanned cost increases have characterized many other FAA acquisitions. Per-unit costs increased substantially for eight of the nine key projects that we have tracked in our annual status reports on the ATC modernization program.

As of March 1996, 74 projects totaling $5.1 billion\u2014only about 15 percent of the modernization program\u2019s overall cost\u2014were completed, and 147 projects remained active.

FAA\u2019s difficulties in developing software have caused cost overruns and schedule delays for numerous acquisitions of major systems.", "We have also reported recurring weaknesses in FAA\u2019s management of the acquisition process. FAA did not historically manage its acquisitions of major systems in accordance with the business-like principles embodied in Office of Management and Budget Circular A-109 and FAA\u2019s own acquisition policies. For example, FAA did not analyze its mission needs and performed flawed or limited analyses of alternative approaches for achieving those needs. FAA also did not perform realistic testing before proceeding into full production of systems and found out later that the systems did not meet the agency\u2019s specifications. Other managerial weaknesses include inadequate oversight of contractors\u2019 performance, difficulties in resolving issues related to requirements for FAA\u2019s various systems, and problems with securing sites to install equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior GAO Reviews of Federal Acquisition Management Have Analyzed the Influence of Organizational Culture", "paragraphs": ["Organizational culture is one managerial factor we have examined in reviews of acquisition management at other federal agencies but not at FAA.

In our view, individuals acted in response to incentives related to their careers, jobs, program support, organizational influence, and budget levels. Collectively, these incentives created an environment that encouraged \u201cselling\u201d and starting new programs and pushing existing programs ahead despite development, production, and implementation problems.", "In our 1992 report on the Department of Energy, we concluded that the Department\u2019s contract management problems would require a change in its business philosophy and that its efforts to instill a new organizational culture were an acknowledgement of the systemic nature of the problems.Similarly, we reported that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration would have to change its organizational culture in order for its contract management improvement efforts to succeed. Since then, our preliminary work in evaluating the implementation of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 has shown that effective implementation of this act will require fundamental changes in the culture of government management\u2014changing management\u2019s focus from what federal employees are doing to what they are accomplishing."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Constructive Organizational Cultures Have Similar Characteristics", "paragraphs": ["Organizational theory and behavioral science describe an interdependent relationship between employees\u2019 beliefs, values, and attitudes and their individual and collective behaviors.

External forces include the needs of customers and, in the case of government agencies, congressional committees and Members of Congress.", "Organizational theory and research show that an organization\u2019s culture is more constructive when employees\u2019 underlying values, attitudes, and beliefs cause individuals and the organization as a whole to behave more often in ways that have desirable results\u2014both for the organization and its customers. Employees in these organizations demonstrate a stronger commitment in the following four areas: mission focus, accountability, coordination, and adaptability.", "Mission focus refers to the employees\u2019 pursuit of goals that define the best course of action for an organization. An agency\u2019s mission provides the agency with purpose and meaning and promotes short- and long-term commitment by its employees. In a more constructive culture, employees are more likely to think ahead and plan, emphasize quality over quantity, and subordinate their own needs to the agency\u2019s overall mission.", "Accountability refers to the value an organization places on involvement, participation, and ownership among its members. A greater sense of commitment to the organization fosters the employees\u2019 willingness to be held accountable for decisions and actions. In a more constructive culture, employees are more likely to take responsibility and work to achieve self-set goals, give positive rewards to others, and help others to think for themselves.", "Coordination refers to the consistency of behavior and the sharing of beliefs and values by individuals and groups within an organization. Such consistency facilitates the exchange of information and fosters coordinated efforts. In a more constructive culture, employees are more likely to involve others in decisions affecting them, openly share information, resolve differences collaboratively, cooperate with others in the organization, and pursue common purposes.", "Adaptability refers to the employees\u2019 capacity to respond positively to changing demands and opportunities posed from within and outside the organization. Adaptability enables an organization to adopt new behaviors and processes (e.g., in response to emerging technologies and the changing needs of its customers). In a more constructive culture, employees are more likely to resist conformity, think in unique and independent ways, explore alternatives before acting, learn from mistakes, and be receptive to change.", "When an organization and its employees demonstrate a strong, balanced commitment in these four areas, research shows that the employees are more likely to be satisfied and the organization will perform better. Conversely, an organization is less effective when its employees, both individually and collectively, are less focused on the agency\u2019s overall goals, are held less accountable, coordinate their actions less effectively, and are more resistant to change."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In light of FAA\u2019s persistent acquisition problems and our work at other federal agencies that highlighted a need to change organizational culture, the Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation and Related Agencies, House Committee on Appropriations, asked us to examine FAA\u2019s management of its ATC modernization program to (1) determine whether FAA\u2019s organizational culture has contributed to the agency\u2019s continuing cost, schedule, and technical problems and (2) identify steps that FAA could take to improve its acquisition management through changing its organizational culture if that is a contributing factor.", "To accomplish the first objective, we reviewed reports focused specifically on FAA\u2019s acquisitions as well as selected studies and research on organizational culture. We drew upon analyses of FAA by other organizations and analyzed the results of FAA employee surveys. We also discussed these analyses with employees involved in acquisitions, including members of the integrated product teams, and with other FAA acquisition stakeholders. We used common theories of research on organizational culture to link the behaviors of FAA employees to long-standing problems in its acquisition process. To document these problems, in reviewing our past reports and testimonies on FAA\u2019s acquisition of ATC systems we concentrated on reports that had been issued since FAA announced its ATC modernization program in 1981. A detailed description of key studies and employee surveys is provided in appendix I.", "The body of research on organizational culture is extensive. Theories describe the behaviors and problems promoted by different types of organizational cultures and the elements that are essential for organizational performance and effectiveness.

Cooke, consultant for Human Synergistics/Center for Applied Research, Inc.; and Dr. Joseph Coffee, Director of National Education Programs at the Department of Treasury\u2019s Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms.

Program officials took such actions as establishing unrealistic cost and schedule estimates and rushing acquisitions prematurely into the production phase. Studies and surveys indicate that these actions were driven by organizational incentives that did not support a focus on FAA\u2019s mission."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FAA\u2019s Actions Did Not Reflect a Mission Focus", "paragraphs": ["In reviewing problematic acquisitions, we found that FAA officials acted in ways that did not reflect a strong commitment to the agency\u2019s acquisition mission. Over the years, program officials did not perform mission needs analyses; set unrealistic program cost and schedule estimates; suppressed bad news; and began system production before completing development, testing, and evaluation. Although enabling projects to get started and proceed with minimal interruption, these actions did not foster the agency\u2019s mission of undertaking only essential ATC acquisitions and completing them within budget and on schedule.", "Program officials pushed ahead with acquisitions without demonstrating the importance of those acquisitions to achieving the agency\u2019s mission. In 1993, we reported that many of the mission need statements we examined\u2014documents that identified the need for FAA to invest an additional $5 billion to fix deficiencies in the ATC system\u2014were not based on the results of any documented mission analysis. Despite the lack of substantial support for these acquisitions, FAA\u2019s top management approved the statements. As a result, FAA has acquired systems that do not meet the agency\u2019s needs. For example, as we noted in that report, FAA spent $46 million on the Real Time Weather Processor to provide controllers with current accurate weather information. However, the new equipment operated as much as six times more slowly than the existing system, and in 1991, FAA suspended this program indefinitely and began to redefine controllers\u2019 needs.", "Program officials established unrealistic schedule estimates. The result was \u201cunexpected\u201d schedule delays. For example, according to our 1989 report on the Voice Switching and Control System (VSCS) project, FAA\u2019s project schedule was more optimistic than that of the system engineering and integration contractor who was hired to provide technical and programmatic support to FAA in managing the modernization program.FAA officials explained that they preferred their schedule over the contractor\u2019s whose \u201csafe\u201d dates did not require as much effort to meet. The contractor, however, said that FAA\u2019s schedule was unrealistic because it did not allow any extra time to absorb unanticipated difficulties. By 1991, FAA\u2019s estimated date to implement the VSCS at the first-site had slipped from May 1992 to June 1994.", "Program officials also established unrealistic cost estimates. The total estimated cost of the AAS project tripled from the original estimate of $2.5 billion to $7.6 billion. On a per-unit basis, the estimated cost of the VSCS project increased from the original estimate of about $10 million to about $63 million or an increase of 511 percent; the estimated cost of the Integrated Terminal Weather System project increased from about $3 million to almost $7 million or an increase of 129 percent. The magnitude of these increases indicates that FAA managers were not being realistic in estimating the costs of various ATC systems.", "Program officials have suppressed bad news. For example, officials managing the ARSR-4 project reported in 1989 that the first implementation of this radar would occur in September 1992. Since 1989, despite their consistent indications that the radar was almost operational, they reported delays in 5 of the following 6 years. In 1995, program officials said the radar system would be up and running in September 1995; however, the first ARSR-4 radar was operational in April 1996. In recent years, the reasons for schedule slippages cited by program officials included software errors that surfaced while integrating software with hardware, production delays, problems with preparing sites, and integration problems between ARSR-4 radars and other ATC systems. While a certain level of technical problems in implementing a complex radar system like ARSR-4 is normal, the consistent pattern of reporting that this system was almost ready, followed by annual schedule delays, indicates that program officials were not disclosing the full extent of difficulties they encountered.", "FAA officials have rushed into production of ATC systems. Over the years, cost, schedule, and performance problems have resulted from excessive concurrency\u2014beginning system production before completing development, testing, or evaluation programs. FAA has proceeded with producing numerous systems, including the Microwave Landing System (MLS), Mode S radar, and Oceanic Display and Planning System (ODAPS), before their critical performance requirements had been met. The decision to proceed into the production phase of these projects proved to be a mistake. After years of delays, the MLS contractors did not meet established performance requirements. As of May 1995, the ODAPS contractor had not met a key operational requirement\u201411 years after the contract was awarded. Although FAA awarded a production contract for Mode S radar in 1984, the agency implemented its first full-performance Mode S radar in February 1995."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mission Focus Not Supported by Organizational Incentives", "paragraphs": ["Employees at all levels have described FAA\u2019s shortcomings in mission focus.

In a 1995 survey, these employees continued to indicate their focus on survival, rather than mission accomplishment, in responses, such as the following;", "A majority of the respondents (62 percent) agreed that employees are often hesitant to say what they really think for fear of retaliation.", "More than half (53 percent) disagreed that management supports employees who raise difficult or controversial issues in open meetings.", "Half disagreed that management helped employees stay focused on what really matters.", "Nearly half (45 percent) disagreed that pointing out when promised deadlines or deliverables are not realistic would not be held against them.", "In discussions with FAA employees and in reviewing studies and reports on its acquisition process, we found further evidence of a link between FAA\u2019s insufficient mission focus and the agency\u2019s incentives. For example, the Associate Administrator for Research and Acquisitions described a \u201cgrow-your-own\u201d development process at FAA. He said that a group of programs has emerged that does not reflect a unified approach to achieving the acquisition mission because program managers are rewarded for starting individual programs and getting them to advance, regardless of the long-term consequences.", "A 1995 internal FAA study on the use of support services contracts revealed incentives for focusing on short-term results. The study noted that (1) funding for program officials to pursue new projects appeared to be given a higher priority than funding for users to install purchased equipment and (2) a backlog in the installation and implementation of field equipment had risen to an equivalent of an estimated 1,300 staff years. According to this study, new equipment would likely continue to be backlogged and stored in warehouses unless the agency\u2019s Airway Facilities division received increased resources for installation. In our view, this allocation of resources reflects a short-term emphasis on beginning new programs without considering the long-term implications for existing systems.", "A 1994 report on the AAS program by the Center for Naval Analyses (CNA) discussed organizational incentives that did not promote a strategic focus on FAA\u2019s mission. According to CNA, FAA\u2019s culture discouraged program officials from reporting news of cost increases, schedule delays, and performance problems with the AAS project. This suppression of bad news prevented top management from taking early action. Similarly, in a 1993 internal study of its process to determine system requirements, an FAA team reported that the agency did not reward employees for how well they met customers\u2019 needs; instead, job standards reflected how a process was performed without regard to the effect on the agency\u2019s overall performance or budget.", "In our 1992 review of the Defense Department\u2019s management of acquisitions of major weapon systems, we found that the Department\u2019s organizational culture allowed the needs of the participants in the acquisition process to create incentives for pushing programs and encouraging undue optimism, parochialism, and other compromises of good judgment. Consequently, problems persisted not because they were overlooked or underregulated but because they enabled more programs to survive and thus more participants\u2019 needs to be met. For example, because the success of program managers depended on getting results (e.g., meeting the next major milestone), their strongest motivation was to keep the programs moving and to protect them from interruption.", "It is easy to understand why participants in the federal acquisition process, including FAA officials, are driven by these incentives. By analyzing mission needs, they risk raising questions about the need for \u201ctheir\u201d projects. By establishing realistic cost estimates, they may endanger the approval of near-term funding. By surfacing problems, they may expose their projects to heightened managerial and congressional oversight and risk criticism for their decisions and actions. By insisting on full testing before moving to production, they may delay a project\u2019s schedule and cause it to receive reduced funding.
