As of March 2002, the Air Force delinquency rate on average was about 5 percentage points lower than the rest of DOD and 1 percentage point higher than the federal civilian agencies. The Air Force's overall delinquency and charge-off problems were primarily associated with lower paid, low- to midlevel enlisted military personnel. Despite these improvements, a weak control environment contributed to significant abuse and potential fraud. For example, many of the problem cases identified were due to ineffective controls over the issuance and cancellation of travel cards and weaknesses in the assignment and training of agency program coordinators. During the period of our review, over 400 Air Force cardholders committed potential bank fraud by writing three or more nonsufficient fund (NSF) checks to Bank of America. Also, many cardholders used their cards for inappropriate purchases, such as cruises and event tickets. A significant relationship also existed between potential travel card fraud, abuse, and delinquencies and individuals with substantial credit history problems. Some cardholders had personal accounts placed in collection while others had filed bankruptcies prior to receiving government travel cards. Also, the issuance of the travel cards to virtually everyone who applied for them compounded these problems. GAO found documented evidence of disciplinary actions in less than half of the cases reviewed where cardholders wrote NSF checks, or their accounts were charged off or placed in salary offset. GAO also found that over half of the cases reviewed involved individuals who still had secret or top-secret security clearances. Other control weaknesses related to the Air Force's failure to provide the necessary agency program coordinator training, and infrequent or nonexistent monitoring of travel card activities. The recently enacted fiscal year 2003 Defense appropriations and authorization acts require the Secretary of Defense to establish guidelines and procedures for disciplinary actions and to deny issuance of travel cards to individuals who are not creditworthy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2001, the Air Force had about 500,000 individually billed travel  card accounts, and about $831 million in related travel card charges.  In  contrast to the purchase card program, where charges are billed directly to the  government for payment, the individually billed travel cardholder is directly  responsible for all charges incurred on his or her travel card account and  for remitting payments on the monthly bill.  The cardholder is expected to  use the government travel card only for valid expenses related to official  travel and to submit a properly documented voucher to get reimbursed by  the Air Force for valid expenses.  The intent of the travel card program was  to improve convenience for the traveler and to reduce the government\u2019s  costs of administering travel.  If properly controlled, the travel card would  provide an efficient and effective method for administering the travel  program.

This report provides details and results of our Air Force travel  card audit.  The objectives of our audit of the Air Force\u2019s travel card  program were to determine, for fiscal year 2001 and the first 6 months of  fiscal year 2002, (1) the reported magnitude and impact of delinquent and  charged-off Air Force travel card accounts, along with an analysis of  related causes, (2) the effectiveness of the overall control environment and  key internal controls for the Air Force\u2019s travel program, (3) whether  indications existed of potentially fraudulent and abusive activity related to  the Air Force travel cards, and (4) whether abusive activity associated with  the travel card is effectively linked to disciplinary actions and security  clearances.  To achieve these objectives, we analyzed Air Force account  delinquency and charge-off information and compared it to non-Air Force  DOD components and federal civilian agencies.  We reviewed the adequacy  of DOD and Air Force policies and procedures related to travel card use  and tested the effectiveness of key internal control activities at three Air  Force installations.

We then identified one Air Force installation  within each of the three commands based on the magnitude of travel card  transactions, payments, and delinquencies.  Appendix III presents data on  delinquency rates by major command.  We tested key control activities,  including documented evidence of travel authorization, accurate travel  voucher processing, timely submission of the travel voucher by the  employee, and timely payment of the travel reimbursement to the  employee.  Our statistical sample test results can be projected only to the  individual installations where we performed the testing and cannot be  projected to the command level or to the Air Force as a whole.  We used  data mining procedures across the universe of individually billed Air Force  travel card activity to identify potentially fraudulent and abusive travel card  activity, based on the nature, amount, merchant, and other identifying  characteristics of the transactions.

Other Air Force actions included encouraging the use of the split  disbursement payment process, in which the Defense Finance and  Accounting Service (DFAS) sends a portion of the traveler\u2019s reimbursement  directly to the bank rather than the cardholder, and increased management  attention and focus on the delinquency issue.  However, except for split  disbursements, Air Force actions primarily address the symptoms or back- end result of delinquency and charge-offs after they have already occurred.

As discussed further in appendix  II, we used data mining procedures to identify transactions that we  believed to be potentially fraudulent or abusive based upon the nature,  amount, merchant, and other identifying characteristics of the transaction.   As a result of these procedures, we found instances in which cardholders  abused their travel cards by purchasing a wide variety of personal goods or  services that were unrelated to official government travel.  As shown in  table 7, we were able to determine that during an 18-month period, Air  Force cardholders charged approximately $31,000 to purchase admission  to entertainment events, such as NFL football games and a Janet Jackson  concert.  We also identified travel card transactions totaling approximately  $14,000 for gambling; $31,000 for cruise packages; and $32,000 coded as  purchases at gentlemen\u2019s clubs, which provide adult entertainment.  The  examples shown in table 7 include both instances where the cardholders  paid their bills and where they did not.", "Our investigative work showed that gentlemen\u2019s clubs were sometimes  used to convert the travel card to cash by supplying cardholders with  actual cash or \u201cclub cash\u201d for a 10 percent fee.  To illustrate, an Air Force  employee that charged $440 to their government travel card at one of these  clubs, would receive $400 in cash.  Such charges are processed by the  establishment\u2019s merchant bank, and authorized by Bank of America, in part  because the merchant category code (MCC),which identifies the nature  of the transactions and is to be used by Bank of America to block improper  purchases, are circumvented when the establishments reported the  charges as restaurant, dining, or bar charges.  Subsequently, the club would  receive payment for a $440 restaurant charge.", "Examples of Travel Card Abuse  We found cases where individuals used their travel cards for both official  and personal reasons, but failed to pay their accounts, thereby resulting in  accounts that were charged off and/or included in salary offset and fixed  payment plans.  Table 8 provides examples of those cases.", "The following examples include details of cases summarized in table 8.", "Cardholder #1 is a staff sergeant (E-5) in the Idaho Air National Guard  who is employed full-time as a juvenile counselor at a county  correctional facility.  The cardholder told our investigators that from  December 22, 2000, to February 19, 2001, his wife used his government  travel card without his knowledge or consent.  Bank of America records  showed that transactions for the above period totaled over $13,000, of  which over $10,000 was for on-line gambling charges and another $3,000  was for ATM withdrawals.  There were also several credits to the  cardholder\u2019s account totaling over $5,000 from his wife\u2019s gambling  winnings.

The cardholder also  contacted Bank of America to work out a payment plan for the debt but  no agreement could be reached.  As a result of his inability to pay the  debt incurred by his wife, the cardholder filed for Chapter 7  bankruptcy.

For example, in this case, to mask gambling  activity, the on-line gambling establishments with whom the  cardholder\u2019s wife dealt used the merchant category codes for  \u201cMiscellaneous and Specialty Retail Stores\u201d and \u201cProfessional  Services\u2014Not Elsewhere Classified\u201d instead of the merchant category  code for \u201cBetting\u2014Including Lottery, Gaming Chips, Track Wagers.\u201d   However, these establishments credited the wife\u2019s winnings to the  cardholder\u2019s account using the merchant category code for \u201cBetting\u2014 Including Lottery, Gaming Chips, Track Wagers.\u201d  Active monitoring by  the APC of ongoing travel card activity would have helped detect the  problem transactions sooner.", "Cardholder #2 was a highly skilled technical sergeant (E-6) at Travis  AFB, California, who held a secret clearance and worked on C-5 aircraft,  large cargo aircraft designed for airlifting weapons and supplies.  Our  discussions with base officials and our review of the cardholder\u2019s  personnel file and credit report revealed that the cardholder had several  credit card delinquencies prior to issuance of the travel card.

At that time, the account was suspended  and Bank of America closed and canceled the cardholder\u2019s account a  week later.  However, Travis AFB officials told us that they asked Bank  of America to keep the individual\u2019s travel card account open so that he  could travel where necessary to make repairs to downed C-5 aircraft.   The officials told us that the cardholder was one of a few experts who  could supervise repairs on the C-5 aircraft.

During the ensuing investigation  involving the individual, his security badge was revoked and he had to  be escorted to and from his worksite.  Shortly thereafter, Air Force  investigators videotaped the individual selling military protective gear  in a town near the base, and the individual was arrested and charged  with theft and sale of government property.  Investigators determined  that the individual was addicted to gambling and had used his  government travel card reimbursements and the proceeds from the sale  of stolen government property to finance his gambling habit.  In  January 2002, the individual was court-martialed, and in March 2002, he  was convicted of theft and sale of $50,000 in government property and  was dishonorably discharged.

IATS calculates the amount of per diem  authorized in the travel order and voucher and the amount of mileage, if  any, claimed by the cardholder.  In addition, any other expenses claimed  and approved are entered into IATS.  If problems with the voucher are  found during the initial entry of the information into IATS or during audits  after the initial entry, the voucher can be rejected and returned to the  cardholder for correction.  Once the vouchers are processed and possibly  audited, they are sent to DFAS for payment to the cardholder or to Bank of  America and the cardholder, if the cardholder elected to use the split  disbursement payment process whereby part of the reimbursement is sent  directly to Bank of America.
