This \"leakage\" from 401(k) accounts can result in a permanent loss of retirement savings. GAO was asked to analyze (1) the incidence, amount, and relative significance of the different forms of 401(k) leakage; (2) how plans inform participants about hardship withdrawal provisions, loan provisions, and options at job separation, including the short- and long-term costs of each; and (3) how various policies may affect the incidence of leakage. To address these matters, GAO analyzed federal and 401(k) industry data and interviewed federal officials, pension experts, and plan administrators responsi- ble for managing the majority of 401(k) participants and assets."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The incidence and amount of the principal forms of leakage from 401(k) plans--that is, cashouts of account balances at job separation that are not rolled over into another retirement account, hardship withdrawals, and loans--have remained relatively steady, with cashouts having the greatest ultimate impact on participants' retirement preparedness. Approximately 15 percent of participants initiated some form of leakage from their retirement plans, according to an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau survey data collected in 1998, 2003, and 2006. In addition, the incidence and amount of hardship withdrawals and loans changed little through 2008, according to data GAO received from selected major 401(k) plan administrators. Cashouts of 401(k) accounts at job separation can result in the largest amounts of leakage and the greatest proportional loss in retirement savings. Most plans that GAO contacted used plan documents, call centers, and Web sites to inform participants of the short-term costs associated with the various forms of leakage, such as the tax and associated penalties. However, few plans provided them with information on the long-term negative implications that leakage can have on their retirement savings, such as the loss of compounded interest and earnings on the withdrawn amount over the course of a participant's career. Experts that GAO contacted said that certain provisions had all likely reduced the overall incidence and amount of leakage, including those that imposed a 10 percent tax penalty on most withdrawals taken before age 59?, required participants to exhaust their plan's loan provisions before taking a hardship withdrawal, and required plan sponsors to preserve the tax-deferred status of accounts with balances of more than $1,000 at job separation. However, experts noted that a provision requiring plans to suspend contributions to participant accounts for 6 months following a hardship withdrawal may exac-erbate the long-term effect of leakage by barring otherwise able participants from contributing to their accounts. GAO also found that some plans are not following current hardship rules, which may result in unnecessary leakage."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The current economic recession has caused millions of U.S. workers to  lose their homes, their jobs, and significant portions of their retirement  savings. The sudden reduction in the value of retirement savings in  response to stock market declines has reportedly led many 401(k) plan  participants to feel less confident in reaching their retirement goals and to  worry that they may never be able to retire. Moreover, the rise in  unemployment has had a detrimental impact on retirement savings. For  example, unemployed participants can no longer make tax-deferred  contributions to employer-sponsored plans and will likely have more  difficulty saving anything at all. In addition, unemployment may lead  participants to tap into their accrued retirement savings to navigate  difficult times. This \u201cleakage,\u201d which can result in the permanent loss of  retirement savings, has raised concerns that plan participants may be  jeopardizing their long-term retirement security through the short-term  consumption of their retirement savings. Such reductions in retirement  savings may be even more pronounced if the leakage occurs at a time  when a participant\u2019s account balance has already experienced market  value losses.", "Since they were first introduced several decades ago, 401(k) plans have  become the principal retirement savings vehicle for millions of U.S.  workers. Unlike employees with more traditional defined benefit pensions,  employees with defined contribution plans\u2014such as 401(k) plans\u2014choose  to participate in their employers\u2019 plans and generally decide the amount  they want to contribute and how to invest it. Thus, they bear the  responsibility for funding and managing their investments in a way that  seeks to achieve sufficient benefits in retirement. The removal of  retirement savings prior to retirement can affect a participant\u2019s ultimate  preparedness for retirement, especially when the amounts removed are  spent and not replaced. For example, 401(k) participants who choose to  take a lump-sum distribution, or \u201ccash out,\u201d from their account balance  when separating from their employer, rather than rolling the money over  to another qualified plan, may find it difficult to accrue sufficient savings  to provide adequate income in retirement.", "In this report, we use a standard definition of leakage\u2014that is, participants  tapping into their accrued retirement savings prior to retirement. We do  not take into account other events that could adversely affect participant  balances, such as participants not taking advantage of the full employer  matching contribution, participants contributing less than the annual  federal limit, or the costs associated with paying plan administrative fees.  In addition, we use the term \u201ccashout\u201d to refer to a lump-sum distribution  made to an employee at job separation that is not subsequently rolled over  into a qualified retirement account or an individual retirement account  (IRA).", "You asked us to examine several aspects of leakage from 401(k) plans.  Specifically, we answer the following questions in this report:  1.  What are the incidence, amount, and relative significance of the  different forms of 401(k) leakage?  2.  How do 401(k) plans inform participants about hardship withdrawal  provisions, loan provisions, and options at job separation, including  the short-term and long-term costs associated with each?  3.  What is known about how various policies may affect the incidence of  401(k) leakage?", "To determine the principal forms of 401(k) leakage, we interviewed  industry and academic experts, reviewed laws and regulations, and  analyzed existing studies on leakage. We then identified cashouts,  hardship withdrawals, and participant loans as the three principal forms of  leakage for the purposes of this report. To determine the incidence and  amount of leakage over time, we analyzed a cross-section of the 3 most  recent years of nationally representative survey data collected in 1998,  2003, and 2006 in the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s Survey of Income and Program  Participation (SIPP). We also analyzed published annual statistics from the  Department of Labor and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), respectively,  to obtain aggregate loan default amounts and early withdrawal penalties  paid. To determine the recent prevalence of leakage, we analyzed  summary data from 2005 through 2008 that we obtained from 401(k) plan  administrators that represent about 22 million 401(k) participants and over  $1 trillion in 401(k) plan assets. To illustrate the relative significance of  leakage over time, we developed scenarios to simulate the effect that  various forms and amounts of leakage may have on retirement savings. In  developing these scenarios, we considered a range of factors, including  historical and projected rates of return, earnings, wages, contribution  rates, years until retirement, loan administration fees, and penalties  associated with leakage.", "To determine how plans inform participants about leakage, we  interviewed 26 plan administrators that represented an estimated 80  percent of 401(k) participants and 65 percent of 401(k) plan assets. As part  of these efforts, we analyzed documents related to leakage from 401(k)  accounts and conducted 10 site visits during which we interviewed  representatives, reviewed relevant documentation, and toured a  participant call center. We also reviewed selected 401(k) plan sponsor and  administrator Web sites, and current pension law and regulations.  Appendix II provides a list of the 401(k) plan administrators that we  contacted.", "To identify what is known about how various policy options may affect the  incidence of leakage, we identified provisions in current law, regulations,  and legislative proposals to identify policy options that are likely to affect  leakage. We then interviewed selected industry and academic experts to  determine how these provisions may affect leakage. We analyzed their  responses and identified the provisions that these experts said were likely  to affect leakage. We then developed model scenarios based on the factors  that experts identified, to illustrate the effect that certain provisions may  have on the accumulation of a participant\u2019s retirement savings.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2008 to August 2009 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. We determined that the data that we  analyzed were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report.  Appendix I of this report contains a detailed description of the  methodology used in this review and its limitations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Private-sector pension plans are classified either as defined benefit or as  defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans generally offer a fixed  level of monthly retirement income based upon a participant\u2019s salary,  years of service, and age at retirement, regardless of how the plan\u2019s  investments perform. In contrast, defined contribution plans, such as  401(k) plans, benefit levels depend on the contributions made to the plan  and the performance of the investments in individual accounts, which may  fluctuate in value. Named after section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue  Code, traditional 401(k) plans allow workers to save for retirement by  diverting a portion of their pretax income into an investment account that  can grow tax-free and be withdrawn without penalty after age 59\u00bd.  Employers and employees may make pretax contributions, up to certain  limits, to individual participant accounts. In 2009, participants may  contribute up to $16,500 per year. The 401(k) account balance is a function  of both the contributions made to the accounts over a career as well as the  investment performance of the account. As such, the declines in the  markets can have a stark effect on retirement savings, as happened in 2007  and 2008 when the financial markets declined.", "About one-half of all U.S. workers participate in some form of employer- sponsored retirement plan. Participation in 401(k) plans rose steadily from  fewer than 8 million participants in the mid-1980s to over 70 million  participants in 2006\u2014the most recent year for which data were available.  The assets in 401(k) plans also increased significantly over the same time  period, from less than $100 billion to over $3 trillion.", "Current law limits participant access to their retirement savings in their  employer-sponsored retirement plans so that the favorable tax treatment  for retirement savings is limited to savings that are, in fact, used to provide  retirement income. Only under certain circumstances do federal  regulations allow 401(k) plan sponsors to provide participants with access  to their tax-deferred retirement savings before retirement. IRS, within the  Department of the Treasury, and Labor\u2019s Employee Benefits Security  Administration (EBSA) are primarily responsible for enforcing laws that  govern defined contribution plans. IRS interprets and enforces provisions  of the Internal Revenue Code that apply to tax-qualified pension plans.  EBSA enforces the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA)  reporting and disclosure provisions and fiduciary responsibility standards,  which, among other things, concern the type and extent of information  provided to plan participants.", "Plan sponsors have considerable latitude within the regulatory guidelines  to choose whether to provide this access in the form of a participant loan,  a hardship withdrawal, or a lump-sum distribution when the participant  separates from an employer. Plans may allow participants to take loans,  but may place limitations on the amounts, purpose, or number of loans  available. Plans may also allow participants who can demonstrate that  they are facing a hardship to take hardship withdrawals. In addition, when  separating from their employer, participants may elect to receive a lump- sum distribution of their account balance, or \u201ccash out,\u201d rather than to  preserve the tax-deferred status of their accounts by rolling over their  account into another qualified plan or IRA. Table 1 provides a summary of  the provisions related to leakage from 401(k) plans.", "Plan sponsors may, but are not required to, offer loan and hardship  withdrawal provisions to participants. In providing these options, plans  offer participants a certain flexibility and short-term financial relief that  may improve a participant\u2019s overall long-term financial standing if the  distributions are used, for example, to pay off high-interest credit card  debt, purchase a primary residence, or support a college education.  Furthermore, as we reported in October 1997, the availability of loan  provisions is associated with encouraging workers to join their employer- sponsored 401(k) plans when they otherwise might not, resulting in higher  overall participation and contribution rates. Unlike other forms of  leakage, participant loans, which are paid back to the plan with interest,  become leakage only if they are not repaid.", "Early access to retirement savings may also burden participants with  short-term costs and long-term consequences. In the short term,  participants who take a distribution before reaching age 59\u00bd generally pay  a 10 percent early withdrawal penalty and income taxes on the distribution  amount, and may face other restrictions and fees, such as loan origination  fees.

For example, to discourage the use of  pension funds for purposes other than retirement, the law imposes an  additional 10 percent tax on certain early distributions made from  qualified retirement plans, such as a 401(k) plan, before a participant  reaches age 59\u00bd. As regular income distributions, these early distributions  are subject to federal and state income tax withholding and taxed at the  marginal income tax rate. Some early distributions may not be taxable if  they are rolled over into an IRA or another qualified retirement account.  Certain other distributions have been exempted from the additional tax.", "Participants tapping into their 401(k) account follow different rules and  procedures to gain access to their money, depending on whether they take  a loan, hardship withdrawal, or cashout.

For example, early distributions from a 401(k)  account, whether in the form of a cashout, hardship withdrawal, or  defaulted loan, may be subject to a 10 percent tax penalty that must be  paid in addition to the amount of the distribution. In addition, some plans  require participants who take a loan to pay an additional loan origination  fee or periodic loan maintenance fees over the course of the loan  repayment period. Participants taking hardship withdrawals are subject to  the 10 percent penalty and must eventually pay federal and state income  taxes on the hardship withdrawal amount. In addition, the requirement  that participants suspend all contributions to their plans for 6 months  following the hardship withdrawal not only prevents participants from  continuing to make contributions but also precludes them from obtaining  any employer matching contribution. The additional costs associated with  cashouts, hardship withdrawal, and defaulted loans can compound  permanent losses of retirement income by reducing a participant\u2019s balance  and precluding these amounts from compounding in the account over  time.", "While the estimated amount of 401(k) leakage is in the billions of dollars,  it represents a relatively small proportion of the aggregate value of assets  in 401(k) plans.

Cashouts can be especially damaging  if taken later in a career when a participant has less time to recover the  losses. For example, table 5 also shows that if a participant were to cash  out their plan at age 35, their account balance at age 65 would be $404,431,  or $183,618 less than had they left the money in their account."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Hardship Withdrawals Can Result in Large Reductions in Retirement Savings", "paragraphs": ["Participants who initiated hardship withdrawals also experienced large  reductions in their retirement savings over their careers.

In our analysis of  various leakage scenarios, we found that among all age and income levels,  hardship withdrawals had the greatest impact on low-income and younger  participants. For example, our simulation showed that a low-earning 35- year-old participant taking a $5,000 hardship withdrawal would forgo 12  percent in retirement savings resulting from the hardship, whereas a high- earning participant of the same age would forgo less than 5 percent due to  higher contribution amounts.

For example, one plan provided  participants with an online calculator tool that allows participants to  determine what effect a loan and its associated tax implications might  have on their future retirement benefit.

One expert told us that he believed that the penalty had  significantly reduced the number of cashouts being taken from 401(k)  plans. Other experts noted that the penalty served as a deterrent because  participants were generally reluctant to pay penalties, regardless of the  amount. A plan administrator told us that many participants contacting the  call center to inquire about a hardship withdrawal had reacted negatively  to the information that they would be required to pay a 10 percent penalty.  Some experts questioned whether the 10 percent penalty\u2019s power as a  disincentive needed to be strengthened to further discourage participants  from removing money from their accounts. Some felt that the percentage  was too low to have any major impact as a deterrent and suggested that  the penalty needed to be increased to further discourage participants from  taking early withdrawals. For example, one expert noted that young  workers who receive a distribution after leaving their first job may regard  the distribution as free money, and the penalty would only reduce the  amount of free money they received. Another expert said that the penalty  served more as a speed bump than as a deterrent for participants earning  higher incomes. Other experts noted that the provision did not deter  participants who were facing true hardships and needed money from their  accounts, regardless of the penalty assessed.", "Because the incidence and amount of leakage from 401(k) accounts have  remained relatively steady, the 10 percent penalty has continued to  provide a steady source of revenue to IRS. Officials told us that the penalty  serves a dual purpose: it deters participants from tapping into their 401(k)  account when they have other sources of money available, and it allows  the federal government to recoup a portion of the subsidy provided to  keep the money tax-deferred. According to published IRS data on early  withdrawals from qualified retirement plans, including 401(k) plans and  IRAs, more than 5 million tax filers paid $4.6 billion in early withdrawal  penalties in tax year 2006. As shown in figure 8, the amount of early  withdrawal penalties paid has increased since 1996, while the average  penalty paid per tax return has stayed about the same.", "Experts said that the provision that lowered the threshold for plan  sponsors to cash out the accounts of separating participants automatically  has likely reduced the overall incidence of leakage. Prior to this provision,  employers could compel mandatory cashouts for separating participants  with account balances under $5,000. The change reduced the threshold for  an automatic cashout to account balances valued at less than $1,000. For  account balances valued at between $1,000 and $5,000, employers were  required to preserve the tax-deferred status of the accounts, either by  keeping the assets in the plan or rolling the balances over into an IRA.  Several experts noted that the provision had dramatically reduced the  incidence of leakage for participants with balances of between $1,000 and  $5,000, but the overall effect was marginal because this group represents a  small proportion of the participant population.", "We developed an illustration to show the maximum savings that could be  preserved over the course of a participant\u2019s working career under the  automatic cashout provision. Our illustration showed that the reduction in  the maximum cashout amount could result in greater savings over time.  (See table 8.)", "Experts said that the provision requiring participants in 401(k) plans to  exhaust their plan\u2019s loan provisions before taking a hardship withdrawal  had likely reduced leakage by promoting the use of loans that are  generally repaid and returned to the plan. Experts said that the provision,  which reduces hardship withdrawals, was a good rule and made financial  sense. One expert said that because loans remain in the plan as an  investment and retain assets when repaid, they resulted in minimal  leakage. In contrast, hardship withdrawals result in the permanent  removal of assets from the plan and cannot be returned to a tax-deferred  account. Thus, taking a loan prior to a hardship withdrawal would  preserve more assets for retirement. One expert told us that it was  important for participants to exhaust their loans to reaffirm that the  hardship exists and is long-term in nature, and the expert emphasized that  it was the responsibility of the plan administrator to demonstrate that the  hardship withdrawal was the participant\u2019s loan of last resort. Another  expert noted that while the rule made financial sense, plan sponsors  needed to more actively encourage this practice, and not simply allow  participants to take a hardship withdrawal each time they faced a situation  that fell within the IRS definition of a hardship.", "In January 2009, as a result of its compliance monitoring examinations,  IRS reported the failure of plans to meet hardship distribution  requirements as one of the top 10 issues facing 401(k) plans. Among other  things, IRS found that administrators of plans that offer participant loans  and hardship withdrawals are allowing participants to take hardship  withdrawals without first exhausting the plan\u2019s loan provisions, as is  currently required. Plan administrators that we contacted said that most  of their plans strictly adhered to this provision; however, others stated that  some plans were not enforcing the provision. Several plan administrators  told us that some plans took participants at their word that they were  facing a hardship or believed that it was the plan sponsor\u2019s decision  whether to fulfill this requirement. For example, officials at one plan told  us that they asked participants whether they had taken a loan before  granting a hardship withdrawal, but that they did not verify the  participants\u2019 responses. Other plan administrators told us that they  believed that the requirement applied to some but not all 401(k) plans.  Under current rules, the loan exhaustion provision applies to all plans that  offer loans and hardship withdrawals, but there is no requirement for  plans to document compliance with this provision.", "Our illustration shows the amount of retirement savings that could be  preserved by adhering to this provision. Specifically, we calculated the  effect on the growth in retirement savings for a medium-income  participant who obtained a combination of a $2,500 loan and a $2,500  hardship withdrawal, rather than taking a $5,000 hardship withdrawal. As  shown in figure 9, participants obtaining even a portion of the needed  amount in the form of a loan could result in additional retirement savings  over the course of a working career."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Experts Said That the Provision Requiring Suspension of Contributions May Exacerbate the Long-term Effects of Leakage", "paragraphs": ["Experts noted that the statutory provision requiring a 6-month suspension  of participant contributions following a hardship withdrawal may increase  the amount of leakage by prohibiting those participants who can  contribute to their 401(k) accounts from doing so. Treasury officials told  us that the suspension period was intended to serve as a test to ensure that  the hardship was real, and that the participant did not have other assets  available to address the hardship. Many of the experts noted that the  provision did little to deter participants from taking hardship withdrawals.  For example, one expert told us that while the provision may have had  some effect as a deterrent to taking a hardship in theory; in practice, it  only affected people already experiencing a hardship.", "Other experts noted that the provision seemed to contradict the goal of  creating retirement income. One expert said that the provision  unnecessarily kept able participants from making contributions, such as  an employee who needed an infusion of cash for a discrete, one-time  event, such as a home purchase. Other experts characterized the  suspension period as excessive and more of an inconvenience than an  effective deterrent. For example, one expert noted, participants who need  money and initiate hardship withdrawals must pay taxes and penalties and  are prevented from making contributions, leaving them with 50 percent or  less of the money they had withdrawn. Several experts suggested  remedies, such as shortening or repealing the suspension period, or  allowing participants to at least keep their employer match during the  suspension period to begin making up lost ground.", "Our illustration shows the effect of the 6-month suspension on the  accumulation of retirement income. As shown in table 9, the suspension  period would have the greatest impact on the retirement savings of  midcareer participants earning a medium income.", "Finally, several experts noted that the 401(k) hardship withdrawal  definition was too broad and gave participants access to money for  circumstances that were both voluntary and foreseeable. For example,  under current rules, participants may take a hardship withdrawal for  purchasing their primary residence, which some experts said did not  constitute an immediate and heavy financial need. Moreover, the 401(k)  definition of hardship differs from hardship equivalents under other  qualified plans, such as 457(b) retirement plans. Under a 457(b) plan, for  example, a participant may take a hardship distribution only when faced  with an unforeseeable emergency, which the regulations define as a severe  financial hardship resulting from an illness or accident, loss of property  due to casualty, or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable  circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the  participant or beneficiary. In addition, the regulations also state that the  purchase of a home and the payment of college tuition are generally not  unforeseeable emergencies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["There are many reasons why participants may choose to use their  retirement savings prior to retirement, and some of these choices may  involve a rational trade-off between immediate financial emergencies and  future retirement needs. U.S. workers continue to feel the effects of the  current economic downturn in the form of job losses, home foreclosures,  and the depreciation of 401(k) retirement savings. With home values down  and lending sometimes difficult to obtain, some workers may see their  accrued 401(k) savings as their last protection against financial hardship.  Yet, even small amounts of leakage can have a significant impact on the  retirement savings of some plan participants.", "While tapping into a 401(k) account to meet short-term needs may be  rational under certain circumstances, some leakage could be mitigated if  participants had adequate information on the long-term implications of  their actions. Cashouts can be the most damaging form of 401(k) leakage,  are the least regulated, and appear to run counter to the goal of retirement  savings. However, many participants continue to take this option when  separating from their employer, in part because the option is often  presented to them with little or no information on its long-term  consequences. With better information on the consequences of the various  forms of leakage, participants may choose to preserve their retirement  savings, resulting in a better retirement outcome.", "Participants facing sudden and unanticipated hardships would also benefit  from the assurance that they are using the most appropriate and least  damaging option, thereby minimizing the negative impacts on their overall  retirement preparedness. For example, to avoid unnecessary leakage,  employers should not approve participants for hardship withdrawals until  they are certain that participants have exhausted the plans\u2019 loan  provisions. In addition, under current hardship rules, participants who  could continue making retirement contributions after taking a hardship  withdrawal are barred from doing so. This suspension of contributions  also prevents participants from receiving employer matching contributions  and will likely leave them with a lower account balance at retirement.  Ensuring that participants choose the path that causes the least harm to  their retirement accounts and continue to make retirement contributions  whenever possible may help mitigate the adverse impacts of leakage that  otherwise will linger into retirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To help participants recover more quickly from a hardship situation,  Congress should consider changing the requirement for the 6-month  contribution suspension following a hardship withdrawal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To support the goal of providing plan participants with understandable  and useful information about their employer-provided retirement plan  benefits, we recommend that the Secretary of Labor promote industry best  practices by encouraging plans to take the following actions:  Include on their participant Web sites information on their plan loan,  hardship withdrawal, and cashout provisions, including examples of the  long-term consequences of each provision.
