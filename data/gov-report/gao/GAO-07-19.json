It does not provide for the kind of strategic human capital management focus that GAO's research and evaluations have shown to be essential to the success of any organizational entity. For example, the staffing plan was not derived using a documented, data-driven methodology and does not provide for inventorying the knowledge and skills of existing staff, forecasting future knowledge and skill needs, analyzing gaps in capabilities between the existing staff and future workforce needs, (including consideration of expected succession needs), and formulating strategies for filling expected gaps. Exacerbating this situation is that the FBI is not proactively managing Sentinel human capital availability as a program risk; it has not included human capital in the program's risk inventory nor has it developed and implemented a proactive risk mitigation strategy, even though program documents cite human capital as both a challenge and a risk. According to program officials, they plan to manage their human capital needs in the same way as when they initially staffed the program office, in part because the bureau's IT system life cycle management policies and procedures do not require them to do otherwise.

According to the bureau, the complexity of this mission shift,  along with the changing law enforcement environment, strained its  existing IT environment. As a result, the bureau accelerated the IT  modernization program that it began in September 2000. This program,  later named Trilogy, was the FBI\u2019s largest IT initiative to date, and  consisted of three parts: (1) the Information Presentation Component to  upgrade FBI\u2019s computer hardware and system software, (2) the  Transportation Network Component to upgrade FBI\u2019s communication  network, and (3) the User Application Component to upgrade and  consolidate FBI\u2019s five key investigative software applications. The heart of  this last component became the Virtual Case File (VCF) system, which was  intended to replace the obsolete Automated Case Support system, FBI\u2019s  primary investigative application.", "While the first two components of Trilogy experienced cost overruns and  schedule delays, both are nevertheless currently still operating. However,  VCF never became fully operational. In fact, the FBI terminated the  project after Trilogy\u2019s overall costs grew from $380 million to $537 million,  the program fell behind schedule, and pilot testing showed that  completion of VCF was infeasible and cost prohibitive. Among reasons we  and others cited for VCF\u2019s failure were poorly defined system  requirements, ineffective requirements change control, limited contractor  oversight, and human capital shortfalls due to, for example, no continuity  in certain management positions and a lack of trained staff for key  program positions.", "The FBI reports that it has almost 500 systems, applications, databases,  and networks that are in operation, undergoing enhancement, or being  developed or acquired.

Using commercially available software and hardware components,  Sentinel is planned to provide a range of system capabilities and services,  including:  investigative case management, leads management, and evidence  management;   document and records management, indexed searching, and electronic  links to legacy FBI systems and external data sources; training, statistical, and reporting tools; and   security and application management.", "The FBI plans to acquire Sentinel in four phases, each of which will span  12 to 18 months. While the specific content of each phase is to be  proposed by and negotiated with the prime contractor, the general  content of each phase is as follows:    Phase 1: Includes a Web-based portal that will provide a data access tool  for ACS and other legacy systems and includes the definition of a service- oriented architecture to support delivery and sharing of common services  across the bureau.", "Phase 2: Includes the creation of case document and records management  capabilities, document repositories, improved information assurance,  application workflow, and improved data labeling to enhance information  sharing.", "Phase 3: Includes updating and enhancing system storage and search  capabilities.", "Phase 4: Includes implementing a new case management system to replace  ACS.", "Overall, the FBI estimates that the four phases will cost about $425 million  and take 6 years to complete. For fiscal year 2005, the FBI reprogrammed  $97 million in appropriated funds from various sources to fund Sentinel  work and submitted a $100 million budget estimate for fiscal year 2007.", "To manage the acquisition and deployment of Sentinel, the FBI established  a program management office within the Office of the Chief Information  Officer.

In doing so, the officials said that their approach was to fill  program leadership positions with government staff and to fill the rest  with government and contractor staff. Further, FBI officials said that they  had initially focused on positions associated with near-term program  management activities, such as program planning, requirements  management, and contract solicitation and award. For government  positions, program officials received support from the Human Capital  Office in posting job announcements and processing applications. The  program officials worked directly with existing contractors to fill contract  positions. According to officials, they were able to address their initial  staffing needs quickly because of the priority the Sentinel Program  Manager, who is directly responsible for human capital decisions, devoted  to recruitment and staffing efforts during the program\u2019s planning stages,  the availability of the FBI\u2019s Human Capital Office to assist them, and the  ability to draw from existing contract vehicles.", "Of the program\u2019s 78 positions, 60 are to be filled by contractors (77  percent). This level of reliance on contractors for program management is  appreciably higher than it was for another major IT program that we  recently reviewed . For example, the ratio of government-to-contractor  staffing on the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s US VISIT program was  about 50-50. According to Sentinel officials, their reliance on contractors  for program management is a common practice in intelligence programs.  While we are not aware of any generally accepted standards governing the  desired mix of government versus contractor personnel performing  program management functions, acquisition experts have recently raised  over-reliance on contractors in performing program management  functions as an emerging issue in the federal government.", "To date, the program office reports that it has filled 63 of 78 identified  positions (81 percent).

As we  previously reported, a strategic approach to human capital management  enables an organization to be aware of and prepared for its current and  future human capital needs, such as workforce size, knowledge, skills, and  training. To be effective, our research shows that such a strategic  approach includes using data-driven, fact-based methods to (1) assess the  knowledge and skills needed to execute a program; (2) inventory existing  staff knowledge and skills; (3) forecast the knowledge and skills needed  over time; (4) analyze the gaps in capabilities between the existing staff  and future workforce needs, including consideration of evolving program  and succession needs caused by turnover and retirement; and (5)  formulate strategies for filling expected gaps, including training, additional  hiring, and the appropriate use of contractors.

As previously stated, officials told us that they relied on their  collective years of experience in managing IT projects and the assistance  of a contractor to create the staffing plan, and that they reviewed resumes  of candidates to fill the positions in the staffing plan. These efforts have  not produced program life cycle strategies for retention of key staff,  succession planning for key positions, long-term hiring of new staff,  replenishment of workforce losses due to foreseeable attrition, or training  of existing staff.

In commenting on a draft of  this report, the CIO stated that, in July 2005, he began a three-phase  strategic human capital planning initiative, the purpose of which is to  provide the CIO with the means to meet the bureau\u2019s IT human capital  needs for the 21st century. The three phases are (1) development of a  competency model and an inventory of existing staff knowledge and skills,  (2) an analysis of gaps between staff needs and existing capabilities, and  (3) development and implementation of strategies to fill critical gaps. The  FBI reports that they are close to completing the first phase, but that much  work remains to be done. At the same time, the Sentinel program is well  under way. Moreover, while the CIO stated that the Sentinel staffing plan  will dovetail with this three-phase initiative, program officials told us that  it was not clear to them how, or whether, the program\u2019s staffing efforts  were aligned with or part of other human capital efforts under way at the  bureau.", "Nevertheless, program officials told us that they do not see a need to  change their approach to managing Sentinel human capital because they  believe that the approach used to initially staff-up the program office had  served them well. Officials told us they will reassess their human capital  needs for future phases of the project to ensure the right complement of  staff and skills mix is available for each phase. In addition, they said that  the bureau\u2019s life cycle management policies and procedures do not require  such a strategic approach to managing human capital for IT programs. Our  analysis of the bureau\u2019s system life cycle management directive and  program management handbook confirmed that they do not contain  policies, procedures, or guidance for doing so.

According to program  officials, the inventory does not include human capital risks because they  do not see a need to include them. Available Sentinel program  documentation and other statements by program officials, however,  suggest otherwise. For instance, the Sentinel staffing plan states that  adequate staffing is a critical factor in the program office\u2019s ability to  successfully execute its responsibilities, and that staff recruitment will be  a difficult challenge given the competition for skilled IT professionals with  security clearances in the Washington Metropolitan Area. Moreover, the  FBI\u2019s fiscal year 2007 budget submission for Sentinel (Exhibit 300)  identifies the availability of human capital for the prime contractor as a  program risk, and in commenting on a draft of this report, the CIO stated  that human capital risks exist. In addition, officials identified various  hiring challenges, such as that two-thirds of applicants fail the bureau\u2019s  security screening process and that the time it takes to execute the hiring  process can be lengthy.
