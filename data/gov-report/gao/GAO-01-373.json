In general, the preference has been intended to (1) direct the benefits of public resources--relatively inexpensive hydropower--to portions of the public through nonprofit entities, (2) spread the benefits of federally generated hydropower widely and encourage the development of rural areas, (3) prevent private interests from exerting control over the full development of electric power on public lands, and (4) provide a yardstick against which the rates of investor-owned utilities can be measured. The applications of various preference provisions have been challenged several times in the courts, which have directed a power marketing administration (PMA) to provide power to preference customers. In other instances, they have supported the denial of power to such customers. The characteristics of the electricity industry have changed. During the last 20 years, competition has been replacing regulation in major sectors of the U.S. economy. Several proposals have come before Congress to restructure the electrical industry, including some that would encourage the states to allow retail customers a choice in selecting their electricity supplier. As it debates these proposals, Congress has continued to consider the role of preference in the PMA's sale of electricity."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For decades, the power marketing administrations (PMA) of the  Department of Energy (DOE) have provided electricity, generated largely at  federal multipurpose water projects, to customers in over 30 states. To  guide the PMAs\u2019 efforts in marketing electricity, the Congress and the  courts have directed the PMAs to give certain customers preference.  Generally, preference is the opportunity to obtain priority access to federal  power that has traditionally been sold at rates generally below those of  other sources. Preference provisions come into play only when a potential  customer that does not have preference (such as an industrial user or a  commercial power company) and a preference customer (such as a  municipally owned utility or a rural electric cooperative) want to buy  federal power and not enough is available for both. As we enter the 21st  century, the electricity industry is restructuring from one dominated by  regulated monopolistic electric utilities to one that increasingly allows  customers to choose their source of electricity. The Congress continues to  consider legislation dealing with this industry\u2019s restructuring, including the  role of preference in the PMAs\u2019 sale of electricity.", "To help in congressional deliberations on the future role of the PMAs and  their preference customers, the Subcommittee on Water and Power asked  us to (1) identify how federal legislation and major relevant court cases  have, over time, directed the PMAs to give preference to particular  customers in purchasing electricity and (2) discuss the status of preference  in the PMAs\u2019 electricity sales in light of the restructuring of the electricity  industry.", "To do this, we reviewed power-marketing and land reclamation statutes  that contain provisions providing such preferences, which are referred to  as preference clauses or provisions. We also reviewed numerous legislative  proposals, as well as numerous judicial and administrative cases, that have  interpreted and applied the portions of various statutes that confer  preference. A list of the statutes, court cases, and administrative rulings we  reviewed appears in appendix I. A table showing the extent to which the  PMAs are selectively affected by various preference-related statutes is  contained in appendix II."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Preference Clauses and Beneficiaries Have Evolved Over Time", "paragraphs": ["Preference clauses have existed throughout the history of federal power  legislation and have been directed to a variety of customers and regions of  the nation. The Congress has mandated preference in the sale of electricity  by federal agencies in a number of power-marketing and land reclamation  statutes. The idea of establishing public priority or preference in the use of  public water resources dates back to the 1800s, when the Congress decided  to keep navigable inland waterways free from state taxes, duties, and the  construction of private dams. The Reclamation Act of 1906, which is also  referred to as the Town Sites and Power Development Act of 1906, is  generally considered the federal government\u2019s entry into the electric power  field. The act grants preference in the disposition of surplus hydroelectric  power from federal irrigation projects for \u201cmunicipal purposes,\u201d such as  street lighting.", "As the availability and sources of electricity have changed over time, the  types of preference clauses the Congress has included in legislation have  evolved. For example, with the Federal Power Act of 1920, preference  began to evolve from serving \u201cmunicipal purposes\u201d to serving particular  classes of users, such as public bodies and cooperatives. The 1920 act  required the federal government, when faced with breaking a tie between  competing equal applications, to give preference to states and  municipalities in awarding licenses for hydroelectric plants owned and  operated by nonfederal entities. The act defined a municipality as a city,  county, irrigation district, drainage district, or other political subdivision or  agency of a state competent under law to develop, transmit, utilize, or  distribute power. One primary benefit that the Congress sought in giving  priority to public utilities and cooperatives, which distribute power directly  to customers without a profit incentive, was to obtain lower electricity  rates for consumers. At that time, competitive rate setting was not used to  provide lower electricity rates for service from regulated monopolies with  dedicated service territories. The Congress has also provided preference to  specified regions of the nation.", "The notion of providing public bodies and cooperatives with preference for  federal hydropower rests on the general philosophy that public resources  belong to the nation and their benefits should be distributed directly to the  public whenever possible. Under the various preference clauses,  preference customers are given priority over nonpreference customers in  the purchase of power. In many cases, the preference provisions of federal  statutes give the electric cooperatives, many of which are rural, and public  bodies priority in seeking to purchase federally produced and federally  marketed power. However, the courts have held that preference customers  do not have to be treated equally and that all potential preference  customers do not have to receive an allotment of federal power. Preference  provisions come into play only when a potential customer that does not  have preference (such as an industrial user or a commercial power  company) and a preference customer (such as a municipally owned utility  or a rural electric cooperative) want to buy federal power and not enough  is available for both.", "The Congress initially granted preference in the sale of federal electricity to  public bodies and cooperatives for several reasons. First, it was a way to  ensure that the benefits of this power were passed on to the public at the  lowest possible cost, using cost-based rates, because the preference  customers generally were entities that would not incorporate a profit in  their rates. Second, it was also meant to extend the benefits of electricity to  remote areas of the nation using publicly and cooperatively owned power  systems. Additionally, the Congress gave preference to public bodies and  cooperatives to prevent the monopolization of federal power by private  interests. The rates charged by such nonprofit entities could then serve as a  yardstick for comparison with the rates charged by public and private  utilities. For example, the Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928 encouraged  public nonprofit distributors to begin marketing power by allowing them a  reasonable amount of time to secure financing in order to construct  generation and transmission facilities. According to the House Committee  on Irrigation and Reclamation, one of the committees that drafted the 1928  act, the allocation of power rights between the preference and  nonpreference customers was expected to create competition among  various entities, ensuring reasonable rates and good service. These entities  included states, political subdivisions, municipalities, domestic water- supply districts, and private companies. The committee viewed the  preference clause as a bulwark against the monopolization of power by  private companies. Another, more recent embodiment of the premise that  public resources should be provided to the public without an effort to  profit from their sale is the Hoover Power Plant Act of 1984. This act gives  preference primarily to municipalities and others for power generated at  the Hoover Dam. It also authorizes the renewal of a preference power  contract with an investor-owned utility, originally entered under the  Boulder Canyon Project Act of 1928.", "At about the same time as the Congress was enacting the Rural  Electrification Act of 1936 to encourage cooperatives and others to extend  their electric systems into nearby rural areas, it enacted other statutes that  affect how federally generated electricity is sold, especially to  cooperatives. The Bonneville Project Act of 1937, along with the earlier  (1933) Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) Act, extended preference to  include nonprofit cooperative organizations. The acts also authorized the  construction of federal transmission lines to carry the power, thus  minimizing regional reliance on private power companies. The two laws  established a statutory framework of energy allocation policies in an era of  extensive federal hydroelectric development. The 1937 Bonneville Project  Act authorized the construction of federal power lines in order to transmit  the federal power as widely as practicable. The act states that preference  was provided to public bodies and cooperatives to ensure that the  hydropower projects were operated for the benefit of the general public,  particularly domestic (residential) and rural customers. The preference  clauses in the Bonneville and TVA acts were both viewed as yardsticks for  evaluating the rates charged by private utilities.", "Preference for public entities and cooperatives is also found in the  Reclamation Project Act of 1939 and the Flood Control Act of 1944. The  Reclamation Project Act of 1939, which provides guidance for projects  operated by the Bureau of Reclamation, gives preference to municipalities,  other public corporations or agencies, and cooperatives and other  nonprofit organizations. The Bureau is an agency within the Department of  the Interior whose projects generate much of the electricity sold by  Bonneville and Western. The 1939 act limited preference for cooperatives  to those financed at least in part by loans made under the Rural  Electrification Act of 1936, as amended. The Flood Control Act of 1944,  which gives guidance for projects operated by the U.S. Army Corps of  Engineers, gives preference to public bodies and cooperatives. The Corps\u2019  projects generate electricity sold by all four PMAs. The act requires that  electricity be sold to encourage the most widespread use of power at the  lowest rates to consumers consistent with sound business practices. The  federal government was authorized to construct or acquire transmission  lines and related facilities to supply electricity to federal facilities, public  bodies, cooperatives, and privately owned companies. The legislative  history indicates that priority was given to public bodies and cooperatives  to expand rural electrification and to avoid monopolistic domination by  private utilities.", "Subsequent statutes, while building on preference provisions provided by  other federal power marketing laws, granted regional, geographic  preference. The Pacific Northwest Power Preference Act, enacted in 1964,  authorizes Bonneville to sell outside its marketing area, the Pacific  Northwest region, surplus federal hydropower if there is no current market  in the region for the power at the rate established for its disposition in the  Pacific Northwest. The 1980 Northwest Power Act requires Bonneville to  provide power to meet all the contracted-for needs of its customers in the  Northwest, extending the regional preference provisions of the 1964 act to  include not only hydropower but also power from Bonneville\u2019s and  customers\u2019 other resources\u2014including coal-fired and nuclear plants. As a  result of this regional preference, Bonneville\u2019s customers in the Pacific  Northwest\u2014including private utility and direct service customers as well  as public utilities\u2014have priority over preference customers in the Pacific  Southwest. The act also requires Bonneville to generally charge lower rates  to preference customers than to nonpreference customers. Such rates are  based upon the cost of the federal system resources used to supply  electricity to those customers.", "In September 2000, the 1980 Northwest Power Act was amended to allow  Bonneville to sell preference power to existing \u201cjoint operating entities\u201d  (public bodies or cooperatives formed by two or more public bodies or  cooperatives that were Bonneville preference customers by Jan. 1, 1999).  As indicated in the legislative history of the amendment, the new entities  could pool their members\u2019 or participating customers\u2019 power purchases  from Bonneville, which could result in operating efficiencies and  reductions in overhead costs for them, without reducing Bonneville\u2019s  receipts from the sale of power.", "The Congress also granted regional preference in the sale of electricity  from federal projects to other parts of the country, such as the Northeast,  that are not served by the PMAs or TVA. The 1957 Niagara Redevelopment  Act establishes (1) a division of all power from the project into preference  and nonpreference power, (2) a preference for public bodies and  cooperatives, with an emphasis on serving domestic and rural consumers,  and (3) a geographic preference for preference customers in New York and  in neighboring states.", "Other statutes give geographic preference to entire states or portions of  states for purchases of electricity generated in those areas. For example,  the 1928 Boulder Canyon Project Act gives preference to customers in  Arizona, California, and Nevada for purchases of excess power from the  Boulder Canyon Project. This preference language distinguishes among  preference customers, giving the states (e.g., California) a priority over  municipalities (e. g., Los Angeles)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Application of Preference Provisions Reviewed by the Courts", "paragraphs": ["Although we found no instances in which the statutory preference  provisions themselves were challenged, specific applications of these  provisions by the PMAs have been challenged in the courts and in  administrative proceedings. The cases have included disputes among  preference customers and between preference and nonpreference  customers of the various PMAs. In some instances, the courts have directed  a PMA to provide power to preference customers, and in other instances,  they have supported a PMA\u2019s denial of power to such customers. General  principles that may be drawn from the various court interpretations and  rulings are that (1) PMAs must act in favor of customers specifically  provided preference and priority in purchasing surplus power when  nonpreference customers are competing for this power, (2) PMAs have  discretion in deciding how and to which preference customers they will  distribute electricity when the customers are in competition with each  other for limited power, and (3) preference customers do not have to be  treated equally, nor do individual preference customers have an entitlement  to all or any of the power. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has  affirmed the application of preference clauses in its rulings, as has the  Attorney General in an opinion interpreting the preference provision of the  1944 Flood Control Act.

For example, the  issues and problems of the 1930s, when rural America was largely without  electricity and private utilities were not extensively regulated, were not  those that confronted the Congress in later decades or that confront the  Congress now. The issue of preference in power sales by the PMAs was of  continuing interest during the 106th Congress. Not only was the Northwest  Power Act amended in September 2000, but also a bill was introduced in  the Senate in April 2000 to amend the Niagara Redevelopment Act. This bill  would have eliminated the geographic preference allocating up to 20  percent of the power from the Niagara Power Project to states neighboring  New York. The preference status of sales to selected cooperatives and  public bodies in those states, however, would not have been affected. In  September 2000, a bill was introduced in the House of Representatives to  eliminate all future sales of preference power; its provisions would have  taken effect only as each existing power sale contract expired.  In October  2000, another bill was introduced in the House of Representatives to  authorize investor-owned electric utilities in California to purchase power  directly from Bonneville at specified rates. The 106th Congress adjourned,  however, without taking further action on these bills. As of January 30,  2001, no bills directly relating to preference power had been introduced in  the 107th Congress, according to DOE officials.", "Over the last 20 years, competition has been replacing regulation in major  sectors of the U.S. economy.

As the Congress continues these  deliberations, it is considering redefining existing federal roles, as well as  how to more efficiently and equitably produce and distribute electricity to  all customers. The way that the federal government generates, transmits,  and markets federal preference power has not changed in the same manner  as the industry surrounding it. In a March 1998 report, we noted that the  Congress has options that, if adopted, would affect preference customers.  Considering changes to the preference provisions would be consistent with  the spirit of several of our testimonies before various Senate and House  committees. Examining the legacy of existing federal programs in light of  changing conditions can yield important benefits. At these hearings, we  discussed the need to reexamine many federal programs in light of  changing conditions and to redefine the beneficiaries of these programs, if  necessary.

They also  observed that the previous administration did not support the repeal of the  \u201cpreference clause\u201d as part of the restructuring of the electricity industry.  That administration did not incorporate such provisions in its bill to  restructure the industry because it believed that federal restructuring  legislation should be designed to ensure that consumers in all states benefit  and that those in certain parts of the nation not be adversely affected.

D.C. 1985)", "Irrigation districts' claim to an allocation of power ahead of other preference  customers (super preference) for WAPA power was denied. The preference clause  of the Reclamation Project Act does not provide a superpreference for irrigators; it  only provides that public entities be given preference over private entities. The  clause does not require that all preference customers be treated equally or that they  even receive an allocation.

Southwestern Power Administration, 828 F.2d  1083 (5th Cir. 1987)", "The court upheld the dismissal of a challenge by an electric cooperative to an  exchange arrangement between a SWPA customer and an investor-owned utility.  The investor-owned utility's arrangement with preference customers does not violate  the preference provision of the Flood Control Act. Even though the investor-owned  utility receives some economic benefits, this is not a sham sale of preference power.", "ElectriCities of North Carolina, Inc. v.

The appellate court affirmed that preference rights under the  act accrue to public bodies and nonprofit cooperatives that are engaged in the actual  distribution of power. In determining the ultimate retail distribution of the power sold  to them, public entities could resell the power to industrial and commercial users, not  just to domestic and rural customers. The court also described \u201cyardstick  competition,\u201d a theory that underlies preference. The court stated that the Congress,  while concerned with meeting the needs of rural and domestic consumers, believed  that all interests could best be served by giving municipal entities the right to decide  on the ultimate retail distribution of the preference power sold to them. This belief  was founded on the so-called \u201cyardstick competition\u201d principle, which assumes that if  the municipal entities are supplied with cheap hydropower, their lower competitive  rates will force the private utilities in turn to reduce their rates, with resulting benefits  to all, including rural and domestic consumers.", "Massachusetts Municipal Wholesale Electric  Company v.

FERC held that any  public body or nonprofit cooperative in a state neighboring New York within  economic transmission distance of the Niagara Power Project is entitled to an  allocation of preference power. FERC also held that only publicly owned entities that  are capable of selling and distributing power directly to retail consumers are public  bodies entitled to preference under the act.", "Disposition of Surplus Power Generated At Clark  Hill Reservoir Project, 41 Op.

If within that period the preference customer does not do so, the  Secretary is authorized to contract with the nonpreference customer, subject to the  condition that should the preference customer subsequently obtain the means to  take and distribute the power, the Secretary will be enabled to deal with the  preference customer.
