Although IRS has collected recent compliance data, it still has concerns with some outdated methodologies and data used to estimate the tax gap. IRS is taking laudable steps intended to improve the estimate, which it plans to revise by the end of 2005. IRS has also developed a proposed schedule of compliance studies, but it has no approved plans to periodically measure compliance for the tax gap components. While it may not be feasible or necessary to measure compliance for all components at the same frequency or level of investment, periodic compliance studies would support a more data-driven and risk-based approach to reducing the tax gap. IRS recently began to capture data on the reasons why taxpayers are noncompliant. However, IRS has concerns about the data, such as examiners assigning the same reason for noncompliance regardless of situation. Also, it is often difficult for examiners to determine a taxpayer's intent--whether the noncompliance is unintentional or intentional. Collecting better data on reasons can help IRS focus its activities on taxpayer service or enforcement. Although IRS is developing a system intended to capture better examination data, IRS does not have firm or specific plans to develop better reason data. IRS approaches tax gap reduction through improving taxpayer service and enforcing tax laws and has two broad strategic goals and related key efforts that are intended to support this approach. However, IRS has not established long-term, quantitative compliance goals and regularly collected data to track its progress, which would complement its current, important compliance efforts. Establishing clear goals and measuring progress towards them would be consistent with results-oriented management principles. IRS has begun to consider additional goals, but it is not yet clear if they will be compliance related.

IRS also estimates the amount of the gross tax gap that it will recover  through enforcement and other actions and subtracts that to estimate the  net annual tax gap. For tax year 2001, IRS estimated that it would  eventually recover about $55 billion for a net tax gap from $257 billion to  $298 billion.

For example, by analyzing  1979 and 1982 TCMP data, IRS identified significant noncompliance with  the number of dependents claimed on tax returns and justified a legislative  change to address the noncompliance. As a result, for tax year 1987,  taxpayers claimed about 5 million fewer dependents on their returns than  would have been expected without the change in law.", "Tax compliance data are useful outside of IRS as well. Other federal  agencies and offices use compliance data for tax policy analysis, revenue  estimating, and research. For example, the Department of Commerce\u2019s  Bureau of Economic Analysis had used TCMP data to adjust its national  income and product accounts.

According to IRS, without current compliance  data, it has limited capability to determine key areas of noncompliance to  address and actions to take to maximize the use of its limited resources.  For example, the formulas that IRS creates from compliance data to select  returns for examination have enabled IRS to focus examination resources  on noncompliant returns rather than burdening compliant taxpayers.  When IRS updated the formulas in the early 1990s with compliance data  from the 1988 TCMP, IRS selected a lower percentage of compliant tax  returns for examination. However, after 3 years of using formulas based  on the 1988 data, the percentage of compliant tax returns examined  increased each year through 1998, placing additional burdens on  compliant taxpayers and leaving less time for IRS to examine  noncompliant returns that resulted in an additional tax assessment.", "Historically, IRS has varied how frequently it measured compliance for  particular types of taxpayers and taxes. As appendix I shows, the period  between measurements of individual income tax reporting compliance,  which consistently has accounted for the largest portion of the tax gap,  never exceeded 4 years between 1963 and 1988. In planning the 2001 NRP  to measure individual income tax compliance, IRS envisioned doing the  NRP on a 3-year cycle. Appendix I also shows that IRS measured  compliance less frequently for other types of taxpayers and taxes, such as  for small corporation income taxes, and that IRS never measured  compliance for large corporations or for excise taxes.", "Although regularly measuring tax compliance can be beneficial, how often  measurements should be made is a judgment that depends on many  potential criteria including (1) the amount that a particular type of  noncompliance is thought to contribute to the tax gap, (2) whether IRS has  reason to believe that compliance may have changed (e.g., due to tax law  changes), and (3) costs, particularly when IRS officials said that resources  to conduct operational examinations are already limited. Using these  criteria, IRS would likely vary the frequency of compliance measurement  studies. Based on these criteria as well as our previous reports, decisions  about compliance measurement would also be affected by the following  factors.", "Precision. The costs and benefits of measuring compliance can vary with  how precisely IRS wishes to measure compliance to achieve an intended  use (e.g., tax gap estimation or examination return selection).

For example, taxpayers  may unintentionally claim the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) because  they do not understand the child residency requirements for this credit  (i.e., a dependent must live with the taxpayer for more than half of the  year).

Through  efforts such as education and outreach programs, IRS seeks to improve  voluntary compliance with the tax system by helping people understand  their tax obligations. In addition, IRS attempts to simplify the tax process,  such as by revising forms and publications to make them more easily  understood by diverse taxpayer communities and electronically  accessible. In conjunction with taxpayer service, IRS uses its enforcement  authority to ensure that taxpayers are reporting and paying the proper  amount of taxes. Through efforts such as examining tax returns and  collaborating with state governments to share leads on abusive tax  avoidance transactions, IRS seeks to detect and deter noncompliance.", "Two of IRS\u2019s three strategic goals, along with their associated objectives  and strategies, are intended to directly support this approach.", "Goal 1\u2014Improve Taxpayer Service\u2014is intended to promote voluntary  compliance. This goal has three objectives (1) improve service options for  the tax paying public (2) facilitate participation in the tax system by all  sectors of the public and (3) simplify the tax process.", "Goal 2\u2014Enhance Enforcement of the Tax Law\u2014is intended to ensure,  through IRS\u2019s enforcement authority, that taxpayers are meeting their tax  obligations. The four objectives for this goal are (1) discourage and deter  noncompliance with emphasis on corrosive activity by corporations, high- income individual taxpayers, and other contributors to the tax gap; (2)  ensure that attorneys, accountants, and other tax practitioners adhere to  professional standards and follow the law; (3) detect and deter domestic  and off-shore-based tax and financial criminal activity; and (4) deter abuse  within tax-exempt and governmental entities and misuse of such entities  by third parties for tax avoidance or other unintended purposes. To  achieve these objectives, IRS has 15 strategies, such as \u201cre-examine and  adjust audit processes to target likely areas of noncompliance.\u201d", "In addition to these goals, IRS\u2019s service and enforcement efforts outlined  in its strategic plan are also intended to support tax gap reduction. IRS\u2019s  strategic plan mentions over 60 service and enforcement efforts targeted  at improving taxpayer compliance. Because the plan did not prioritize  these efforts, we asked IRS officials to identify the key efforts in reducing  the tax gap. In response, IRS provided over 40 key efforts. Enforcement  efforts included pursuing high income nonfilers (taxpayers with income  over $100,000 who have not filed a tax return) through direct enforcement  actions and identifying higher priority collection cases through analytical  models. Service, or nonenforcement, efforts included a taxpayer education  program on tip reporting.

However, IRS\u2019s strategies for  improving compliance generally lack a clear focus on long-term,  quantitative goals and results measurement. IRS has established broad  qualitative goals and strategies for improving taxpayer service and  enhancing enforcement of the tax laws. IRS has also identified measures,  such as compliance rates for tax reporting, filing, and payment as well as  the percentage of Americans who think it is acceptable to cheat on their  taxes, which are intended to gauge the progress of its strategies toward  its broad goals. However, IRS does not collect recent data to update all of  these compliance measures and has not established quantitative goals  against which to compare the measures and judge any progress made  through its compliance strategies.", "Although IRS has not focused on quantitative, results-oriented goals for  improving voluntary compliance, IRS has established many output-related  goals and measures that track activity level, such as the number of  taxpayers contacted, collection cases closed, or returns examined. In  contrast, IRS has fewer outcome-related goals and measures that track  results, such as refund timeliness or examination quality.", "In the past, IRS had set a long-term goal of improving overall compliance  to 90 percent by 2001. This goal was to be achieved through a research  approach rooted in IRS\u2019s Compliance 2000 philosophy. The Compliance  2000 philosophy envisioned using nonenforcement efforts to correct  unintentional noncompliance and reserving enforcement efforts for  intentional noncompliance. To carry out this philosophy, in the early  1990s, IRS initiated many research projects across IRS\u2019s 63 district offices  to identify noncompliant market segments, root causes for the  noncompliance, and innovative ways to improve compliance. However,  the lack of objective compliance data, among other factors, limited the  success of this approach. Recently, external stakeholders, such as the IRS  Oversight Board, have supported the concept of setting a numeric, long- term goal for increasing the voluntary compliance rate.", "In response to a President\u2019s Management Agenda initiative to better  integrate budget and performance information, IRS officials said that they  are considering various long-term goals for the agency. IRS has not yet set  a time frame for publicly releasing the goals.

As such, long-term, quantitative compliance goals offer several benefits for  IRS, as discussed below.", "Perhaps most important, compliance goals coupled with periodic  measurements of compliance levels would provide IRS with a better basis  for determining to what extent its various service and enforcement efforts  contribute to compliance. Additionally, long-term, quantitative goals may  help IRS consider new strategies to improve compliance, especially since  these strategies could take several years to implement. For example, IRS\u2019s  progress toward the goal of having 80 percent of all individual tax returns  electronically filed by 2007 has required enhancement of its technology,  development of software to support electronic filing, education of  taxpayers and practitioners, and other steps that could not be completed  in a short time frame. Focusing on intended results can also promote  strategic and disciplined management decisions that are more likely to be  effective because managers who use fact-based performance analysis are  better able to target areas most in need of improvement and select  appropriate interventions. Likewise, agency accountability can be  enhanced when both agency management and external stakeholders such  as Congress can assess an agency\u2019s progress toward meeting its goals.  Finally, setting long-term, quantitative goals would be consistent with  results-oriented management principles that are associated with high- performing organizations and incorporated into the statutory management  framework Congress has adopted through GPRA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Updated Compliance Data Provide Opportunities for IRS to Establish a More Results-Oriented Tax Gap Reduction Approach", "paragraphs": ["Not unlike other agencies we have reported on in the past, IRS faces  challenges in implementing a results-oriented management approach, such  as identifying and collecting the necessary data to make informed  judgments about what goals to set and to subsequently measure its  progress in reaching its goals.

IRS\u2019s most recent EITC compliance study  estimated that between $8.5 billion and $9.9 billion, or between 27 percent  and 32 percent, respectively, of the EITC claims filed for tax year 1999  should not have been paid. Following the release of this study, a task force  of IRS and Treasury officials determined the three leading types of errors  that accounted for about $7 billion annually in overclaims. On the basis of  compliance data and other research, IRS started an initiative to improve  service, fairness, and compliance and designed specific corrective actions  targeting the three types of errors. IRS is evaluating these actions to  determine their effectiveness at reducing the overclaim rate in each of the  three errors. Because IRS targeted its EITC effort based on data on the  sources and extent of taxpayer errors, it was better able to determine what  actions to take and how well, using systematic data collection and  program evaluation, the effort is meeting its intended purpose.", "Measuring progress toward any goals that may be set could be challenging.  For example, IRS researchers have found it difficult to determine the  extent to which its enforcement actions deter noncompliance or its  services improve compliance among taxpayers who want to comply.  Although widespread agreement exists that IRS enforcement programs  generally increase voluntary tax compliance, challenges such as collecting  reliable compliance data, developing reasonable assumptions about  taxpayer behavior, and accounting for factors outside of IRS\u2019s actions that  can affect taxpayer compliance, such as changes in tax law, make it  difficult to estimate the effect of IRS\u2019s enforcement and service activities.  Even if IRS is unable to empirically estimate the extent to which its  actions directly affected compliance rates, periodic measurements of  compliance levels can indicate the extent to which compliance is  improving or declining and provide a basis for reexamining existing  programs and triggering corrective actions if necessary.", "Recently, several research studies have offered insights to better  understand the direct tax revenue effects of IRS\u2019s activities as well as the  indirect effects on voluntary tax compliance. IRS researchers have  hypothesized that the indirect effect of an examination varies among  taxpayer segments. Further, a recent study concluded that criminal  investigations have positive direct and indirect tax effects. Although these  studies generally indicate that IRS activities have positive tax effects, the  magnitude of these effects is not yet known with a high level of confidence  given compliance measurement challenges, as mentioned earlier.  According to IRS, these studies serve as a valuable baseline for further  research, but it has not yet determined how it will use these studies to  make operational decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As discussed in our recent testimony on the tax gap before the Senate  Committee on Finance, and underscored by IRS, periodic tax compliance  measurement is critically important to IRS\u2019s ability to estimate the tax gap  and design compliance programs intended to reduce the tax gap. Without  current, reliable compliance data, it can be difficult for IRS to monitor  trends or identify new types of noncompliance, determine its compliance  resource needs and how to allocate such resources, and justify budget and  staffing requests to policy makers in Congress and the executive branch.  Consequently, completion of NRP, which covered the largest portion of  the tax gap and was designed and implemented with an eye to reducing  the costs and burdens of data collection, is a substantial achievement.  However, although IRS has recently proposed a schedule for future NRP  studies, it has no approved plans to repeat this study or periodically  measure compliance across the various components of the tax gap. Doing  periodic compliance studies in areas that have previously been measured,  such as individual income tax underreporting, would provide valuable  information to support a more data-driven and risk-based approach  towards improving compliance and reducing the tax gap. Although it may  not be feasible or necessary to measure compliance for all components of  the tax gap at the same frequency or with the same level of investment,  where practical methodologies exist, periodic measurements should be  taken. Where practical methodologies do not yet exist, such as for excise  tax or for large corporations, looking for ways to overcome challenging  compliance measurement difficulties would be worthwhile.", "The tax gap is both a measure of the burden and frustration of taxpayers  who want to comply but are tripped by tax code complexity and of willful  tax cheating by a minority who do not wish to pay their fair share to  support government programs. As such, collecting data on the reasons  why noncompliance occurs can help IRS more effectively tailor its efforts  to improve compliance. It can be difficult for IRS examiners to  consistently determine the reasons why taxpayers have failed to comply  with the tax laws. However, IRS has no specific plans to address this issue  and, as a result, is missing opportunities to gather better data than it  already collects. Certain immediate steps, like improving reason codes,  better training examiners in applying the codes, and possibly reducing the  number of examiners who would be responsible for making judgments on  the reasons taxpayers are noncompliant may improve the data IRS  currently collects. Nevertheless, given the difficulty of consistently  determining why taxpayers are noncompliant, sustained research on these  reasons also would be needed to develop a better understanding.", "Reducing the tax gap will be a challenging task given persistent levels of  noncompliance and will not likely be achieved through a single solution.  Rather, the tax gap must be attacked on multiple fronts and with multiple  strategies over a sustained period of time. Without long-term, quantitative  voluntary compliance goals and related performance measures, it will be  more difficult for IRS to determine the success of its strategies, adjust its  approach when necessary, and remain focused on results, especially since  factors that affect compliance change over time. Having compliance goals,  coupled with recently collected NRP data, would provide a solid base  upon which IRS can develop a more strategic, results-oriented approach to  reducing the tax gap.", "Taken together, these steps\u2014periodically measuring compliance,  determining the reason taxpayers are noncompliant, and setting results- oriented long-term goals\u2014can help IRS build a foundation to understand  how its taxpayer service and enforcement efforts affect compliance,  improve its efforts, and make progress on reducing the tax gap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To establish a stronger foundation for improving IRS\u2019s efforts to reduce  the tax gap, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue should do the  following.", "Develop plans to periodically measure tax compliance for areas that have  been previously measured, such as for individual income tax  underreporting, and study ways to cost effectively measure compliance for  other components of the tax gap that have not been measured, such as for  excise tax and large corporations.
