Education subsequently established the Race to the Top (RTT) grant fund and awarded almost $4 billion to 12 states related to developing effective teachers and leaders, improving the lowest-achieving schools, expanding student data systems, and enhancing standards and assessments. This report, prepared in response to a mandate in the act, addresses (1) actions states took to be competitive for RTT grants; (2) how grantees plan to use their grants and whether selected nongrantees have chosen to move forward with their reform plans; (3) what challenges, if any, have affected early implementation of states' reform efforts; and (4) Education's efforts to support and oversee states' use of RTT funds. GAO analyzed RTT applications for 20 states, interviewed state officials, visited 4 grantee states, analyzed states' planned uses of grant funds, and interviewed Education officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State officials GAO interviewed said their states took a variety of actions to be competitive for RTT grants. Of the 20 states GAO interviewed, officials in 6 said their states undertook reforms, such as amending laws related to teacher evaluations, to be competitive for RTT. However, officials from 14 states said their reforms resulted from prior or ongoing efforts and were not made to be more competitive for RTT. While officials in all 20 states told us that applying for RTT took a significant amount of time and effort, several of them also said their state benefited from the planning that the application process required. Grantees plan to use RTT grant funds to implement reforms in four areas. The largest percentage of state-level RTT funds will be used to increase the effectiveness of teachers and leaders. GAO interviewed officials in 8 nongrantee states who said they expect to continue implementing parts of their RTT plans, though at a slower pace than if they had received a grant. Most grantee states have faced a variety of challenges, such as difficulty hiring qualified personnel, that have delayed implementation. As a result, as of June 2011, about 12 percent of first-year grant funds were spent, and some projects were delayed several months. Some state officials said they expect to spend more funds soon and may seek Education's approval to reallocate some first-year grant funds into later years. Education has provided extensive support to grantee states and has begun monitoring. Education assigned a program officer to each state to assist with implementation and has developed ways for grantees to share information, such as hosting meetings on specific initiatives. Some officials from nongrantee states said they would find this information useful, but they were generally unaware of these resources or were unable to access them."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Education (1) facilitate information sharing among grantees on additional promising practices and (2) provide nongrantee states with related information.

RTT, referred to in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of  2009 (Recovery Act) as State Incentive Grants, is the largest competitive  grant fund ever administered by Education. RTT is also notable because it  provides incentives for reform across multiple areas of K-12 education.  Areas of reform include adopting standards and assessments that prepare  students to succeed in college and the workplace and improving the  lowest-achieving schools. Reforms similar to those in RTT are included in  Education\u2019s proposal for reauthorizing the Elementary and Secondary  Education Act of 1965 (ESEA); the proposal also includes other  competitive grants as a way to drive innovation in K-12 education. In  addition to Recovery Act funding already awarded, in fiscal year 2011,  Education can award up to $700 million in RTT grants to states with an  emphasis on early childhood learning. The administration has proposed  $900 million for fiscal year 2012 for RTT grants to be made directly to  school districts.", "The Recovery Act requires GAO to evaluate the RTT grant fund.

We analyzed RTT applications for 20  of the 47 states that applied for RTT grants in the first, second, or both  phases of the RTT grant competition: the 12 states (including the District  of Columbia) that received the grants and 8 selected states that did not  receive grants. We interviewed officials in these 20 states about their  efforts to apply for the RTT grant. In addition, we selected 4 grantee  states\u2014Delaware, New York, Ohio, and Tennessee\u2014for in-depth data  collection; we conducted site visits to those states and a total of 12 of their  school districts. During these visits, we interviewed officials in states and  districts about their planned uses for RTT grant funds, their perspectives  on the benefits of their planned uses, challenges they have experienced in  beginning to implement grant activities, and support provided by  Education. We also reviewed relevant federal laws, regulations, and  guidance and interviewed Education officials.

Education divided the criteria into two  groups: (1) \u201creform conditions criteria,\u201d referring to the state\u2019s history of  and current status in implementing reforms and (2) \u201creform plan criteria,\u201d  referring to the state\u2019s plans to implement new reforms. States were  required to provide a narrative response for each criterion and provide  performance measures and other information for selected criteria. The  applications also had to include budgets and timelines for implementing  certain proposed reform efforts. In short, states were to provide  information not only on the extent of their experiences implementing  reforms in these areas, but also on their plans for moving forward.", "In addition, states could demonstrate that a sufficient number of their  school districts were committed to participating in their RTT reform plans  by having a memorandum of understanding signed by district  superintendents, school board presidents, and local union  representatives. The Recovery Act requires that districts in each grantee  state must receive at least 50 percent of the state\u2019s total grant, and,  according to Education, only participating districts receive these funds.  States could also describe how they would work with participating  districts to use RTT funds to improve student outcomes, such as  increasing the rates at which students who graduate from high school are  prepared for college and careers.

Education  issued proposed requirements for the RTT grant fund in July 2009, and in  November 2009, the department issued final requirements and a notice  inviting state governors to apply for Phase 1 of the grant. For a state to  have been eligible to receive an RTT grant, Education must have  previously approved the state\u2019s applications in both rounds of SFSF grant  awards. In addition, at the time they submitted their RTT applications,  states could not have any legal, statutory, or regulatory barriers to linking  data on student achievement or growth to teachers and principals for  evaluation purposes. States had the option to apply in either phase of the  competition but were only able to reapply in Phase 2 if they did not  receive a grant in Phase 1.", "Forty-one states applied for RTT funds in Phase 1 of the competition, and  all applications were reviewed and scored by external reviewers using  Education\u2019s grant award criteria. Sixteen states passed the initial review  and were deemed \u201cfinalists\u201d for the grants. In March 2010, Education  announced that Delaware and Tennessee would receive grants of  approximately $100 million and $500 million, respectively. Education  posted all Phase 1 applications and reviewers\u2019 scores and comments on its  Web site. In April 2010, Education issued a notice inviting applications for  Phase 2 of the RTT grant competition, and in August, Education  announced that 10 states received Phase 2 RTT grants ranging from $75  million to $700 million. (Education was required to award all RTT grant  funds by Sept. 30, 2010.) The size of each state\u2019s award was based in part  on the size of the state, among other factors.

As in Phase 1, all applications and reviewers\u2019  scores and comments were posted on Education\u2019s Web site.", "Following Education\u2019s announcement of grant recipients, states were  given access to 12.5 percent of their award. This amount is approximately  equal to the state portion of the first year grant amount for state-level  activities only. To receive the rest of their grant funds, states had to  submit, and the department had to approve, documents known as scopes  of work, which were more streamlined implementation plans that updated  and aligned timelines and budgets in the states\u2019 approved applications.  Education also required states to submit scopes of work from each of their  participating school districts 90 days after the grants were awarded.  Education reviewed and approved the state scopes of work and also  reviewed the extent to which district scopes of work aligned with their  respective state\u2019s plans.

Any funds not obligated  and liquidated by September 30, 2015, will revert to the U.S. Treasury,  according to Education officials. Also, Education required RTT grantee  states, school districts, and schools to identify and share promising  practices\u2014with the federal government and the public\u2014that result from  implementing RTT projects. This requirement includes making RTT data  available to stakeholders and researchers and publicizing the results of  any voluntary evaluations they conduct of their funded activities.", "Education\u2019s policy is to monitor grantee states to ensure they meet their  goals, timelines, budgets and annual targets, and fulfill other applicable  requirements. According to Education officials, the department\u2019s  monitoring plan for states emphasizes program outcomes and quality of  implementation, while also ensuring compliance with RTT program  requirements. They said the monitoring process for RTT grantees builds  on the process that the department uses to monitor all discretionary  grants. This process includes, among other things, (1) establishing  working partnerships with grantees in order to effectively administer and  monitor awards, (2) reviewing and approving administrative changes to  grants, (3) monitoring projects for performance and financial compliance,  (4) providing technical assistance and feedback to grantees on their  progress, and (5) reviewing final outcomes and disseminating information  about successful results. In addition, Education requires states to monitor  how school districts use RTT funds.", "Education\u2019s Institute of Education Sciences (IES) is conducting a series of  national evaluations of RTT state grantees as part of its evaluation of  programs funded under the Recovery Act. In September 2010, IES  awarded two contracts to evaluate RTT implementation, outcomes, and  impacts on student achievement. One evaluation will examine multiple  Recovery Act programs, including RTT, and the other evaluation will focus  on RTT and the School Improvement Grants program.

Those policy changes included new state legislation  and formal decisions made by executive branch entities, such as the  governor or state board of education (see table 2). For example, New York  officials told us that their state enacted several new education reform laws  to be competitive for RTT, including a law that allows school districts to  partner with state-approved organizations to manage their lowest- achieving schools. California officials also told us that their state passed  several laws to be competitive for RTT. California\u2019s Governor called a  special session of the legislature, during which it passed a variety of  laws\u2014such as adopting the Common Core State Standards and repealing  an existing law that prohibited the use of student achievement data in  decisions such as setting a teacher\u2019s pay or deciding whether a teacher  should be promoted.", "In contrast, officials in the other 14 states we interviewed said that their  states made education policy changes during the RTT application period,  but those changes were not made specifically to be competitive for an RTT  grant. State officials explained that the changes their state made reflected  the culmination of education reform efforts that began prior to the RTT  competition. For example, Ohio enacted legislation in 2009 that required  the state to set more challenging statewide academic standards, created  new ways for teachers to earn their teacher\u2019s license, and required college  readiness examinations for high school students. Ohio officials said that  the legislation was introduced before RTT was announced and was not an  action that Ohio took to be competitive for the grant. However, they also  told us that RTT being aligned with existing state policies influenced their  decision to apply for the grant. Arizona officials told us that their state  enacted legislation in 2010 that required a variety of changes to their K-12  education system. These changes included developing a new teacher  evaluation system based on growth in student achievement and  establishing a commission to set guidelines for student data collection and  reporting. Arizona officials said these legislative changes would have been  made regardless of RTT.", "In addition to making policy changes, officials in all 20 states we  interviewed said they conducted outreach to a variety of stakeholders\u2014 including school district officials, state legislators, and representatives  from the business community\u2014to build support for the state\u2019s RTT  application. To demonstrate a state\u2019s ability to implement reforms  statewide, the RTT application allowed states to submit signed  memoranda from school districts that agreed with the state\u2019s reform plans.  Officials in 10 states\u20144 grantee states and 6 nongrantee states\u2014told us  they made significant efforts to secure the participation of their school  districts. For example, officials in Ohio\u2014a state with over 1,000 school  districts (including more than 300 charter school districts)\u2014said they met  with district leadership, traveled to districts for in-person meetings, and  attended teacher union meetings and training sessions on RTT to build  consensus around the reforms. In addition, officials in all 20 states we  interviewed told us they held meetings with education stakeholder groups,  such as state legislators, and members of the business community to  discuss the state\u2019s education reform plan and stakeholder roles in it. States  received letters of support from many organizations and state legislators  for their applications. For example, Pennsylvania reported receiving over  270 letters of support for its Phase 2 RTT application from a wide variety  of individuals and groups, including some elected officials, teacher unions,  and businesses.", "Officials in the 20 states we interviewed also told us that applying for RTT  required a significant amount of time and effort. Many officials we  interviewed estimated spending thousands of hours to prepare the RTT  application; however, they generally did not track the total costs  associated with their efforts. One state official estimated that her state  spent at least 4,000 hours preparing their RTT application. Also, all 20  states we interviewed received grants to hire consultants who helped  prepare the RTT applications. For example, the Bill and Melinda Gates  Foundation reported funding technical assistance providers who assisted  25 states in developing their RTT applications. Each of these 25 states,  including 14 of the 20 we interviewed, received consulting services worth  $250,000 with these funds. With grants such as these, states hired  consultants who provided a range of services, including drafting material  for the application and conducting background research and analysis.  State officials told us that consulting firms received between $75,000 and  $620,000 for their services. According to Education officials, states  commonly receive external support to apply for federal grants, such as the  Teacher Incentive Fund, in an effort to leverage their resources more  effectively. However, Education officials also explained that the RTT  competition was more comprehensive in scope than other federal  discretionary grants, which may have prompted states to seek out a  greater level of external support. Many state officials reported that high- level staff from multiple state offices helped prepare the application. For  example, officials in North Carolina told us that the State Superintendent  of Public Instruction and the Chairman of the State Board of Education led  the team that wrote the state\u2019s application and that the Governor  presented part of the state\u2019s application to a group of peer reviewers  during the application review process.

The following  examples illustrate planned uses of RTT funds for these activities:    Training teachers to use student performance data to improve  instruction. Delaware plans to spend about $7 million to hire 29 data  coaches to work with small groups of teachers to improve instruction  using student performance data. These teachers will use technology- based tools called instructional improvement systems to guide them  through this process. Under Delaware\u2019s new academic assessment  system, teachers will be able to make instructional changes with real- time data from student assessments that will be administered several  times a year. Delaware state officials said that RTT will provide funds  for data coaches in schools with limited numbers of high-need students  and that they would not be able to provide these resources without the  funds. (Prior to RTT, the state had been using data coaches in schools  with the greatest number of high-need students.) According to  Delaware state officials, the first five coaches were scheduled to start  working with teachers as a pilot program in March 2011 in five  districts, and by July 2011 each school in the state will have access to a  data coach for two full school years. After 2 years, state officials expect  that data coaches will have built enough capacity in each school  district, so that district leaders can independently provide support to  teachers in using the data.", "Developing systems to evaluate teacher and principal  effectiveness. New York plans to spend approximately $2.6 million to  develop and adopt a new value-added student growth model, which  will measure annual changes in individual student academic  performance and tie the performance to teacher evaluations. According  to state officials and their RTT application, a new state law requires all  classroom teachers and principals to be evaluated based in part on  student data, which will include assessment results and other measures  of achievement. The law also establishes annual teacher evaluations as  a significant factor for employment decisions such as promotion and  retention.", "Providing professional development to improve the skills of  incoming and current teachers and school leaders.

North Carolina officials plan to develop training in the coming months  and complete it by October 2013. According to North Carolina state  officials, Web-based training will eventually be available in every  school district and will help ensure that professional development  materials are consistent. These officials told us that without RTT funds,  they would not have been able to provide this training in every district.  In addition, the state plans to spend $18.6 million to create Regional  Leadership Academies that, according to North Carolina state officials,  are a major part of their professional development plan.

State officials said they planned to issue the request by the spring of 2011,  but at the time of our review, the proposal had not yet been issued.", "Officials in the states we visited\u2014Delaware, New York, Ohio, and  Tennessee\u2014said they experienced other challenges that led to months- long delays in implementing 13 of 29 selected RTT projects. For example,  Delaware adjusted its plan for hiring data coaches, individuals who assist  teachers with understanding the results of student assessment data and  help them modify their instruction. Initially, the state planned to hire 15  data coaches in January 2011 and an additional 20 beginning in September  2011, assuming the cost for each coach was $68,000. However, as they  started the process of hiring coaches, state officials determined their cost  estimate was insufficient to hire qualified personnel. Instead, they  determined they needed about $80,000 per coach and lowered the number  of total coaches to 29. Also, state officials determined it would be too  disruptive to hire 15 coaches in the middle of a school year. The state  decided to hire coaches between February and May 2011, with the goal of  having all 29 coaches in place by September 2011. Improved planning on  the part of the RTT grantees could have minimized the timeline delays that  resulted from complicated state-level procurement processes or hiring  challenges. Officials from three states acknowledged that at least some of  their timelines were overly optimistic. Nonetheless, challenges such as  these are not entirely unexpected given the amount of planning needed to  assemble a comprehensive reform plan that involves numerous local  entities and stakeholders.", "In addition to the challenges cited, Education\u2019s review of state  documentation has taken longer than anticipated, in part because of the  department\u2019s need to review changes to state plans. According to  Education officials, when Phase 2 grantee states submitted their scopes of  work in November 2010, they included changes to their original RTT  budgets and timelines, which Education had to review and approve. For  example, Education approved Massachusetts\u2019s request to reschedule two  activities in the teacher and leaders reform area from year 1 to year 2, due  to hiring delays. For these reasons, Education has taken longer than it  anticipated to approve state scopes of work. As of April 28, 2011,  Education had approved scopes of work for 9 of the12 RTT grantee states.", "Department officials said they continue to work with the remaining states  to complete the approval process for their scopes of work.", "As a result of these challenges, states have been slow to draw down their  RTT grant funds. As of June 3, 2011, states had drawn down about $96  million, or 12 percent, of the year 1 total RTT grant funds totaling almost  $800 million (see table 3), although Delaware and Tennessee have had  access to their funds for about a year, and the other grantees have had  access to their funds for several months.", "Education officials told us that states have the full 4-year grant period to  draw down their entire grant funds. They said states that anticipate not  drawing down the full amount of their year-1 budgets have requested  changes to their reform plan that would allow them to make additional  expenditures in later years. For example, Florida officials plan to request  that Education allow them to revise their budgets and allocate some year-1  funds in their budget for year 2. In addition, some states have spent less of  their grant funds than originally anticipated, to ensure that sufficient  internal controls and cash management procedures were in place before  requesting reimbursement. For example, an official from the District of  Columbia told us that they can only make drawdowns after a payment has  been made. This is due in part to the District\u2019s status as a \u201chigh-risk\u201d  grantee, a designation applied by Education to grantees that, among other  things, have experienced significant challenges administering their grants  in the past. The official explained that, as of March 2011, the District had  spent almost $13 million of its own funds for activities related to its RTT  grant and that he expected the District to spend funds at a faster pace in  the future."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Provided Extensive Support and Is Monitoring States\u2019 Activities, but Its Efforts to Facilitate Information Sharing Are Somewhat Limited", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Education Provided Extensive Support and Guidance to States during Early Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Education provided support to states as they have begun to implement their  reform plans. For example, Education assigned program officers to each  state to help determine how the department could support the grantee  states as they implement their RTT plans. According to Education and  several state officials, program officers talk with state officials by telephone  at least once a month and review the state\u2019s monthly progress reports to  determine if the state is on schedule and on budget and to provide  assistance with any state-reported issues. Program officers identify and  provide support or direct state officials to appropriate sources of support  for any issues associated with implementing funded activities. Program  officers also answer state officials\u2019 questions and provide guidance and  support on an as-needed basis, seeking assistance from department officials  when necessary. For example, Education officials told us that, after  Delaware approved their school districts\u2019 scopes of work for year 1, they  approved Delaware\u2019s request for an additional year to work with districts to  update and improve their plans for years 2 through 4 of the grant period.  Officials from most grantee states told us that Education generally provided  helpful support after their initial grant awards.", "In addition to the support provided by program officers, Education created  a process to allow states to make changes to their reform plans and issued  and updated written guidance and other documents to help states  implement RTT activities. For example, Education posted on its Web site a  \u201cfrequently asked questions\u201d document, as well as state scopes of work,  award letters, final budget summaries, and amendment decision letters.  Several state officials we spoke with said that having these materials on  Education\u2019s Web site is helpful. Education has also provided additional  guidance on specific challenges. For example, the department helped  Tennessee officials correct their indirect-cost calculations and submit a  revised budget after being selected as a grantee in Phase 1. After working  with Tennessee officials to make the needed changes, Education provided  additional guidance on calculating indirect costs for Phase 2 applicants  and made this information available for all applicants on the department\u2019s  Web site."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Has Begun to Monitor State Implementation of RTT- Funded Activities", "paragraphs": ["Education has begun its process to monitor states\u2019 progress in meeting  program goals. Since the grants were awarded, the department has been  tracking states\u2019 activities and challenges by regularly communicating with  states, reviewing their monthly progress reports, and reviewing other  documentation, such as state scopes of work. Education\u2019s monitoring  protocol uses a common set of questions to oversee state progress and to  address specific needs and challenges of each grantee. This protocol  requires states to submit a progress update each month that provides  information on activities selected in consultation with Education and  based on their state scope of work and application. In addition, Education  will hold discussions with states twice a year. Prior to these discussions,  states are to provide additional information, such as any updates needed  to their monthly progress reports and their assessment of the extent to  which they are on track to reach their performance goals. In addition,  Education plans to conduct annual, on-site reviews of RTT program  operations and activities in each state and to require states to submit an  annual performance report that documents their progress in achieving  planned education reforms. The department plans to finalize these  reporting requirements in the summer of 2011. According to Education  officials, the agency plans to issue various reports based on RTT  monitoring: (1) annual state-specific progress reports on RTT starting in  late 2011 that will include information on implementation and  performance; (2) an annual report on the progress of all 12 states  collectively; and (3) a report to be issued at the end of the 4-year grant  period on the overall experience, including lessons learned.", "In addition to federal monitoring, states will monitor school district  implementation of grant activities. Education initially required state  grantees to submit their school district monitoring plans within 6 months  of their grants being announced. However, Education officials told us that  state officials wanted to review the department\u2019s monitoring plan before  designing their own plans for school districts. In February 2011, Education  informed states that their plans for monitoring districts would not be due  until Education finalized its state monitoring plan. Education finalized its  plan in April 2011, and all states subsequently submitted their plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Facilitates Information Sharing, but Grantees Want More Information, and Nongrantees Are Unaware of Plans to Share Lessons Learned", "paragraphs": ["Education has taken steps to facilitate information sharing and  collaboration among states. Specifically, Education is working with a  contractor to provide technical assistance, such as developing a Web site  through which RTT states can collaborate and hold meetings\u2014known as  communities of practice\u2014on topics of common interest. Education  officials said the secure Web site allows states to share ideas, documents,  and other information. Communities of practice will address topics such  as implementing new teacher evaluation systems. Education conducted  two webinars in November 2010 on teacher evaluation, and in December  2010, Education convened officials from grantee states in Washington,  D.C., to share guidance and challenges on the topic. Additional topics that  have been covered include measuring academic growth in nontested  subjects, such as music and art. Education officials said that in the future,  the communities of practice will include a combination of in-person and  online gatherings and will be flexible and responsive to state needs.  Education is planning another meeting in the fall of 2011 for states to  discuss strategies to turn around low-achieving schools.", "In addition, while grantee states told us they contact each other to  exchange information, they said they would like more opportunities to  share promising practices. According to education officials from  Delaware, for example, they shared information with Rhode Island and  other states about providing technical assistance to school districts to help  them implement reforms at the district level. Tennessee officials told us  they shared their state-level plans and their template for school district  scopes of work with several Phase 2 grantees before Education published  examples on its Web site. However, grantee states expressed interest in  additional opportunities to share promising practices. North Carolina,  Ohio, and Rhode Island plan to develop statewide data systems to improve  instruction, which state officials expect will help teachers analyze their  students\u2019 performance data to better address academic material that  students find difficult to understand. Officials from these states said they  are interested in working with other states on developing and  implementing these systems. In addition, Tennessee officials told us that  once they begin implementing models to turn around low-achieving  schools with their Achievement School District, they could share their  experiences. They said doing so could be helpful since most states do not  have experience with turning around low-achieving schools on the scale  that Tennessee plans to attempt.", "Many nongrantee states continue to implement key reforms. However,  officials from most (6 of the 8) nongrantee states we spoke with told us  they were not able to access the Web site and were not aware of the  Education-sponsored communities of practice. For example, an education  official from Arizona said that he receives many e-mails from Education,  but the department has not notified him of any plans to share practices or  information about RTT. He added that he would appreciate having the  opportunity to gain knowledge from grantees. Because Arizona has other  federal grants, such as the School Improvement Grant for turning around  low-achieving schools, he would like to know how RTT states and school  districts are leveraging other federal funding sources to implement  activities that align with the RTT reform areas.", "In addition to states\u2019 interests in sharing information, Education has  certain policies that support information sharing and collaboration.  Education generally requires states and their subgrantees to make  information about their RTT-funded projects and activities available to  others by, for example, posting that information on a Web site identified or  sponsored by Education. Education also requires all program officers  responsible for administering discretionary grant programs to share  program results and information about significant achievements, including  the best available research and practices that could inform other projects  with the public.

It led some states to undertake new initiatives and  others to accelerate their existing and planned educational reform efforts.  While it is too soon to know whether these initiatives will help close  achievement gaps or significantly improve outcomes for K-12 students, the  broader impact of RTT\u2019s reform efforts may be more evident over time  through, for example, Education\u2019s impact evaluation study and other  related studies. Whether the momentum around the reform initiatives and  efforts to implement them can be sustained over time may depend on a  number of factors, including the progress that states make as they begin to  implement their reform initiatives. In addition, if state funding for K-12  education declines, states might face challenges sustaining RTT reform  efforts once grant funds are no longer available.", "The overarching goal of RTT is to foster large-scale education reform.  Sharing information with nongrantee states carrying out similar initiatives  can accelerate the pace and scope of reform efforts and is a sound  investment of resources. And if states are to get the greatest possible  return on investment, efforts to facilitate sharing of information should  begin soon. Information sharing among grantees is also important. Without  opportunities for grantees to share information and experiences, states  may miss opportunities to learn from each other and leverage their  experiences.", "Although Education provided support to grantees as they began  implementing their initial activities, most grantees have faced challenges  meeting some interim deadlines. While states might have done a better job  of anticipating some of their challenges, they were tasked with developing  comprehensive reform plans requiring extensive planning and  coordination with a broad array of stakeholders. Missing interim deadlines  has not yet derailed states from their original reform plans. However,  short-term delays could eventually lead to longer-term delays, and  grantees may risk falling short of their ultimate goals. While Education has  begun monitoring grantee progress, it is important that Education ensure  that states meet their required timelines and receive assistance to stay on  track.

However, while  the department agreed that sharing information with nongrantees is  important, it did not agree that nongrantees should have access to the  secure grantee Web site or the communities of practice. As noted in its  response, the department believes grantees should have more time to  work together on common problems before providing access to specific  information-sharing mechanisms to other states. Education also noted that  it plans to make the resources and lessons learned from grantee states  available to all states at some point in the future. We maintain that  nongrantee states that are implementing reforms similar to those funded  by RTT could benefit from the discussions grantees have and related  documents they may develop.

We also identified other actions states  took to apply for RTT grants. To determine whether a state changed a  certain policy or law to be competitive for RTT, we used the following  criteria: (1) the change in law or policy occurred within the RTT  application period, (2) state officials attributed the change or the effort to  being a factor in applying for the RTT grant, and (3) state officials reported  that the change would not have happened without the RTT competition.

Major budget categories included personnel expenses,  contracts, or state allocations to school districts. We reviewed grant draw- down amounts provided by Education. We interviewed state education  officials from all 12 grantee states, including telephone interviews with 8  grantee states and site visits to 4 grantee states\u2014Delaware, New York,  Ohio, and Tennessee.

During our site visits,  we interviewed state officials and officials from three to four school  districts per state. To provide a range of perspectives, we selected school  districts that varied across several criteria, including the extent to which  the district was mentioned in the state RTT application; whether the  district was in an urban, suburban, or rural area; the percentage of high- minority schools in the district; and the percentage of high-poverty schools  in the district.
