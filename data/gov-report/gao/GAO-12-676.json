IDES replaced the departments' separate processes for evaluating servicemembers for fitness and disability. Initially a pilot at 3 military treatment facilities, IDES is now in place at military treatment facilities worldwide. In previous reports, GAO identified a number of challenges as IDES expanded to more facilities, including staffing shortages and difficultly meeting timeliness goals. In light of IDES' expansion, GAO was asked to examine: (1) the extent to which DOD and VA are meeting IDES timeliness and servicemember satisfaction performance goals, and (2) steps the agencies are taking to improve IDES performance. GAO analyzed IDES timeliness and customer satisfaction data, visited six IDES sites with varying performance, and interviewed DOD and VA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Case processing times under the Integrated Disability Evaluation System (IDES) have increased over time, and measures of servicemember satisfaction have shortcomings. Since 2008, annual average processing times for IDES cases have steadily climbed, while the percentage of cases meeting established timeliness goals declined. Average case processing times reached 394 and 420 days for active and reserve component members in fiscal year 2011--compared to goals of 295 and 305 days, respectively, and just 19 percent of active duty and 18 percent of guard or reserve servicemembers completed the process and received benefits within established goals. Of the four phases comprising IDES, the medical evaluation board phase increasingly fell short of timeliness goals, while the physical evaluation board phase, although meeting goals, was taking increasingly more time to complete. With respect to servicemember satisfaction with the IDES process, GAO found shortcomings in how these data are collected and reported, such as unduly limiting who is eligible to receive a survey and computing average satisfaction scores in a manner that may overstate them. Department of Defense (DOD) officials told GAO they are considering alternatives for gauging satisfaction with the process. DOD and Veterans Affairs (VA) are taking steps to improve IDES performance, but progress to date is uneven and it is too early to assess their overall impact. For example, VA increased resources for completing exams and disability ratings while the Army is hiring additional staff for its medical evaluation boards. VA has met exam timeliness goals in the past several months, but other resources have yet to translate into lower processing times. DOD and VA are pursuing system upgrades so that staff and managers at IDES facilities can better track and manage the progress of servicemembers' cases. IDES officials have been working with the military services to correct case data that were inaccurately entered into VA's IDES tracking system, but have not yet identified a permanent solution to improve the accuracy of data input. Finally, DOD, with VA's assistance, is in the early stages of an in-depth review of the entire IDES process and its supporting IT systems. This effort is intended to improve understanding of how each step contributes to overall processing times and identify opportunities to streamline the process and supporting systems. However, timeframes for completing the review or issuing recommendations have yet to be established."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["To improve monitoring of IDES timeliness and satisfaction, GAO recommends that DOD and VA work together to (1) develop plans for completing the ongoing business process review and implementing any resulting recommendations and (2) improve the accuracy of case information at the point of data entry; and that (3) DOD consider alternative approaches to measuring satisfaction.

We supplemented these analyses with  site visits to six military treatment facilities, where we spoke with DOD  and VA staff as well as some servicemembers involved in the IDES  process. We selected these facilities to obtain perspectives from sites in  different military services and geographical regions and with varying  caseloads and performance outcomes. For both research objectives, we  interviewed key officials involved with IDES at DOD, VA, and each of the  military services, and reviewed pertinent reports, guidance, plans,  relevant federal laws, regulations, directives, and other documents. We  conducted this performance audit from May 2011 to August 2012, in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

This phase involves four stages: (1) the  servicemember is counseled by a DOD board liaison on what to expect  during the IDES process; (2) the servicemember is counseled by a VA  case manager on what to expect during the IDES process and medical  exams are scheduled; (3) medical exams are conducted according to VA  standards for exams for disability compensation by VA, DOD, or  contractor physicians, and (4) exam results are used by the MEB to  identify conditions that limit the servicemember\u2019s ability to serve in the  military.an impartial medical review by a physician not on the MEB, or both.", "Also during this stage, a servicemember can seek a rebuttal, or  PEB phase: In this subsequent phase, decisions are made about the  servicemember\u2019s fitness for duty, disability rating and DOD and VA  disability benefits, and the servicemember has opportunities to appeal  those decisions. This includes: (1) the informal PEB stage, an  administrative review of the case file by the relevant military branch\u2019s PEB  without the presence of the servicemember; (2) VA rating stage, where a  VA rating specialist prepares a rating that covers the conditions that DOD  determined made a servicemember unfit for duty and any other conditions  claimed by the servicemember to VA. This rating is prepared for use by both agencies in determining disability benefits. In addition,  servicemembers have several opportunities to appeal different aspects of  their disability evaluations: a servicemember dissatisfied with the decision  on whether he or she is fit for duty may request a hearing with a \u201cformal\u201d  PEB; a servicemember who disagrees with the formal PEB fitness  decision can, under certain conditions, appeal to the reviewing authority  of the PEB; and a servicemember can ask for VA to reconsider its rating,  but only for conditions found unfitting by the PEB.", "Transition phase: If the servicemember is found unfit to serve, he or she  enters the transition phase and begins the process of separating from the  military. During this time, the servicemember may take accrued leave.  Also, DOD board liaisons and VA case managers provide counseling on  available benefits and services, such as job assistance.", "VA benefits phase: A servicemember found unfit and separated from  service becomes a veteran and enters the VA benefits phase.

The overall timeframes  are intended to represent an improvement over the legacy disability  evaluation system, which was estimated to take 540 days to complete.", "In addition to timeliness, the agencies also established a performance  goal of having 80 percent of servicemembers satisfied with the IDES  process. DOD measures satisfaction through surveys conducted after the  completion of the MEB, PEB, and transition phases. Each survey consists  of approximately 30 questions, including 4 questions that ask about the  servicemember\u2019s satisfaction with the overall IDES process up to that  point.

DOD\u2019s and VA\u2019s current goal is to complete 60 percent of IDES cases on  time. In fiscal year 2008, an average of 63 percent of cases for active  duty servicemembers and 65 percent for reservists completed the  process and received benefits within the timeliness goals; by fiscal year  2011 this was down to 19 and 18 percent respectively (see fig. 5). These  trends also hold when considering all cases that completed the IDES  process regardless of outcome, although overall processing times were  shorter. (See app. III for more information on case processing times  regardless of outcome.)", "When examining timeliness across the four phases that make up IDES,  data show that average processing time regularly fell short of goals for  three\u2014MEB, Transition, and VA Benefits. For example, for cases that  completed the MEB phase in fiscal year 2011, active duty and reserve  component members\u2019 cases took an average of 181 and 188 days  respectively to be processed, compared to goals of 100 and 140 days.  For the PEB phase, processing times increased over time, but were still  within the established goal of 120 days. Along with increasing average  processing times, the percentage of cases meeting goals for most phases  has generally declined (see fig. 6). In particular, the MEB and Transition  phases have lower percentages of cases meeting goals than the other  phases in most years, especially for active duty cases.", "As noted above, the MEB phase was a key contributor to increases in  overall processing times between 2008 and 2011 for both active duty  servicemembers and reservists for cases that have completed the IDES  process regardless of outcome (table 1).", "To obtain a better understanding of more recent timeliness trends within  the MEB phase, GAO analyzed MEB timeliness of all cases\u2014all fiscal  years combined\u2014that completed the MEB process by sorting them into  two groups: (1) those that completed the entire IDES process, and (2)  those that had not yet completed IDES but completed the MEB phase.

However, the percentage of reserve component  members who missed the goal by more than 90 days increased from 18  to 28 percent.", "For those servicemembers who were still enrolled in the MEB phase as of  December 2011, the data show that 41 percent of active duty and 33  percent of reserve component servicemember cases had already missed  the goal processing times (see fig. 8). Of these, 15 percent of active duty  and 10 percent of reservist component servicemember cases missed the  goal by more than 90 days.", "Within the MEB phase, significant delays have occurred in completing  medical examinations (medical exam stage) and delivering an MEB  decision (the MEB stage). For cases completing the MEB phase in fiscal  year 2011, 31 percent of active duty and 29 percent of reservist cases  met the 45-day goal for the medical exam stage and 20 percent of active  duty and 17 percent of reservist cases met the 35-day goal for the MEB  stage. Officials at some sites we visited told us that MEB phase goals  were difficult to meet and not realistic given current resources. For  example:", "Some military officials noted that they did not have sufficient numbers  of doctors to write the narrative summaries of exam results needed to  complete the MEB stage in a timely manner. One facility noted that  while they have 7 doctors, they would need 11 additional doctors and  10 technician assistants to process cases through the initial medical  exam and other additional disability specific examinations in a timely  manner. Further, officials at another Army base we visited noted that  there was a shortage of doctors and DOD board liaisons and that they  had difficulty recruiting such staff due to the remote location of the  base.", "At all the facilities we visited, officials told us DOD board liaisons and  VA case managers had large case loads. While DOD has established  a goal of 1 board liaison for every 20 servicemembers, the ratios  varied widely by military treatment facility with a range from 1:1 as the  lowest to the highest of 1:75 according to recent data. Because of  high case loads and a reported increase in the complexity of cases,  staff at one facility reported a liaison to servicemember ratio of 1:80  and noted that liaisons must often prioritize cases to deal with the  most pressing issues first. As a result, cases that might otherwise be  quick to process take longer simply because they are waiting to be  processed. Liaisons are often working overtime and weekends to  keep up with cases.", "Monthly data produced by DOD subsequent to the data we analyzed  show significantly improved timeliness for the medical exam stage (66  percent of active duty cases met the goal in June 2012) and some  improvement for the MEB stage (40 percent of active duty cases met the  goal in the month of June 2012). However, it is too early to tell whether  these improvements will continue going forward.

For all cases that completed the PEB  phase in fiscal year 2011, only 38 percent of active duty and 38 percent of  reservists\u2019 cases received an informal PEB decision within the 15 days  allotted. Further, only 32 percent of active duty and 27 percent of reservist  cases received a preliminary VA rating within the 15-day goal. (see   table 3).", "Regarding delays with the VA rating, VA officials told us that staffing has  been a challenge at their IDES rating sites and that this has slowed case  processing. Monthly data produced by DOD subsequent to the data we  analyzed show similar trends for the informal PEB and VA preliminary  rating stages. As of June 2012 (most recent data available), active duty  cases showed slight improvements in timeliness for the informal PEB  stage (41 percent of cases meeting the goal and processing times  averaging 24 days). The VA rating stage, on the other hand, showed  slight declines in timeliness (31 percent of cases meeting the established  goal and processing times of 35 days) relative to FY 2011 averages for  active duty servicemembers. However, as noted before, it is too early to  tell the extent to which such trends will continue. (See app. III for DOD  reported monthly data, October \u2013 June 2012.)", "Also during this phase, IDES planners allocated the majority of overall  PEB processing time (75 out of the 120 days) for appeals\u2014including a  formal PEB hearing and a reconsideration of the VA ratings. According to  officials, while the three appeal stages do not happen for every case,  appeals can significantly increase processing times for any one case.  However, only 20 percent of cases completed in fiscal year 2011 actually  had any appeals; calling into question DOD and VA\u2019s assumption on the  prevalence and average effect of appeals, and potentially masking  processing delays in other mandatory parts of the PEB phase.", "The transition phase has consistently taken longer than its 45-day goal\u2014 almost twice as long on average. While processing times improved  slightly for cases that completed this phase in fiscal year 2011 (from 79  days in fiscal year 2010 to 76 days in fiscal year 2011 for active duty  cases), timeliness has remained consistently problematic since fiscal year  2008 (see table 4).", "DOD lacks comprehensive data on how servicemembers spend their time  in the transition phase, which includes many different activities related to  separation from the military. These activities vary widely depending on  the case. For example, during this phase servicemembers receive  mandatory training such as job training through the Transition Assistance  Program and may also receive counseling such as pre-discharge  Vocational Rehabilitation and Employment counseling. In addition,  servicemembers may be placed on temporary duty while house hunting,  or to allow for a servicemember\u2019s children to complete the school year  before moving. Servicemembers may also take earned leave time\u2014to  which they are entitled\u2014before separating from the service. For example,  an Army official said that Army policy allows servicemembers to take up  to 90 days of earned leave prior to separating, and that average leave  time was about 80 days. Because many of these activities can occur  simultaneously or in small intermittent segments of time, DOD officials  said it is difficult to track which activities servicemembers participate in or  determine how much time each activity takes. DOD is exploring options  for better tracking how time is spent in this phase. Because a potentially  substantial amount of the time in this phase may be for the personal  benefit of servicemembers, DOD recently began reporting time in IDES  with and without the transition phase included.", "Processing time improved somewhat for the benefits phase (48 days in  fiscal year 2010 to 38 days in fiscal year 2011), but continued to exceed  the 30-day goal for active duty servicemembers (see table 5).", "Several factors may contribute to delays in this final phase. VA officials  told us that cases cannot be closed without the proper discharge forms  and that sometimes they do not receive this information in a timely  manner from the military services. Additionally, if data are missing from  the IDES tracking system (e.g., the servicemember already separated,  but this was not recorded in the database), processing time will continue  to accrue for cases that remain open in the system. Officials could not  provide data on the extent to which these factors had an impact on  processing times for pending cases, but said that once errors are  detected and addressed, reported processing times are also corrected."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Shortcomings in the Design and Administration of Servicemember Surveys Hamper their Usefulness", "paragraphs": ["In addition to timeliness, DOD and VA evaluate IDES performance using  the results of servicemember satisfaction surveys. In principle, all  members have an opportunity to complete satisfaction surveys at the end  of the MEB, PEB, and transition phases; however, under current survey  procedures servicemembers become ineligible to complete a survey for  either the PEB or transition phases if they did not complete a survey in an  earlier phase. Additionally, servicemembers who start but do not  complete a phase are not surveyed. As such, DOD may be missing  opportunities to obtain input from servicemembers who did not complete  a prior survey or exited IDES in the middle of a phase. Further,  response rates may be affected because DOD does not survey  servicemembers once they separate from the service and become  veterans. While it is not necessary for DOD to survey all servicemembers  at the end of every phase, the percentage and characteristics of  servicemembers covered by the survey (i.e., who completed a phase and  were ultimately interviewed) may be insufficient to establish that the  survey results are representative of servicemember satisfaction,  especially for later phases. (See table 6 for response and coverage  rates.) DOD officials recently told us that they will consider alternative  survey eligibility requirements, including working with the Office of  Management and Budget for permission to interview veterans. (For  additional information regarding the timing of the survey, see app. II).", "In addition, alternate survey measures show lower satisfaction rates  than those reported by DOD. Using DOD\u2019s measure, we found an  overall satisfaction rate of about 67 percent since the inception of  IDES. DOD defines a servicemember as satisfied if the average of his  or her responses across several surveys is above 3 on a 5-point  scale, with 3 denoting neither satisfied nor dissatisfied. However,  using our alternate measure that defines servicemembers as satisfied  only when all of their responses are 4 or above, we calculated the  satisfaction rate to be about 24 percent (see fig. 9).", "Our calculation is a more conservative measure of satisfaction, because it  rules out the possibility that a servicemember is deemed \u201csatisfied\u201d even  when he or she is dissatisfied on one or more questions in the scale.  While not incorrect, DOD\u2019s scale can mask pockets of servicemember  dissatisfaction. For example, an individual may indicate that he or she is  very dissatisfied with one phase of the program, but satisfied with other  phases, and the overall satisfaction score can be the same as one for a  servicemember who is generally satisfied across all phases of the  process. Measuring satisfaction, or even dissatisfaction, in different ways  may provide a more complete picture of satisfaction and how it varies in  different circumstances, and thus may reveal areas where DOD could  focus on improving management and performance.", "Finally, using either DOD\u2019s or our calculated measure, we found that  overall satisfaction did not vary much according to differences in the  experiences of servicemembers. For example, our model estimated that  satisfaction varied by no more than approximately five percentage points  across branch, component, disenrollment outcome, sex, MEB exam  provider, enlisted and officer personnel classes, and the number of  claimed and referred conditions. While lack of variation could be a  positive outcome signaling consistent treatment, it could equally mean  that the survey does not measure opinions in enough detail to  discriminate among servicemembers\u2019 experiences. Either way, such  results provide little insight into identifying areas for improvement or  effective practices. Further, while we found some association between  servicemembers satisfaction and the timeliness of their case processing,  we also found many servicemembers were highly dissatisfied even when  their cases were completed on time, and many were highly satisfied even  when their cases were not. For example, 68 percent of those who said  that PEB timeliness was \u201cvery poor\u201d completed the phase on time, and 55  percent of those who said that MEB timeliness was \u201cvery good\u201d did not  complete on time. The lack of variation and/or correlation between  satisfaction and experiences of servicemembers\u2014coupled with low  coverage rates\u2014raise questions about the value of the survey results as  a performance measure and program evaluation tool. (See app. II for  more information on servicemember satisfaction results.)", "DOD is reconsidering its options for measuring customer satisfaction, but  has yet to select a particular approach. As noted above, possible changes  might include widening the criteria for who is eligible for the survey,  modifying survey questions, changing when and how the survey is  delivered, and changing how satisfaction is calculated. Officials already  concluded that the survey, in its current form, is not a useful management  tool for determining what changes are needed in IDES and said that it is  expensive to administer\u2014costing approximately $4.3 million in total since  the start of the IDES pilot. Navy officials told us they believed that the  satisfaction surveys could be made more useful if they knew whether  servicemember\u2019s satisfaction was actually influenced by the  servicemember\u2019s desired or actual outcome of the IDES process. Further,  Army officials already determined that the DOD survey is of limited value,  and are proceeding with plans to field their own survey in the hopes of  obtaining more detailed information at the facility level. Because of fiscal  constraints, DOD suspended the survey in December 2011, but officials  told us that they hope to resume collecting data in fiscal year 2013.", "We identified two potential alternatives to assessing servicemember  experiences.", "Surveying a sample of servicemembers: While a census gives each  servicemember a chance to describe his or her experiences with  IDES, DOD could collect the same data at a lower cost by surveying a  probability sample of servicemembers. If appropriately designed and  executed, a sample would accurately represent all groups of  servicemembers and produce the necessary data for important  subgroups, such as facilities or branches. Since the cost of  administering a survey is strongly related to the number of people  surveyed, probability sampling could also allow DOD to assess  servicemember experiences while substantially reducing data  collection costs.", "Exit interviews: In-depth interviews with servicemembers, completed  at disenrollment from IDES, could also yield more detailed and  actionable information about the program. Although the current survey  includes open-ended questions, it is primarily designed to collect  standardized, quantitative measures of satisfaction with broad aspects  of IDES, such as fairness and the performance of DOD board liaisons  and VA case managers. As a result, the survey provides a limited  amount of detailed feedback on particular facilities, staff members,  and stages of the process that managers might use to improve the  servicemember experience, decrease processing times, or reduce  cost. In contrast, semi-structured exit interviews would allow  servicemembers to provide this type of qualitative, detailed feedback.  Interviewing servicemembers at the end of the process would also  allow servicemembers to assess their overall experiences with IDES  rather than at an earlier stage, without having completed the entire  process. Exit interviews could also reach servicemembers who exit  IDES without completing the process such as those who are returned  to duty. Exit interviews, however, have the potential to be labor  intensive and expensive."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recent Actions and Ongoing Initiatives May Improve IDES Performance, but It Is Too Early to Assess Their Overall Impact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "DOD and VA Took Steps to Address Previously Identified IDES Challenges", "paragraphs": ["DOD and VA have undertaken a number of actions to address IDES  challenges\u2014many of which we identified in our past work.

With respect to the Army, meetings are led by the Army\u2019s  vice-chief of staff and VA\u2019s chief of staff, and include reviews of  performance where regional and local facility commanders provide  feedback on best practices and challenges. For example, recent  Army-VA conferences focused on delays in completion of preliminary  ratings for Army PEBs by VA\u2019s Seattle rating site, efforts by the Army  to increase MEB staffing, development of Army-wide IDES  standardization guidance, and Army-VA electronic records  interchange. Periodic meetings are also held between senior Navy  medical and VA officials to discuss performance issues at Navy  military treatment facilities.", "VA holds its own biweekly conferences with local staff responsible for  VA\u2019s portion of the process. These conferences are supplemented by a  bi-weekly IDES \u201cdashboard\u201d that tracks performance data for portions of  the IDES for which VA is responsible. According to VA officials, in  addition to identifying best practices, these conferences focus on sites  with performance problems and identify potential corrective actions. For  example, officials said a recent conference addressed delays at Fort  Benning, Georgia, and discussed how they could be reduced.

In addition, senior VA  health care officials hold periodic conferences with officials responsible  for exams at IDES sites, to monitor performance.", "Ensuring sufficient medical exam resources: In our December 2010  report, we noted that VA struggled to provide enough medical examiners  (both VA employees and contractors) to meet demand and deliver exam  summaries within its 45-day goal. For example, significant deficiencies in  examiner staffing (particularly for mental health exams) at Fort Carson  contributed to exams for active duty members taking an average of 140  days. To improve exam timeliness, VA hired more examiners and is  devoting more resources at those sites where VA clinicians perform IDES  exams. In addition, in July 2011, VA awarded a revised compensation  and pension (including IDES) contract that provides more flexibility for VA  to have contractors perform IDES exams at sites needing additional  resources. As a result, VA can use contractors to conduct exams for  regional offices beyond the 10 offices for which the contractor normally  provides services. Also, VA contracted with 5 companies to provide short- term exam assistance at IDES sites needing it. Further, VA procedures  allow reserve component servicemembers in remote locations to receive  exams close to their homes. VA exam timeliness has improved and the  agency met its 45-day goal for active component members in every  month from August 2011 through June 2012. VA officials attributed  improved exam timeliness, in part, to additional exam resources provided  to IDES sites. (See app. III for additional information on fiscal year 2012  timeliness.)", "Ensuring sufficient exam summaries: In our December 2010 report, we  noted that some cases were delayed because VA medical exam  summaries were not complete and clear enough for use in making rating  and fitness decisions and needed to be sent back to examiners for  additional work. VA officials told us that they have been reinforcing the  importance of training and communication between rating staff and  medical examiners as ways to improve exam summary sufficiency. For  example, VA identified types of information which, if missing from an  exam summary, would cause it to be insufficient, and has been training  examiners to include such information. Additionally, VA noted that VTA  now has the ability to track cases with insufficient exams by allowing staff  to annotate information on exam summaries. However, staff are not  required to provide this information and rules and procedures for its use  have not been established.", "Ensuring sufficient MEB staffing: In our December 2010 report, we noted  that some sites had insufficient MEB physicians, leading to delays in  completing the MEB phase. At that time, most of the 27 pilot sites were  not meeting the 35-day goal, with average times for active component  cases as high as 109 days. Meanwhile, DOD did not have sufficient board  liaison staff to handle IDES caseloads. The Army is in the midst of a  major hiring initiative intended to more than double staffing for its MEBs  over its October 2011 level, which will include additional board liaison and  MEB physician positions. The Army reported having 610 full-time  equivalent MEB staff positions in October 2011, and planned to hire up to  1,410; this would include 172 MEB physician and 513 board liaison  positions. The Army also planned to hire an average of one contact  representative per board liaison; these staff members assist the board  liaisons with clerical functions, freeing more of the liaisons\u2019 time for  counseling servicemembers. As of June 2012, the Army had filled 1,219  (86 percent) of the planned 1,410 positions.", "Ensuring sufficient VA rating staff: In our December 2010 report, we  noted that VA had insufficient staff at one of its rating sites to handle the  demand for preliminary ratings, rating reconsiderations, and final VA  benefit decisions. VA officials said that the agency has more than tripled  the staffing at its IDES rating sites\u2013from 78 to 262 positions. Further, VA  has moved staff resources to IDES rating sites from other VA regional  offices to provide short-term help in working down rating backlogs.  Recent monthly data show an increase in the number of preliminary VA  ratings completed, and a slight improvement in processing times.  However, as noted before, it is too early to tell the extent to which such  trends will continue.

For example, a reserve unit may not have complete medical  records for a member who received care from a private provider. When  the servicemember enters the IDES, a board liaison is responsible for  obtaining the private provider records before handing off the case to VA  for exams. To address issues with reserve component servicemembers\u2019  records, the Army established an interim office in Pinellas Park, Florida in  January 2011. For reserve component servicemembers who may require  IDES referral, this office is tasked with obtaining records from the  member\u2019s reserve unit; reviewing them to identify missing information;  and, if necessary, requiring the reserve unit to obtain additional records to  complete the case file. Staff at this office also determine whether the  member needs IDES referral. Army officials indicated that this office is  expected to help reduce the backlog of Army reserve component cases in  the IDES. However, Army officials noted that they are providing training to  reserve units to improve their ability to maintain complete records on their  servicemembers and eventually, the Army may discontinue this office if  no longer needed.", "Improving MEB documentation and decisions: In response to delays in  completing the MEB stage, the Navy and Army have initiatives underway  to help ensure the timely completion of narrative summaries and MEB  decisions. For example, the Navy piloted electronic narrative summary  preparation at Naval Hospital Camp Lejeune, North Carolina. In May  2012, after determining that the piloted process led to improved MEB  completion timeliness, the Navy deployed electronic narrative summary  preparation Navy-wide. In March 2011, the Army also deployed an  abbreviated MEB narrative summary format, intended to provide better  information for MEB and PEB decision making while helping reduce  delays in the completion of these summaries by MEB clinicians.  Incorporating feedback from its MEBs and PEBs, the Army expects the  revised IDES template to reduce redundant information, make summaries  simpler and easier to use, and standardize summary preparation across  their sites.", "Resolving diagnostic differences: In our December 2010 report, we  identified differences in diagnoses between DOD physicians and VA  examiners, especially regarding mental health conditions, as a potential  source of delay in IDES. We also noted inconsistencies among services  in providing guidance and a lack of a tracking mechanism for determining  the extent of diagnostic differences. In response to our recommendation,  DOD commissioned a study on the subject. The resulting report  confirmed the lack of data on the extent and nature of such differences,  and noted that the Army has established guidance more comprehensive  than the guidance DOD was developing. It also recommended that DOD  or the other services develop similar guidance. A DOD official told us that  consistent guidance across the services, similar to the Army\u2019s, was  included in DOD\u2019s December 2011 IDES manual. Also, in response to our  recommendation, VA took steps to modify the VTA database used to  track IDES to collect information on diagnostic differences. The VTA  upgrade was completed in June 2012 after several delays. The report  also recommended that DOD and VA establish a committee to improve  the accuracy of posttraumatic stress disorder ratings. DOD noted that  training on diagnostic differences has been incorporated into its  continuing medical education curriculum for military clinicians, but DOD  considers the issue of posttraumatic stress disorder ratings largely  resolved.

Officials told us that the VTA\u2014which is the primary means of  tracking the completion of IDES cases\u2014has limited reporting capabilities  and staff at local facilities are unable to use it for monitoring the cases for  which they are responsible. DOD and VA developed VTA improvements  that will allow DOD board liaisons and VA case managers\u2014 and their  supervisors\u2014to track the status of their cases. VA included these  operational reporting improvements in its June 2012 VTA upgrade. In the  meantime, staff at many IDES sites have been using their own local  systems to track cases and alleviate limitations in VTA. Further, the  military services have been moving ahead with their own solutions. For  instance, the Army has deployed its own information system for MEBs  and PEBs Army-wide. In addition, DOD has also been piloting its own  tracking system at 9 IDES sites. As a result, staff at IDES sites we  visited reported having to enter the same data into multiple systems. For  example, board liaisons at Army MEBs Fort Meade and Joint Base Lewis- McChord reported entering data into VTA and the Army\u2019s new system,  while board liaisons at Andrews Air Force Base reported entering data  into VTA and DOD\u2019s pilot data system.", "Improving IDES data quality: DOD is taking steps to improve the quality of  data in VTA. Our analysis of VTA data identified erroneous or missing  dates in at least 4 percent of the cases reviewed. Officials told us that  VTA lacks adequate controls to prevent erroneous data entry, and that  incorrect dates may be entered, or dates may not be entered at all, which  can result in inaccurate timeliness data. For example, Army officials noted  that some cases shown in VTA as very old were actually closed, but were  missing key dates. In September 2011, DOD began a focused effort with  the services to correct erroneous and missing case data in VTA. Officials  noted that the Air Force and Navy completed substantial efforts to correct  the issues identified at that time, but Army efforts continue. DOD and  Army officials noted that additional staff resources are being devoted to  cleaning up Army VTA data. While improved local tracking and reporting  capabilities will help facilities identify and correct erroneous data, keeping  VTA data accurate will be an ongoing challenge due to a lack of data  entry controls.

Requirements for an electronic case file transfer solution  have been completed and DOD and VA officials expect to begin piloting it  in August 2012. As a short-term solution, the Army and VA began using  an Army file transfer Web site to move IDES records between the Army\u2019s  PEBs and the Seattle VA rating site in March 2012.

Figure 19 also shows decreases in  percentages of cases meeting timeliness goals at the MEB and PEB  phases when cases are grouped by fiscal year of starting a given phase.  The fluctuations in the timeliness of the Transition and Benefits phases  were more prevalent when cases were grouped in this manner.", "Low response and coverage rates for servicemember satisfaction surveys  administered after each phase of IDES raise concerns about how well the  satisfaction survey results represented the larger population of  servicemembers who completed one or more phases.", "DOD surveys servicemembers after they complete the MEB, PEB, and  Transition phases of IDES. The department attempts to survey all  servicemembers who complete each phase, but only if they completed  the prior surveys. For example, the MEB survey must be completed  before a servicemember is eligible to complete the PEB survey.", "Using the data available to us, and as table 8 below shows, we found that  9,604 of the 25,212 servicemembers who completed the MEB phase  were surveyed, for a 38 percent response and coverage rate.18,296 servicemembers who completed the PEB phase, only 8,968 of  them completed the prior MEB survey and were eligible for the PEB  survey and of these only 4,795 were surveyed. Using DOD\u2019s eligibility  criteria, the response rate for the PEB survey was roughly 54 percent  (4,795 of 8,968). However, the coverage rate for all servicemembers who  completed the PEB phase (regardless of whether they completed the  prior survey) was only 26 percent (4,795 of 18,296). Similarly, the  response rate for the Transition survey was 72 percent while the  coverage rate was only 23 percent (See table 8).", "As table 9 below shows, there were some sizable differences between  respondents and nonrespondents, especially for the PEB and Transition  surveys. For example, respondents to the transition survey spent more  time than nonrespondents in the Transition phase, were less likely to be  separated with benefits, and were more likely to be placed on the  Permanent Disability Retired List. These differences, combined with low  response and coverage rates, raise the possibility of biased responses.", "The particular measure used to assess servicemember satisfaction can  affect the proportion reported as \u201csatisfied\u201d with the IDES program.  Depending on the measure used, satisfaction is about 2.8 times lower  than what DOD has reported, and many servicemembers classified as  \u201csatisfied\u201d express moderate dissatisfaction with some aspects of the  process.", "DOD has reported average servicemember satisfaction with IDES overall  and with three phases of the process, i.e., MEB, PEB, and Transition  phases. In so doing, DOD has developed indices of satisfaction on  several broad dimensions, such as satisfaction with the overall  experience and fairness, which combine responses to selected survey  questions. Although the number of questions used in each index vary  depending on the number of phases completed, each index classifies  servicemembers as \u201csatisfied\u201d or \u201cdissatisfied\u201d using the average of their  responses across all questions in the index. Each question\u2019s scale ranges  from 1 to 5, with 1 denoting \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d (or a similar negative  response), 5 denoting \u201cvery satisfied,\u201d and 3 denoting \u201cneither satisfied  nor dissatisfied.\u201d DOD reports that a servicemember is \u201csatisfied\u201d if his or  her average response across all items in the scale exceeds 3. Table 10  summarizes the responses to each question that DOD uses in its overall  satisfaction index at each phase (as of August 2011).", "DOD\u2019s indices are one reasonable method of summarizing  servicemember opinions. In quarterly performance reports, DOD notes  that it has used factor analysis, a form of latent variable statistical models  to assess the reliability of its scales. While we did not review DOD\u2019s  models, we independently found that DOD\u2019s overall index of satisfaction  with IDES was highly reliable. (Specifically, using Cronbach\u2019s alpha, the  index was highly correlated with a single latent dimension at \u03b1 = 0.92.)  This supports DOD\u2019s choice to measure the single concept of  \u201csatisfaction\u201d by averaging the ordinal servicemember responses.", "Nevertheless, the average survey response can obscure variation in the  responses that make up the index. For example, suppose that a  servicemember said she was \u201cvery satisfied\u201d (response of 5) on two of the  four questions in the index, \u201cdissatisfied\u201d on one (response of 2) and \u201cvery  dissatisfied\u201d on the last one (response of 1). With an average response  over 3, the DOD measure would classify her as \u201csatisfied,\u201d despite the  fact that she was \u201csomewhat dissatisfied\u201d or \u201cvery dissatisfied\u201d with two of  the four aspects of IDES that DOD considers important. The grouping rule  considers this servicemember equally happy with IDES as someone who  says they are \u201csatisfied\u201d with all four aspects in the index.", "To assess the extent to which DOD\u2019s index might mask dissatisfaction,  we calculated the proportion of questions in the scale on which  servicemembers whom DOD classified as \u201csatisfied\u201d gave neutral or  negative responses (1, 2, or 3). We found that half of these  servicemembers gave neutral or negative answers to at least 25 percent  of the items in the index, and a quarter gave such answers to at least 41  percent of the items. For these servicemembers, the DOD index may  suggest more satisfaction than the underlying survey questions would  support.", "We further assessed the sensitivity of DOD\u2019s index by comparing it  against a different (i.e., GAO\u2019s) measure of satisfaction: whether a  servicemember is \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery satisfied\u201d (or gives a similarly  positive response) on all items in DOD\u2019s scale of overall IDES  satisfaction. Our measure is more conservative than DOD\u2019s, because  ours only includes positive responses and uses a broader cutpoint (two  response categories) to distinguish between \u201csatisfied\u201d and \u201cnot satisfied\u201d  servicemembers. (In contrast, DOD calculates average satisfaction on an  ordinal scale of 1 to 5, and then uses a cutpoint at 3.) Our measure is not  inherently more valid, however, and has its own weaknesses. In  particular, we classify a servicemember as \u201cnot satisfied\u201d if she gives a  neutral or negative response to just one of the four items in DOD\u2019s scale.", "When we analyzed overall satisfaction using both measures, we found  that overall, servicemembers are 2.8 times less satisfied on our measure  than on DOD\u2019s (i.e., 23.8 versus 67 percent). Further, only about 20 to 30  percent of servicemembers are \u201csatisfied\u201d with each aspect of the IDES  process that DOD considers important across most of the subgroups we  analyzed, while DOD classifies about 60 to 70 percent of such  servicemembers as \u201csatisfied\u201d on average. In the next section, we present  further information on variation in satisfaction across servicemember  groups."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Explaining Servicemember Satisfaction Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Although the servicemember survey provides numerous measures of  satisfaction, it is also important to explain variation in satisfaction  outcomes\u2014i.e. why some servicemembers are more satisfied than  others. Explaining variation can connect dissatisfaction with poor program  performance and help identify specific reforms to improve the  experiences of servicemembers who typically have been less satisfied.  However, the available program data cannot precisely explain outcomes  when used in this type of explanatory analysis. Using the available data,  we could predict satisfaction only 1.9 percentage points better after  controlling for multiple factors than what we would have achieved by  chance (65.5 percent vs. 63.7 percent of satisfied responses predicted  correctly).", "In order to further explain variation in satisfaction, we matched the survey  responses to the data that DOD and VA maintain on the processing of  each servicemember\u2019s case, known as the VTA data. This database  primarily measures the time it took servicemembers to complete each  phase of the IDES process. A small number of other program and  demographic variables are also available, such as service branch,  component, and the number of conditions claimed and referred. Using the  matched survey and VTA data, we estimated the association between  satisfaction and observable factors that could potentially explain variation  in servicemembers\u2019 experiences.", "Table 11 below (columns 2-4) presents these associations for both DOD\u2019s  and GAO\u2019s overall measures of satisfaction. The \u201craw data\u201d estimates are  simply the proportion of servicemembers in a particular group who were  satisfied according to either measure. In the fourth column (\u201cmodel  estimates\u201d), we estimate this proportion holding constant all of the other  factors listed, using a statistical model. Specifically, the estimates are in- sample mean predicted probabilities of giving a satisfied response on the  GAO satisfaction index from a logistic model of satisfaction. The  covariates are given by indicators of whether the servicemember  belonged to each group in column 4. The maximum likelihood estimators  allowed the probability of satisfaction, given the covariates, to be  dependent across observations within the 26 cross-classified groups of  PEB location and MEB medical treatment facility. This adjusted for the  possibility that servicemembers were similarly satisfied if they were  processed in the same locations, given similar values on the observed  covariates.", "Regardless of which measure is used (DOD\u2019s or GAO\u2019s), satisfaction  varied only modestly across many important groups of servicemembers.  Our model estimates that the GAO measure of satisfaction varied by no  more than approximately five percentage points across branch,  component, disenrollment outcome, sex, MEB exam provider, enlisted  and officer personnel classes, and the number of claimed and referred  conditions, although differences across MEB treatment facilities and PEB  locations were larger. This can be seen as a positive outcome, if this  correlation implies that DOD and VA administer the program consistently  across servicemembers and locations. However, the lack of variation also  could suggest that the survey items do not measure opinions in enough  detail to discriminate among servicemembers\u2019 experiences.", "Also shown in table 11, satisfaction had a stronger association with case  processing time (time spent in IDES) than some of the other factors we  examined. Servicemembers whose case processing times were among  the quickest 25 percent were about 2.3 times as likely to be satisfied (on  the GAO scale) than those whose times were among the 25 percent of  cases with the longest overall timeframes (i.e., 41 versus 18 percent).  Nevertheless, only 41 percent of those servicemembers whose cases  were processed most quickly were satisfied (holding constant the other  factors). This suggests that servicemembers\u2019 opinions about IDES may  be only loosely related to the amount of time they spent in IDES, as  discussed in the next section below.", "Although the average case processing time has generally increased since  2008, when we look at satisfaction by fiscal year, servicemember  satisfaction shows evidence of improvement since fiscal year 2008.  Specifically, our measure of satisfaction from the model increased by 15  percentage points since 2008, roughly doubling from 13 to 28. Because  the model estimates control for various other factors, these results  suggest that servicemember views of the IDES process have improved  over time, rather than the possibility that IDES has simply processed  different types of cases.", "Satisfaction does not vary by a large amount across many MEB treatment  facilities, but there are exceptions. Our model estimates that about 18 to  26 percent of servicemembers were satisfied at most facilities. However,  there were pockets of greater satisfaction. Specifically, servicemembers  had more positive experiences at Forts Belvoir, Bragg, Campbell, Drum,  Hood, and Polk, with satisfaction estimated to have ranged from 28 to 45  percentage points. Fort Meade had the lowest satisfaction at 15 percent.  These estimates hold constant time spent in IDES and other factors in  column 4 and, thus, partially account for the types of cases each facility  processes.", "DOD and VA measure IDES timeliness directly in VTA and as part of the  overall servicemember satisfaction scale. These overlapping measures  let us compare servicemembers\u2019 opinions to their actual experiences in  the program. To do this, we calculated processing times at each phase of  IDES for servicemembers who expressed varying degrees of satisfaction  with the timeliness of their case processing at that phase. In addition, we  analyzed whether servicemembers who were satisfied with the overall  IDES process were more or less likely to meet timeliness goals. Table 12  provides these statistics.", "As shown in table 12, satisfaction generally stayed the same or  decreased as processing times increased. The median days spent in the  MEB and PEB phases were 35 and 38 percent lower, respectively,  among those servicemembers who said that MEB and PEB timeliness  was \u201cvery good\u201d as compared to those who said it was \u201cvery poor.\u201d The  former group was 170 percent more likely to have met the MEB  timeliness goal and 30 percent more likely to have met the PEB  timeliness goal. Similarly, the case for a median servicemember\u2014whom  we classified as \u201csatisfied\u201d with the overall IDES process\u2014was completed  15 percent more quickly and was 49 percent more likely to have met the  timeliness goal than the median servicemember who was \u201cdissatisfied.\u201d  The model estimates in table 11 confirm that the GAO measure of  satisfaction and timeliness (time spent in IDES) are negatively related  even when holding constant several other variables.", "Perceived and actual timeliness had little association at the Transition  phase. Across all levels of satisfaction with timeliness, the median  processing time varied by no more than 4 days, and the proportion  meeting the timeliness goal varied by no more than 4 percentage points.  The use of personal leave is one plausible explanation for the  unresponsiveness of servicemember satisfaction to actual processing  times in the Transition phase. A servicemember might not have been  dissatisfied with delays if taking leave was the reason, rather than the  IDES process itself.", "Despite the associations between actual and perceived timeliness at the  MEB and PEB phases, there were many servicemembers who were  satisfied or dissatisfied with timeliness that spent similar amounts of time  in the program. For example, 68 percent of those who said that PEB  timeliness was \u201cvery poor\u201d completed the phase on time, and 55 percent  of those who said that MEB timeliness was \u201cvery good\u201d did not complete  on time. Among servicemembers who said that MEB timeliness was \u201cvery  good,\u201d the middle 80 percent of processing times ranged from 62 days to  223 days. The same range for servicemembers who said MEB timeliness  was \u201cvery poor\u201d was 88 to 323 days. As table 12 shows, a similar pattern  holds for the PEB phase. Although servicemembers tend to be more  satisfied in MEB and PEB when their cases take less time, many of them  are highly dissatisfied even when their cases take an unusually short  amount of time (and vice versa). In the Transition phase, however, 40  percent of servicemembers who said that timeliness was \u201cvery good\u201d  were processed in 91 to 657 days\u2014a more lengthy range than at the  other phases. The large range and relationship with satisfaction may  reflect the use of servicemember leave.", "The fact that many servicemembers are similarly satisfied with timeliness,  even though they can have widely different processing times, has broader  implications for measuring the performance of IDES. DOD\u2019s timeliness  goals may not be meaningful to servicemembers or necessarily reflect  high-quality service. Alternatively, servicemembers may not use  reasonable standards to assess the time required to process their cases,  or they may not accurately perceive the time they have spent in the  program. In these scenarios, the value of servicemember satisfaction as a  performance measure becomes less certain.", "The relationship between perceived and actual timeliness may simply  reflect a large amount of unobserved heterogeneity across  servicemembers. For example, a servicemember whose case has been in  IDES for an extremely long time might still be highly satisfied with  timeliness if the case was complex or personal leave was taken during  the process.

The survey includes many  highly correlated questions measuring satisfaction with the overall  process or broad components of it, such as DOD board liaisons,  VA case managers, or timeliness.

The data support detailed  reporting of performance measures, but they do not measure  similarly detailed information on the nature of each case that might  allow DOD and VA to understand the reasons for lengthy case  processing times or to identify cases that might become delayed  and ensure that they remain on schedule. For example, the  database does not measure the type or severity of referred  medical conditions in detail, the nature of delays experienced  early in the process, or the use of servicemember leave.
