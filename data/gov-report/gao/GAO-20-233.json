This report describes policies that can restrict Medicaid beneficiaries' access to MAT medications, including any related to the distribution methods.", "To do this work, GAO reviewed relevant laws, policies, and documents, as well as studies describing access barriers and the benefits and challenges of the distribution methods. GAO also interviewed federal officials; stakeholders representing state Medicaid directors, health care providers, patients, and pharmacies; and state officials and health care providers from Minnesota, North Carolina, and Ohio, as well as the District of Columbia.

The federal government has identified expanding access to MAT as important for reducing opioid use disorders and overdoses, and has taken action to increase access. However, GAO found that some state and federal policies can restrict Medicaid beneficiaries' access to MAT medications. Some of these policies, and three selected states' and the District of Columbia's efforts to address potential access barriers, include the following:", "MAT medication coverage. A 2018 study found that about 40 percent of states may not provide Medicaid coverage for some formats of MAT medications, such as injectable and implantable formats, as required by federal law; however, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which oversees Medicaid, has not determined the extent to which states are in compliance with the federal requirements to cover MAT medications.", "Prior authorization requirements. Some MAT medications and formats are subject to prior authorization, which requires these medications to be pre-approved before being covered by Medicaid. While these requirements are generally used to reduce expenditures, unnecessary utilization, and improper payments, stakeholders told GAO the requirements may cause life-threatening delays in the case of MAT medications. Some states, including three states and the District of Columbia that GAO reviewed, have taken steps to remove prior authorization requirements for MAT medications.", "Distribution methods. States may mandate the ways MAT medications can be distributed. For example, Minnesota's fee-for-service plan requires the use of the buy-and-bill distribution method for all injectable and implantable medications. This method requires providers, such as physicians, to purchase and store these medications until administered to the patient, allowing immediate access to the MAT medication for Medicaid beneficiaries. However, for expensive injectable medications, which can cost $1,200 per treatment, this method places providers at financial risk if the medication is not used or the reimbursement is less than the providers' costs, requiring resources some providers may lack, according to providers in the selected states and District of Columbia. As a result, some states have removed such restrictions to maximize beneficiary access.", "Federal waiver for prescribing buprenorphine. According to stakeholders GAO interviewed, some providers are unwilling to obtain the federal waiver necessary to prescribe or administer buprenorphine for opioid use disorder\u2014due to reasons such as the hours of training associated with the waiver\u2014which can restrict beneficiary access to this MAT medication. In addition, while nurse practitioners and physician assistants are eligible for these waivers, some state laws require them to be supervised by a physician. Stakeholders told GAO that some nurse practitioners may find it difficult to identify a qualified physician, which may affect patient access to MAT."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS determine the extent to which states are in compliance with federal requirements to cover MAT medications, and take action as appropriate.

According to the  latest, preliminary data from the Centers for Disease Control and  Prevention, in 2018, almost 70,000 Americans died of a drug overdose,  with an estimated 69 percent of those deaths involving an opioid. For  those with OUD, research shows that medication-assisted treatment  (MAT), which combines behavioral therapy and the use of certain  medications, can be effective at reducing opioid use and increasing  treatment retention, in comparison to other treatments. However, we have  previously reported on barriers\u2014such as federal laws, provider  availability, perception, and cost\u2014that can restrict patient access to the  medications used in MAT.", "The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has identified  expanding access to MAT as an important strategy for reducing opioid  use disorders and opioid overdoses.

According to an analysis of SAMHSA\u2019s National  Survey on Drug Use and Health by the Kaiser Family Foundation,  Medicaid provided health care coverage in 2017 to 38 percent of  nonelderly adults with OUD. States\u2019 Medicaid programs have flexibility in  how they design their programs and can therefore vary in how MAT  medications are covered and distributed, such as through retail  pharmacies. However, little information exists on how different distribution  methods may affect beneficiaries\u2019 access to the medications.", "The Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery  and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act (SUPPORT Act)  included a provision for GAO to study the effect of states\u2019 Medicaid  programs and policies related to the distribution methods of MAT  medications in terms of beneficiary access, cost, and provider willingness  to provide these medications. In this report, we describe policies that  may restrict such access to MAT medications for Medicaid beneficiaries,  including any related to the distribution methods.", "For our report, we focused our work on three of the medications used for  MAT: buprenorphine, buprenorphine-naloxone, and naltrexone.

These  medications come in a variety of formats, including oral, implantable, and  injectable.", "Buprenorphine. Buprenorphine is a partial opioid agonist, meaning it  binds to opioid receptors and activates them. It reduces or eliminates  opioid withdrawal symptoms, including drug cravings, and blunts the  euphoria or dangerous side effects of other opioids, such as heroin. It can  be used for detoxification treatment and maintenance therapy.  Buprenorphine is available as a MAT medication in two oral formats\u2014(1)  tablets for sublingual (under the tongue) administration, and (2) film for  sublingual or buccal (inside the cheek) administration; as a subdermal  (under the skin) implant; and in an injectable format. Oral formats are  often used for beneficiaries that are in the beginning stages of treatment.  The implantable format is generally used for beneficiaries who are  already stable on a low or moderate dosage of oral buprenorphine. The  oral formats are taken daily, while the injectable format is administered  monthly, and the implantable format is administered every 6 months. The  medication carries a risk of abuse, particularly in oral formats where it can  be used inappropriately or illegally re-sold. The injectable and implantable  formats of buprenorphine are intended to minimize this risk and to  increase beneficiary compliance, because the medication is administered  by a provider.", "Buprenorphine-naloxone. Naloxone is a medication added to some oral  formats of buprenorphine to reduce the chances of misuse or abuse.  Buprenorphine-naloxone is available in an oral format as either a film or a  tablet. It discourages people from inappropriately injecting a crushed and  dissolved tablet of buprenorphine by inducing symptoms of opioid  withdrawal when injected by individuals physically dependent on opioids.", "Naltrexone. Naltrexone is an opioid antagonist, meaning it binds to opioid  receptors, but does not activate them, thereby blocking the euphoria the  user would normally feel from opioids. It also may result in withdrawal  symptoms if recent opioid use has occurred. Therefore, it is used for  relapse prevention following complete detoxification from opioids. It can  be taken daily in an oral format or as a once-monthly injection; though  due to low patient compliance, SAMHSA does not recommend using oral  naltrexone for OUD treatment. Naltrexone carries no known risk of abuse.  For the injectable format of naltrexone, beneficiaries have to be free from  opioids for at least a week before they can begin the medication."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Prior Authorization and Preferred Drug Lists", "paragraphs": ["Subject to certain requirements, state Medicaid agencies may use  different strategies, such as prior authorization and preferred drug lists  (PDL), to manage the cost of prescription medications and ensure that  patients are taking medications that are clinically appropriate. Prior  authorization requires that certain conditions are met before services can  be provided to patients, in part, to control utilization and prevent improper  payments. PDLs reflect state Medicaid agencies\u2019 determinations on  whether medications, including those used for MAT, will be covered and  whether these medications will be categorized as preferred or non- preferred. A PDL indicates the first-choice or preferred medication for a  beneficiary\u2019s particular medical condition. PDLs are utilized by state  Medicaid agencies to incentivize providers to prescribe certain types of  medications. In addition, the preferred or non-preferred categorization of  medication can vary between fee-for-service and managed care plans  within a state.

The pharmacist is reimbursed for the cost of the  medication by a payer, such as Medicaid or private insurance, and by  any co-payment from the beneficiary.  2.  External delivery from a specialty pharmacy. After receiving a  prescription from a physician or other health care provider, a specialty  pharmacy delivers the medication directly to the provider so the  medication can be administered (injected or implanted by the  provider) to the beneficiary for whom it was prescribed. The specialty  pharmacy ensures that any specific requirements for a medication are  maintained; for example, injectable naltrexone requires the use of  refrigerated warehouses, insulated shipping containers, and  temperature monitoring equipment. The specialty pharmacy is  reimbursed by Medicaid or another payer.  3.  Buy-and-bill.

This beneficiary was initially  prescribed oral buprenorphine, but the  medication was repeatedly stolen by the  patient\u2019s partner. The provider and  beneficiary agreed that injectable  buprenorphine would allow treatment to  continue without the risk of theft. Initially, the  provider was not able to find a specialty  pharmacy with an electronic prescription  system compatible with the provider\u2019s  system, which was necessary to receive the  prescriptions. The provider told us that after a  compatible specialty pharmacy was identified  and the order was completed, the delivery  was further delayed, because two staff  members\u2014as required\u2014were not available  to sign for the delivery when it arrived. Three  months after the decision was made to switch  medications, the delivery was completed and  the provider administered the medication.", "Furthermore, state Medicaid policies that require or prevent the use of  certain distribution methods for MAT medications can restrict providers  from using methods that may be best suited for their patients or practice,  which may in turn affect beneficiaries\u2019 access to the medications,  according to stakeholders. Medicaid officials and providers we  interviewed told us that some states require the use of certain distribution  methods when a provider prescribes a MAT medication. For example,  Minnesota\u2019s fee-for-service plan (which covers about 25 percent of the  state\u2019s Medicaid population) requires that health care providers use buy- and-bill for all physician administered medications, including those that  are injected or implanted. Minnesota providers we interviewed told us  that they are reluctant to prescribe either the injectable or implantable  versions of MAT medications, due to payment delays or other problems  they experienced when they attempted to use buy-and-bill.", "Stakeholders told us that access to MAT medications would be  maximized if providers and beneficiaries are not restricted when choosing  among the three distribution methods\u2014and some states have removed  such restrictions. Officials from one manufacturer told us that since 2016,  nine states that required use of buy-and-bill for their medication have  eliminated those requirements. Medicaid officials in North Carolina told us  that because smaller medical practices do not want the inventory costs  associated with buy-and-bill, the state has moved to allow providers to  obtain the injectable buprenorphine through either buy-and-bill or a  specialty pharmacy. According to the officials, this has resulted in the  increased use of the medication. Similarly, Medicaid officials in the District  of Columbia told us that prior to 2017, injectable MAT medications were only available through buy-and-bill\u2014despite Medicaid reimbursements  being lower than providers\u2019 costs. In 2017, these medications became  available from specialty pharmacies."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "CMS Has Undertaken Opioid Coordination Efforts", "paragraphs": ["CMS has undertaken various coordination efforts aimed generally at  addressing OUD.

A 2019 National Academy of  Sciences report also notes that treatment with buprenorphine is less  risky than many other OUD treatments that do not require special  training.

Providers with a 100-patient waiver limit treated an average  of 57 patients, although more than one-quarter were at or  approaching their patient limit.", "A survey of physicians, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants  who obtained a waiver or increased their patient waiver limit in 2017  found that these providers were treating about one-third of their  patient limit.", "Literature we reviewed noted that providers might not treat the maximum  number of patients allowed by their waiver limit, because they are not  specialists in addiction medicine, or they do not want to treat a larger  number of patients with OUD. These providers may have obtained a  waiver to respond to the needs of their existing patients who have OUD,  rather than to add new patients. In contrast, one of these studies and  officials from one organization representing health care providers in  addiction medicine we interviewed noted that there are providers who are  addiction medicine specialists that cannot work a full-time schedule if they  are only allowed to treat 275 patients, which is the maximum allowed  under the waiver rules.

For example, officials from an  organization representing providers reported that physician assistants in  some states, such as Kentucky and Tennessee, cannot prescribe  buprenorphine for the treatment of OUD. Further, according to officials from another organization representing providers, most states require  nurse practitioners to be supervised by or have a collaborative agreement  with a physician. Thus, to prescribe buprenorphine for MAT, the nurse  practitioners in these states must obtain a DATA 2000 waiver and have  supervision from or a collaborative agreement with a physician.
