To determine the medical  conditions that drugs subject to REMS are intended to treat, we identified  the therapeutic classes of these drugs using RED BOOK data from March  2018, and characterized the therapeutic classes by medical conditions.  We also estimated Medicare Part D and Medicaid drug spending for a  select number of reference standard drugs for which cost data were  available. We also compared spending for a select number of reference  standard drugs to spending for a corresponding generic drug. To do this,  we used publicly available data from the Medicare Part D Drug Spending  Dashboard and the Medicaid Drug Spending Dashboard, maintained by  the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). These data  covered drug spending and utilization for both of these programs for  calendar year 2017, the most current data available at the time of our  review.

We  interviewed officials from two stakeholders representing drug companies.  We also interviewed officials from nine drug companies who have  experience with drugs subject to REMS about these agencies\u2019 efforts.  We used the following three criteria to identify a range of generic drug  companies with whom to speak: (1) whether they made six or more  inquiries to FDA regarding their inability to access samples of reference  standard drugs; (2) whether they had experience negotiating a required  shared system (a system implemented jointly by two or more drug  companies to coordinate certain REMS activities, which is required for  some generic drugs); and (3) the different medical conditions their drugs  were intended to treat in order to obtain a range of drugs. After applying  our criteria, we selected four generic drug companies. To obtain the  reference drug companies\u2019 perspectives, we selected five drug  companies whose reference standard drugs were the subject of sample  access inquiries from the four generic companies that we selected. We  asked these drug companies about their opinions on FDA and FTC\u2019s  efforts to address these specific practices. To supplement our interviews  with stakeholders and drug companies, we reviewed 16 comments to the  Federal Register related to FDA\u2019s efforts. We selected these 16  comments out of a total of 42 comments because they were submitted by  stakeholders representing professional associations, patient advocacy  groups, and drug companies.

According to FDA, for  most drugs, routine, risk-minimization measures, such as FDA-approved  professional labeling, are sufficient to protect the public from the drug\u2019s  risks. However, in some cases, FDA may require a drug company to  take additional actions to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its  risks and to help mitigate or prevent serious risks of adverse side effects.  Specifically, FDA may require the drug company to establish a REMS that  includes one or more risk-mitigation strategies beyond the drug\u2019s  professional labeling.", "According to FDA, most REMS are designed to reinforce patients\u2019 and  health care providers\u2019 behaviors and actions that support the safe use of  the particular drug they cover. For example, FDA may require drug  companies to give patients and health care providers additional  information to reinforce certain safe use conditions or specific risks  described in the approved labeling of a certain drug. FDA may require a  REMS either before a drug is approved or after approval if FDA becomes  aware of new safety information. When determining whether a REMS is  necessary, FDA considers several factors, including, for example, the  estimated size of the population likely to use the drug and the  seriousness of the disease or condition being treated.", "FDA may require a REMS to include one or more components. For  example, FDA may require drug companies to provide patients with  certain information in the form of medication guides. Generally,  medication guides include information on serious side effects, including  those that might require emergency medical care or involve life- threatening conditions. Similarly, FDA may require drug companies to  develop communication plans for how the drug company will disseminate  information to health care providers. Communication plans can include,  for example, information on any serious risks of the drug and any safety  protocols to ensure its safe use. Thus, for one REMS, FDA could require  a drug company to provide a medication guide. For a second REMS, FDA  could require a drug company to provide both a medication guide and a  communication plan. Table 1 below includes a list of selected REMS  components. Additionally, if a reference listed drug is subject to a  REMS, an approved generic drug is also subject to some of the same  REMS requirements.", "FDA can also require drug companies to implement another REMS  component, called \u201celements to assure safe use\u201d (ETASU), if a drug has  been shown to be effective, but is associated with a specific serious risk.  Depending on the risk, FDA may require any or all of the following  ETASU measures:", "Prescribers have specific training or special certifications;", "Pharmacies or health care settings where the drug is dispensed have", "Drugs are dispensed only in certain health care settings, such as  hospitals;", "Drugs are dispensed with evidence of safe-use by the patient, such as  requiring a patient\u2019s acknowledgement that she has been counseled  on a drug\u2019s risks and understands and accepts these risks;", "Patients are monitored, for example, while taking the drug for specific  adverse events or outcomes; or", "Patients are enrolled in a registry for collection of certain information,  such as patient outcomes and adverse reactions associated with the  drug.", "According to FDA, these measures are for drugs that can be marketed  only if there are requirements in place to mitigate a specific serious risk  listed in the drug\u2019s labeling. If FDA requires certain ETASU measures, it  may also require a drug company to develop an implementation system  to enable the drug company to monitor and evaluate implementation of  the ETASU measures by health care providers, pharmacists, and other  responsible parties.", "Also, if a reference listed drug is subject to a REMS with ETASU and a  generic version is being developed, the reference drug company and the  generic drug company are required to develop a shared system\u2014a  system that is used by participating companies to coordinate their REMS  activities and information about a drug\u2019s risks. Under a required shared  system, the generic drug company and the reference drug company use  the same REMS documentation and other materials on the drug\u2019s risks  and generally share in the implementation and maintenance of any  database and infrastructure (e.g., call center). According to FDA, shared  systems can be beneficial in reducing the burden for patients and health  care providers, such as prescribers and pharmacies, when accessing  REMS informational materials or completing administrative requirements,  including any required training or certifications for providers.", "Generic drug companies must submit REMS documentation and  materials as part of their generic drug application. Generally, before FDA  can approve generic drugs that are subject to REMS with ETASU,  reference drug companies and generic companies must reach agreement  on a required shared system. According to FDA, generic drug companies  that are developing a required shared system should submit their  proposed REMS materials to FDA by the midpoint of the application  review process or another time as specified by the agency. Any delays  in the development of a required shared system can affect FDA\u2019s ability to  approve a generic drug application. A generic company may request a  waiver from FDA, which if granted, would allow the generic company to  develop a separate system that includes the same ETASU measures  required for the reference listed drug.

This practice can apply both to reference standard drugs subject to  REMS, specifically those subject to certain ETASU measures, and those  not subject to REMS. For example, some drug companies might limit  access to samples of reference standard drugs subject to REMS, citing  ETASU measures that limit distribution, such as the measure that limits  distribution of drugs subject to REMS to only certain health care  settings. Additionally, drug companies may limit access to samples of  reference standard drugs that are not subject to REMS. Typically, generic  companies obtain samples through normal distribution channels such as  wholesale distributors. However, drug companies could, for example, limit  the sale of their reference standard drugs to certain pharmacies, such as  specialty pharmacies. FDA and FTC have testified before Congress that  these distribution limits\u2014for reference standard drugs with and without  ETASU-related distribution measures\u2014can hinder generic companies\u2019  ability to develop generic drugs and to submit a generic drug application  to FDA for review.", "The second practice involves circumstances when a reference drug  company delays its negotiations with generic drug companies on a  required shared system. The negotiations to develop a required shared  system can be complex because all parties must agree on the  implementation of the REMS as well as issues related to cost-sharing,  confidentiality, and product liability concerns. As part of their generic drug  application, generic companies must include an adequate REMS program  in order to be approved.

In these three cases, the generic drug companies entered  into shared systems that are separate from the reference drug company  systems. For example, after developing generics of Lotronex, which is  subject to REMS with ETASU and intended to treat gastrointestinal  conditions, the generic companies were required to enter into a shared  system with the reference drug company. When these companies were  not successful in negotiating a required shared system, FDA determined  the burden of developing a required shared system with the reference  drug company outweighed the benefits of having one and waived the  requirement.

(See sidebar for drug  companies\u2019 perspectives on this practice.) In 2014, FDA issued draft  guidance describing how a generic drug company could ask the  agency to send what is known as a safety determination letter to the  reference drug company on the generic drug company\u2019s behalf. The  draft guidance explains how FDA could send a letter stating that the  agency had reviewed the generic company\u2019s plans for its  bioequivalence testing and determined that these plans included  safety measures that were comparable to those in the ETASU  measures for the reference standard drug. For example, if the  reference standard drug\u2019s ETASU required protections to prevent fetal  exposure to the drug, the generic company\u2019s plans should include the  same protections. The safety letter would also note that FDA would  not consider it a REMS violation to provide reference standard drug  samples to the generic company requesting the safety determination  letter. According to FDA, some reference drug companies were  concerned that providing samples to the generic drug company would  violate REMS requirements.", "From 2016 to 2018, FDA issued 12 safety determination letters to  reference drug companies on behalf of generic companies, according  to agency data. However, FDA did not issue a safety determination  letter for all of the requests it received. According to FDA officials,  there are various reasons why they might not issue a safety  determination letter to the reference drug company. For example, a  generic company must sign a disclosure form in order for FDA to send  the letter to the reference drug company, but the generic company  does not always choose to do this. Additionally, the generic  company might have withdrawn its request for a safety determination  letter, or FDA might be waiting for additional information from the  generic company in order to complete its review. According to FDA  officials, there is no need for a safety determination letter (which  assures the reference drug company that providing samples to the  generic drug company will not be considered a violation of their  REMS) when there is no REMS for the product in the first place.", "Drug Companies\u2019 Perspectives on Limited  Access to Samples of Reference Standard  Drugs Not Subject to Risk Evaluation and  Mitigation Strategies (REMS)  Officials from three of the four generic  companies in our review told us they had  experience with drug companies\u2019 imposed  distribution limits on reference standard drugs  not subject to REMS.

In order to take enforcement action, FTC needs to find  sufficient evidence of activity that violates the Federal Trade  Commission Act or the Sherman Act. For example, FTC would need  to find that a reference drug company\u2019s practice constituted  monopolization in violation of the Sherman Act. According to FTC  officials, they have not brought any antitrust cases to the courts, but  have filed two amicus briefs related to cases involving drugs subject  to REMS.

Officials  from one reference drug company said that  the level of complexity can increase based on  the number of companies and the different  people involved.", "FDA issued waivers that allowed generic drug companies to  develop a separate system from the REMS of the reference listed  drug and issued draft guidance on how to obtain such a waiver.  According to FDA, since 2007, the agency has received 13 requests  for a waiver from the shared system requirement, and at the time of  our data collection and analysis, FDA had approved three, the first in  2013. (See sidebar for drug companies\u2019 perspective on required  shared systems.) These waivers allowed the generic drug company to  develop a separate system that includes the same ETASU measures  required for the reference listed drug. According to officials, FDA was  unable to grant the remaining waivers for different reasons. For  example, the agency may still be reviewing the generic drug  application submitted by the company that requested a waiver.  Officials explained that the waiver request is part of the overall generic  drug application and the agency cannot approve a waiver without  approving the application as well. To further facilitate the process, in  2018, FDA issued draft guidance describing what factors the agency  considers when granting waivers. The statute authorizes FDA to  grant a waiver (1) if the burden of creating a required shared system  outweighs the benefit of having it, taking into account the impact on  the health care providers, patients, and drug companies involved or  (2) if an aspect of the ETASU is covered by an unexpired patent or  entitled to trade secret protection, and the generic company was  unsuccessful in obtaining a license for use. FDA\u2019s guidance  describes examples of the potential benefits of having a shared  system and the burdens of forming a shared system on health care  providers, patients and drug companies that FDA will consider. For  example, having a shared system could benefit drug companies by  making a REMS for multiple products more efficient.

Of the remaining two  generic companies, officials from one company were unaware of the  web page and officials from the second company noted that they were  uncertain why a generic company would be included in the list of  companies on FDA\u2019s web page.", "Officials from two of the five reference drug companies we  interviewed, and whose companies appeared on the web page, said  they were unaware of any inquiries made to their companies  requesting samples of reference standard drugs. Additionally, officials  from one company told us they did not know why they were on FDA\u2019s  published web page because the company had sold the reference  standard drug to another company and had informed FDA that this  had occurred.", "According to FDA, the web page reflects the owner of the reference  standard drug at the time the agency received an inquiry, regardless  of whether the drug was later sold. Additionally, some generic  companies might contact FDA directly without contacting the  reference drug company because they anticipate having difficulties  accessing samples of the reference standard drug. FDA notes on its  web page that the agency did not independently investigate or confirm  the access limitations described in the inquiries it received.", "FTC\u2019s filing of amicus briefs. Officials from two of the generic  companies in our review said FTC\u2019s filing of amicus briefs was  generally a positive step. Officials from two companies said the  amicus briefs helped negotiations with reference drug companies. A  third generic company said the amicus briefs helped raise awareness  about issues generic companies are having. Officials from a fourth  generic company said FTC\u2019s actions could impact the company\u2019s  efforts to develop generic versions of reference listed drugs in the  future. Officials from the five reference drug companies we  interviewed did not have any comments on FTC\u2019s specific amicus  briefs.", "Waivers for a required shared system. Officials from three of the  four generic companies we spoke with had experience with waivers.  Officials from one of these three companies said the waiver guidance  was helpful. However, officials from this generic company and a  second company said it took FDA almost a year to grant their waivers.  According to officials from a third company, they obtained their waiver  within a month, in part, because negotiations had been ongoing for  more than a year. According to FDA officials, the review of a waiver  request is part of the generic drug company\u2019s drug application. FDA  will not grant a waiver unless the generic drug company meets the  waiver requirements and its generic drug application is approved.", "Reference drug companies and other stakeholders expressed  concerns about these waivers. Officials from three of the five  reference drug companies we spoke with said the burden on health  care providers or patients should be considered when granting  waivers. Officials from one company specifically expressed concerns  that as FDA grants additional waivers, it could place an additional  burden on the health care system. For example, health care providers  could be required to use multiple systems to access REMS  information on the drug\u2019s risks or to complete administrative  requirements, such as required certification. The remaining reference  drug companies did not have comments on the topic.", "In comments we reviewed on FDA\u2019s draft guidance on these waivers,  stakeholders noted concerns similar to those raised by the reference   drug companies. For example, two groups representing pharmacists  and pharmacies said that if FDA grants additional waivers, it could  place a burden on the health care system. Historically, FDA has  attempted to limit the number of required shared systems created  under waivers. If a generic drug company is granted a waiver, it is  allowed to create a separate system that includes the same ETASU  measures required of the reference listed drug. However, to date,  FDA has only granted waivers to generic drug companies that agree  to share their systems with other drug companies that concurrently or  subsequently develop generic or brand versions of the same  reference listed drugs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to FDA and FTC for their review and  comment.

These data covered drug  spending and utilization for both of these programs for calendar year  2017, the most current data available. However, not all spending and  utilization data for reference standard drugs subject to REMS were  available. Since we analyzed data as of March 18, 2019, we were able to  identify 139 reference standard drugs subject to REMS with  corresponding cost data. To assess the reliability of these data, we  interviewed knowledgeable agency officials. We determined that the data  were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report.", "Medicare and Medicaid paid at least $11.8 billion in 2017 for reference  standard drugs subject to REMS, according to cost data available from  the CMS\u2019s drug pricing dashboard.

This  amount\u2014which includes Medicare Part D plan sponsors and beneficiaries  Part D payments such as copays, but not price concessions, such as  manufacturers\u2019 rebates\u2014accounted for at least 8 percent of all Medicare  drug spending in 2017. Similarly, Medicaid paid at least $3.3 billion for  reference standard drugs subject to REMS, or at least 15 percent of all  Medicaid drug spending in 2017.", "Of the 139 reference standard drugs in our analysis, the greatest share of  these programs\u2019 spending, across medical conditions, was on reference  standard drugs subject to REMS for cancer, based on our analysis of  available data. Specifically, Medicare and Medicaid spent at least $4.6  billion on 8 reference standard drugs that treat cancer. See table 3 below  for Medicare and Medicaid spending for reference standard drugs subject  to REMS by medical condition treated.", "Further, our analysis of available data showed that Medicare and  Medicaid spent the most on Revlimid, a drug used to treat cancer, totaling  $3.6 billion with Medicare accounting for $3.3 billion of this total. More  than 37,000 Medicare beneficiaries used this drug, at an average cost per  dosage unit of $626.94. (See table 4.)", "In contrast, Medicaid spent the most on Suboxone, a drug used to treat  opioid dependence, totaling $0.7 billion, based on available data. More  than 3 million Medicaid claims were filed for this drug in 2017, at an  average cost per dosage unit of $7.89. Vivitrol was the third most utilized  drug under Medicaid. (See table 5.)", "Based on our analysis of available data, the selected examples of  reference standard drugs subject to REMS had higher average cost per  dosage unit compared to the generic. For example, Medicare spent an  average cost per unit of $12.20 for Clozaril, a drug used to treat mental  health conditions, compared to $0.99 for clozapine, a generic version of  Clozaril.
