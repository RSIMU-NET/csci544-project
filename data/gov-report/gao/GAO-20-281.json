Since then, private-sector developers and property  management companies, hereafter referred to as private partners, have  assumed primary responsibility for military family housing in the United  States. They are currently responsible for the construction, renovation,  maintenance, and repair of about 99 percent of domestic military  housing\u2014more than 200,000 homes on and around military bases\u2014in  the continental United States, Alaska, and Hawaii. Over the last few  years, reports of the presence of lead-based paint and other hazards,  such as mold and pest and rodent infestation, have raised questions  about DOD\u2019s management and oversight of privatized military housing.", "We have previously reported on DOD\u2019s privatized housing program. In  2018, we reviewed the financial condition of DOD\u2019s privatized housing  projects and found that DOD should take steps to improve monitoring,  reporting, and risk assessment. We recommended that DOD revise  guidance to improve the consistency and comparability in terms of the  time periods of the information reported on the financial condition of its  privatized housing projects, fully assess the effects of reductions in basic  allowance for housing on the projects, clarify when project changes  require notice, and define tolerances for project risks. DOD concurred  with our recommendations and, as of 2019, was taking steps to address  them. Specifically, DOD revised its reporting guidance to the military  departments to ensure that financial data were consistent and  comparable. In addition, DOD planned to update guidance to include a  requirement to report on the risk of changes in the basic allowance for  housing and to provide notification of project changes. A list of related  products is included at the end of this report.", "The Conference report accompanying a bill for the Fiscal Year 2019  Department of Defense Appropriations Act included a provision for us to  review ongoing issues within privatized military housing. We assessed  the extent to which the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD) and the  military departments (1) conduct oversight of privatized military housing  for servicemembers and their families, (2) have communicated their roles  and responsibilities to servicemembers and their families, and (3) have  developed and implemented initiatives to improve privatized housing.", "For each of our objectives, we included all privatized housing projects in  each military department. We reviewed OSD and military department  policies and guidance related to the implementation of the MHPI program  and interviewed OSD and military department officials and  representatives from each of the 14 private partners that are currently  responsible for privatized housing projects. We visited a non- generalizable sample of 10 installations selected to represent each of the  military departments and six private partners\u2014including the five largest  who own the majority of privatized military housing\u2014as well as  geographic and climate diversity. We reviewed the ground leases and  other MHPI project documents for housing projects at each of these  locations, and at each installation we interviewed local military  department and housing office officials, as well as local private partner  representatives. In order to obtain resident perspectives on the condition  of privatized housing at the 10 installations we visited, we facilitated 15  focus groups with over 70 residents. In addition, we developed and  administered a publicly available online tool that provided a voluntary  opportunity for any resident of privatized military housing to submit  information on his or her experiences. We received and reviewed over  650 responses and eliminated those that did not meet our criteria.  Information obtained from our focus groups and online tool are not  generalizable to all privatized military housing residents.", "For objective one, we also collected information from the private partners  on the structure of the performance incentive fees that they can receive  under the terms of their ground leases. We reviewed the performance  incentive fee structures to determine the extent to which the indicators  underlying them would allow the military departments to assess the  private partners\u2019 performance as it relates to the condition of the  privatized housing units they maintain. To assess the extent to which  private partner work order data could be used to monitor and track the  condition of privatized homes, we identified and analyzed available  private partner data from each of the 79 MHPI family housing projects on  work orders from October 2016 through April 2019. We requested data  from the private partners in April and May 2019, selecting a time frame  that would include complete data for fiscal years 2017 and 2018 and the  most comprehensive data available at the time for fiscal year 2019. To  assess the reliability of the data, we contacted representatives from each  of the 14 private partners to discuss each company\u2019s data system and  potential limitations for using the data. We then performed manual testing  on initial data files received from each partner to identify issues that would  impact the validity and reliability of using these data for ongoing  monitoring and tracking of the condition of privatized housing units. For  example, we identified instances of duplicate records. While we found  these types of data anomalies, as discussed later in the report, we  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for addressing our  reporting objectives. To evaluate resident satisfaction data reported in  OSD\u2019s reports to Congress on privatized housing, we reviewed the  processes for collecting, calculating, and reporting these data for the  three most recently issued reports for fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017,  focusing our detailed analysis on DOD\u2019s fiscal year 2017 report.", "For objective two, we reviewed military department policies and guidance  related to their roles and responsibilities for working with residents of  privatized housing. We also reviewed ground leases and other MHPI  project documents for the 10 installations we visited to identify guidance  that articulated private partners\u2019 and military departments\u2019 roles and  responsibilities. During our site visits to 10 installations, we interviewed  military department housing office officials and private partner  representatives to discuss their specific roles and responsibilities. We  also asked questions soliciting information about residents\u2019 understanding  of the roles and responsibilities of the military housing office and the  dispute resolution process during our 15 focus groups, information that  we also sought through our publicly available online tool.", "For objective three, we interviewed OSD and military department officials  to discuss ongoing initiatives developed over the course of our audit work  that were aimed at improving MHPI.

From the inception of MHPI,  the military departments were provided with various authorities to obtain  private-sector financing and management to repair, renovate, construct,  and operate military housing in the United States and its territories. These  authorities included the ability to make direct loans to and invest limited  amounts of funds in projects for the construction and renovation of  housing units for servicemembers and their families. The projects were  generally financed through both private-sector financing, such as bank  loans and bonds, and funds provided by the military departments. The  Army and the Navy generally structured their privatized housing projects  as limited liability companies in which the military departments formed  partnerships with the developers and invested funds in the partnership.", "The Air Force generally provided direct loans to the developers. Because  privatized housing projects involve budgetary commitments of the federal  government, each project was scored at inception by the Office of  Management and Budget to determine the amount of funds that needed  to be budgeted for that particular project.", "The military departments have flexibility in how they structure their  privatized housing projects, but typically the military departments lease  land to developers for a 50-year term and convey existing housing  located on the leased land to the developer for the duration of the lease.  The developer then becomes responsible for renovating and constructing  new housing and for the daily management of the housing units. At the  end of fiscal year 2017, 14 private partners were responsible for 79  privatized military family housing projects\u201434 for the Army, 32 for the Air  Force, and 13 for the Navy and the Marine Corps. See appendix II for a  list of all of these housing projects.", "Each privatized housing project is a separate and distinct entity governed  by a series of legal agreements that are specific to that project, hereafter  referred to as business agreements. These agreements include, among  other things, an operating agreement, a property management  agreement, and an agreement that describes the management of funds in  the projects, including the order in which funds are allocated within the  project. However, while each project is distinct, there are some common  elements in how projects invest and use funds. Every project takes in  revenue, which consists mostly of rent payments. Projects then pay for  operating expenses, including administrative costs, day-to-day  maintenance, and utilities, among other things. After that, projects  generally allocate funds for taxes and insurance, followed by debt  payments. Figure 1 shows a typical funding structure for a privatized  housing project.", "In the typical privatized housing project depicted in figure 1, once debt  payments are made, funds are allocated to accounts that fund scheduled  maintenance, such as repair and replacement of items like roofs, heating  and cooling systems, and infrastructure. After that, funds are allocated to  a series of management incentive fees, such as the property  management fee. Finally, the project divides these remaining funds  according to a fixed percentage between accounts that (1) fund major  renovations and rebuilds and (2) are provided to the developer. The  percentages may vary across agreements, but according to military  department documentation, typically, the majority of funds go toward the  accounts funding major renovations and rebuilds.", "Most of the projects\u2019 business agreements also include the option for the  private partners to receive performance incentive fees based on  achieving the performance metrics established in each individual project\u2019s  business agreement. These fees are intended to incentivize private  partner performance. The incentive fees can be paid to private partners  on an annual or quarterly basis and can be withheld in part or in total if  the private partner fails to meet the established metrics. The weight each  performance metric and underlying indicator carries toward the incentive  fee varies by project, so incentive fees for some projects may be heavily  dependent on financial performance, while others may be more heavily  weighted toward resident satisfaction."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Goals, Roles, and Responsibilities in the Privatized Housing Program", "paragraphs": ["The Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Facilities Management,  under the authority, direction, and control of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Sustainment, is responsible for all matters related to MHPI  and is the program manager for all DOD housing, whether DOD-owned,  DOD-leased, or privatized.

Each installation has  a military housing office that is responsible for conducting daily oversight  of a project\u2019s management and operations. Military housing officials told  us that activities to monitor the physical condition of housing units  generally include reviewing sample work order requests, following up with  a sample of residents to check on their experience with recently  completed work, and inspecting homes during the change-of-occupancy  process. However, the implementation and scope of these activities  varies and can be limited. For example, during our site visits conducted  from June through August 2019, we identified the following installation- specific practices:", "The rate of inspections of homes following change-of-occupancy  maintenance at the installations we visited varied. For example, at the  time of our site visits, military housing office officials at Tinker Air  Force Base, Oklahoma, told us that they inspect 100 percent of  homes that have completed change-of-occupancy maintenance, while  officials from Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, stated that they inspect  10 to 20 percent of these homes. In November 2019, Air Force  officials told us that they are moving to a 100-percent inspection  policy. Similarly, the Army issued an order in March 2019 directing  military housing office officials to inspect 100 percent of homes where  change-of-occupancy maintenance has been completed. Officials  from Army installations we visited noted that this was an increase  from previous practices, and for one installation was a change in  practice from conducting inspections only during the move-out  process, which occurs prior to change-of-occupancy maintenance.", "According to Department of Navy officials, the Navy\u2019s business  agreements stipulate that Navy and Marine Corps installations have  access to all work order information. However, practices for following  up on work order records varied among some of the Navy and Marine  Corps installations we visited. For example, military housing office  officials at Camp Pendleton, California, told us that for one of the two  partners that own housing on the base, they had access to only 3  percent of completed work orders from the previous month. For the  other partner that owns housing on the base, military housing office  officials noted that the partner provided them with nine work orders of  varying priority each month to review. One military housing office  official added that these were the minimum requirements needed for  monthly reporting and that they were working with the private partner  to increase their access to work order records. Following a different  practice, military housing office officials at Naval Station Norfolk,  Virginia, told us that they had access to the private partner\u2019s  maintenance record system and would pull reports on homes that had  made six or more maintenance calls in a 30-day period.", "Periodic reviews of compliance with each project\u2019s business  agreements. Periodic reviews of compliance with a project\u2019s business  agreements are a joint effort between the local military housing office, the  private partners, military department installation commands, and other  echelons of command. These reviews can include neighborhood tours  to view project amenities such as community centers, playgrounds, and  pools, all of which are owned, maintained, and operated by the private  partner companies, as well as exteriors of housing units. However, similar  to the daily oversight activities, these annual reviews have been narrow in the scope of their assessment of the physical condition of the housing  units, as interior walk-throughs were, at times, focused on just a few  homes at each installation. For example:", "The Air Force Civil Engineer Center is the primary oversight and  governance body for the Air Force\u2019s privatized housing projects. The  Air Force oversight process includes periodic compliance reviews of  all privatized housing projects. To accomplish this task, the Air Force  is to use a compliance checklist to review the private partner\u2019s  compliance with a project\u2019s business agreements. In addition to the  compliance reviews, guidance states that Air Force Civil Engineer  Center officials visit projects annually, and officials told us that they  tour a sample of homes and interview private partner representatives,  military housing office staff, and residents during these visits.  However, according to selected annual site visit reports we reviewed  and a discussion with an Air Force official, annual site visit reports  typically include only an evaluation of three to four housing units on an  installation and can be restricted to empty units or units that have  completed change-of-occupancy maintenance, limiting the robustness  of the assessment of the installation\u2019s housing units\u2019 physical  condition.", "According to Department of the Navy officials, the Navy and the  Marine Corps provide oversight of privatized housing projects through  a tool called the monitoring matrix. Officials from the various  organizational entities involved with privatized housing\u2014to include the  Commander, Naval Installation Command; the Naval Facilities and  Engineering Command; and the military housing office\u2014are to use  this monitoring matrix to periodically review private partner  compliance with a project\u2019s business agreements. The matrix contains  a condition assessment component, which includes a tour of  privatized housing neighborhoods and a visual inspection of individual  privatized housing units. However, similar to the Air Force, according  to select assessments we reviewed and a discussion with a military  housing office official, the visual inspections are typically focused on  two to three homes in each neighborhood on an installation and to  homes that have recently undergone change-of-occupancy  maintenance.", "Army guidance calls for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to conduct  an annual ground lease inspection to review private partner  compliance with a project\u2019s business agreements. The guidance also  calls for the Army\u2019s program manager to conduct an annual  installation visit to each project to evaluate performance and ensure a  project\u2019s compliance with the business agreements. The visit is to  include a recommended site tour, described in guidance as a brief  visual inspection tour of community elements, and a walk-through  visual inspection of at least four housing units\u2014two renovated and  two recently built\u2014including one unit designated as an accessible  home under federal guidelines. However, according to a May 2019  report by the Army Inspector General, these requirements were  inconsistently met, and the results did not include a follow-up process  and were not communicated to senior commanders.", "Through the recent housing reviews that they have conducted, each  military department\u2019s internal oversight body has recognized that the  departments\u2019 oversight guidance has been limited in addressing the  condition of privatized homes and provides little clarity to housing officials  about their roles and responsibilities in assessing the physical condition of  homes. For example, in May 2019, the Department of the Army Inspector  General reported that senior commanders and garrison staffs expressed  confusion concerning the roles, responsibilities, and authorities regarding  privatized housing and that oversight, governance, and synchronization  were insufficient to identify current housing challenges. Similarly, an April  2019 report from the Air Force Inspector General noted that ambiguous  guidance had resulted in inconsistent action and uneven performance  across Air Force housing projects. In addition, a November 2019 report  by the Naval Audit Service identified nine separate guidance documents  for the oversight of privatized housing and found that personnel at  installation and regional levels were unclear on the guidance and  requirements for performing oversight of privatized housing.", "According to military department officials, each department has  completed initiatives and is undertaking initiatives to revise guidance and  standardize daily oversight activities in an effort to provide consistent  oversight across projects and installations and to increase the focus on  the physical condition of housing. In addition, the military departments  have initiatives to increase staffing levels, improve training for military  housing office officials, and ensure that military department housing  officials have independent access to work order data to strengthen their  oversight activities. Figure 3 outlines examples of completed and ongoing  initiatives by military department to improve the oversight of privatized  housing.", "However, each military department is working to implement service- specific initiatives with minimal guidance from OSD on the level of  oversight expected as it relates to the condition of privatized housing.  OSD guidance as it pertains to the condition of privatized housing is  limited compared with the guidance OSD provides for monitoring the  condition of military-owned housing.", "Specifically, OSD guidance is focused on the oversight of the  implementation of projects, the construction of new housing units, and  project financial monitoring. The guidance stipulates that after privatized  housing projects are awarded, monitoring should include descriptions of  deal structure and strategies for project monitoring. In contrast, OSD  guidance for military-owned housing provides clearly defined objectives to  the military departments for oversight, including the physical condition of  the homes. For example, the DOD manual for housing management  directs the military departments to provide managerial oversight of DOD\u2019s  government-owned family housing to ensure that (1) the required  inventory is being provided and maintained in good condition, (2) the  program is being operated in an effective and cost-efficient manner, and  (3) servicemembers and their families have adequate housing choices.  Further, the manual provides specific objectives for the condition of  DOD\u2019s government-owned family housing, stating that for DOD family  housing to be considered adequate overall, it must meet minimum  standards for configuration, privacy, condition, health, and safety. It also  states that military service condition assessments shall use private-sector  housing industry and DOD standards or codes as a basis for assessing  inventory adequacy. The manual adds that for DOD government-owned  family housing to be considered in adequate condition, the construction  cost for all needed repairs and improvements cannot exceed 20 percent  of the replacement cost.", "According to DOD\u2019s housing manual, program assumptions for privatized  housing are that privatization allows the military departments to work with  the private sector to generate housing built to market standards. While  the military departments\u2019 policies provide for some measureable oversight  activities, such as requiring a certain number or type of home to be  inspected, OSD has not provided guidance to the military departments  clearly defining oversight objectives for monitoring the physical condition  of privatized housing units.", "DOD\u2019s housing manual further states that because privatization creates a  long-term governmental interest in privatized housing, it is essential that  projects be attentively monitored. The 50-year term for the ground leases  creates a long-term interest in monitoring the privatized housing assets,  to include the physical condition of the housing units. However, unless  DOD updates its guidance on the oversight of privatized housing with  objectives for overseeing the physical condition of housing units, it cannot  be assured that the military departments\u2019 oversight activities will be  sustained over time or be sufficiently consistent across projects, raising  the risk that private partners may not provide adequate quality housing.  Notably, the military departments have entered into privatized housing  agreements with some of the same companies, and members of different  military services may live at installations managed by military services  different than their own. As such, it is important that oversight  expectations generally be consistent across the military departments and  the projects they manage.", "Moreover, all military departments have an interest in ensuring that  residents feel confident that the private partners will be held to a  consistent standard for maintaining the condition of their homes.  Participants in 8 of our 15 focus groups stated that they will no longer live  in privatized housing following their current experience, and participants  in 6 of our 15 focus groups stated that their current experience with  privatized housing will affect the future career decisions for their family.  One participant stated that he plans to exit the service after 8 years,  noting that his decision is largely based on his experience with privatized  housing. In addition, in our online tool we asked residents if their  experience with privatized housing would impact their future career and  housing decisions. For those residents that responded to these questions,  the majority said their experience will make them less likely to continue to  live in privatized housing in the future. For example, one respondent  stated that while living in privatized housing is a benefit to being in the  military, living in housing that is subpar and where nothing seems to be  getting fixed or at least acknowledged makes the family hesitant to live in  privatized housing again. Some residents also indicated that their  experience would impact their future career decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Uses Several Metrics to Monitor Private Partner Performance, but the Indicators Underlying Those Metrics May Not Provide Meaningful Information on the Condition of Privatized Housing", "paragraphs": ["The military departments each use a range of project-specific  performance metrics to monitor private partner performance. However,  the indicators underlying the metrics designed to focus on resident  satisfaction and on the quality of the maintenance conducted on housing  units may not provide meaningful information or reflect the actual  condition of the housing units. For example, in April 2019 the Air Force  Inspector General reported that the current incentive structure measures  many things with precision, but does not measure the right things.  Private partner performance is commonly measured through four key  metrics\u2014resident satisfaction, maintenance management, project safety,  and financial management. To determine how well the private partners  are performing under these metrics, military housing office officials told us  that they rely on a range of indicators established in the project business  agreements. Table 1 provides examples of various indicators that the  performance metrics comprise.", "According to officials from each military department, the performance  metrics and their underlying indicators are a key tool that each military  department uses to hold private partners accountable for providing quality  management of the privatized housing projects. However, we found that  the indicators themselves may not reflect how the private partner is  performing in terms of providing servicemembers and their families with  quality services and housing. For example:", "Maintenance management: One commonly used indicator of  performance in maintenance management measures how often the  property manager\u2019s response time to work orders meets required time  frames established in the project\u2019s business agreements. While this  indicator measures the timeliness of the private partner\u2019s response, it  does not measure or take into account the quality of the work that was  conducted or whether the resident\u2019s issue was fully addressed. As  such, a property manager may fully meet the metric for maintenance  management, even if a given repair has not been adequately  completed. Residents in 13 of our 15 focus groups noted that they  typically have had to submit multiple work order requests before an  individual maintenance issue has been fully addressed. For example,  a resident who participated in one of our focus groups provided us  with a copy of work orders she had submitted related to a single  maintenance issue in her home. The first work order was marked  completed on time, yet the resident had to submit a work order for the  same issue a week later. Further, an official at one Army installation  told us that since the incentive fee for the project is awarded on a  quarterly basis, judging property managers only on the basis of work  orders completed on time for that quarter could mask persistent  ongoing housing problems. This is because many smaller work orders  get closed out each quarter, while work orders for more complicated  issues might stay open over multiple quarters. Some projects include  indicators that aim to more directly measure quality, such as the  number of work orders placed during the first 5 business days of  residency. This type of indicator may more clearly indicate the extent  to which change-of-occupancy maintenance was complete on a given  home.", "Resident satisfaction: One example of an indicator of resident  satisfaction is whether a project has met target occupancy rates  established in the project\u2019s business agreements. An OSD official and  private partner representatives told us they use occupancy as an  indicator of satisfaction, based on the assumption that residents would  move if they are dissatisfied with their home\u2019s condition. However,  according to the Army\u2019s Portfolio and Asset Management Handbook,  occupancy rates are not a recommended metric to monitor private  partner performance because occupancy rates already impact project  finances. Our focus groups and the responses we received to our  online tool also indicate that this may not be a reliable assumption.  Although most residents are not required to live in military housing,  residents in each of our 15 focus groups and responses to our online  tool indicated a variety of reasons for choosing to live in privatized  housing, many of which do not have to do with their satisfaction with  the quality or condition of their homes. For example, residents in our  focus groups cited other factors influencing their decision to live in  privatized housing, such as living in close proximity to military medical  or educational services for children or other family members that are  part of the military\u2019s Exceptional Family Member Program, a lack of  safe and affordable housing in the surrounding community, and  access to quality schools. Volunteers that responded to our online  tool also cited accessibility to base services, commute time, and  safety as reasons for choosing to live in privatized housing.", "Another commonly used indicator of resident satisfaction is the results  of various resident satisfaction surveys, such as maintenance surveys  and leasing surveys, as well as the annual satisfaction survey. The  military departments and the private partners use these survey tools  to gauge resident satisfaction with the maintenance conducted on  their homes, service provided by property managers, and amenities  provided in their community, among other things. However, residents  in 4 out of our 15 focus groups indicated that the surveys they receive  related to maintenance performed on their homes do not ask  questions about the quality of maintenance work. For example,  residents told us that maintenance surveys, which they generally  receive after maintenance work is completed on their homes, ask if  the maintenance worker was courteous, but not about the quality of  the work performed on the home.", "We reviewed maintenance surveys from 3 of the 10 installations we  visited and found that the surveys asked residents to provide  feedback on the quality of the work, with questions asking them to  rate their satisfaction with the quality of the maintenance work  completed. In addition, we reviewed a quarterly Army survey from one  of the installations we visited and found that this survey asked  residents about their satisfaction with the courteousness and  professionalism of the maintenance team and the responsiveness and  timeliness of maintenance work, but did not specifically ask about  their satisfaction with the quality of the maintenance work completed.", "We also found that the information used to support the indicators can  vary. For example, officials at one Army installation\u2014Fort Huachuca,  Arizona\u2014use quarterly resident surveys, the Army\u2019s annual survey, and  action plans on Army annual survey results as indicators of resident  satisfaction. However, officials at another Army installation\u2014Fort Knox,  Kentucky\u2014use residential community office relationship management  and point of service surveys. Similarly, we found differences in the  information used as indicators of the maintenance management metric.  For example, officials at both Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, and Davis- Monthan Air Force Base, Arizona, rely on the timeliness and quality of  change-of-occupancy maintenance as an indicator of maintenance  management. However, officials at Hickam Air Force Base also use work  order response and completion times as indicators of the maintenance  management metric, whereas officials at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base,  Arizona, only use work order response times.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should evaluate performance and hold individuals  accountable for their internal control responsibilities. If management  establishes incentives, management should recognize that such actions  can yield unintended consequences and evaluate incentives so that they  align with the entity\u2019s standards of conduct. The standards further state  that management should use quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s  objectives, including relevant data from reliable sources.", "In October 2019, OSD, in collaboration with the military departments and  private partners, issued new guidance standardizing the performance  incentive fee framework across the military departments. The new  guidance provides a framework for standardizing the minimum and  maximum percentages of the fee that each metric can account for,  allowing for some flexibility in the weight each metric will carry for an  individual project. Specifically, maintenance management and resident  satisfaction can account for between 60 and 90 percent of the fee, project  safety can account for between 5 and 15 percent of the fee, and financial  performance can account for between 5 and 15 percent of the fee.", "However, despite DOD\u2019s efforts to ensure more focus on the condition  and quality of, and resident satisfaction with, privatized housing through  the standardization of metrics across the military departments, the metrics  may be misleading if the specific underlying indicators used to determine  whether a metric has been reached are not reevaluated on an ongoing  basis to ensure they are accurate measures of the private partners\u2019  performance and an accurate reflection of the condition and quality of  privatized homes. OSD and military department officials have recognized  that the current indicators for measuring performance do not consistently  focus on or prioritize the private partners\u2019 performance with maintaining  housing units and ensuring resident satisfaction. For example, Army  officials told us they are no longer using occupancy rate as an indicator of  resident satisfaction and have taken steps to standardize performance  indicators across all Army projects, while still allowing for flexibility at the  installation level to modify the weight of indicators to provide incentives  reflective of the specific needs of the installation. Limitations to the current  indicators may hinder the military departments\u2019 ability to accurately  determine private partner performance. OSD and the military department  officials told us they have not yet reevaluated the specific indicators used  to determine whether a private partner has met a specific metric because  doing so will require negotiation with each of the private partners for each  project. However, without reviewing the specific indicators used to award  performance incentives, OSD and the military departments do not have  assurance that the information the military departments are using to  award these incentives reflects the actual condition of the housing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and Private Partners Collect Maintenance Data on Privatized Housing, but These Data Are Not Captured Reliably or Consistently for Use in Ongoing Monitoring of Housing Units", "paragraphs": ["Maintenance data collected by the private partners are not captured  consistently or reliably across projects for use in ongoing monitoring of  the condition of privatized housing units over time.

According to  private partner representatives, work orders can be entered into the  system by property management office staff, maintenance technicians, or  call center representatives for those companies that use offsite call  centers to process resident service request calls. At some installations,  residents can also enter work orders into the work order tracking system  through online portals or mobile applications.", "However, we noted cases where work orders were inconsistently entered  into the work order tracking systems with respect to two primary factors\u2014 (1) how the request is described by the resident or interpreted by the  individual entering the data, which can differ for each work order; and (2)  the existing range of pre-established service category options in the  private partner\u2019s work order tracking system, which differ among the  partners. According to private partner representatives, the individual  responsible for entering the work order into the system\u2014property  management office staff, maintenance technicians, call center  representatives, or residents\u2014makes a judgment on how to categorize  the work order.", "These factors create challenges for looking at the data across projects.  Private partner representatives from one installation we met with stated  that the quality of the work order data is dependent on the data input into  the system. In some cases, the data input can be inaccurate or imprecise,  depending on the specificity with which a resident describes his or her  maintenance issue or how a staff person enters the data into the system.  A private partner representative from another installation we visited stated  that reporting on data from the work order tracking system can be  challenging because individuals across installations inputting data may  have a different interpretation of a resident\u2019s reported issue. Private  partner representatives from another installation noted that the work order  tracking system they used could not be easily updated with a new  category if needed, making it more difficult to identify systemic issues. For  example, there is one category for all exterior repairs, but no way to break  that category down into what the specific repairs are, such as roofs. In the  event that there is an issue with several roofs in the same area, the  private partner representative said it would be hard to identify the issue  because the only option available is to look through the notes section.  According to this individual, the regional maintenance technicians, not the  work order tracking system, are the best resource for identifying trends or  recurring issues.", "This inconsistent entering of information into the work order tracking  systems, which occurs both within and across installations, means that  the military departments cannot readily use the data to capture the  prevalence of a particular issue, such as mold, among the homes in a  reliable manner. For example, if someone wanted to use work order data  to track instances of mold, he or she would find that these may be  represented in the work order systems under a variety of service  categories, such as mold or mildew, plumbing and bath, heating and  cooling, or general. To isolate service requests related to mold, one may  have to rely on using the service comments for each request, which can  vary in their level of detail. In addition, service requests for mold issues  may be entered into the work order systems under different priority levels,  such as routine, urgent, or emergency. As a result of the variation in the  type and amount of information collected in the work order tracking  systems, work order data alone cannot be used to determine the validity  of a service request, the severity of the problem, or whether the work was  completed to a quality standard. Figure 4 shows examples of differences  in how a perceived mold issue can be captured in these systems based  on our review of the data provided by the private partners.", "Military department officials found similar limitations when analyzing the  work order data.

For example, according to private partner  representatives at one installation we visited, a practice for tracking  emergency work orders in the work order tracking system had changed in  2013. Work that comes in under an emergency priority may take several  steps to complete: A maintenance technician may first have to stop the  emergency, then clean up any resulting damage, before repairing the root  cause and completing any finishing work. Prior to 2013, maintenance  technicians would open and close new work orders for each step in the  process. Under the new practice, the original work order is kept open until  completion. Representatives from a different private partner described a  similar change in practices, noting that if a work order was closed or  recategorized before the work was finished there could be issues for how  it is tracked, such as getting dropped out of the system and the work not  getting done. A third partner noted the same practice, but added that an  emergency work order can be downgraded to urgent or routine status  during the time that the work is taking place. As a result, work order data  alone may not accurately identify the number of open work orders at any  given time, the time it took to address a maintenance issue, or if a  maintenance request has been fully completed.", "Additionally, we identified anomalies in the work order data provided to us  from each of the 14 partners. For example, we identified instances of,  among other things, duplicate work orders, work orders with completion  dates prior to the dates that the resident had submitted the work order,  and work orders still listed as in-progress for more than 18 months.  According to military department officials, they have increased their  efforts to review data from the private partners\u2019 work order tracking  systems and have found similar anomalies. For example, a Navy official  working with work order data found that a couple of homes had six or  seven unique work order records in the system, but each contained  identical information in the various data fields. Officials from both the  Navy and Air Force have come across work order records that were  marked as complete within minutes of being entered into the system or  marked as complete with a date prior to the work order being open, which  signaled the need for further scrutiny.", "Each military department has efforts underway to monitor private partner  work order data in an effort to increase oversight of the quality of  privatized housing.

However, we  found instances where the sum of the data broken out by different  housing categories was not equal to the reported total number of  surveys received. For example, when we reviewed data for Fort  Rucker, Alabama, the calculated sum of surveys broken out by  different housing categories was 1,372, but the Army reported a total  of 530 surveys received, a difference of 842 surveys.", "Further, the presentation of data in OSD\u2019s report to Congress is  misleading because OSD did not explain the methodology it used to  calculate the overall resident satisfaction percentage or include caveats to  explain limitations to the data. Specifically, OSD did not include  information on overall response rates to the annual satisfaction survey for  each military department, nor did it include response rates by project. Low  response rates can create the potential for bias in survey results. For  example, in its fiscal year 2017 report, OSD reported that 25 percent of  residents living in renovated homes at the MHPI project including Fort  Detrick, Maryland/Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, D.C.,  were satisfied with their housing.

The Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA includes a  provision requiring each military installation to use the same satisfaction  survey for tenants of military housing\u2014including privatized military  housing\u2014the results of which are not to be shared with private partners  until reviewed by DOD. The statute also states that DOD\u2019s reports to  Congress shall include additional information, such as the results of  residence surveys, as well as assessments of maintenance response  times, completion of maintenance requests, the dispute resolution  process, overall customer service for tenants, and other factors related to  the condition of privatized housing.", "OSD\u2019s report to Congress states that, given DOD\u2019s objective of improving  the quality of life for its servicemembers, the degree of satisfaction  military families experience in privatized housing is a critical indicator of  overall program success and the military departments and private  partners use tenant surveys to help assess the quality of privatized  housing.

According to an OSD  official responsible for preparing the reports to Congress, her office  inherited the MHPI report process from its predecessors and had to  quickly catch up on reports because DOD was behind on its reporting  requirement. However, she noted her office is working with the military  departments to review the resident satisfaction survey questions and will  be identifying and implementing measures to ensure an accurate and  reliable process to compile, calculate, report, and compare MHPI residents\u2019 satisfaction by military department and across DOD.

Similarly, officials at the  military housing office at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, told us that  many residents were confused by their office\u2019s role because the private  partner office goes by the name \u201cTinker Housing Office.\u201d Further, we  observed that both private partner representatives and some military  housing office officials are located in the same building, and signage does  not distinctly indicate that the office houses both military officials and  private partner representatives. In contrast, the military housing office at  Camp Pendleton, California, is intentionally branded as the \u201cCamp  Pendleton Joint Housing Office\u201d and signage indicates the office houses  officials from both the Marine Corps and the installation\u2019s private partners.  See figure 5 for examples of the varying level of detail in military housing  office signage.", "Some military housing office officials told us they have taken steps to  improve resident awareness, such as increasing advertising of the military  housing office\u2019s role and contact information, using town hall meetings to  inform residents of their roles and responsibilities, and rebranding their  military housing offices to differentiate them from the private partners. For  example, the Army housing office at Fort Sill, Oklahoma, changed its  name from the \u201cResidential Communities Initiative Housing Office\u201d to the  \u201cGarrison Housing Office\u201d to more clearly denote that the military housing  office is not associated with the private partner. In addition, a Marine  Corps housing office official provided us with a flyer, which is distributed  to residents by the private partner, informing residents of housing office  contact information and the service\u2019s three-step dispute resolution  process. See figure 6 for a copy of the flyer.", "According to DOD officials, the military departments generally decreased  their staffing and oversight of daily privatized housing operations after the  MHPI was enacted, which led to less ongoing resident interaction. For  example, Army officials we spoke with in January 2019 told us they  typically filled 80 percent of available military housing office positions  across their installations. Additionally, officials stated that housing offices  were generally staffed with two or three officials responsible for assisting  servicemembers with housing needs both on the installation as well as in  the local community. Further, the officials told us that the team at Fort  Bragg, North Carolina, was decreased from about 15 to 3 positions.  According to OSD officials, while housing offices should generally not  require the number of personnel that were necessary prior to  privatization, reductions following sequestration reduced housing staff  below the level necessary to fully perform required privatized housing  oversight as it was originally envisioned at the outset of the program.", "OSD has also recognized that the military departments\u2019 communication  with residents about their role as a resource for residents has not been  clear or systematic. In February 2019, the Assistant Secretary of Defense  for Sustainment testified before Congress that a way forward in  addressing resident concerns would require focus in three key areas:  communication, engagement, and responsiveness. In support of this,  OSD and the military departments are collaborating with each of the  private partners on several initiatives aimed at improving the residents\u2019  experience with privatized housing and ensuring a consistent resident  experience across installations. These initiatives include: establishing a tenant bill of rights that will clearly define tenants\u2019 rights establishing a resident advocate position that is planned to provide  advice, education, and support to the resident and advocate on the  resident\u2019s behalf in disputes with private partners; developing a common lease that provides a common framework and  language in residential leases across all privatization projects; and developing a standardized formal dispute resolution process to ensure  the prompt and fair resolution of disputes that arise between  privatized housing landlords and residents.", "Despite the development of initiatives aimed at improving the resident\u2019s  experience with privatized housing and various ad hoc efforts to better  brand and advertise the roles and responsibilities of some military  housing offices, the military departments have not systematically or  clearly communicated these efforts to residents, and military officials we  met with acknowledged that there still appears to be a gap in residents\u2019  awareness of the military housing office and its role in the dispute  resolution process.", "Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government state that  management should externally communicate the necessary quality  information to achieve the entity\u2019s objectives. Management communicates  this externally through reporting lines so that external parties can help the  entity achieve its objectives and address related risks. Moving forward,  having plans in place to clearly and systematically communicate the  difference between the military housing office and the private partners\u2014 including the military departments\u2019 roles, responsibilities, and military  housing office locations and contact information\u2014will better position the  military departments to achieve the intended objectives of the initiatives  they are currently developing with OSD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD and Private Partners Are Implementing Initiatives to Improve Privatized Housing, but May Face Challenges DOD and Private Partners Are Implementing Initiatives to Improve MHPI", "paragraphs": ["OSD, the military departments, and the private partners have identified  and begun collaborating on a series of initiatives aimed at improving  residents\u2019 experience with privatized housing.

Tri-service working  groups, each chaired by a designated military department and including  officials and legal counsel from each military department as well as  private partner representatives, are leading efforts to develop and  implement the initiatives. In addition, in the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA,  Congress established several requirements aimed at addressing military  privatization housing reform. Several of the statutory requirements  provide specific provisions that DOD will need to incorporate into its  development and implementation of existing MHPI initiatives, as well as  additional requirements aimed at improving the oversight of privatized  housing. Table 2 outlines key initiatives aimed at improving privatized  housing, as well as additional selected requirements mandated by the  Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA.", "In addition to the provisions noted in table 2, the Fiscal Year 2020 NDAA  included requirements for increased oversight of the physical condition of  privatized housing.

Specifically, key challenges include the timeliness with which they  are able to implement initiatives, a lack of resources needed for  implementation, and concerns that implementation could have unintended  negative impacts on the financial viability of the privatized housing  projects.", "Timeliness of implementation due to the need to collaborate with  and obtain input and agreement from the large number of  stakeholders involved in privatized housing. According to DOD  officials and private partner representatives, many of the initiatives  designed to improve privatized housing require not only agreement  between DOD and the private housing partners, but also discussion  with and, in some cases, approval by the project bond holders.  Because DOD does not have the ability to unilaterally make changes  to existing business agreements, this need for stakeholder agreement  limits DOD\u2019s control over the implementation timeline of any initiative  that requires changes to a project\u2019s business agreement\u2014such as the  implementation of a standardized dispute resolution process.  Additionally, the private partners noted that the bond holders may be  reluctant to agree to changes to the business agreements that could  result in higher project costs.", "The need for more military department staff with targeted  expertise. As noted earlier, the military departments had reduced  their involvement in daily privatized military housing operations as part  of the overall privatization effort. This included reducing staffing levels  at the installations, and military housing office officials at over half of  the installations we visited stated that reduced staffing levels had  impacted their ability to carry out oversight duties, such as work order  data analysis and housing inspections. Further, until recent issues  surfaced over concerns of the quality of privatized housing, the  military departments had distanced themselves from involvement in  daily military housing operations. For example, the Army issued a  memorandum in 2013, which has since been rescinded, stating that  garrison commanders were not to authorize, direct, or permit Army  representatives to initiate health and welfare inspections of privatized  housing. Each of the military departments has plans to increase the  military housing office staffing at each installation to allow for  enhanced oversight. In particular, according to military department  officials, these positions will focus on quality control and quality  assurance of the maintenance of privatized homes. However,  improvements to the condition of privatized housing may not be fully  realized until DOD establishes a uniform code of basic standards for  privatized military housing, as required by the Fiscal Year 2020  NDAA, and these new personnel are trained in these standards.", "The potential for unintended negative financial impacts on the  projects that could outweigh the intended benefits of the  initiatives. OSD officials and private partner representatives have  expressed concern that some proposed initiatives could result in  unintended financial consequences for the housing projects. In  particular, private partner representatives noted costs from things  such as legal fees associated with the development of a common  lease and the various addendums that would be required and the  unanticipated costs of hiring outside third party inspections. In  particular, some of the private partners noted that the financial impact  of unfunded requirements to projects that are already experiencing  financial distress could result in even fewer funds available to reinvest  in improvements to the current and future physical condition of the  homes.", "Moreover, OSD officials told us they have concerns that some  initiatives\u2014such as increased frequency of change-of-occupancy  inspections that may result in homes remaining vacant longer than  planned and therefore not collecting rent\u2014may unintentionally impact  a project\u2019s cash flow. Officials noted that some installations have  large-scale housing turn over at the same time and inspections may  not be able to be completed in the required time frames. For example,  OSD officials said that at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the vast majority  of homes generally turn over during a 2-week time period. Officials  said that in a location like this, new oversight requirements may have  a negative impact on residents\u2019 move-in timelines, which could  subsequently impact occupancy rates and project cash flow as a  result of delays in rent payments. OSD officials also stated that  residents\u2019 ability to have their basic allowance housing payments  segregated and held in escrow may present financial challenges to  both the resident and the project. These officials noted that they did  not yet know how the withholding of these payments would be  implemented. According to OSD officials, as of January 2020, there  are many questions surrounding the implementation of the Fiscal Year  2020 NDAA provisions. Officials told us that they have not yet  assessed the impact of increased oversight on the financial viability of  the MHPI projects, but stated that as they develop processes to  implement each new statutory provision, the financial impact is  something that needs to be considered.", "DOD\u2019s Military Housing Privatization Initiative Performance Evaluation  Report for fiscal year 2017 stated that the government\u2019s interests are not  always aligned with those of the private sector, and that oversight and  engagement are required and expected in a public-private partnership  over the long term to ensure success. We have previously reported that  the military departments have not defined their risk tolerance levels for  privatized housing relative to the program\u2019s objective of providing quality  housing that reflects community living. Specifically, we recognized that  the Office of Management and Budget guidance on the preparation,  submission, and execution of the federal budget suggests that public- private partnerships, such as privatized military housing projects, contain  some elements of risk to the government. Standards for Internal Control  in the Federal Government state that management should identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving defined program  objectives. While DOD is in the process of developing and implementing  initiatives to improve privatized military housing, OSD and the military  departments have not assessed the risk of the proposed initiatives on the  financial viability of the privatized housing projects.", "According to an OSD official, the intention of privatization was to reduce  the government\u2019s role in the management of military housing and put  more responsibility on the private partners. As described earlier in this  report, the military departments have ramped up their oversight efforts in  response to recent concerns about the condition of privatized housing by,  for example, revising guidance and hiring additional staff. However, OSD  has not assessed the impact of these activities on the financial viability of  the MHPI projects. For example, OSD has not determined how increasing  the frequency of housing office inspections and residents\u2019 withholding of  rent could impact the bottom line of some of its privatized projects.  Without assessing risks to the financial viability of the MHPI projects  associated with the implementation of these initiatives aimed at improving  privatized housing, DOD\u2019s efforts to improve the privatized housing  program could be compromised. Further, DOD has a long-term interest in  ensuring the financial health of the properties privatized under MHPI. As  we have reported, typically the titles to the homes that were conveyed to the private partners and any improvements made to these homes during  the duration of the ground leases will automatically revert to the military  departments upon expiration or termination of the leases."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD\u2019s oversight of privatized housing is critical to ensure that residents  are being provided with affordable, quality housing that generally reflects  contemporary community living standards. In light of recent concerns  about the effect of inadequate and poor quality housing on  servicemembers and their families, the military departments have recently  implemented steps to increase the oversight of the condition of privatized  housing. However, OSD has not provided the military departments with  specific objectives for this monitoring. The newly established Chief  Housing Officer position, intended to standardize guidance and processes  for the oversight of privatized housing, provides DOD with an opportunity  to ensure that revised guidance provided to the military departments  includes objectives for increased oversight. In addition to oversight of the  condition of homes, DOD has taken initial steps to standardize  performance incentive metrics across the military departments. However,  unless efforts are made to ensure that the indicators driving these metrics  accurately reflect private partners\u2019 performance in maintaining the  condition and quality of privatized homes, DOD\u2019s ability to hold private  partners accountable will remain limited. Further, while the military  departments continue to increase the access to and use of work order  data to monitor and track the condition of privatized housing, without  consistent terminology and practices for work order data collection and  processes for validating data collected from the private housing partners,  the use of these data may not result in reliable findings. Finally, DOD has  frequently reported high customer resident satisfaction rates as a key  indicator of the success of the privatization initiative. However, the  process used to collect and calculate the data used for determining these  rates and limitations in its presentation to Congress raise questions about  the reliability of DOD\u2019s reports and their usefulness as an indicator of  program success. By improving oversight guidance, mechanisms for  measuring private partner performance, the reliability of housing data,  and reporting on resident satisfaction, DOD can better ensure that MHPI  is providing servicemembers with quality housing.", "Despite a decreased role in the daily management of privatized housing,  the military departments still maintain responsibility for providing  servicemembers with resources for seeking resolution to any issues  identified in their privatized homes. However, without plans in place to  communicate military housing office roles, responsibilities, and locations  to residents of privatized housing, these individuals may not receive the  full benefits of the assistance that the military housing offices provide. In  light of the increased focus by DOD and Congress in ensuring that  residents are aware of their rights and responsibilities, improved  communication with residents about the military housing offices\u2019 roles and  responsibilities can help ensure that residents are utilizing the full range  of resources available to them if they have issues with privatized housing.", "As OSD, the military departments, and the private partners take steps to  improve the resident experience with privatized military housing and  increase the department\u2019s focus on the condition of privatized homes,  ensuring that their efforts do not inadvertently harm the financial viability  of these projects is key.

Prior to requesting these data, we contacted  representatives from each of the 14 private partner companies to  discuss our forthcoming data request and to better understand each  company\u2019s data system and potential limitations for using the data.  Subsequently, we requested that each partner provide us with data for  all work orders across all data elements for each installation under  their management. We received data on over 8 million work orders  among the 14 private partners. We performed manual testing on initial  data files received by each partner to identify issues that would impact  the validity and reliability of using these data for ongoing monitoring  and tracking of the condition of privatized housing units. In doing so,  we identified instances of anomalies in work order data from each of  the 14 partners. For 12 of the 14 partners, we found at least one of  the following anomalies in the initial work order data files received for  the time period requested: (1) duplicate work orders; (2) work orders  with completion dates prior to the dates that a resident had submitted  the work order; and (3) work orders still listed as in-progress for more  than 18 months.

During our site visits to 10 installations,  we interviewed military department housing office officials and private  partner representatives to discuss their specific roles and responsibilities.  We asked questions soliciting information about residents understanding  of the roles and responsibilities of the military housing office and the  dispute resolution process during our 15 focus groups. We also solicited  resident feedback in our online tools regarding residents\u2019 experience  reporting maintenance issues and working with military housing offices  and private partners to get maintenance issues resolved.", "To determine the extent to which DOD and private partners have  developed and implemented initiatives to improve privatized housing, we  interviewed OSD and military department officials to discuss ongoing  initiatives developed over the course of our audit work aimed at improving  MHPI and reviewed relevant guidance. We met with private partner  representatives to discuss their involvement in developing these  initiatives, as well as to gain an understanding of any challenges or  concerns that may impact the implementation of these initiatives.  Following the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2020, we reviewed provisions of the statute designed to  improve the condition of privatized housing and evaluated the extent to  which these provisions would impact ongoing or planned DOD initiatives  or provide new oversight roles and responsibilities for OSD and the  military departments. We discussed these provisions with OSD officials  and private partner representatives to understand how, if at all, their  implementation may impact the privatized housing projects, as well as  any potential barriers to implementation in the current legal construct of  the program.", "We conducted this performance audit from November 2018 to March  2020 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
