This was the latest in a series of high-profile security incidents at LANL spanning almost a decade. LANL conducts research on nuclear weapons and other national security areas for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). GAO was asked to (1) identify LANL's major programs and activities and how much they rely on classified resources; (2) identify initiatives LANL is taking to reduce and consolidate its classified resources and physical footprint and the extent to which these initiatives address earlier security concerns; and (3) determine whether its new management approaches will sustain security improvements over the long-term. To carry out its work, GAO analyzed LANL data; reviewed policies, plans, and budgets; and interviewed officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["With fiscal year 2007 budget authority of about $2.7 billion, LANL conducts work on over 175 programs that can be grouped into three major program categories--Nuclear Weapons Science, Threat Reduction Science and Support, and Fundamental Science and Energy--and two support program categories--Environmental Programs and Safeguards and Security. Respectively, LANL's major programs serve to ensure the safety, performance, and reliability of the U.S. nuclear deterrent; support nonproliferation and counterproliferation efforts; and address energy security and other emerging national security challenges. LANL's Nuclear Weapons Science programs are the primary users of the facilities housing classified resources. For example, the Nuclear Weapons Science programs are the primary users of 14 facilities that store special nuclear material while LANL's other major programs are the primary users of only 7 such facilities. LANL has over two dozen initiatives under way that are principally aimed at reducing, consolidating, and better protecting classified resources, as well as reducing the physical footprint of the laboratory by closing unneeded facilities. While many of these initiatives address security concerns identified through past external evaluations--such as efforts to consolidate storage of classified documents and media into fewer secure facilities and to destroy unneeded classified nuclear weapon parts--significant security problems at LANL have received insufficient attention. Specifically, LANL has not implemented complete security solutions to address either classified parts storage in unapproved storage containers or weaknesses in its process for ensuring that actions taken to correct security deficiencies are completed. LANL intends to use three management approaches to sustain the security improvements it has been able to achieve to this point over the long-term: (1) undertake management actions required of LANL under the Compliance Order issued by the Secretary of Energy as a result of the 2006 security incident, (2) develop a Contractor Assurance System to measure and improve LANL's performance and management, and (3) implement annual performance evaluation plans NNSA uses to measure LANL's performance and determine a contract award fee. These approaches contain weaknesses that raise doubts about their ability to sustain security improvements over the long-term. Specifically, the actions LANL has proposed to take to meet the terms of the Compliance Order are only short-term--with completion planned for December 2008. Further, according to LANL officials, the Contractor Assurance System is not fully deployed and the measures it includes may not be fully effective. Finally, the annual performance evaluation plans do not sufficiently reward improving long-term security program effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), located in Los Alamos, New  Mexico, is one of three national laboratories responsible for designing and  developing a safe, secure, and reliable nuclear weapons deterrent. In  addition to its nuclear weapons work, LANL also serves as a focal point  for nonproliferation and threat reduction activities, as well as chemical,  biological, and physics research. To carry out its programs, in fiscal year  2007 LANL had total budget authority of about $2.7 billion, with about $1.5  billion devoted to nuclear weapons work. It employs about 13,000  employees on a campus that covers approximately 40 square miles and  has 2,700 structures. LANL is overseen by the National Nuclear Security  Administration (NNSA), a separately organized agency within the  Department of Energy (DOE). NNSA is responsible for the management  and security of the nation\u2019s nuclear weapons, nuclear nonproliferation,  and naval reactors programs.", "To carry out its various missions, LANL employs a variety of classified  resources, including, among other things:    Category I special nuclear material, such as plutonium, which it uses to  manufacture parts for nuclear weapons and for research and development  activities;   millions of classified documents;    over 4,300 pieces of classified removable electronic media, such as CDs  and removable hard drives, which pose a security risk that requires the  maintenance of an accountability system to prevent unauthorized access  or removal;    about 60,000 classified parts used in nuclear weapons or for research and    111 vault-type rooms that house or store classified documents and  classified removable electronic media, classified parts, and classified  computer network infrastructure; and  five computer networks, one of which handles classified information.", "DOE requires that LANL maintain different levels of security for its  facilities depending on the type and amount of classified resources these  facilities store or house. The most basic level of security, known as a  Property Protection Area, provides safeguards to protect government  property against damage, destruction, and theft. These safeguards include,  for example, locks and keys, security guards, and signs prohibiting  trespassing. Classified resources may not be stored or housed in these  areas. The highest levels of security, known as Exclusion Areas, Protected  Areas, and Material Access Areas, provide safeguards to protect quantities  of Category I and II special nuclear material. These safeguards include, for  example, boundaries defined by fences and sensors that detect intrusion,  personnel and vehicle access controls and barriers, armed guards, and  alarms. In addition, some facilities, known as Sensitive Compartmented  Information Facilities, provide additional controls governing access to  classified intelligence information beyond those required by normal  management and safeguarding practices.", "Since 1999, LANL has experienced a number of high-profile security  incidents that were subject to congressional hearings. Many of these  incidents have focused on LANL\u2019s inability to account for and control  classified resources, as the following illustrate:  In 1999, a scientist transferred classified information from classified  computers onto unmarked disks and removed the disks from authorized  work areas.", "In 2000, two hard drives containing nuclear weapon design information  used by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team were temporarily lost.", "On several occasions in 2003 and 2004, the laboratory could not account  for classified removable electronic media.", "In October 2006, it was discovered that a contract employee had  transferred classified information to a USB \u201cthumb drive\u201d and removed the  thumb drive, as well as other classified documents, from the laboratory.", "In addition to these well-publicized incidents, security evaluations by  DOE\u2019s Office of Inspector General, DOE\u2019s Office of Independent  Oversight, NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos Site Office (Site Office), and GAO have  identified persistent, systemic security problems at LANL. These problems  include weaknesses in controlling and protecting classified resources,  inadequate controls over special nuclear material, inadequate self- assessment activities, and weaknesses in the process LANL uses to ensure  that it corrects identified security deficiencies. For example, DOE\u2019s Office  of Independent Oversight and the Site Office recently cited LANL for  weaknesses in its control and accountability system for special nuclear  material, including unreliable accounting when quantities are moved  within a facility. In addition, DOE\u2019s Office of Independent Oversight, the  NNSA Site Office, and the DOE Inspector General identified problems with  LANL\u2019s management of classified parts, including inadequate tracking and  storage of these parts. In July 2007, the DOE Office of Inspector General  found that LANL was still not tracking all of its classified parts and that it  lacked fundamental safeguards, such as regularly scheduled inventories  and segregation of duties, to ensure full and accurate accountability.  Finally, in January 2008, we reported that LANL has experienced 57  reported security incidents in recent years involving the compromise or  potential compromise of classified information and that 37 of these  incidents posed the most serious threat to U.S. national security interests.", "In response to these repeated problems, LANL and NNSA have taken a  variety of actions. For example, in 2004, the laboratory director shut down  operations for up to 10 months to deal, in part, with LANL\u2019s security  problems. In November 2005, we reported that the estimated cost of this  shutdown was as much as $370 million and that the shutdown delayed  important national security work. In addition, in 2005, after half a century  of laboratory management by the University of California, DOE opened the  LANL management and operating contract for competitive bidding. In  December 2005, Los Alamos National Security LLC (LANS), which is made  up of the University of California, Bechtel National, Washington Group  International, and BWX Technologies, was awarded the management and  operating contract for LANL. NNSA measures LANL\u2019s performance and  determines LANS\u2019s management and operating award fee using annual  performance evaluation plans, which establish NNSA\u2019s priorities for LANL  and ensure that contract requirements are met. After taking over  management of the laboratory in June 2006, LANS began a series of  initiatives that it believed would address security in a comprehensive and  integrated manner\u2014including consolidating its classified resources and  reducing the scope of its physical footprint. The new Contractor  Assurance System, which LANL is contractually required to implement,  provides the laboratory with a means of assessing its progress toward  meeting performance milestones, including security performance, and  bringing management attention to areas of concern. In July 2007, in  response to the October 2006 security incident, the Secretary of Energy  issued a compliance order directing LANL to implement specific  corrective actions to remediate management deficiencies that contributed  to the October 2006 incident, as well as to address long-standing  deficiencies in the laboratory\u2019s classified information programs.", "In this context, you asked us to (1) identify LANL\u2019s major programs and  activities; (2) determine the extent to which the major programs and  activities rely on classified resources to meet their objectives; (3) identify  the initiatives LANL is taking to consolidate its classified resources and  reduce the scope of its physical footprint; (4) determine if these initiatives  address previously identified security concerns; and (5) determine  whether new management approaches that LANL and NNSA are  implementing under the new contract will sustain security improvements  over the long-term. Separately, we are evaluating cyber security across the  DOE complex, including at LANL, and therefore did not include an  assessment of the effectiveness of LANL\u2019s cyber security program as part  of this review.", "To address these objectives, we analyzed documentation on DOE and  LANL budgets, programs, and activities; documentation on LANL\u2019s  classified resources and physical footprint reduction and consolidation  plans; NNSA Site Office security surveys and Office of Independent  Oversight security assessments from fiscal years 2000 to 2008; the LANS  management and operating contract; LANL\u2019s Contractor Assurance  System; DOE\u2019s 2007 Compliance Order; and NNSA\u2019s performance  evaluation plans for fiscal years 2007 and 2008. We also collected data on  LANL\u2019s programs in order to group them into categories and to identify the  facilities and classified resources associated with these program  categories. We performed a reliability assessment of these data and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this  report. Further, we conducted three visits to LANL and toured sites  proposed for consolidation, as well as vault-type rooms. Finally, we  conducted interviews with key security and program officials at LANL,  NNSA and its Site Office, DOE, and LANS. More details on our scope and  methodology can be found in appendix I.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["LANL is organized in a matrix that allows programs to draw on scientific,  engineering, and experimental capabilities from throughout the laboratory.  Programs are funded and managed out of LANL\u2019s 15 directorates, such as  Weapons Physics or Chemistry, Life and Earth Sciences, but LANL\u2019s  scientists and engineers work in 64 technical divisions that are discipline  specific. These technical divisions, such as Applied Physics or Biology,  accomplish the work of the laboratory and support its operations.  Program managers in the directorates fund work in the technical divisions  in order to meet milestones determined with NNSA or other work  sponsors. To this end, employees in the technical divisions may support  multiple programs with their work and may be called on to provide  specific expertise to different programs. LANL\u2019s facilities are managed by  its directorates and provide specific capabilities, such as high-performance  computers, LANL employees use for their work, as well as general office  and meeting space.", "When LANL was originally sited and constructed during the Manhattan  Project, according to laboratory officials, its infrastructure was  intentionally spread out as a safety and security precaution. What was  once a benefit now makes LANL\u2019s management and operation complex.  Spread across 40 square miles and including 155 miles of roads, 130 miles  of electrical transmission lines, 90 miles of gas transmission lines, and 9.4  million square feet of facility space, LANL employs 12,000 to 14,000 people  every day.", "LANL\u2019s approximately 2,700 structures are grouped together across the  laboratory into 49 major technical areas that include major scientific and  experimental facilities, environmental cleanup areas, and waste  management locations (see fig. 1). However spread out the technical  areas, LANL only considers less than 400 acres of its site to be highly  suited for development because of the difficulty of developing the site\u2019s  steep slopes and because of the need to maintain safety and security  buffers around specific work activities. The most heavily developed area  of the laboratory is Technical Area-3, LANL\u2019s core scientific and  administrative area, which accounts for half of the laboratory\u2019s employees  and total floor space.", "While individual scientific and engineering directorates within LANL are  responsible for managing and securing its facilities, multiple programs  across these organizations share facilities to accomplish their objectives.  For example, LANL\u2019s Chemistry and Metallurgy Research facility is  managed by LANL\u2019s Chemistry, Life and Earth Sciences directorate. The  facility, however, is occupied by over 500 employees to support a number  of programs across LANL that require its analytical chemistry and  materials property testing capabilities (see fig. 2). These programs include  manufacturing nuclear weapon pits, experimenting with nuclear fuels for  civilian energy production, and producing nuclear heat sources for  National Aeronautics and Space Administration missions.", "LANL\u2019s shared facilities are protected at different levels depending on the  type and amount of classified resources they house or store. DOE Manual  470.4-2, Physical Protection, defines these different levels and the types of  safeguards that must be in place to ensure that classified resources are  adequately protected. Table 1 summarizes these security levels and  appropriate safeguards from lowest to highest level of security.", "To determine the overall effectiveness of LANL\u2019s implementation of DOE  security requirements and the laboratory\u2019s security performance, two DOE  organizations periodically conduct independent reviews. DOE\u2019s Office of  Independent Oversight conducts assessments, typically every 18 months.  These assessments identify the weaknesses of LANL\u2019s security program  and produce findings that laboratory officials must take action to correct.  NNSA\u2019s Los Alamos Site Office is also required to conduct surveys  annually. These surveys are based on observations of performance,  including compliance with DOE and NNSA security directives. While the  two types of reviews differently categorize the topics and subtopics they  cover, the reviews overlap substantially. They both address security  program management, protective forces, physical security, classified  information protection, control and accountability of nuclear materials,  personnel security, and cyber security. Furthermore, they both use a color- coding system to rate each area of review as either Green (satisfactory or  effective), Yellow (marginal or needs improvement), or Red  (unsatisfactory or significant weakness). The results of these reviews  affect LANS\u2019s ability to earn its performance-based award fee for  successful management and operation of LANL.", "Under the contract between LANS and NNSA for the management and  operation of LANL, NNSA is to establish the work to be accomplished by  LANL, set requirements to be met, and provide performance direction for  what NNSA wants in each of its programs. NNSA does this by annually  issuing a performance evaluation plan that documents the process and  associated performance objectives, performance incentives, award term  incentives, and associated measures and targets for evaluating LANS\u2019s  performance. In the performance evaluation plans for fiscal years 2007 and  2008, performance objectives and award fee incentives were specifically  provided for security performance. LANL\u2019s contract requires the  development of a Contractor Assurance System to increase accountability  and improve management and performance. The Contractor Assurance  System, according to the LANL official responsible for its implementation,  is an integrated performance-based management system that is designed  to include independent assessment and that is available as a tool for  federal oversight. Notwithstanding the development of the Contractor  Assurance System, under the contract with LANS, NNSA preserves its  right to conduct direct oversight, particularly in the area of security.", "The Secretary of Energy has authority under 10 C.F.R. \u00a7 824.4(b) of DOE\u2019s  Procedural Rules for the Assessment of Civil Penalties for Classified  Information Security Violations to issue compliance orders that direct  management and operating contractors to take specific corrective actions  to remediate deficiencies that contributed to security violations regarding  classified information. On July 12, 2007, the Secretary of Energy issued a  compliance order to LANS as a result of the security incident uncovered in  October 2006 when a subcontractor employee removed classified  information from LANL without authorization. Analysis of the incident  identified numerous breakdowns in LANL\u2019s classified information  protection program and concluded that these breakdowns were caused, in  part, by poor security practices. The Compliance Order directs LANS to  take comprehensive steps to ensure that it identifies and addresses critical  classified information and cyber security deficiencies at LANL. These  steps must be completed by December 2008. Violation of the Compliance  Order would subject LANS to civil penalties of up to $100,000 per violation  per day until compliance is reached."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LANL Conducts Over 175 Program Activities That Fall into Three Major and Two Support Program Categories", "paragraphs": ["LANL has three major program categories\u2014Nuclear Weapons Science,  Threat Reduction Science and Support, and Fundamental Science and  Energy.

Because the United States stopped  conducting underground nuclear weapon tests in 1992, LANL weapons  scientists and engineers are involved in hundreds of research projects in  programs aimed at developing strong physics modeling and predictive  capabilities that provide information about nuclear weapons\u2019  performance. Of particular focus since 2001 has been the development of a  common methodology, known as \u201cQuantification of Margins and  Uncertainties,\u201d for quantifying critical design and engineering factors  during the operation of a nuclear weapon and the margin for these factors  above which the weapons could fail to perform as designed.  Furthermore, LANL is involved in two ongoing life extension programs, for  the W76 and B61, which are efforts to refurbish aging weapons and extend  their lifetimes for 20 to 30 years. In addition, LANL builds, operates, and  maintains the infrastructure necessary to carry out its nuclear weapons  mission and to support other laboratory missions.", "In fiscal year 2007, LANL conducted work on 41 Nuclear Weapons Science  programs supported by about 3,400 FTEs and with a budget from NNSA of  about $1.5 billion, which represented over half of LANL\u2019s total budget and  approximately 87 percent of the funds received from NNSA for all of  LANL\u2019s major program categories.

These findings related to  improper marking of classified parts with their appropriate classification  level and storage of classified parts in containers and facilities that are  considered nonstandard, or out of compliance with DOE rules governing  classified resource storage. These rules include requirements for building  alarms, frequency of security guard patrols, and facility vulnerability  assessments. Furthermore, the DOE Inspector General reviewed LANL\u2019s  management of classified parts in 2007 and had additional findings about  the inventory systems used to maintain accountability over classified  parts. While LANL has not resolved issues related to nonstandard storage  (see discussion in a subsequent section of this report), LANL officials told  us that by destroying nearly 30,000 classified parts at the laboratory, they  have established a goal to reduce the number of nonstandard storage  facilities from 24 to 0 by the end of August 2008.

The Site Office noted that despite the  existence of LANL procedures for regularly reviewing classified  inventories to reduce them to the minimum necessary, routine review and  reduction of classified inventories was not occurring. While other surveys  and assessments did not discuss this finding, LANL\u2019s current initiatives to  reduce accountable and nonaccountable documents and classified  removable electronic media, which began in 2003, have significantly  reduced holdings, and future classified holdings reduction targets are  being developed.", "Through engineered controls, LANL is also attempting to limit the ability  and the need to create new classified removable electronic media and to  make the information previously stored on removable media available  through the laboratory\u2019s classified computer network. Specifically, to  prevent the creation of new media, LANL is removing functions on  classified computers that would allow media to be created or copied and  is deploying new classified computing systems that do not contain the  capability to create removable electronic media. In addition, LANL has  undertaken an effort to upload the information stored on classified  removable electronic media to the laboratory\u2019s classified computer  network before the media are either destroyed or permanently archived.  LANL officials said this will reduce the risk that media could be  mishandled, thus improving the laboratory\u2019s physical security. However,  LANL officials also acknowledged that transferring information from  classified media to a classified network represents a shift from physical  security risk to cyber security risk.

LANL management reviews all nonstandard storage  requests, and requests are approved by LANL\u2019s Physical Security group.", "The approval process requires LANL to conduct risk assessments for these  nonstandard storage areas.", "While the Site Office has never independently raised concerns about the  adequacy of nonstandard storage areas in its surveys, the Office of  Independent Oversight has consistently called attention to this issue.  Specifically, in fiscal years 2003, 2007, and 2008, the Office of Independent  Oversight noted problems with the safeguards LANL said were in place to  protect nonstandard storage areas and questioned the risk assessment  methodology LANL has used to determine appropriate protections. In  2007, the Chief of DOE\u2019s Office of Health, Safety and Security, which  oversees independent assessments, testified that LANL is overly  dependent on nonstandard storage for the protection of many of its  classified nuclear weapon parts and that the overall impact of deficiencies  in nonstandard storage arrangements on the protection of these parts is  substantial. LANL officials told us their goal is to eliminate all 24  nonstandard storage areas at the laboratory by August 2008 and, in the  interim, continue to apply for waivers to rules governing standardized  storage through the Site Office\u2019s approval process. However, LANL\u2019s plans  for eliminating specific nonstandard storage areas show the elimination of  one area planned for the second quarter of fiscal year 2009\u2014as much as  seven months later than LANL\u2019s August 2008 goal\u2014and four others that  will remain nonstandard storage areas. Furthermore, a recent status report  on nonstandard storage area elimination activities showed that nearly all  activities were at risk of schedule delay.", "Process for ensuring that corrective actions are completed. When  evaluations result in findings of security deficiencies, LANL must prepare  a corrective action plan that charts a path forward for resolving the  finding. To resolve a deficiency and complete its corrective action plan,  DOE requires LANL to conduct a root-cause analysis, risk assessment, and  cost-benefit analysis to ensure that the corrective action implemented  truly resolves the deficiency identified. In fiscal year 2007, the Office of  Independent Oversight questioned the completeness of corrective action  plans\u2014some of which did not include the required risk assessments\u2014 leading to concerns about whether actions taken to address security  deficiencies would in fact prevent recurrence. This concern is similar to  our 2003 finding that corrective action plans are often inconsistent with  DOE requirements. The fiscal year 2008 Office of Independent Oversight  assessment noted that weaknesses in corrective action plans\u2019 causal  analyses remain. Specifically, the Office of Independent Oversight found  that some corrective action plans\u2019 root-cause analyses were insufficient to  properly identify security deficiencies. According to LANL officials, in  fiscal year 2008, LANL revised its self-assessment program to ensure that  root-cause analyses are included in all corrective action plans and that  these plans are sufficient.", "In fiscal year 2007 the Site Office and the Office of Independent Oversight  raised concerns about the timeliness of LANL\u2019s submission of corrective  action plans and the length of time it takes to close corrective action plans  by resolving findings. The fiscal year 2007 Performance Evaluation Plan  that NNSA developed to establish priorities for the laboratory provided  LANS with financial incentives totaling over $1 million to complete LANL\u2019s  corrective actions on schedule. While the Site Office noted significant  improvement in the timeliness and closure of corrective action plans in its  fiscal year 2007 survey, LANL did not meet the fiscal year 2007  performance milestone. NNSA\u2019s fiscal year 2008 Performance Evaluation  Plan provides LANS with a $100,000 financial incentive to improve the  timeliness of corrective action plan development and up to an additional  $357,000 to close corrective action plans quickly and on time.", "Inadequate self-assessment. Concerns about the adequacy of LANL\u2019s  assessments of its own security performance were raised by the Site  Office in fiscal years 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007 and by DOE\u2019s Office of  Independent Oversight in fiscal year 2008. These concerns related to the  comprehensiveness of LANL\u2019s self-assessments, the extent to which self- assessments included discussion of all internal findings, and the extent to  which these findings were analyzed and addressed through corrective  actions. NNSA provided LANS with a nearly $600,000 financial incentive  under the fiscal year 2007 Performance Evaluation Plan to improve LANL\u2019s  self-assessment program. According to NNSA\u2019s evaluation of LANL\u2019s fiscal  year 2007 performance, LANL did not meet NNSA\u2019s goal but did make  progress toward it by significantly improving self-assessment. The Office  of Independent Oversight\u2019s fiscal year 2008 assessment also noted  improvements but recommended further areas for attention. These  recommendations included ensuring that self-assessments address all  aspects of each assessment topic, such as classified information  protection and physical security.

While LANL has  not reported any incidents involving the loss or diversion of special  nuclear material in recent years, the Site Office and Office of Independent  Oversight raised concerns in fiscal years 2002, 2003, 2005, 2006, and 2007  related to LANL\u2019s system. Such concerns included the absence of controls  in MASS to detect internal transfers of nuclear materials that could result  in safeguards category limits being exceeded in time to prevent the  transfer.

Additionally, the  initiative focuses on facilities that have no enduring mission need, thus  avoiding future operations costs. While the footprint reduction plans put  together by LANL\u2019s Weapons Physics and Weapons Engineering  directorates both state that security improvements would result from  facility reduction, LANL officials responsible for setting priorities for  reducing facilities told us that the facilities\u2019 security problems were not  seriously considered when planning for footprint reduction. In that regard,  we found that of the 77 facilities LANL counted toward meeting its  footprint reduction goal of 400,000 square feet in fiscal year 2007, only 2  facilities contained any classified resources.

Similarly, NNSA\u2019s Office of  Defense Nuclear Security noted in 2007 that after each security incident at  LANL, the laboratory has responded by changing policies and procedures  and investing in new equipment and systems. The result, according to the  Office of Defense Nuclear Security, had been a steady improvement in  security through mitigation of immediate problems; however, the inability  to halt what NNSA has characterized as a string of incidents involving the  failure to account for classified information demonstrated that LANL had  not identified and addressed the root causes of security incidents. In its  own analysis of the October 2006 security incident, LANL determined that  the incident\u2019s root cause was inconsistent and ineffective implementation  of Integrated Safeguards and Security Management principles in its  classified work, despite the fact that a DOE policy governing  implementation of Integrated Safeguards and Security Management  throughout the DOE complex had been in place since at least 2001.", "In acknowledging the problem of sustaining security improvements, LANL  officials described three management approaches they intend to use to  ensure that security improvements currently being implemented are  sustained over the long-term: (1) DOE\u2019s July 2007 Compliance Order, (2)  LANL\u2019s Contractor Assurance System, and (3) NNSA\u2019s annual performance  evaluation plans.

Of these seven critical security issues, five pertain to the physical security  of classified information and resources. These five issues include the  following:    LANL has not consistently or effectively implemented the principles and  functions of Integrated Safeguards and Security Management in the  management of classified work;   LANL\u2019s classified information security training is not fully effective;    LANL has not provided effective leadership and management in protecting  classified information;    LANL\u2019s assurance system has not effectively resolved classified  information protection issues; and   LANL has not, in some cases, effectively sustained corrective actions.", "The majority of the actions LANL outlined in its plan to address these  issues are discrete, rather than representing long-term efforts aimed at  improving LANL\u2019s overall security performance.

First, LANL officials told us that the system will not be fully  developed or implemented by the time LANL completes its Compliance  Order efforts in December 2008. Second, an internal assessment of the  Contractor Assurance System found that (1) there is a lack of evidence  that the system is being effectively deployed across the laboratory and (2)  the measures included in the system may not be meaningful.", "LANL is designing the Contractor Assurance System to measure and track  performance from the top down. Top-level measures, such as meeting  program milestones set by NNSA or on-time delivery of products, are in  place. Lower-level measures, such as measures of the work processes used  to meet milestones and deliverables, are still in development. LANL  officials responsible for designing the Contractor Assurance System told  us that these lower-level measures are critical to the success of the system  because they will provide the data that indicate where work processes are  breaking down before milestones or deliverables are delayed. Officials  also said that trend analysis from data associated with lower-level  measures would indicate areas where security concerns are developing.  During fiscal year 2008, LANL officials said they plan to focus on  developing lower-level measures, but they will not complete these  measures by December 2008. A senior official in NNSA\u2019s Site Office told us  it could be another 3 to 4 years before the Contractor Assurance System is  fully implemented.", "In its first internal assessment of the Contractor Assurance System  completed in September 2007, LANL found that while the system was  operational and met the requirements of the contract between NNSA and  LANS, it contained significant weaknesses. For example, while upper-level  management uses the system, there are gaps in its use across LANL\u2019s  technical divisions and facilities. According to the assessment, these gaps  could make the system ineffective. In addition, a LANL official told us that  while managers are required to attend training on using the system, many  do not yet recognize its usefulness.

According to NNSA\u2019s Site Office, the two sets of  measures complement each other and allow NNSA to withhold incentive  fees when its expectations for effective management and leadership are  not met. Site Office officials told us it is possible LANL could achieve  success in all of the objective security measures but fail to earn award fees  on the basis of its performance assessed with subjective measures.", "We found that the objective measures included in the performance  evaluation plans reward LANL for complying with existing DOE security  requirements but do not sufficiently reward LANL for improving its  security performance. Of the $51.3 million potentially available for LANS\u2019s  total performance-based incentive fee in fiscal year 2008, only $1.43  million is associated with objective measures of security performance. Of  this total, $1.4 million is an incentive for compliance with DOE security  requirements, and only $30,000 is allocated to forward-looking and  laboratorywide security improvement. According to a senior NNSA  security official, compliance with DOE requirements does not assure that  LANL\u2019s security program is functioning effectively, and actions to achieve  compliance may not be valuable unless the actions also address  management or operational needs. Specifically, in fiscal year 2008, we  found the following objective provisions:    $800,000 to achieve the milestones LANL sets in an annual security  operating plan, which aligns LANL\u2019s security activities with its budget. The  fiscal year 2008 annual security operating plan provides a roadmap for  LANL security program compliance with DOE requirements and includes  milestones such as submitting the Site Safeguards and Security Plan,  conducting security training, publishing security policy, completing  quarterly equipment maintenance requirements, and conducting  inventories of special nuclear material.    $200,000 to achieve an overall satisfactory rating on the Site Office\u2019s  annual security survey.    $400,000 to achieve 90 percent of the milestones associated with the  ongoing Phase 2 Nuclear Materials Safeguards and Security Upgrade  construction project.    $30,000 to develop a forward-looking Safeguards and Security  Modernization Plan, which according to a senior Site Office official, is in  progress.

The entire $2.7  million encouraged LANL to comply with existing DOE requirements for  effective security operations. LANL earned $2.4 million of the $2.7 million  potentially available, despite the occurrence of the October 2006 security  incident.", "NNSA increased the potential performance award fee associated with  subjective measures for laboratory performance in fiscal year 2007 as a  result of the October 2006 security incident and also included subjective  measures in the fiscal year 2008 Performance Evaluation Plan. These  measures evaluate LANS\u2019s leadership in integrating programs, including  security, across the laboratory and achieving exemplary overall laboratory  performance. We found that these measures are neither compliance-based  nor forward-looking, but rather focus on overall quality of performance. In  fiscal year 2007, LANL received its lowest performance rating in this  category, earning only 35 percent of the over $10 million potentially  available. LANL\u2019s low performance rating directly reflected the occurrence  of the October 2006 security incident. In fiscal year 2008, the award fee  potentially available for successful achievement of subjective measures is  $10.3 million, approximately $125,000 more than in fiscal year 2007. One of  the 20 criteria NNSA will consider in determining the fiscal year 2008  award fee in this area is specific to overall performance, timeliness, and  effectiveness of security commitments.

We reported that these factors  contributed to weakness in NNSA\u2019s oversight of security at its laboratories  and production facilities. During the course of this review, senior Los  Alamos Site Office officials confirmed that these problems persist. For  example, they said NNSA has not developed a strategy for determining  long-term staffing needs at the Site Office. As of October 2007, the Site  Office employed 13 security staff\u2014enough for one person to oversee each  of the topical areas the Site Office had to evaluate. This staffing level,  officials said, was sufficient to cover only 15 percent of LANL\u2019s facilities.  More recently, a senior security official at the Site Office said security  staffing levels have decreased since October 2007.

In addition, some important security problems  identified in external evaluations have not been fully addressed. Moreover,  our review pointed out the potential for cyber security risks to increase as  a result of actions to improve physical security. Consequently, while LANL  security officials have indicated their desire to prevent future security  incidents, we believe that only a long-term, integrated strategy can help  ensure that they will succeed.", "Continuously implementing security improvement initiatives over the long- term and proactively addressing new security risks also requires an  effective process for assessing contractor performance on security  activities. We believe the relative immaturity of and weaknesses in the  management approaches LANL and NNSA intend to use to ensure that  security improvements are sustained may limit their effectiveness and  result in a failure to sustain security improvement initiatives. Specifically,  DOE\u2019s Compliance Order requires LANL to take immediate actions to  improve security deficiencies, but the Compliance Order does not serve as  a tool for ensuring these actions are sustained. In addition, we have doubts  that LANL\u2019s Contractor Assurance System can sustain security  improvement initiatives until it is sufficiently mature, which may take  several years. Therefore, we believe performance evaluation plans hold  the most promise for ensuring that security initiatives are sustained over  the long-term. When the LANL management and operating contract was  competed in 2005, laboratory security was a key consideration. NNSA  stated that it intended to put a contract in place, along with an annual  performance evaluation plan, that would communicate its priorities and  provide incentives to accomplish those priorities. However, despite  NNSA\u2019s persistent statements about the importance of security, we believe  that the performance evaluation plans that NNSA has issued under the  new LANS contract do not provide meaningful financial incentives for  strategic security improvements or communicate to LANL that security is  a top federal priority. Rather than reward LANL for principally complying  with current DOE security requirements, in our view, financial incentives  in performance evaluation plans should be focused on the long-term  improvement of security program effectiveness to a greater extent. We  believe that LANL needs to develop a strategic plan for laboratory security  that is comprehensive, contains solutions to address all previously  identified security findings, takes an integrated view of physical and cyber  security, provides opportunities for periodic updates to ensure additional  security risks are identified and addressed, and is tied to meaningful  performance incentive fees.", "Finally, as LANL plans for further reductions in its facility footprint, it has  an opportunity to assess facilities\u2019 security weaknesses, as well as their  deferred maintenance burdens and their anticipated contributions to  future program missions, when it first determines which facilities should  be reduced.

We compared the facilities LANL had selected with  the original real property list and agreed the 633 facilities selected by  LANL represented the appropriate facilities for our analysis.", "Using the data collection instrument we had provided, LANL officials  entered information on (1) the security protection level of each of the 633  facilities, as described by DOE Manual 470.4-2, Physical Protection, which  defines different levels of security depending on the type and amount of  classified resources these facilities store or house; (2) the types of  classified resources housed or stored in each facility; (3) where practical,  how many of each type of classified resource each facility stores or  houses; (4) which of the laboratory\u2019s major and support programs rely on  the classified resources in each facility; and (5) how much space each of  the laboratory\u2019s major and support programs use in each facility as a  percentage of that facility\u2019s gross square footage.", "We analyzed the data by aggregating facilities by program and apportioned  classified resource usage according to three categories: (1) a program is  the exclusive user of all of the space in a facility storing or housing  classified resources, (2) a program is the primary user of space in a facility  storing or housing classified resources because it uses more space than  any of the other major or support programs at LANL, and (3) a program  uses some space in a facility storing or housing classified resources.  Because our analysis focused on facilities used for one of LANL\u2019s three  major programs, we excluded facilities only used by laboratory support  programs, resulting in final analysis of 607 of the original 633 facilities.", "To evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the information LANL  officials provided, we compared the data with other documentary and  testimonial evidence we collected during the course of our review to  ensure that the data were consistent. For example, we had received  briefings about the reduction of vault-type rooms at LANL, and we ensured  that the total number of vault-type rooms LANL program managers had  discussed with us during these briefings matched the total number of  vault-type rooms identified in the facility data LANL provided. In addition,  we compared the data provided on the security levels of specific facilities  with our physical observations of security safeguards at these same  facilities during site visits to determine whether the data LANL officials  provided were consistent with our experiences at those facilities. We also  conducted logic and electronic tests of the data and followed up with  LANL officials to resolve discrepancies. We determined that these data  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To identify the initiatives LANL is taking to consolidate its classified  resources and reduce the scope of its physical footprint, we collected and  reviewed data on LANL\u2019s plans for consolidating classified resources and  interviewed key LANL, National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA),  and DOE officials. We also toured LANL facilities that house and store  classified resources, such as vault-type rooms and the super vault-type  room, and visited a facility where classified nuclear weapon parts are  being destroyed. In addition, we identified the buildings that LANL was  proposing to close as part of its footprint reduction effort and, using the  information provided by LANL officials in response to our data collection  instrument, determined whether closing these buildings could improve  LANL\u2019s security posture by eliminating or consolidating the classified  resources that may have been stored or housed in them as a result of  footprint reduction. Finally, we visited sites currently undergoing closure  and sites proposed for consolidation and reduction.", "To determine if LANL\u2019s security initiatives address previously identified  security concerns, we reviewed security evaluations conducted by DOE\u2019s  Office of Independent Oversight and NNSA\u2019s Site Office from fiscal years  2000 to 2008 and identified the security concerns raised by these  evaluations. We then compared LANL\u2019s current initiatives with the results  of our review of the security evaluations to determine if all of the security  concerns were being addressed. We discussed the results of this analysis  with DOE, NNSA headquarters, NNSA Site Office, and LANL contractor  officials. In addition, we reviewed relevant DOE Office of Inspector  General reports.", "To determine whether the management approach LANL is implementing  under the new LANS contract is sufficient to ensure that LANL\u2019s security  improvement initiatives are fully implemented and sustainable, we asked  LANL and NNSA to identify how they intended to sustain security  improvements and ensure the effectiveness of LANL\u2019s security. We  reviewed the management approaches they identified, specifically (1)  LANL\u2019s actions in response to DOE\u2019s July 2007 Compliance Order resulting  from the October 2006 security incident, (2) the security-related aspects of  the new Contractor Assurance System LANL is implementing, and (3) the  incentives being used to improve security at LANL under the 2007 and  2008 Performance Evaluation Plans. As part of this review, we determined  the extent to which each of these management approaches could sustain  security improvement initiatives over the long-term and the extent to  which these management approaches focused on either compliance with  DOE security requirements or improved effectiveness of LANL\u2019s security  program. We discussed these management approaches with LANL, NNSA  headquarters, and NNSA Site Office officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from March 2007 to June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: LANL\u2019s NNSA Supported Nuclear Weapons Science Programs", "paragraphs": ["LANL conducted work on 41 Nuclear Weapons Science programs in fiscal  year 2007, all of which were supported by NNSA.
