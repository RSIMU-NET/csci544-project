GAO was asked to review the options and associated costs for removing SSNs from the Medicare card. This report (1) describes the various options for removing the SSN from Medicare cards; (2) examines the potential benefits and burdens associated with different options; and (3) examines CMS\u0092s cost estimates for removing SSNs from Medicare cards.", "To do this work, GAO reviewed CMS\u0092s report, cost estimates, and relevant supporting documentation. GAO also interviewed officials from CMS and other agencies that perform Medicare related activities (the Social Security Administration and Railroad Retirement Board), as well as officials from DOD and VA, which have undertaken SSN removal efforts. GAO also interviewed private health insurance companies and relevant stakeholder groups."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services\u0092 (CMS) 2011 report to Congress proposed three options for removing Social Security numbers (SSN) from Medicare cards. One option would truncate the SSN displayed on the card, but beneficiaries and providers would continue to rely on the SSN. The other two options would replace the SSN with a new identifier that would be displayed on the card and either be used only by beneficiaries, or by both beneficiaries and those who provide Medicare services. CMS, however, has not selected or committed to implementing any of these options. The Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA), and private insurers have already removed or taken steps to remove SSNs from display on their identification or health insurance cards.", "CMS\u0092s option to replace the SSN with a new identifier for use by both beneficiaries and providers offers the greatest protection against identity theft. Beneficiaries\u0092 vulnerability to identity theft would be reduced because the card would no longer display the SSN and providers would not need the SSN to provide services or submit claims (negating the need for providers to store the SSN). This option would also pose fewer burdens than the other two options because beneficiaries would not have to remember an SSN to receive services or to interact with CMS. Providers also would not need to conduct additional activities, such as querying a CMS database, to obtain the SSN. The burdens for CMS would generally be similar across all the options, but CMS reported that this option would require more information technology (IT) system modifications.", "CMS reported that each of the three options would cost over $800 million to implement, and that the option to replace the SSN with a new identifier for use by both beneficiaries and providers would be somewhat more expensive, largely because of the IT modifications. However, the methodology and assumptions CMS used to develop its estimates raise questions about their reliability. For example, CMS did not use appropriate guidance, such as GAO\u0092s cost-estimating guidance, when preparing the estimates to ensure their reliability. Additionally, CMS could provide only limited documentation related to how it developed the estimates for the two largest cost areas, both of which involve modifications to IT systems."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS (1) select an approach for removing SSNs from Medicare cards that best protects beneficiaries from identity theft and minimizes burdens for providers, beneficiaries, and CMS and (2) develop an accurate, well-documented cost estimate for such an option.

SSA had a technical comment."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 48 million Medicare cards display Social Security numbers  (SSN). Thieves can steal the information from these cards to commit  various acts of identity theft, such as opening bank or credit card  accounts or receiving medical services in a beneficiary\u2019s name. In 2010,   7 percent of households in the United States, or about 8.6 million  households, had at least one member age 12 or older who experienced  identity theft, according to U.S. Department of Justice figures. The  estimated financial cost of identity theft during that time was  approximately $13.3 billion. Additionally, theft of this information could  result from a data breach\u2014the unauthorized disclosure of a beneficiary\u2019s  personally identifiable information. Between September 2009 and March  2012, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Office for  Civil Rights identified over 400 reports of provider data breaches involving  protected health information that each affected more than 500  individuals.", "The SSN is displayed on Medicare cards, and it is the main component of  the health insurance claim number (HICN). The Social Security  Administration (SSA) and the Railroad Retirement Board (RRB) assign  the HICNs to eligible Medicare beneficiaries. HHS\u2019s Centers for Medicare  & Medicaid Services (CMS) administers the Medicare program, and  relies on the HICN for numerous Medicare purposes. For example, CMS  requires beneficiaries to provide the HICN to document eligibility for  Medicare services; requires providers to use the number to bill for  services; and uses the number and claims information to analyze  Medicare\u2019s performance and conduct program integrity efforts. Each  beneficiary is issued a Medicare card that prominently displays the HICN,  and CMS advises beneficiaries to carry this card with them at all times  and show this card to medical providers when receiving services. As we  have reported, however, the explicit display and use of the SSN poses a  threat of identity theft.", "The importance of enhancing security protections for SSN display and  use has resulted in multiple actions by federal and state governments and  the private sector. For example, SSA has advised for years that  individuals not carry their Social Security card with them. In 2007, the  Office of Management and Budget issued a directive to all federal  agencies to develop a plan for reducing the unnecessary use of SSNs  and exploring alternatives to their use. Many federal agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DOD) and Veterans Affairs (VA), have  taken significant steps to remove SSNs from their health insurance and  identification cards. In the private sector, health insurers have also  removed SSNs from their insurance cards in an effort to comply with state  laws and protect beneficiaries from identity theft.", "In 2004, we reported that CMS determined it would be cost-prohibitive to  remove the SSN from the Medicare card. In a 2006 report to Congress,  CMS highlighted an option for removing the SSN from the Medicare card  and estimated it would cost over $300 million to do so. In 2010,  members of Congress asked CMS to update that report in light of the fact  that CMS had not taken actions to remove SSNs from Medicare cards.  CMS subsequently issued a report in November 2011. You asked that  we review CMS\u2019s 2011 report, including the options it presented for  removing the SSN from Medicare cards and the estimated costs. In  addition, you asked that we examine the lessons learned from DOD and  VA\u2019s efforts to remove SSNs from their insurance cards.

We  interviewed officials from CMS, SSA, and RRB. To obtain a broader  perspective on efforts to remove SSNs from health insurance and  identification cards, we interviewed officials from DOD, VA, and the  following relevant stakeholders: three private health insurers that  implemented efforts to remove SSNs from their cards; a provider association for physician group practices; a health insurance industry  association; and a membership organization for people age 50 and older,  a population that would be significantly affected by the removal of SSNs  from Medicare cards.", "To examine the potential benefits and burdens of the options CMS  proposed for removing SSNs from Medicare cards, we interviewed  officials from CMS to obtain more information about the options presented  in its report.

During our interviews with  private health insurers and other stakeholders, we obtained information  about the benefits and burdens faced by providers and beneficiaries  when removing SSNs from health insurance cards. We assessed the  options presented by CMS based on the following criteria: (1) maximized  protection against identity theft; and (2) minimized burdens on  beneficiaries, providers, and CMS. These criteria were developed based  on prior GAO work on identity theft and informed by information from  CMS\u2019s 2011 report and interviews with CMS officials and others.", "To examine CMS\u2019s cost estimates for removing SSNs from Medicare  cards, we interviewed officials at CMS, SSA, and RRB to obtain details  about the development of the cost estimates, including the methods and  underlying assumptions used to derive them. We also interviewed officials  from DOD and VA to obtain information on the costs to those agencies  related to their initiatives to remove SSNs from DOD and VA identification  cards. When interviewing relevant stakeholders, we obtained information  about the costs associated with switching from an SSN-based to a non- SSN based identifier on their health insurance cards, to the extent such  information was available. In addition, as part of our assessment of  CMS\u2019s cost estimates, we used GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and Assessment  Guide, as appropriate. This guide identifies best practices that should  be followed to ensure that a reliable cost estimate is comprehensive, well- documented, accurate, and credible.

The Medicare card is used as proof of eligibility for both of these  programs. Part C is Medicare Advantage, under which beneficiaries  receive benefits through private health plans. Part D is the Medicare  outpatient prescription drug benefit. CMS requires that cards issued by  Part C and Part D health plans do not display an SSN.", "For most individuals, SSA determines eligibility for Medicare and assigns  the individual\u2019s HICN. However, for the approximately 550,000 Railroad  Retirement beneficiaries and their dependents, the RRB determines  Medicare eligibility and assigns this number.

In most cases, the SSN  on the card is the card holder\u2019s own; however, approximately 14 percent  of Medicare beneficiaries have cards that contain the SSN of the family  member whose work history makes the beneficiary eligible for Medicare  benefits.", "A unique identifier is an essential component for administering health  insurance. Such an identifier is used by providers to identify beneficiaries  and submit claims for payment. As Medicare\u2019s primary unique identifier,  the HICN is used by beneficiaries, providers, and CMS and its  contractors. State Medicaid programs, which are jointly funded federal- state health care programs that cover certain low-income individuals, use  the HICN to coordinate payments for dual-eligible beneficiaries\u2014 individuals who are enrolled in both Medicare and Medicaid.

CMS officials told us that they limited their  options to those retaining the basic format of the current paper card, and  did not consider other options that they believed were outside the scope  of the congressional request. For example, CMS did not consider using  machine-readable technologies, such as bar codes or magnetic stripes.", "Option 1: Truncating the SSN: Under this option, the first five digits  of the SSN would be replaced with \u2018X\u2019s (e.g., XXX-XX-1234) for  display on the card. However, the full SSN would continue to be used  for all Medicare business processes. As a result, when interacting with  CMS, beneficiaries would need to recall the full SSN or provide  additional personally identifiable information in order for CMS to  match the beneficiary with his or her records. To interact with CMS,  providers would also need to obtain the complete SSN using an  existing resource. This would involve querying an existing database,  calling a CMS help line, or asking the beneficiary for the complete  SSN or other personally identifiable information.", "Option 2: Developing a New Identifier for Beneficiary Use: Under  this option, the SSN would be replaced by a new identifier not based  on the SSN that would be displayed on the card, similar to private  health insurance cards. CMS refers to this new identifier as the  Medicare Beneficiary Identifier (MBI). This number would be used by  beneficiaries when interacting with CMS. Providers, however, would  be required to continue to use the SSN when interacting with CMS  and conducting their business processes. To obtain this information,  providers would be expected to electronically request it from CMS  using the new identifier. CMS said it would need to create a new  database for this purpose.", "Option 3: Developing a New Identifier for Beneficiary and  Provider Use: Under this option, the SSN would be replaced by a  new identifier not based on the SSN, which would be displayed on the  card. As in option 2, CMS referred to this number as the MBI. In  contrast to option 2, however, this new number would be used by both  beneficiaries and providers for all interactions with CMS. Under this  option, the SSN would no longer be used by beneficiaries or providers  when interacting with CMS, which could eliminate the need for  providers to collect or keep the SSN on file.

However, the level and type of modifications required to IT  systems vary under each option. These systems are responsible for  various business functions that perform claims processing, eligibility  verification, health plan enrollment, coordination of benefits, program  integrity, and research efforts. According to CMS, between 40 and 48 of  its IT systems would require modifications, depending on the option  selected. The truncated SSN option would require modifications to 40  systems; the option that uses a new identifier for beneficiary use would  require modifications to 44 systems; and the option that uses a new  identifier for beneficiary and provider use would require modifications to  48 systems.", "In its 2011 report, CMS estimated that any of the 3 proposed options  would likely take up to 4 years to implement. During the first 3 years,  CMS would coordinate with stakeholders; complete necessary IT system  conversions; conduct provider and beneficiary outreach and education;  and conduct training of business partners. In the fourth year, CMS would  issue new Medicare cards to all beneficiaries over a 12-month period.", "CMS officials stated that the agency could not implement any of the  options without additional funding from Congress.

Complete removal of the  SSN from the Medicare card would protect beneficiaries from identity theft  in the event that a card is lost or stolen. However, like the truncation  option, beneficiaries may have difficulty recalling their SSN at the time of  service or when interacting with CMS. This could also be difficult because  the SSN needed to show eligibility may not be the beneficiary\u2019s own. In  addition, providers would likely need to change their administrative  processes to obtain the needed information either by querying a  database, calling CMS, or obtaining it directly from the beneficiary.  Finally, because providers would still need to collect and store the SSN  for eligibility verification and claims submission, beneficiaries would  remain vulnerable to identity theft in the event of a provider data breach.

Other  significant cost areas for CMS include reissuing the Medicare card,  conducting outreach and education to beneficiaries about the change to  the identifier, and responding to beneficiary inquires related to the new  card.", "Both SSA and RRB would also incur costs under each of the options  described in CMS\u2019s 2011 report. SSA estimated that implementing any  of the three options presented in the 2011 report would cost the agency  $95 million. SSA\u2019s primary costs included $62 million for responding to  inquiries and requests for new Medicare cards from beneficiaries and   $28 million for processing new cards mailed by CMS that are returned as  undeliverable. SSA officials told us that even though CMS would be  responsible for distributing new Medicare cards, SSA anticipated that  about 13 percent of the beneficiary population would contact SSA with  questions. RRB\u2019s costs totaled between $1.1 million and $1.3 million.  Between 21 and 34 percent of RRB\u2019s total costs were related to IT  system updates and changes, depending on the option. The rest of  RRB\u2019s costs were related to business functions, such as printing and  mailing new cards; user costs related to system and procedure changes;  and education and outreach.", "The cost estimates included in CMS\u2019s 2011 report were as much as   2.5 times higher than those estimated in its 2006 report to Congress.", "CMS attributed these increases to the inclusion of costs not included in  the 2006 report, such as those associated with changes to state Medicaid  systems and changes to its IT systems related to Part D, as well as a  more thorough accounting of costs associated with many of the other cost  areas, including SSA costs. In addition, CMS said in its 2006 report that  phasing in a new identifier for beneficiaries over a 5- to 10-year period  would reduce costs. However, in its 2011 report, CMS stated that such an  option would be cost prohibitive because it would require running two  parallel IT systems for an extended period of time."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Methods and Assumptions CMS Used to Derive Cost Estimates Raise Questions about Their Reliability", "paragraphs": ["There are several key concerns regarding the methods and assumptions  CMS used to develop its cost estimates that raise questions about the  reliability of its overall cost estimates. First, CMS did not use any cost  estimating guidance when developing its estimates. GAO\u2019s Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide identifies a number of best practices  designed to ensure a cost estimate is reliable. However, CMS officials  acknowledged that the agency did not rely on any specific cost-estimating  guidance, such as GAO\u2019s cost-estimating guidance, during the  development of the cost estimates presented in the agency\u2019s report to  Congress. The agency also did not conduct a complete life-cycle cost  estimate on relevant costs, such as those associated with IT system  conversions. CMS officials told us they did not conduct a full life-cycle  cost estimate for each option because this was a hypothetical analysis,  and doing so would have been too resource intensive for the purpose of  addressing policy options.", "Second, the procedures used to develop estimates for the two largest  cost categories\u2014changes to existing state Medicaid IT systems and  CMS\u2019s IT system conversions\u2014are questionable and not well  documented. For each of CMS\u2019s options, the agency estimated Medicaid   Given the size of this cost category,  IT changes would cost $290 million. we have concerns about the age of the data, the number of states used to  generalize these estimates, as well as the completeness of the  information CMS collected. For example, CMS\u2019s estimates for costs  associated with its proposed changes were based on data collected in  2008, at which time the agency had not developed all of the options   In addition, while CMS asked for cost data  presented in its 2011 report.from all states in 2008, it received data from only five states\u2014Minnesota,  Montana, Oklahoma, Rhode Island, and Texas\u2014and we were unable to  determine whether these states are representative of the IT system  changes required by all states. CMS extrapolated national cost estimates  based on the size of these states, determined by the number of Medicare  eligible beneficiaries in them. However, the cost of IT modifications to  Medicaid systems would likely depend more on the specific IT systems  and their configurations in use by the state than on the number of  Medicare beneficiaries in the state. CMS was unable to provide  documentation about the data it requested from states related to its cost  projections, or documentation of the responses it received from states on  the specific modifications to Medicaid IT systems that would be required.  CMS officials also acknowledged that each state is different and their IT  systems would require different modifications.", "For the CMS IT-system conversion costs, officials told us that CMS  derived its IT-system conversion cost estimates by asking its IT system  owners for costs associated with changes to the systems affected under  each of the three options. However, CMS provided us with limited  documentation related to the information it supplied to its system owners  when collecting cost data to develop its estimates, and no supporting  documentation for the data it received from system owners. The  documentation CMS provided asked system owners to provide the basis  for their estimates (including, for example, costs related to labor and  hardware, and software changes and additions), and laid out general  assumptions for system owners to consider. However, because CMS  asked for estimates for broad cost categories, the data it received were  general in nature and not a detailed accounting of specific projected  costs. CMS officials also told us that system requirements changed over  the course of their work; however, they provided no documentation  related to how these changes were communicated to system owners. In  addition, CMS officials told us that they generally did not attempt to verify  estimates submitted by system owners. CMS could not explain how or  why a number of the systems the agency believed would require  modifications would be affected under its three options, or the variance in  the costs to modify these systems across the options.", "Moreover, CMS\u2019s cost estimates for the IT-related costs in its 2011 report  were approximately three times higher than the estimate in the agency\u2019s  2006 report.  That report stated that the majority of changes necessary  to replace the existing number with a non-SSN-based identifier would  affect only two systems; however, the agency estimated in its 2011  report that up to 48 systems would require modification, depending on the  option selected. Furthermore, CMS\u2019s 2006 report stated that the   2 primary IT systems affected\u2014the Medicare Beneficiary Database and  the Enrollment Database\u2014account for $70 million, or 85 percent, of the  IT-related costs. However, in the 2011 report, these 2 systems accounted  for 5 percent or less of the IT-related costs, depending on the option  implemented. CMS officials we interviewed were unable to explain the  differences in the number of systems affected, or the costs of required  modifications to IT systems between the 2006 and 2011 reports.", "Third, there are inconsistencies in some assumptions used by CMS and  SSA in the development of the estimates. For example, CMS and SSA  used different assumptions regarding the number of Medicare  beneficiaries that would require new Medicare cards. According to CMS  officials, the agency based its cost estimates on the number of Medicare  beneficiaries at the time the report was prepared (47 million), whereas  SSA officials told us the agency based its estimates on the expected  number of beneficiaries in 2015 (55 million), the year they estimated the  new card would likely be issued. In addition, nearly 30 percent of SSA\u2019s  costs were related to processing newly-issued Medicare cards that are  returned as undeliverable. However, SSA officials told us that they were  not aware that CMS\u2019s cost estimates included plans to conduct an  address-verification mailing at a cost of over $45 million prior to issuing  new cards. Such a mailing could reduce the number of cards returned as  undeliverable, and thus SSA\u2019s costs associated with processing such  cards.", "Finally, CMS did not take into account other factors when developing its  cost estimates, including related IT modernization efforts or potential  savings from removing the SSN from Medicare cards. In developing its  estimates, CMS did not consider ways to integrate IT requirements for  removing the SSN from Medicare cards with those necessitated by other  IT modernization plans to realize possible efficiencies. DOD and a private  health insurer we interviewed reported that when removing SSNs from  their cards, they updated their systems to accommodate this change in  conjunction with other unrelated system upgrades. CMS officials told us  that because many of the agency\u2019s other IT modernization plans are  unfunded, the agency does not know when or if these efforts will be  undertaken. As a result, the agency is unable to coordinate the SSN  removal effort or to estimate savings from combining such efforts. In its  report, CMS also acknowledged that if the agency switched to a new  identifier used by both beneficiaries and providers, there would likely be  some savings due to improved program integrity and reduced need to  monitor SSNs that may be stolen and used fraudulently. However, in  developing its estimates, CMS did not include any potential savings the  agency might accrue as a result of removing the SSN from Medicare  cards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Nearly six years have passed since CMS first issued a report to Congress  that explored options to remove the SSN from the Medicare card, and five  years have elapsed since the Office of Management and Budget directed  federal agencies to reduce the unnecessary use of the SSN. While CMS  has identified various options for removing the SSN from Medicare cards,  CMS has not committed to a plan to remove them. The agency lags  behind other federal agencies and the private sector in reducing the use  of the SSN. DOD, VA, and private health insurers have taken significant  steps to eliminate the SSN from display on identification and health  insurance cards, and reduce its role in operations.", "Of the options presented by CMS, the option that calls for developing a  new identifier for use by beneficiaries and providers offers the best  protection against identity theft and presents fewer burdens for  beneficiaries and providers than the other two. Consistent with the  approach taken by private health insurers, this option would eliminate the  use and display of the SSN for Medicare processes conducted by  beneficiaries and providers. While CMS reported that this option is  somewhat more costly than the other options, the methods and  assumptions CMS used to develop its estimates do not provide enough  certainty that those estimates are credible. Moreover, because CMS did  not have well-documented cost estimates, the reliability of its estimates  cannot be assessed. Use of standard cost-estimating procedures, such  as GAO\u2019s estimating guidance, would help ensure that CMS cost  estimates are comprehensive, well documented, accurate and credible.  Moving forward, CMS could also explore whether the use of magnetic  stripes, bar codes, or smart chips could offer other benefits such as  increased efficiencies. Absent a reliable cost estimate, however,  Congress and CMS cannot know the costs associated with this option  and how to prioritize it relative to other CMS initiatives.
