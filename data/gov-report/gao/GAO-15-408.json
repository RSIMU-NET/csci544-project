Although the procedures, in part, address some leading contract management practices, such as defining performance management activities, they lack documentation requirements and clearly defined management responsibilities for some activities. For example, the procedures do not require USPS to document some key management decisions, such as USPS's decision to forego additional revenue when a mailer did not ship a minimum volume of packages, as contractually required. Documenting such information could improve future decision making and enhance accountability for the effective and efficient use of USPS resources. USPS acknowledged that the procedures contained gaps when they were initially established.

However, larger and heavier packages can increase USPS's costs. For example, carriers must walk packages that are too large for a centralized mailbox to the customer's door, which increases costs. Moreover, mailers use size and weight to inform their own business decisions. For example, one mailer continually assesses package size and weight to make cost-effective decisions about the delivery method it chooses. If mailers route larger or heavier packages via Parcel Select, collecting and studying such information could improve USPS's analysis of attributable costs for Parcel Select NSAs.", "Contract-specific cost estimates : USPS's method to determine attributable costs uses average cost estimates for the Parcel Select product instead of contract-specific cost estimates. USPS's use of averages further limits its analysis of the extent to which each Parcel Select NSA covers its attributable costs, because USPS had not studied the extent to which the size and weight of packages shipped under individual contracts deviated from the characteristics of packages USPS used to estimate the average.", "USPS officials questioned whether the benefits of developing contract-specific cost estimates would exceed the costs; however, USPS has used less intensive methods, such as sampling, to improve estimates for other products in the past."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that USPS update its standard procedures to address gaps in documentation requirements and contract management responsibilities.

Thus, Sales or Finance creates monthly,  quarterly, and annual reports that analyze data that include the volume of  packages shipped and revenue generated under the contract. For  example, Finance develops a quarterly performance report that is used  internally by Sales. This report communicates the Parcel Select NSA\u2019s  contractual requirements, actual and projected volume and revenue data,  as well as descriptive information such as the contract\u2019s effective and  expiration dates.", "Submission of compliance review to the PRC: In addition to internal  reporting, USPS reports each NSA\u2019s performance externally to the PRC.  Specifically, Finance files USPS\u2019s Annual Compliance Report to the PRC;  this report covers the extent to which USPS finds that each NSA has met  statutory requirements including whether each contract has covered its  attributable costs. According to PRC officials, all Parcel Select NSAs have  complied with these statutory requirements each year. However, PRC  officials noted that they do not review and are not statutorily required to  review the extent to which mailers or USPS have complied with other  contractual requirements, such as minimum volume requirements and  any payments to USPS for failure to meet these requirements as part of  its Annual Compliance Determination Report.", "Business reviews: USPS officials said that they use performance reports  to conduct business reviews with mailers. Business reviews are meetings  where USPS and the mailer discuss business opportunities, contract  terms\u2014such as volume requirements and pricing\u2014and contract  performance. The Standard Procedures define additional  responsibilities USPS should perform if a mailer is at risk of failing to meet  contractual conditions.

Moreover, USPS did not require the mailer to  pay the difference between the discounted price and the published  price, as called for under the contract. Sales officials told us that they  decided not to require the payment for business reasons, including  maintaining this mailer as a source of package volume and allowing  the mailer time to adjust to changing market conditions that influenced  its performance. Although we recognize that USPS should have  flexibility to reach management decisions based upon the facts and  circumstances of each contract, Sales officials did not document the  reasons for their decision to leave the performance issue unresolved  and forgo the additional revenue.

Internal control standards state  that organizations should clearly define key areas of responsibility and  establish procedures to ensure that management promptly resolves  performance issues. Without clearly defining who is responsible for  promptly addressing performance issues and the procedures these  individuals should follow, USPS is at risk of leaving performance  issues unresolved\u2014such as the example of a mailer\u2019s failure to reach  minimum volumes discussed above\u2014issues that could impact future  contract performance.", "In addition, the Standard Procedures do not clearly define who is  responsible for reporting contract changes, such as rate adjustments  and amendments, to PRC. Internal control standards and leading contract management practices we identified state that  organizations should establish appropriate lines of reporting. Without  clearly defining who is responsible for reporting information to PRC in  the Standard Procedures, USPS is at risk of not reporting contract  changes to PRC as required. For example, although PRC requested  that USPS file an amendment to a Parcel Select contract in November  2014, USPS did not file the requested amendment as ordered.

Finance  officials stated that because the weight of packages shipped under the  Parcel Select NSAs did not vary significantly from the average weight,  they had no reason to believe that heavier Parcel Select packages  delivered under the NSAs would be more costly to process and deliver  than the average cost to deliver packages that are not under the NSAs.

For  packages entered higher in USPS\u2019s delivery stream (at sectional center  facilities and network distribution centers), USPS officials noted that  obtaining contract-specific information would require USPS to fully  integrate the entire USPS mail data system and entirely replace its  existing cost system, which would cost many hundreds of millions of  dollars.", "We recognize that USPS must carefully balance the costs and benefits  associated with developing contract-specific attributable cost estimates  for Parcel Select NSAs.

USPS noted that it did not believe that  package size and weight significantly affect the costs of Parcel Select  NSAs, because most packages are entered at the DDU and thus bypass  much of USPS\u2019s processing and transportation network. However, as the  report notes, while USPS does collect data on the weight of all Parcel  Select packages, it does not collect information on the size of NSA  packages and has not studied the impact of either of these factors on  USPS\u2019s delivery costs for specific contracts. This limits USPS\u2019s analysis  of attributable costs for Parcel Select NSAs. USPS stated it would explore  obtaining additional mailer characteristics and ascertaining their  relationships to costs for specific Parcel Select NSAs. USPS noted in its  comments that it has already taken steps to obtain contract-specific  characteristics for Sunday delivery of NSA packages. Sunday delivery,  however, currently constitutes a relatively small percentage of Parcel  Select volume.", "As the report notes, collecting and studying information on the size and  weight of Parcel Select packages is important, because larger and  heavier packages can increase USPS\u2019s delivery costs. The report also  points out that private sector mailers use package weight and size  information to inform their own business decisions, such as making cost- effective decisions regarding the delivery method they choose. As the  report concludes, collecting and studying information on the size and  weight of Parcel Select NSA packages could improve USPS\u2019s analysis of  attributable cost coverage for each contract and position USPS to better  understand how mailers\u2019 business decisions affect these costs. This  understanding will be important given the rapidly changing package  delivery market.", "In its comments, PRC said that it found our draft report well-researched  and balanced and agreed with both of our recommendations. PRC  supported the cost-effective development of more accurate attributable  cost estimates for Parcel Select NSAs. PRC also clarified that USPS\u2019s  method to estimate average costs for Parcel Select packages excludes  Parcel Select mail weighing less than one pound. We modified the  relevant text to note this clarification.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the appropriate  congressional committees, Postmaster General, Acting Chairman of  PRC, USPS Office of Inspector General, and other interested parties. In  addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at 202-512-2834 or rectanusl@gao.gov.

We also examined  USPS documents such as the Standard Procedure for Managing NSA  Contracts that describe the procedures. We also reviewed copies of all 13  Parcel Select NSAs executed by USPS along with their supporting file  documentation, such as contract performance and business review  reports. This includes eight Parcel Select and five Parcel Select & Parcel  Return Service contracts. For purposes of our report, we refer to both of  these contract categories as Parcel Select NSAs, since each includes the  Parcel Select product. We also examined Postal Regulatory Commission  (PRC) documents, such as orders and notices. We did not review the  extent to which USPS complied with all of its management procedures  because this did not fall within the scope of this review. We also did not  report volume, revenue, or mailer-specific information for individual NSAs  because USPS and mailers consider the information proprietary, and  according to USPS officials, public disclosure would violate contractual  confidentiality provisions.", "In addition, we conducted interviews with USPS officials from the Sales,  Finance, and Legal departments, who are responsible for developing,  monitoring, and evaluating the performance of Parcel Select NSAs; PRC  officials responsible for reviewing the contracts; and representatives from  eight mailers that signed 12 of the 13 Parcel Select NSAs to determine  how USPS implements its procedures. The number of mailers is less than  the number of implemented contracts because some mailers signed more  than one contract. We did not interview representatives from one of the  mailers that signed a Parcel Select NSA, because the company was sold  and knowledgeable representatives were no longer available to meet with  us. According to USPS, no packages were ever shipped under that  contract. We compared USPS\u2019s procedures for managing the contracts  against selected leading contract management practices. To select these  practices, we:  Identified criteria sources that included leading contract management  practices and then confirmed that these sources were appropriate  through consultation with internal stakeholders. These sources  included: (a) our standards for internal control in the federal  government; (b) guidance documents and regulations for federal  agencies, such as best practices issued by the Office of Federal  Procurement Policy; and (c) documents from contract management  and administration organizations including the National Contract  Management Association and the Institute for Supply Management,  which were recognized for their expertise in this area.", "Reviewed information included in each criteria source to identify  practices that are relevant to either (a) buyers and sellers or (b) just  sellers. Because the Postal Service is the service provider (or seller)  under Parcel Select NSAs, we excluded leading practices that are  only pertinent to buyers. In addition, we identified practices that were  applicable to USPS and its unique statutory and regulatory  requirements as an independent establishment of the executive  branch of the federal government.", "Exercised professional judgment to select practices that we identified  as particularly relevant to the managing Parcel Select NSAs.", "Based upon these steps, we selected the following leading contract  management practices: defining roles and responsibilities; establishing  procedures for the contract management process; planning and  negotiation; managing performance; communicating effectively; and  documenting management activities and decisions. USPS agreed that  these practices were relevant and reasonable.", "To determine revenue and volume trends for Parcel Select, which we  describe in the background of our report, we reviewed USPS Revenue,  Pieces, & Weight reports, which present official USPS estimates. We  assessed the reliability of these data by reviewing related documentation,  such as a December 2007 USPS Office of Inspector General report on   and by collecting information from knowledgeable  USPS\u2019s data system,USPS officials, and determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for  our reporting purpose.", "To examine the method that USPS uses to determine whether each  Parcel Select NSA covers its attributable costs, we reviewed relevant  laws and regulations that establish requirements for product categories  and contracts such as PAEA. We also analyzed agency documents that  describe or discuss the methodology that USPS uses, such as USPS\u2019s  fiscal year 2014 Annual Compliance Report and PRC\u2019s Annual  Compliance Determination Reports for fiscal years 2008 through 2013,  the most recent reports available. We also reviewed relevant federal  agency, academic, and GAO reports that describe USPS\u2019s costing  approach and related issues, such as the USPS Office of Inspector  General\u2019s audit reports. In addition, we conducted interviews with USPS  and PRC officials to obtain their views on USPS\u2019s cost coverage  methodology. Finally, we made written requests for information regarding  the methodology used to calculate attributable cost to USPS and PRC  officials, who provided written responses on the subject. We did not  review USPS\u2019s postal costing methodology generally, such as methods to  divide costs into attributable and institutional costs and methods to  distribute attributable costs to various USPS products and services.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2014 through April 2015  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
