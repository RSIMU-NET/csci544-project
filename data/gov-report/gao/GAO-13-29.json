Despite these efforts, the unemployment rate for veterans who have recently separated from the military is higher than that for the civilian population. The number of service members transitioning to the civilian workforce is expected to increase. In response to a request, this report examines (1) the extent to which federal veterans' employment and training programs vary in services they deliver and veterans who receive them; (2) the extent to which federal agencies coordinate programs; and (3) what is known about the performance of these programs. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed agency data, policy documents, and relevant federal laws and regulations, reports, and studies, and interviewed federal and regional officials and state officials in six states selected to achieve geographic and demographic diversity. In examining coordination, GAO included in its review employment assistance DOD provides to Guard and Reserve members."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The six federal veterans' employment and training programs offer similar employment services, but largely target different groups. Among these programs, the Department of Labor's (Labor) Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program has the greatest potential for overlap with other veterans' programs and Labor's employment programs for the general population. Federal law governing the Disabled Veterans' Outreach Program makes all veterans who meet the broad definition of \"eligible veteran\" eligible for its services, but gives disabled veterans and economically and educationally disadvantaged veterans the highest priority for services. However, Labor's guidance does not provide states--who administer the program using federal funds--criteria for prioritizing services. The law also generally requires that program staff provide participants with intensive services (e.g., individual employment plans), but Labor's data indicate that nationally 28 percent of participants received such services in 2011. In explaining this statistic, Labor officials said one possible explanation was that staff are enrolling people who do not need intensive services. Labor said it plans to develop guidance on prioritizing services, and it also has a six-state pilot to improve monitoring, but neither of these efforts has been completed.", "In 2008, Labor and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) compiled a handbook intended to guide the roles of their respective staff in coordinating services to disabled veterans; however, they have not updated the handbook nor included related Department of Defense (DOD) employment initiatives in their interagency agreements. GAO's interviews with VA and Labor officials identified certain challenges with meeting desired program outcomes resulting, in part, from sections of the handbook that provide insufficient guidance or are subject to misunderstanding. For example, the handbook says Labor and VA are to coordinate to achieve \"suitable employment\"--employment that follows the veteran's rehabilitation plan and does not aggravate the disability. However, it does not explicitly say how staff should navigate situations where a veteran's financial need or preferences do not align with this goal. In such instances, program staff may work at cross purposes and veterans may accept jobs that do not count as suitable employment. Further, DOD is expanding its employment assistance, but does not have an interagency agreement to coordinate with Labor and VA efforts. Absent an updated handbook and integration of DOD into the coordination framework, there is increased risk for poor coordination and program overlap.", "While available performance information shows that most programs' outcomes are below pre-2007 levels, the information Labor reports and the research it has conducted make it difficult to know the extent to which each program is achieving its annual performance goals. Veterans' employment outcomes for programs administered by both Labor and VA have generally not regained levels seen before the recession that began in 2007, which is similar to employment programs for the general population. In reporting performance, Labor does not relate employment outcomes to individual program goals. In contrast, Labor reports outcomes and goals for its other workforce programs aimed at the general population. Moreover, while both agencies have studies completed or under way, neither has conducted impact evaluations that assess program effectiveness to determine whether outcomes are attributable to program participation and not other factors. As a result, Congress and other key stakeholders lack essential information needed to assess each program's performance. GAO is making four recommendations aimed at improving the guidance provided to staff in the coordination handbook, integrating DOD into the interagency coordination framework, improving agency reporting on achievement of program performance goals, and assessing program effectiveness."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making four recommendations aimed at improving the guidance provided to staff in the coordination handbook, integrating DOD into the interagency coordination framework, improving agency reporting on achievement of program performance goals, and assessing program effectiveness."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2011, the Department of Labor (Labor) and the Department  of Veterans Affairs (VA) spent an estimated $1.2 billion on veterans\u2019  employment and training programs and served about 880,000  participants.

In responding to this objective, we included not only the six  programs indicated above but also three Labor programs available to the  general population: the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Adult and  Dislocated Worker programs, and the Employment Service (ES)  Program.

As part of answering our first two objectives, we also  conducted case studies in six selected states. For all 50 states, we first  determined whether each was high, medium, or low on the following  characteristics: the percentage of veteran population, amount of program  expenditures, program performance, and veterans\u2019 unemployment rate.  We then selected one state from each of Labor\u2019s six regions to achieve  variation on the above characteristics, as well as diversity in terms of  geography and state size.

According to the referral process outlined in the  interagency handbook and by agency officials (see fig. 3), there are two  main referral points from the Vocational Rehabilitation Program to Labor\u2019s  Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach Program staff: (1) before the participant\u2019s  rehabilitation plan is completed and (2) after the participant has  completed a rehabilitation plan and been deemed job-ready, or ready for  employment, by VA staff.

This study will include a supplemental study of  veterans using the public workforce system, but this portion of the study,  as described in the draft research plan for the study, is not an impact  evaluation and cannot determine the extent to which veterans\u2019 outcomes  are due to the services they receive in the public workforce system.", "Similar to Labor, VA has not conducted evaluations that allow it to  determine if veterans\u2019 employment outcomes result from program  services or if they are the result of other factors. As shown in table 3, VA  has funded research that examines data related to the completion of  veterans\u2019 rehabilitation plans and participant outcomes. For example,  VA is funding a longitudinal study of Vocational Rehabilitation Program  participants and has issued two reports on the study. The most recent  report begins to analyze VA administrative data to determine  characteristics associated with completing rehabilitation or discontinuing  the program within the first 2 years. However, the report states that its  findings thus far are only descriptive and may have little or no predictive  value. VA plans further study of emerging trends. VA also plans additional  follow-up of program participants in its case management process.  Specifically, the agency plans to send a questionnaire to collect  information on whether former participants are employed and whether  they need additional services."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Given that the number of service members transitioning to civilian  employment is expected to increase and the number of veterans with  service-connected disabilities is on the rise, Labor\u2019s Disabled Veterans\u2019  Outreach Program is likely to see an increased demand for its services.  Labor attempts to maximize the employment services for those veterans  who need them most. However, we found that there is a need for clearer  guidance to states on how to prioritize services and additional monitoring  of their implementation of such guidance. Labor said it is developing such  guidance but has not completed it, and has tested new monitoring  protocols in six states but has not finalized them. It is encouraging that  Labor has these efforts under way, and it will be important for the  department to complete both efforts.", "Labor and VA both provide employment and training programs targeted to  veterans. Although Labor and VA have a handbook governing their  coordination with respect to employment and training for veterans, it has  not been updated since 2008. Our work identified sections of the  handbook that provided insufficient guidance, resulting in situations where  the practices of one department presented difficulties for the other in  meeting desired program outcomes. At the same time, DOD has begun  expanding employment assistance initiatives to segments of the veteran  population, such as National Guard and Reserve members, some of  whom may also meet Labor and VA veterans\u2019 programs eligibility  requirements. However, Labor and VA\u2019s agreement does not govern their  coordination with DOD\u2019s programs. Without an agreement that includes  all three departments, efforts to help veterans find employment are at  greater risk of being fragmented or overlapping, and may not leverage  federal resources.", "Finally, the federal investment in veterans\u2019 employment and training  programs warrants greater transparency with regard to the extent to  which these programs are meeting their performance goals and whether  outcomes are attributable to program participation and not other factors.  Labor reports substantial information on outcomes for these programs.  However, Labor is not consistently reporting the extent to which outcomes  for each of its veterans\u2019 programs are achieving the specific performance  goals that were established for these programs. This stands in contrast to  the level of performance reporting by Labor for its WIA Adult and ES  programs, which identifies the extent to which outcomes in these  programs are achieving performance goals. In addition, while the federal  government makes a substantial investment in Labor and VA programs to  achieve employment outcomes for veterans, neither agency has  conducted studies to see if these outcomes can be attributed to the  programs\u2019 services, instead of other factors. As a result, Congress and  other stakeholders lack essential information to assess how well these  programs are performing and hold federal agencies accountable for  achieving results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following four recommendations based on our review:", "To increase the effectiveness of coordination efforts, the Secretaries  of Labor and VA should incorporate additional guidance to address  the two problem areas we identified into any update to the interagency  handbook that governs their coordination for veterans\u2019 employment  and training programs.", "To ensure government resources are used efficiently, the Secretaries  of Labor, VA, and DOD should incorporate DOD\u2019s employment  assistance initiatives into the agreements that guide interagency  coordination.", "To enhance transparency and accountability for achieving results, the  Secretary of Labor should consistently report both performance goals  and associated performance outcomes for each of its veterans\u2019  employment and training programs.", "To assess veterans\u2019 employment programs\u2019 effectiveness, Secretaries  of Labor and VA should, to the extent possible, determine the extent  to which veterans\u2019 employment outcomes result from program  participation or are the result of other factors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Labor, the  Department of Veterans Affairs, and the Department of Defense for  review and comment.

In response to our recommendation on reporting program  performance, Labor said it will explore ways to increase consistency and  transparency of the information it reports.  In response to our  recommendation to Labor and VA regarding assessing program  effectiveness, VA concurred and Labor did not specify whether or not it  agreed.  Labor said that it is committed to robust program evaluation and  that each agency, including VETS, develops an annual evaluation agenda  and sets priorities.  Labor said it has a multi-component agenda for  evaluating services to veterans and cited some current studies, such as   a study of the TAP program and a statistical analysis of services received  by veterans and their outcomes using the public workforce system.  We  think obtaining information about the effectiveness of veterans' programs  is important because such information can assist Congress in assessing  program results and identifying areas where adjustments may be needed.   As Labor and VA conduct research on program outcomes, it will be  important for them to consider approaches that would enable them to  separate the impact of their programs from other factors that might  influence participants\u2019 outcomes.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We  defined an employment and training program as one specifically designed  to enhance the specific job skills of individuals in order to increase their  employability, identify job opportunities, or help job seekers obtain  employment. Labor oversees five of these programs for veterans: (1) the  Disabled Veterans\u2019 Outreach Program, (2) the Homeless Veterans\u2019  Reintegration Program, (3) the Local Veterans\u2019 Employment  Representative Program (Employment Representative Program), (4) the  Transition Assistance Program (TAP), and (5) the Veterans\u2019 Workforce  Investment Program (VWIP). VA oversees the sixth program called the  Vocational Rehabilitation & Employment Program (Vocational  Rehabilitation Program).requirements, and outcome measures that these programs had in  common.", "Our 2011 report identified services, eligibility  For this report, we focused on the six programs identified in our January  2011 report in more detail and examined (1) the extent to which federal  veterans\u2019 employment and training programs vary in terms of the services  they deliver and the veterans who receive them; (2) the extent to which  federal agencies coordinate these programs; and (3) what is known about  the performance of these programs.", "Our approach overall involved reviewing relevant literature, relevant  federal laws and regulations, and analyzing Labor and VA data on  veteran participants, services provided, and performance. We also  interviewed federal Labor, VA, and Department of Defense (DOD) agency  officials who govern agency policy at the national level and key  stakeholder associations.", "To determine the extent to which these programs vary in terms of the  services they deliver and the veterans receive them, we analyzed Labor  and VA data on services provided and veteran participants, agency  annual reports, budget justifications, and other agency policy documents.  To assess the reliability of Labor\u2019s data on services to veterans in one- stops, we reviewed available information about the data and conducted  interviews with officials knowledgeable about the data. We determined  that these data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. We reviewed  relevant federal laws and regulations to determine program eligibility  requirements. We interviewed agency officials, veterans\u2019 service  organizations, and workforce associations to better understand why  programs may serve similar populations with similar services. We  reviewed state plans and interviewed state-level Labor, VA, and DOD  staff for our case study states.", "In addition, we conducted six case studies at the state level. In each  state, we reviewed state plans and interviewed Labor and VA officials  assigned to the state or the region. We also interviewed the Employer  Support of the Guard and Reserve (ESGR) chairperson operating in the  state. These are federal representatives of DOD, but not federal  employees, as they are volunteers. In addition, we interviewed the  directors of state workforce agencies, which carry out veterans\u2019  employment and training programs using federal funds. Finally, within  three states, we interviewed the Director of Veterans Affairs in each state,  a state government official responsible for veterans\u2019 programs and  services. To select states, for all 50 states, we determined whether each  was high, medium, or low on the following characteristics: the percentage  of veteran population, amount of program expenditures, program  performance (veterans\u2019 entered employment rate), and veterans\u2019  unemployment rate. We selected one state from each of Labor\u2019s six  regions to achieve variation on the above characteristics, as well as  diversity in terms of geography and state size. These states were Florida,  Massachusetts, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, and Virginia.", "To determine the extent to which federal agencies coordinate these  programs, we reviewed key agency agreements and guidance, and used  the same six case studies at the state level, and interviewed federal and  state agency officials and associations representing the interests of  veterans. In examining coordination we included not only the five  programs indicated above but also three Labor programs available to the  general population: the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) Adult and  Dislocated Worker and the Employment Service (ES) programs. We also  included programs recently begun by DOD: the Yellow Ribbon and ESGR  programs. We reviewed memoranda of understanding, agency guidance,  and other policy documents related to collaborative efforts among federal  agencies. We also interviewed National Veterans\u2019 Training Institute  officials to discuss the extent to which required training for outreach  specialists and employment representatives includes instruction on how  to foster inter- and intra-agency coordination. In our case studies in six  states, we interviewed state-level officials from the Veterans\u2019 Employment  and Training Services, as well as VA officials. We also interviewed ESGR  officials and Directors of State Offices of Veterans Affairs. To understand  stakeholders\u2019 views on coordination, we interviewed officials from  workforce associations and veterans\u2019 service organizations.
