Finance programs vary in complexity as well as in the amount spent per pupil. Some of this variation in per pupil expenditures is accounted for by differences in the cost of educational services, the property wealth of the state, the amount the state is willing to spend for education, or the funding formula used by the state.

II.4).", "The growth in these at-risk populations has increased the demand for specialized classroom services. Regular classroom services increasingly include special education for the physically and mentally challenged, compensatory education for the economically disadvantaged, and language services for LEP students. In addition, many schools will have to address the needs of other at-risk students, such as children who change schools frequently and are, therefore, more likely to be low achievers and have other difficulties such as health and nutrition problems.", "Because of the additional services associated with educating poor and other at-risk students, many schools face elevated cost requirements and must find ways to stretch current funding levels to pay for these services.

This decrease in the percent of states\u2019 budgets spent for education occurred, in part, because of increased spending for Medicaid and corrections (see fig. 3).

The Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR) defines ability to raise revenue similarly, \u201cas the hypothetical ability of a state and its local governments to raise revenue to provide public services in the state relative to the need for those services.\u201d We have also developed a measure of ability to raise revenue that estimates a state\u2019s ability to finance educational services, which we call ability to raise revenue for education. This measure accounts for the number of school-age children and the costs of providing educational services in the state as measured by average teacher salaries.", "Both measures of ability to raise revenue that we have developed use total taxable resources (TTR) as a component that assesses a state\u2019s ability to finance services. TTR, defined and compiled by the Department of the Treasury, is the average of per capita personal income (PCPI) produced in a state and per capita gross state product (GSP). As noted in an earlier report, \u201cGSP measures all income produced within a state, whether received by residents, nonresidents, or retained by business corporations.\u201d TTR is a more comprehensive indicator of taxable resources than PCPI alone, in part, because it also considers income produced in a state but received by nonresidents. The Congress has included TTR in the allocation formula for the Alcohol, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Block Grant.", "We have also developed two measures of willingness to raise revenue: an overall measure and one for education. Willingness to raise revenue overall can be determined by comparing a state\u2019s actual revenue with its capacity to raise revenue. Willingness to raise revenue for education is determined similarly but focuses on spending for kindergarten to twelfth grade public education alone rather than all public services. For each of our \u201cwillingness measures,\u201d as well as our two \u201cability measures,\u201d we have developed an index by comparing the state figure to that of the whole nation. The following describes each of these indexes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Ability to Raise Revenue Overall", "paragraphs": ["Our index of ability to raise revenue overall has two components. The first component is TTR per capita for a state divided by TTR per capita for the nation. This provides an index of nominal ability to raise revenue. Our second component, a cost index or purchasing power adjustment, provides a common measurement for states with greatly varying costs. This cost index is based on the work of Department of the Treasury analysts. Robert Rafuse developed a state level labor-input-cost index for 1986 based on the mean annual earnings of males 45 to 54 years old who worked 40 or more weeks per year, accounting for seven different levels of education.

Howard Nelson along with information on teacher experience from the Department of Education\u2019s 1990-91 Schools and Staffing Survey, we found that teacher salaries increase about 2.33 percent, on average for the nation, for each year of teacher experience.", "We then adjusted average teacher salaries for each state, a measure of the costs of providing educational services in each state, to account for differences among states in average levels of teacher experience. For example, we found that the average teacher salary in Oklahoma for 1991-92 was $26,514 and that the average number of years of teaching experience was 12.9, about 2.2 years below the national average of 15.1 years. If Oklahoma were to be able to attract teachers with comparable years of experience as the nation as a whole, it would cost the state, we estimate, an additional $618 for each year of teaching experience or about $1,359 for 2.2 years. Therefore, we estimate that the experience-adjusted average teacher salary for Oklahoma would be about $27,873, still well below the average for the nation, $34,213. Consequently, while our measure of the cost of educational services in Oklahoma is still low, it does account for Oklahoma\u2019s costs being somewhat higher were it to have levels of teaching experience comparable to the U.S. average.", "To illustrate how the index of ability to raise revenue for education was developed, consider again the example of Oklahoma. Oklahoma has a relatively low TTR per school-age child, about 73 percent of the U.S. average, or $104,693 per child compared with $143,178 per child for the United States. This stems from two factors: (1) relatively low TTR and (2) relatively high proportions of school-age children. While Oklahoma\u2019s nominal ability to raise revenue for education is low, its cost of providing educational services, that is, adjusted average teacher salaries, is also low, at about 81 percent of the U.S. average.
