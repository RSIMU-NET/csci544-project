Specifically, many tank units reported that they could be fully trained for their wartime mission within a short time period. Units that reported that they would need more time to become fully trained generally cited personnel issues rather than the lack of training funds as the reason.

Section 365 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 directed us to examine several issues associated with the movement of training funds. We are responding to the act with a series of reports. We reported last year on the extent that funds were being moved by all the services, pointing out that the Army had moved nearly $1.1 billion from its training budget during fiscal years 1997 through 1999. As agreed with your offices, in this report we assessed in more detail the extent to which Army tank training funds had been moved. Specifically, our objectives were to (1) identify whether the Army was continuing to move training funds planned for its divisions; (2) assess whether reported readiness remained at high levels for these divisions, specifically their armor (i.e., tank) battalions; and (3) assess whether DOD and the Army are providing Congress with complete and consistent information regarding tank training. Appendix I describes our scope and methodology.", "To have trained and ready forces, Army armor units conduct training at their home bases, called home station training; at the National Training Center at Fort Irwin, California, and the Combat Maneuver Training Center in Germany, which are the Army\u2019s premier locations to conduct training; and in Kuwait as part of military exercises with the armed forces of Kuwait. The Army has determined that its armor units need to conduct 800 miles of training annually on their tanks at their home station in order to be adequately trained to carry out their wartime mission. In addition to conducting home station training, the Army periodically sends its armor units to the National Training Center and other training exercises. There are no tank mile goals associated with this training away from the home station. The Army tracks and reports the miles its tanks are driven on a monthly basis and aggregates them annually."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Army has 10 active duty divisions, as listed in appendix II. Six of these divisions are called heavy divisions because they are equipped with large numbers of tanks, called armor. Two other divisions are called light divisions because they have no armor. The remaining two divisions are an airborne division and an air assault division. Heavy divisions accounted for the majority of the Army\u2019s division training funds, about 70 percent ($808 million) in fiscal year 2000, and these divisions are the focus of this report.", "The Army uses a building block approach to train its armor forces\u2014 beginning with individual training and building up to brigade-sized unit training, as shown in figure 1. This training approach is documented in the Army\u2019s Combined Arms Training Strategy (CATS). The strategy identifies the critical tasks, called mission essential tasks, that units need to be capable of performing in time of war and the type of events or exercises and the frequency with which the units train to the task to produce a combat ready force. The strategy, in turn, guides the development of unit training plans.", "The Army uses CATS as the basis for determining its training budget. To do this, it uses models to convert training events into budgetary resources, as shown in figure 2. For armor units, the Battalion Level Training Model translates the type of training events identified in CATS and the frequency with which they should be conducted into the number of tank miles to be driven in conducting those training events. The Army then uses another model, the Training Resource Model, to compute the estimated training cost for units based on the previous 3 years\u2019 cost experience. The output from these models is the basis for the Army\u2019s training budget.", "CATS, in combination with the Battalion Level Training Model, has established that the tanks in armor units will be driven, on average, about 800 miles each year for home station training. This is the level of training the Army has identified as needed to have a combat ready force, and its budget request states that it includes funds necessary to support that training. While the Army uses the 800-tank mile goal as a tool to develop its divisions\u2019 home station budgets, it does not identify the number of tank miles to be driven in its training guidance and training field manuals as a training requirement nor does it mention the miles in unit training plans.", "To measure the readiness of its units, the Army uses the Global Status of Resources and Training System. Unit commanders use this readiness system to report their units\u2019 overall readiness level. Under this readiness system, each reporting unit provides information monthly on the current level of personnel, equipment on hand, equipment serviceability, and training, and the commander\u2019s overall assessment of the unit\u2019s readiness to undertake its wartime mission. Units can be rated on a scale of C-1 to C-5. A C-1 unit can undertake the full wartime mission for which it is organized and designed; a C-2 unit can undertake most of its wartime mission; a C-3 unit can undertake many but not all elements of its wartime mission; a C-4 unit requires additional resources or training to undertake its wartime mission; and a C-5 unit is not prepared to undertake its wartime mission. Currently, the training readiness portion of the readiness report reflects the commander\u2019s assessment of the number of training days that are needed for the unit to be fully combat ready.", "In addition to the Army setting a training goal of 800 miles for tanks located at unit home stations, in its performance report for fiscal year 1999, DOD began to use 800 tank training miles, including miles driven at units\u2019 home station and the National Training Center, as a performance benchmark for measuring near-term readiness in responding to the Government Performance and Results Act.

However, each year since at least the mid-1990s, the Army has obligated millions of dollars less than it budgets to conduct training, and tanks have not trained to the 800-mile level. For the 4-year period fiscal years 1997 through 2000, the Army obligated a total of almost $1 billion less than Congress provided for training all its divisions. At the same time, the Army trained on its tanks an annual average of 591 miles at home station.

The largest component of the land forces budget is for training the Army\u2019s 10 active- duty divisions. The Army, through the President\u2019s budget submission, requests more than $1 billion annually in O&M funds to conduct home station division training. The majority of this budget request is for the Army\u2019s six heavy divisions to use for unit training purposes. Over the last 4 years, Congress has provided the Army with the training funds it has requested. For much of the past decade, the Army has moved some of these funds from its division training to other purposes, such as base operations and real property maintenance. We previously reported that this occurred in fiscal years 1993 and 1994 and our current work shows that the Army continues to move training funds to other purposes. Although the Army has moved funds from all of its land forces subactivities, as shown in table 1, for the 4-year period fiscal years 1997 through 2000, it moved the most funds from its subactivity planned for division training.", "Although the Army has moved the most funds out of its division training subactivity, the amount moved has decreased over the past 2 years, as shown in figure 3.", "Despite the recent decrease in training funds moved from the divisions, the Army moved almost $190 million in fiscal year 2000.

Generally, the Army obligated funds planned for training its divisions for other purposes such as base operations, real property maintenance, and operational readiness (such as maintaining its training ranges)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Is Not Canceling Tank Training Due to Lack of Funds", "paragraphs": ["Although the Army budgets to achieve 800 tank miles for home station training, it has consistently achieved less than the 800 training miles for the last 4 years (see fig. 4). During this period, armor units missed the 800-tank mile goal annually by about an average of 26 percent. Recently, however, the number of home station tank miles achieved increased, from 568 miles in fiscal year 1999 to 655 miles in fiscal year 2000.", "There are some valid reasons for not achieving the 800-tank mile goal at home station, which are described below. The Army, however, does not adjust its tank mile goal to reflect these reasons. The Army develops its data on tank mile achievement from each unit\u2019s tank odometer readings. Some home station training, however, does not involve driving tanks. Specifically, the 800-tank mile goal for home station training includes a 60 tank mile increment that some units can conduct through the use of training simulators. These 60 miles are included in the funding for the 800-tank miles, but they are not reflected in tank mile reporting because they are not driven on real tanks.", "In addition, deployment to contingency operations, such as the ones in the Balkans (Bosnia and Kosovo), affects both the available funding and the amount of training that can be conducted at home station. For example, when armor units are deployed to the Balkans they are not able to conduct their normal home station training. During fiscal year 1999, for example, the 1st Cavalry Division deployed to the Balkans for 11 months. Consequently, the division did very little home station training, which affected the Army-wide average home station tank training miles achieved for that year\u2014specifically, an average of 568 tank training miles. However, if the Army had excluded the 1st Cavalry Division because it was deployed to the Balkans for most of that fiscal year, the Army-wide average home station tank mile training would have increased to 655 miles, nearly 90 miles more. In addition, the Army moved and used the funds associated with this missed training to offset the cost of Balkan operations. Although the magnitude of funding shifted to support contingency operations varies annually, the Army does not adjust its methodology and reporting to reflect the tank training miles associated with these cost offsets.", "Even though the Army is not conducting 800 tank miles of home station training, its armor units are still able to execute their unit training events. During our work at five of the Army\u2019s six heavy divisions, we found no evidence to demonstrate that scheduled training events had been delayed or canceled in recent years because training funds were moved out of the division subactivity to other purposes. Training events included those at a unit\u2019s home station and at the Army\u2019s National Training Center and its Combat Maneuver Training Center. Unit trainers told us that if scheduled training had to be canceled or delayed, it likely would be for reasons such as deployments or bad weather. In addition, when unit trainers establish their training plans for certain training events, they focus on achieving the unit\u2019s mission essential tasks and not on how many miles will be driven on the tanks.", "According to the Army, units can execute their training plans despite funds being moved for several reasons. The major reasons were   because most of the movement in funds occurs before the divisions receive the funds, division trainers, using past experience, anticipate the amount of training funds they will likely receive from higher commands and adjust their training plans accordingly and the intensity of the training event can be modified to fit within available funding by taking steps such as driving fewer miles and transporting\u2014 rather than driving\u2014tanks to training ranges."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Army Is Taking Action to Restrict Moving Funds Out of Training Subactivities", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2001, the Army implemented an initiative to protect training funds from being moved that should result in the Army\u2019s using these training dollars for the purposes originally planned. Senior Army leadership directed that for fiscal year 2001, Army land forces would be exempt from any budget adjustments within the discretion of Army headquarters. The senior leadership also required that Army commands obtain prior approval from Army headquarters before reducing training funds. However, subactivities within the Army\u2019s O&M account that have received these funds in the past\u2014such as real property maintenance, base operations, and operational readiness\u2014may be affected by less funding unless the Army requests more funds for these subactivities in the future.

In reviewing comments of commanders who reported degraded readiness for the same period, we found that insufficient funding was rarely cited as a cause of degraded readiness. Only a handful of unit reports filed in the 4-year period covering fiscal years 1997 through 2000, identified instances in which a shortage of funds was cited as a factor in reporting lower readiness levels. During the same period, when commanders cited training as the reason for reporting lower overall readiness, they never cited insufficient funding as a cause.", "Not only do unit commanders report on their overall readiness levels, but they also are required to report on the four subareas that comprise overall readiness.

Our analysis of these readiness reports showed that most armor units reported that their training status was high throughout fiscal years 1997 through 2000.", "There seems to be no direct relationship between average tank miles achieved and reported training readiness. There were times when tank miles achieved (1) increased while the proportion of time units reporting high readiness levels declined and (2) declined while the proportion of units reporting high readiness levels increased. For example, tank miles achieved rose more than 25 percent between the second and third quarter of fiscal year 2000 while the proportion of time units were reporting high readiness levels declined.

One such subactivity funds training at the National Training Center. Armor units based in the United States train at the National Training Center on average once every 18 months. Based on congressional guidance, the Army includes funds for this training in a separate budget subactivity. This subactivity, in essence, pays for tank training miles in addition to the 800 miles for home station training that is funded in the divisions\u2019 training subactivity. During the period fiscal years 1997 through 2000, the National Training Center training added an annual average of 87 miles to overall Army tank training in addition to the average of 591 miles of home station training. Because, through fiscal year 2000, these miles have been conducted on prepositioned equipment rather than on a unit\u2019s own tanks, they appropriately have not been included in home station training activity. Beginning in fiscal year 2001, the Army plans to have an as yet undetermined number of units transport their own tanks for use at the National Training Center. As this occurs, these units will report National Training Center tank miles achieved as part of their home station training.

In its reporting on progress toward the goal, DOD included mileage associated with training at the National Training Center in its tank mile reporting.
