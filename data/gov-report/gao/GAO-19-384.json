Specifically, the department described steps  it has planned or under way to update its policies to require an  organization-wide risk assessment, in accordance with the first part of the  recommendation. With respect to the second part of the recommendation,  the department pointed to portions of its information security and privacy  policy that address the selection of security and privacy controls.", "However, while these policy statements require adherence to NIST and  OMB standards for selecting security controls and require a rationale for  tailoring decisions, they do not specifically require the use of risk  assessments to inform the tailoring of security controls. As NIST states,  organizations apply the tailoring process to align the controls more closely  with the specific conditions within the organization and should use risk  assessments to inform and guide the tailoring process for organizational  information systems and environments of operation. Making this  requirement explicit in policy would help HHS  ensure that it is applying  the appropriate set of controls to its systems; thus, we maintain that our  recommendation is still warranted.", "HHS\u2019s  comments are reprinted in appendix X.

To address our first  objective, we collected agency policies, procedures, and other  documentation and compared them to selected key practices from OMB  and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) guidance for  cybersecurity risk management.", "To identify the key practices, we reviewed OMB guidance pertaining to  cybersecurity risk management, including OMB Circular A-130: Managing  Information as a Strategic Resource, as well as Circular A-123:  Management\u2019s Responsibility for Enterprise Risk Management and  Internal Control, which outlines agency responsibilities for enterprise risk management. We also reviewed NIST guidance, including the Framework  for Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity; Special Publication  800-30: Guide for Conducting Risk Assessments; Special Publication  800-37: Guide for Applying the Risk Management Framework to Federal  Information Systems, and Special Publication 800-39: Managing  Information Security Risk: Organization, Mission, and Information System  View. In selecting the key practices for our assessment, we focused on  those practices identified by OMB and NIST as foundational for providing  an organization-wide approach to cybersecurity risk management.", "We collected and analyzed documentation and other information from  each agency related to cybersecurity risk management and compared it  to the identified key practices. We supplemented our analyses with  interviews with relevant agency officials to discuss the development of  their policies. We discussed the results of our initial analysis of agency  documentation with agency officials to validate our findings, collect  additional evidence, and identify causes for any gaps. We then  determined whether the evidence provided by the agency addressed  each identified criteria element. Specifically, for each criteria element, we  determined if the evidence fully addressed the element (\u201cmet\u201d),  addressed some, but not all, aspects of the element (\u201cpartially met\u201d), or  did not address any aspects of the element (\u201cnot met\u201d).", "To address the second objective, we administered structured interview  questions to the agencies to determine what challenges, if any, they face  in developing and implementing policies and procedures for managing cybersecurity risk. We developed a list of potential challenges based on  our assessment of agencies\u2019 policies and procedures, a review of OMB\u2019s  risk report on agencies\u2019 cybersecurity risk management capabilities,  and  reviews of prior GAO reports in areas related to cybersecurity risk  management. We worked with GAO methodologists to develop a set of  structured interview questions that were sent to the agencies and asked  them to indicate if they faced each of these, as well as any additional,  challenges, and to provide specific examples. We received responses  from all 23 agencies in our review and analyzed them to identify those  challenges that were indicated by a majority of the agencies. We  excluded from our counts agencies that stated they did not have  challenges in a particular area. We also identified common themes within  the challenge areas.", "To address the third objective, we reviewed EO 13800 and  implementation guidance issued by OMB,  as well as relevant reports  and other documents, including OMB\u2019s Federal Cybersecurity Risk  Determination Report and Action Plan, OMB memos, and supporting  documentation for DHS initiatives. We also interviewed OMB and DHS  officials with government-wide cybersecurity responsibilities to gain an  understanding of initiatives under way to address their responsibilities  under the order, and that could help address challenges identified by the  agencies. We then compared these initiatives to the responses we  received from agencies to determine if there were any gaps between the  challenges and the ongoing initiatives. Specifically, for each challenge  identified by a majority of the agencies in our review, we determined if  any of the initiatives under way would address them based on a review of  documentation associated with the initiatives as well as discussions with  OMB and DHS officials.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2018 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.
