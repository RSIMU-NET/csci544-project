The telecommunications loan portfolio had no delinquencies. Much more of the outstanding electricity loan principal is at risk, however, because it is owed by other borrowers that are experiencing financial distress; for example, they are in bankruptcy or, according to RUS officials, are likely to default on loan repayment in the near future.

At the end of fiscal year 1996, the distribution borrower owed $15.1 million in outstanding principal and $4 million in unpaid interest on RUS\u2019 direct loans. The power supply borrower owed $41.2 million in principal and $21.5 million in interest on RUS\u2019 direct and guaranteed loans. Both borrowers filed for bankruptcy in April 1996. The third delinquent borrower has a high debt level because it invested in a nuclear-generating plant that was not completed.

According to the RUS officials, these borrowers\u2019 problems stem from their investments in nuclear-generating plants that were completed late and over budget or in coal-fired generating plants that were built to satisfy anticipated industrial growth that did not occur. These borrowers\u2019 debts had been restructured at least once in the 1980s or the early part of 1990. Two of these borrowers had filed for bankruptcy: One, with $4.2 billion in outstanding loans, filed in 1994, and the other, with $531 million in outstanding loans, filed in 1996.
