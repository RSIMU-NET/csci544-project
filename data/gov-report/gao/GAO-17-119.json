While algae are essential to the ecosystem, providing food for all types of  animals, HABs can produce toxins, and even non-toxic blooms can hurt  the environment and local economies. Specifically, HABs can cause  human illness or death from consumption of seafood or water  contaminated by toxic algae; harm aquatic and other animal species  through neurological or liver damage or severe oxygen depletion  (hypoxia); and hurt the seafood industry, recreation, and tourism. While  HABs and hypoxia can occur naturally, their prevalence, frequency, and  severity are increasing\u2014and this increase is influenced by climate,  pollution, and human activities such as agriculture and wastewater, which  can produce runoff laden with excess nutrients, according to a report by  HAB outbreaks in the United States with significant environmental and  economic effects include blue-green algae (cyanobacteria) in the Great  Lakes, \u201cred tide\u201d on the Gulf of Mexico coast, and \u201cbrown tide\u201d in the mid- Atlantic states. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) and EPA websites, marine and freshwater HABs  cause millions of dollars per year in economic losses in the United States.  HABs reduce tourism, close beaches, and decrease the catch from both  recreational and commercial fisheries, among other impacts. In the  summer of 2015, NOAA pronounced a bloom from central California to  Alaska to be the largest and most severe marine HAB recorded along the  West Coast in at least 15 years. This HAB event resulted in massive  economic losses because of closures of recreational and commercial  shellfish harvesting areas in three states. For instance, shellfish  managers shortened or closed the razor-clam season in parts of  California, Oregon, and Washington, and closed the southern Washington  coast to Dungeness crab fishing\u2014the largest-ever shutdown of that  state\u2019s multi-million-dollar industry.

To gather expenditure data, we developed  and distributed a questionnaire that asked the 17 agencies to identify their  HAB-related research, monitoring, or other activities at the program and  project levels. To assess the accuracy and completeness of the  expenditure data and to learn of any data limitations, we conducted a  data reliability assessment through written questions and follow-up  interviews, as necessary, with agency officials. Our questions asked for  officials to specify if the associated activities were single-purpose in  addressing HABs only, or if they addressed multiple purposes including  HABs. Of the 17 agencies we contacted, 12 provided HAB-related  expenditure data for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, which we  determined were sufficiently reliable for the purpose of producing a rough  estimate of federal HAB-related expenditures and are presented in this  report.", "Even with the efforts we made to ensure the reliability of the data, each of  the agencies had its own methods for collecting HAB-related expenditure  data.

Some agencies provided actual expenditure data, whereas other  agencies provided estimated expenditure data or obligated funding data.  In addition, we asked agencies to identify whether their HAB-related  activities were (1) single-purpose in addressing HABs only, (2) multi- purpose including HABs, or (3) a mixture of both. The lack of a  standardized approach to collecting HAB-related expenditures across the  agencies means that any comparisons among agencies and any  estimated federal total are inexact. In addition, our questionnaire asked  the agencies for information on (1) their key activities regarding HABs; (2)  the purposes of these activities; (3) the specific statutory provisions  authorizing these activities; and (4) the funding mechanisms used, such  as grants or contracts.", "To determine how federal agencies coordinate their HAB-related activities  with each other and with nonfederal stakeholders, we collected and  analyzed information from the agencies through interviews and our  questionnaire on (1) their participation with each other and nonfederal  stakeholders in interagency working groups or other mechanisms to  share information and coordinate on HABs research, monitoring, or other  activities; (2) efforts taken by federal agencies to minimize duplication;  and (3) gaps, if any, in federal HAB-related activities.

Most algae are not  harmful, and the proliferation of algae generally provides the energy  source to fuel food webs. However, when certain conditions are  favorable, algae can rapidly multiply, causing \u201cblooms\u201d and increasing the  risk of toxin contamination of water. When algae bloom in significant  numbers and produce toxic or harmful effects, such events are termed  HABs. The risk is especially great for blooms caused by some species of  cyanobacteria, historically known as blue-green algae, which typically  occur in freshwater but may also appear in marine environments.  Cyanobacterial HABs are of special concern because of their potential  impacts on drinking and recreational waters. Toxins produced by  cyanobacteria (cyanotoxins) can cause allergic and respiratory issues,  attack the liver and kidneys, or affect the nervous system in mammals,  including humans. Cyanobacterial HABs can also cause detrimental  effects on aquatic ecosystems. High biomass blooms, whether of toxic or  nontoxic species, can accumulate as thick scums and mats, which  decompose, causing excessive oxygen consumption\u2014which, in turn,  leads to an increased mortality rate in local fish, shellfish, invertebrate,  and plant populations because of hypoxia. Cyanobacterial HABs may  also adversely affect some types of flora and fauna because they cause  decreased light penetration. Figure 1 shows a satellite image of the then- record-setting cyanobacterial HAB in Lake Erie in September 2011 (an  even larger Lake Erie HAB set a new algal biomass record in 2015),  overlaid on a map of the lake\u2019s tributaries. This image shows the algal  bloom (in green) covering the entire western basin and beginning to  expand into the central basin of Lake Erie, where it continued to grow  until October 2011."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Marine HABs and Health Impacts", "paragraphs": ["Coastal waters of the United States are subject to most of the major HAB  impacts and poisoning syndromes. Marine HAB impacts on animals and  plant life include fish kills, shellfish mortalities, widespread marine  mammal mortalities, and loss of submerged vegetation. Specifically,  some types of harmful algae produce potent toxins that cause illness or  death in humans and marine organisms\u2014fish, seabirds, manatees, sea  lions, turtles, and dolphins are some commonly affected animals. Other  types of harmful algae are nontoxic to humans but cause harm to fish and  invertebrates by damaging or clogging their gills or by forming such large  blooms that the death, and subsequent decay, of the algae lead to  hypoxia in the bottom waters of marine environments, forcing animals to  either leave the area or die. Birds can also get sick by eating algae,  drinking contaminated water, or eating contaminated fish or shellfish.", "Exposure to marine HAB toxins can occur through direct contact by  swimming (dermal exposure); breathing in aerosolized toxins (toxins in  water turned into tiny airborne droplets or mist); or eating toxin- contaminated seafood, including shellfish and finfish. Impacts on human  health through contaminated seafood include amnesic shellfish poisoning,  ciguatera fish poisoning, diarrhetic shellfish poisoning, neurotoxic shellfish  poisoning, and paralytic shellfish poisoning\u2014illnesses that have been  reported in the United States. Two major groups of marine algae\u2014 diatoms and dinoflagellates\u2014produce HAB toxins that cause these  syndromes. According to NOAA\u2019s website, the toxins that cause these  syndromes have been found in U.S. marine waters, and these syndromes  have adverse human health impacts, as follows:", "Amnesic shellfish poisoning, which is caused by several species of  Pseudo-nitzschia that produce the toxin domoic acid, produces  gastrointestinal and neurological effects. Mild cases arise within 24  hours of consumption of contaminated shellfish. Symptoms include  nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. In more severe  cases, neurological symptoms occur, which include headaches,  hallucinations, confusion, short-term memory loss, respiratory  difficulty, seizures, coma, and, in extreme cases, death. These toxic  species have been found on the Pacific Northwest coast from Canada  to mid-California and the Atlantic northeast coast of Canada, as well  as the Gulf of Mexico.", "Ciguatera fish poisoning is the most common seafood-toxin illness  reported in the world, and certain algal species have caused this  syndrome in many tropical and subtropical regions with coral reefs in  the United States, including Caribbean and Pacific Islands, Florida,  and the Gulf of Mexico. Ciguatoxins are transferred through the food  chain from small toxic algae to large fish, such as grouper, and  produce gastrointestinal, neurological, and cardiovascular symptoms  that usually begin developing within 12 to 24 hours of eating  contaminated fish. Gastrointestinal symptoms include diarrhea,  abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting occur, and neurological  symptoms include numbness and tingling of hands and feet,  dizziness, altered hot/cold perception, muscle aches, and low heart  rates and blood pressure. In extreme cases, death occurs through  respiratory failure.", "Diarrhetic shellfish poisoning is a gastrointestinal illness that has  been reported worldwide. Symptoms usually occur within 30 minutes  to a few hours after consumption of contaminated shellfish. Symptoms  include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain. A full  recovery is expected within 3 days, regardless of medical treatment,  but long-term exposure may promote tumor growth in the digestive  system. Various species of Dinophysis and their related toxins, which  cause this syndrome, have been found along the Texas Gulf coast  and the Chesapeake Bay.", "Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning produces gastrointestinal and  neurological symptoms within 3 to 6 hours of ingestion of  contaminated shellfish. Milder cases may include symptoms of  headaches, diarrhea, and muscle/joint pain and commonly occur  when beachgoers are exposed to toxic aerosols produced by wave  action. Symptoms include irritation of the throat and upper respiratory  tract, causing asthma-like effects. More severe effects are altered  perceptions of hot and cold, difficulty breathing, or double vision.  Neurotoxic shellfish poisoning is caused by Karenia brevis, a toxic  dinoflagellate found in the Gulf of Mexico and the east coast of  Florida. Karenia brevis \u201cred tides\u201d are typically characterized by  patches of discolored water, dead or dying fish, and toxic aerosols.", "Paralytic shellfish poisoning symptoms include tingling sensations  or numbness, headaches, fever, rash, dizziness, and gastrointestinal  illness. In severe cases, symptoms include muscular paralysis,  respiratory difficulty, and choking sensation. Despite the severity of  this toxin, victims generally begin to recover within 12 to 24 hours of  intoxication. In some severe cases, victims may die from paralysis  and respiratory failure. A number of species of the dinoflagellate  Alexandrium, which produce a group of toxins (called saxitoxins)  responsible for paralytic shellfish poisoning, have been observed  along the northeast and west coasts of North America, including  Alaska. Another species associated with this syndrome, Pyrodinium  bahamense, has also been found in Florida. The United States has  reported persistent problems with cases of this syndrome since the  mid-1960s.", "Each of these syndromes is caused by different species of toxic algae  that occur in various coastal waters of the United States and the world.  According to the U.S. National Office for Harmful Algal Blooms\u2019 website,  there are virtually no human populations that are free of risk, in part  because of an increase in interstate and international transport of  seafood. CDC officials stated that records of these syndromes are  incomplete because their diagnosis is difficult, physicians might not  always report cases to their health departments, and reporting to CDC is  voluntary; however, CDC estimates that 15,910 cases of ciguatera fish  poisoning occur in the United States annually. According to NOAA  officials, the recent emergence of diarrhetic shellfish poisoning in U.S.  waters, the massive domoic acid-producing bloom on the West Coast in  2015, and the rapid expansion of cyanobacterial blooms in freshwater  indicate that HABs are an increasing threat in the United States.  However, FDA officials stated that controls are in place to prevent  contaminated seafood from entering interstate commerce.", "Beyond human health threats, NOAA officials noted, marine HABs can  have other deleterious impacts. For example, massive fish kills drive  away tourists, require costly beach cleanup, and impact fisheries  management. Some HABs kill or weaken young stages of shellfish,  damaging shellfish aquaculture and impairing shellfish restoration.  Furthermore, NOAA officials stated, water discoloration and accumulation  of algae on beaches affects tourism and property values. Many of these  effects can have serious economic impacts on communities in coastal  areas that depend on marine resources for their livelihoods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HAB Occurrences in the United States", "paragraphs": ["HABs have occurred in all 50 states in the past decade in marine waters,  freshwaters, or both.

These  conditions may include natural phenomena, such as unusually high water  temperatures; extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, floods, or  drought; or sluggish water circulation that allows biomass to accumulate.  One way that human activities may contribute to HABs is by supplying  nutrients to aquatic ecosystems at a rate that \u201coverfeeds\u201d the algae that  exist naturally. These nutrients (mainly nitrogen, phosphorus, and carbon)  can originate as runoff from lawns and farmland or wastewater  discharges from municipalities and industry.

To  assess the accuracy and completeness of the expenditure data and to  learn of the agencies\u2019 definitions of HAB-related activities and any data  limitations, we conducted a data reliability assessment through written  questions and follow-up interviews, as necessary, with agency officials.  Our questions asked officials to specify if the associated activities were  single-purpose in addressing HABs only, or if they addressed multiple  purposes including HABs. Of the 17 agencies we contacted, 12 provided  HAB-related expenditure data for fiscal years 2013 through 2015, which  we determined were sufficiently reliable for our purposes and are  presented in this report. For informational purposes, we present more  detailed tables in appendix II for each of the agencies\u2019 HAB-related  expenditures, but we did not independently verify these amounts.", "Even with the efforts we made to ensure the reliability of the data, each of  the agencies had its own method for collecting HAB-related expenditure  data, and therefore the numbers presented for each agency may differ  compared to a scenario in which a single, standardized method was  used. For this reason, comparisons of HAB-related expenditures from one  agency to another are inexact. For example, agencies such as NOAA and  NSF each utilized a database to track actual expenditures or obligated  funding for HAB-related activities, whereas agencies such as Navy relied  on subject matter experts or staff estimates. Some agencies provided  actual expenditure data, while other agencies provided estimated  expenditure data or obligated funding data.", "In addition, we asked agencies to identify whether their HAB-related  activities were (1) single-purpose in addressing HABs only, (2) multi- purpose including HABs, or (3) a mixture of both. While we believe the  data are sufficiently reliable for the purpose of producing a rough estimate  of HAB-related expenditures, the lack of a standardized approach to  collecting HAB-related expenditures means that any federal total should  be regarded as a rough estimate, and any comparisons among agencies\u2019  expenditures should be regarded as inexact. In addition, our  questionnaire asked the agencies for information on (1) their agencies\u2019  key activities regarding HABs; (2) the purposes of these activities; (3) the  specific statutory provisions authorizing these activities; and (4) the  funding mechanisms used, such as grants, contracts, or interagency  agreements.", "To determine how federal agencies coordinate their HAB-related activities  with each other and with nonfederal stakeholders, we collected and  analyzed information from the agencies through interviews and our  questionnaire on (1) their participation with each other and nonfederal  stakeholders in interagency working groups or other mechanisms to  share information and coordinate on HABs research, monitoring, or other  activities; (2) efforts taken by federal agencies to minimize duplication;  and (3) gaps, if any, in federal HAB-related activities.
