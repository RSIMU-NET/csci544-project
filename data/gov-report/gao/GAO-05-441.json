The activity group's average sales price increased from $111.87 per hour for fiscal year 2000 to $147.07 per hour for fiscal year 2005--a 31 percent increase (21 percent if adjusted for inflation). An increase in material costs was the major driver of the sales price increase. The Army has identified some causes of the higher material costs such as increased material usage to rebuild certain weapon systems under the Army's recapitalization program and higher prices that it pays suppliers for parts, but it has not completed a comprehensive analysis of material cost increases. As a result, the Army has not been able to take proactive steps to control rising material costs. GAO analysis showed that in setting future prices, the Army spread depot maintenance reported gains and losses across all depots rather than allocating them to the individual depot that incurred the gains or losses. While DOD policy does not specify how to allocate gains and losses at the depot level, this practice does not provide the right incentives to the depots to set prices correctly in the budget. If one depot consistently incurred losses, the Army would increase the prices at other depots to help recoup its losses. As a result, the depot incurring the losses is not held accountable for operating on a break-even basis. The end result of this practice is that customers of depots with consistent losses are, in effect, subsidized by customers of depots with consistent gains. GAO analysis also showed that the reported carryover (work not completed at fiscal year end) exceeded DOD's carryover ceilings from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2003. Too much carryover could result in an activity group receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the work until subsequent fiscal years. Factors contributing to carryover exceeding the ceilings include depots receiving new orders at fiscal year-end and not being able to obtain parts needed in a timely manner. Finally, the Army continued to encounter problems implementing a new system intended to improve depot operations. GAO previously reported on these problems in May 2004, and noted that the Army's inadequate requirements management and system testing were primary contributing factors to the problems. These problems are preventing the Tobyhanna Army Depot from accurately reporting on its financial operations, which, in turn, adversely impacts the depot's ability to accurately set prices. GAO's current review found that the Army has not put into place an effective management process to help ensure that the problems with the system are resolved. While the Army developed a process that identified the specific steps that should be followed in addressing the problems identified, the process was not followed. Until the underlying causes of the problems are corrected, other depots implementing LMP will encounter similar problems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Army depot maintenance activity group supports combat readiness by  providing services necessary to keep Army units operating worldwide.  From fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2004, the group employed  between 10,000 and 13,000 people and received approximately $1.4 billion  to $2.6 billion in new orders each year to repair and overhaul a wide range  of assets, including helicopters such as the Apache and Blackhawk; combat  vehicles such as the Abrams tank; air defense systems such as the Patriot  missile; electronics; and inventory items for the Army, other military  services, and foreign governments.

DOD policy requires  working capital fund activity groups to (1) establish sales prices that allow  them to recover their anticipated costs from their customers and (2)  operate on a break even basis over time\u2014that is, to not make a gain nor  incur a loss, which is referred to as a zero accumulated operating result  (AOR). DOD policy also requires the activity groups to establish their sales  prices prior to the start of each fiscal year and to apply these  predetermined or \u201cstabilized\u201d prices to most orders received during the  year\u2014regardless of when the work is actually accomplished or what costs  are actually incurred. For depot maintenance activity groups, DOD policy  also requires that as long as adequate cash balances are maintained,  unbudgeted operating losses or gains of $10 million or more per activity  group will be recouped or returned, as appropriate. This will occur in the  current fiscal year or, in the case of fourth quarter losses or gains, in the  first quarter of the next fiscal year.", "Developing accurate sales prices is challenging since the process to  determine the prices begins about 2 years in advance of when the work is  actually ordered and performed. In essence, the activity group\u2019s budget  development has to coincide with the development of its customers\u2019  budgets so that they both use the same set of assumptions. To develop  prices, the activity group estimates (1) labor, material, overhead, and other  costs based on anticipated demand for work as projected by customers; (2) total direct labor hours for each type of work performed, such as  helicopters, tanks, and repairable inventory items; (3) the workforce\u2019s  productivity; and (4) savings due to productivity and other cost-avoidance  initiatives. In order for an activity group to operate on a break even basis, it  is extremely important that the activity group accurately estimate the work  it will perform and the costs of performing the work. Higher-than-expected  costs or lower-than-expected customer demand for goods and services can  cause the activity group to incur losses. Conversely, lower-than-expected  costs or higher-than-expected customer demand for goods and services can  result in gains.

As a  result of such deficiencies, the DOD Inspector General (who is required by  31 U.S.C. sec. 3521(e)(1) to conduct an audit of said financial statements)  was unable to express an opinion on the reliability of the Army Working  Capital Fund\u2019s financial statements for fiscal years 1993 through 2004.", "To help improve the Army depot maintenance activity group\u2019s operations,  including financial management, in February 1998, the Army Materiel  Command began an effort to replace systems that are at least 30 years old  that manage inventory and depot maintenance operations with LMP.  According to the Army, LMP is intended to transform the Army Materiel  Command\u2019s logistics operations in six core processes, one being financial  management. LMP is to, among other things, improve accounting and  reporting on billions of dollars worth of Army weapons systems through  fully integrated single-source transaction entry, online/real-time data, and  U.S. Standard General Ledger compliance. Further, LMP is intended to  bring the logistics community to the point of achieving favorable audit  opinions on financial statements.

The labor costs  were less than half the material costs\u2019 portion of the composite price for  fiscal year 2005. Depot officials noted that the labor cost increases were  primarily due to factors beyond the activity group\u2019s control, such as  mandated cost-of-living annual salary increases for federal employees.

Under this program, the depots automatically replaced more parts than  they did previously under a traditional weapon system overhaul. This  resulted in an increase in material costs. For example, under the fiscal  year 2002 recapitalization pilot program, the Letterkenny Army Depot  automatically replaced 142 parts on an individual antenna mast group.  By fiscal year 2004, the number of parts automatically replaced by  Letterkenny increased to 1,938 or 1,264 percent.", "Due to increased prices paid to suppliers for component parts used in  repairs, the cost to repair radar sets used for the Patriot missile has  increased significantly. Depot maintenance officials estimated that for  one Patriot missile radar set, they replace approximately 1,500 of the  5,463 active radar antenna elements when they repair it. In January 2003,  depot maintenance was purchasing the antenna elements for $724  apiece from the supplier. About 15 months later, the purchase price for a  single element increased about 43 percent to $1,038. As a result, the  stabilized sales price for repairing the radar set increased from  $6,450,330 in fiscal year 2003 to $7,284,751 in fiscal year 2004, an  increase of $834,421 or 13 percent in 1 year.", "Due to the recapitalization program, the depot maintenance activity  group raised its sales price for the repair of the Chinook helicopter from  $4,431,953 in fiscal year 2003 to $6,754,808 in fiscal year 2005, an  increase of $2,322,855 or 52 percent.

Corpus Christi Army Depot officials stated that  material costs increased because under the recapitalization program the  depot is required to (1) replace more parts 100 percent of the time  during maintenance and (2) follow tighter inspection criteria, which  results in parts being repaired or replaced more frequently. For  example, the depot increased the number of helicopter parts required to  be replaced during maintenance by 217 when it implemented the  recapitalization program.", "Due primarily to the recapitalization program, the depot maintenance  activity group raised the sales price for the repair of the engine used in  the Armored Vehicle Launch Bridge, a folding portable bridge that is  transported on the top of a tank chassis, and the M88 Hercules Recovery  Vehicle, used to recover tanks. More specifically, the Anniston Army  Depot increased the price for the engine from $58,559 in fiscal year 2003  to $95,451 in fiscal year 2005, an increase of $36,892 or 63 percent.  During this same time period, the materials costs increased by $38,749  or 120 percent from $32,183 to $70,932.

A major cause of this increase was  the material cost growth of $30,280 per vehicle. One example of a part  contributing to the higher material costs is the price of a gyroscope used  on the vehicle increasing from $11,486 in fiscal year 2003 to $19,381 in  fiscal year 2005.

On the other  hand, 58 percent and 15 percent of the ordnance orders were financed with  operation and maintenance and procurement appropriations, respectively.  If the Army continues its current practice of allocating gains and losses  across all activities, customers of activities that make a gain will continue  to subsidize customers of activities that incur a loss.

Too much carryover could result in an activity  group receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing  the work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent fiscal years. In  the past, the Congress has reduced the services\u2019 budgets because of  excessive carryover, including a $48 million reduction in the Army\u2019s fiscal  year 2003 Operation and Maintenance appropriation. Factors contributing  to carryover exceeding the ceilings included depots receiving new orders at  fiscal year-end and depots not being able to obtain material needed to  perform repair work in a timely manner. Furthermore, although the Army\u2019s  reported carryover amount exceeded the ceilings, we found that the Army  understated its reported actual carryover for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.  For example, fiscal year 2003 carryover was understated by $95 million.  According to Army officials, the understatement occurred because DOD\u2019s  verbal guidance was unclear. Based on its interpretation of this guidance,  the Army only included actual carryover on orders received in the current  year but did not include carryover related to orders received in prior years  in calculating its reported actual carryover for fiscal years 2002 and 2003."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "What Is Carryover and Why Is It Important", "paragraphs": ["Carryover is the dollar value of work that has been ordered and funded  (obligated) by customers but not completed by working capital fund  activities at the end of the fiscal year. Carryover consists of both the  unfinished portion of work started but not completed, as well as requested  work that has not yet commenced. Some carryover is necessary at fiscal  year-end if working capital funds are to operate efficiently and effectively.  For example, if customers do not receive new appropriations at the  beginning of the fiscal year, carryover is necessary to ensure that the  working capital fund activities have enough work to ensure a smooth  transition between fiscal years. Too little carryover could result in some  personnel not having work to perform at the beginning of the fiscal year.  On the other hand, too much carryover could result in an activity group  receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year but not performing the  work until well into the next fiscal year or subsequent years. By minimizing  the amount of carryover, DOD can use its resources in the most effective  manner and minimize the \u201cbanking\u201d of funds for work and programs to be  performed in subsequent years.", "In 1996, DOD established a 3-month carryover standard for all working  capital fund activities except for the contract portion of the Air Force depot  maintenance activity group. In May 2001, we reported that DOD did not  have a basis for its carryover standard and recommended that DOD  determine the appropriate carryover standard for the depot maintenance,  ordnance, and research and development activity groups. According to the  Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) and Army officials,  based on our recommendation, in December 2002, DOD provided verbal  guidance concerning its new carryover policy for working capital fund  activities. Subsequently, DOD included its revised carryover policy in its  DOD Financial Management Regulation 7000.14-R, Volume 2B, Chapter 9,  dated June 2004, which eliminated the 3-month standard for allowable  carryover. Under the new policy, the allowable amount of carryover is to be  based on the outlay rate of the customers\u2019 appropriations financing the  work. This meant that in determining allowable carryover, the first year  outlay rate would be used for new orders received in the current year (first  year of the work order). According to the DOD regulation, this new metric  allows for an analytical-based approach that holds working capital fund  activities to the same standard as general fund execution and allows for  more meaningful budget execution analysis."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Reports Showed That the Depot Maintenance Activity Group Consistently Exceeded Carryover Ceiling", "paragraphs": ["Tables 4 and 5 show that the Army depot maintenance activity group\u2019s  actual reported carryover (1) consistently exceeded DOD\u2019s 3-month  carryover standard from fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 2001 and  (2) continued to exceed the allowable amount of carryover as calculated  under DOD\u2019s revised carryover policy for fiscal years 2002 and 2003.", "Officials at the four depots that exceeded their carryover ceilings informed  us that reported actual year-end carryover exceeded the allowable amount  because some depots received and accepted work late in the fiscal year and  some depots could not obtain the material needed in a timely manner, so  that less work was performed than planned.

Upon starting the work, depot  officials said they discovered that many of the parts needed for the  overhaul were no longer readily available, thus requiring the depot to  research where the parts could be obtained.

For example, the dollar amount of reported  actual carryover was understated by $95 million at the end of fiscal year  2003 because carryover related to orders received in fiscal year 2002 and  prior years was not included. Army officials at headquarters, the Army  Materiel Command, and the depots acknowledged that the actual carryover  figures did not include carryover related to prior year orders.

The Army interpreted the new  guidance to include only actual carryover on orders received in the current  year and instructed the Army Materiel Command to calculate carryover  accordingly. The Army Materiel Command then provided this guidance to  the depots.

However, this regulation did not contain specific instructions for  determining allowable carryover for work not completed on prior year  orders. To clarify its June 2004 written guidance, DOD again provided the  Army verbal guidance on calculating the allowable carryover amount for  work not completed on prior year orders. Based on the verbal guidance, the  Army used the first year outlay rate for both (1) current year orders and  (2) work not completed on prior year orders. We questioned this  methodology for calculating allowable carryover with officials from the  Army and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller), and  why they were applying the first year outlay rates to prior year orders  instead of the applicable second or third year outlay rates. By using only  the first year rates, the Army was allowed more carryover.

Of the 80 items, we found that 32  items had been either merged with another corrective action or  cancelled\u2014meaning they should not have been included in the stabilization  item inventory. For the remaining items, our analysis identified numerous  instances in which the stated processes were not being followed. As a  result, the Army was unable to provide evidence to show us that the  stabilization items had been corrected. Our analysis disclosed the  following:  The requirements documentation was inadequate or nonexistent for 24  items. As previously noted, the lack of adequately defined requirements  was one of the primary reasons LMP experienced problems when it was  initially deployed in July 2003. Further, since requirements represent the  blueprint that system developers and program managers use, it is  unclear how the individuals assigned to correct a given problem would  know exactly what needed to be fixed, e.g., the detailed business rules  that needed to be implemented.", "Testing documentation was insufficient for 33 items. In some cases,  while there was documentation related to testing, the requirement had  not been properly defined. Therefore, one could not ascertain if testing  was properly conducted. For example, without documentation defining  the business rules that should be used, a tester cannot develop the types  of tests to ensure those business rules are implemented. As discussed  previously, we found numerous problems with the implementation of  the business rules that should be used for recognizing revenue and  billing.", "Documentation is one means available to indicate that the stated processes  are being followed. Without the appropriate documentation, the Army does  not have reasonable assurance that all of the required steps are being  followed and cannot validate that a stabilization item has been corrected.  Further, if a planned corrective action does not resolve a stated problem,  the documentation, particularly for requirements and testing, can be used  to ascertain if the requirement was properly defined. In terms of testing, the  documentation would help indicate if the test was properly designed based  upon the stated requirement and if all of the attributes were tested as  required.", "The following are specific examples of cases in which the problem  resolution process was not followed and, therefore, the Army did not have  reasonable assurance and could not demonstrate to us that these  stabilization items were resolved:  One corrective action related to labor charges was shown as completed  in July 2004. However, the Army could not provide documentation to  substantiate that (1) requirements were developed, (2) government  approval was received, and (3) oversight board approval was obtained.  Although a testing document was provided, it was impossible to  determine its adequacy since a corresponding requirements document  was not available for review.", "Another corrective action designed to resolve inaccurate entries in the  general ledger was shown as completed on July 30, 2004. However, the  Army could not provide documentation that indicated that the  requirements were developed, testing was performed, and government  approval was received. In addition, we found a note that indicated  approval by the oversight board was not necessary, but no one could  explain why the board\u2019s approval was not needed.", "In discussing these issues with Army officials, they acknowledged that  although the problem resolution process was documented in May 2004, it  was not until October 2004 that all items that were submitted to the  oversight board were required to contain the requisite documentation. To  ascertain if the project had effectively implemented the disciplined  processes over other corrective actions subsequent to this later time frame,  we reviewed 14 \u201ctrouble tickets\u201d\u2014specific LMP output problems identified  by Tobyhanna users\u2014that were reported as completed from October 2004  through January 2005. These trouble tickets were be resolved with  essentially the same process used for stabilization items discussed  previously. For example, the problems identified by Tobyhanna were  expected to be reviewed to determine the causes and, if the problems were  caused by the system, the following steps should be taken and  documented: (1) identify the cause of the problem and the corrective  action that needed to be taken (requirements), (2) perform adequate  testing to ensure that the problem was fixed and did not adversely affect  other LMP functionality, and (3) obtain approval by the contractor and LMP  staff. In each case, we found that documentation was not available to  validate that the process had been followed and the problem resolved.  Examples are discussed below.", "In October 2004, a program was developed and placed into operation to  address billing problems reported by Tobyhanna. However, it did not fix  the problem and generated so many errors that the resulting bills could  not be released to the customers. In fact, because of the number of  errors produced by this \u201cfix,\u201d a stabilization item to clean up the  erroneous data was generated. LMP officials stated they were unsure  why this happened. Because of the large number of errors generated, it  was clear that adequate testing had not been performed on this program  before it was placed into production.", "As noted previously, one of the major problems with LMP is its inability  to properly recognize revenue and bill customers. One cause of this  problem is that, in some cases, the system did not include an estimated  value for the planned costs of customer orders that were being  processed by Tobyhanna. When this condition occurred, improper  amounts of revenue were being recognized and improper bills prepared.  The Army recognized this problem early in the LMP deployment and  developed a \u201cfix\u201d in September 2003. However, we found the problem  was still continuing as late as January 2005, and the Army did not know  why the September 2003 corrective action was not working as planned.  If the Army had implemented the necessary disciplined processes, it  would have likely been able to (1) identify the cause of the initial  problem and (2) determine why the September 2003 corrective action  was not working. In one case, this problem generated revenue of over  $2.8 million that should not have been recognized, and in another case a  customer was improperly billed for over $1 million."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The Army depot maintenance group has not always achieved the goals  envisioned under the working capital fund concept\u2014that is, to operate like  a business by developing and using effective methods to control operating  costs, charging customers prices that result in break-even status at year- end, and ensuring that accurate and timely information is available to  manage and report on financial management operations. Specific examples  of management weaknesses in this area include the lack of proactive steps  to control rising material costs, overcharging certain depot maintenance  customers, and excessive amounts of year-end carryover, which could  result in an activity group receiving funds from customers in one fiscal year  but not performing the work until well into subsequent fiscal years, thus  tying up funds for lengthy periods that could otherwise be put to more  beneficial near-term use. Finally, DOD\u2019s inability to develop and implement  systems solutions on time and with the promised capability appears to be a  critical impediment in the planned transformation of depot operations.  Flaws in the early stages of system development, including inadequate  requirements management and system testing, are now manifested in  significant LMP implementation problems at Tobyhanna.

While DOD  concurred with all the recommendations, it noted that our report did not  fully address the effects of the Global War on Terrorism and the impact it  had on maintenance workload at the Army depots. According to DOD,  support for the war more than doubled the depot workload driving up  personnel and material costs. As stated in our report, we agree that the war  on terrorism has affected the depots\u2019 workload and impacted material and  personnel costs.  However, the war on terrorism does not affect the Army\u2019s  (1) practice of spreading gains and losses across all depots, (2) calculation  of reported actual carryover and the allowable amount of carryover, and  (3) development of LMP. Regarding increasing material costs, we agree that  the war does affect overall material costs. However, material costs per  direct labor hour more than doubled from $29.09 in fiscal year 2000 to  $65.23 in fiscal year 2005 and accounted for over 100 percent of the sales  price increase that occurred during this same time period. Because of this  significant increase, we still believe that the Army needs to identify all  material cost drivers and take proactive steps to control them.", "In its comments, DOD concurred with the nine recommendations in the  draft report. For most of the recommendations, DOD identified specific  actions it will take to implement them. For example, DOD believes the  Army should make every effort to control the growth of material costs.  While DOD believes the increase in material costs are, in part, related to  wartime demand increases, the Army will determine the factors affecting  pricing. Also, the Army indicated that it has updated its budget formulation  guidance stating that gains and losses should be allocated to the individual  industrial installations if a several year trend shows that an installation has  consistently realized gains or losses. Further, the Under Secretary of  Defense (Comptroller) will issue guidance clarifying the present carryover  policy concerning the calculation of actual carryover as well as the  allowable amount of carryover. Finally, the Army concurred with our  recommendations on LMP and recognized that it cannot move forward  with future deployments to other depots until critical problems identified  at the Tobyhanna Army Depot are corrected.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairmen and Ranking Minority  Members of the Senate Committee on Armed Services; the Subcommittee  on Readiness and Management Support, Senate Committee on Armed  Services; the Subcommittee on Defense, Senate Committee on  Appropriations; the House Committee on Armed Services; the  Subcommittee on Readiness, House Committee on Armed Services; and the  Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Defense, House Committee  on Appropriations.

We determined the reasonableness of  the figures by reviewing and analyzing the cost factor data at each depot  and the Army Materiel Command. We determined which factors caused the  prices to increase the most and discussed the reasons for the price  increases with officials at the Army Materiel Command and the five Army  depots. In addition, we met with Army Materiel Command and depot  officials to determine what actions they were taking to identify the causes  for increasing material costs\u2014a significant factor causing the majority of  the prices to increase from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005. We also  obtained information on the impact of increasing material costs on  repairing certain weapon systems such as the Patriot missile, Chinook  helicopter, and Bradley fighting vehicle. To assess the reliability of the data,  we (1) reviewed and analyzed the factors used in determining the prices  and (2) interviewed Army officials knowledgeable about the data.

We also reviewed customer  orders to determine why the work was not completed on these orders by  the end of the fiscal year. Further, through a review of documentation and  discussions with officials at Army headquarters, the Army Materiel  Command, the depots, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense  (Comptroller), we determined (1) whether the Army was implementing  DOD\u2019s new carryover policy and (2) how allowable carryover and actual  reported carryover were being calculated under the new carryover policy.", "To determine if the Army encountered problems with the implementation  of LMP at the Tobyhanna Army Depot, we (1) identified problems reported  by system users at the Tobyhanna Army Depot to the system developers  and implementers (Army Materiel Command and CSC), (2) analyzed  actions taken by the Army and its contractor to resolve reported system  problems, (3) analyzed system stabilization plan to determine whether  system problems were sufficiently identified and understood to allow  proper problem resolution, (4) analyzed Army\u2019s project management  processes to determine whether underlying root causes of system  problems were identified and appropriate system solutions were developed  to resolve reported system problems, and (5) analyzed Tobyhanna\u2019s  financial reports produced by the legacy system and LMP at the time of  conversion to LMP to determine whether differences in account balances  were identified and reconciled.
