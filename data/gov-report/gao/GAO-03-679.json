Both agencies offer services and resources to support and encourage telework in the federal government. However, these agencies have not fully coordinated their telework efforts and have had difficulty in resolving their conflicting views on telework-related matters. As a consequence, agencies have not received consistent, inclusive, unambiguous support and guidance related to telework. After we discussed the issues created by the lack of coordination between GSA and OPM with both agencies, a GSA official then indicated that GSA and OPM expressed a new commitment to coordination. Such a commitment reflects a promising start for better assisting federal agencies in improved implementation of their telework programs. However, the key to success will be sustained efforts by both agencies to work together in assisting agencies and providing consistent and straightforward guidance, services, and resources on the governmentwide telework initiative. GAO identified 25 key practices in telework-related literature and guidelines as those that federal agencies should implement in developing telework programs and grouped these practices under seven categories. While the four selected executive agencies we reviewed--the Department of Education (Education), GSA, OPM, and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)--have taken at least some steps to implement most of the key practices, only 7 of the 25 key practices, such as establishing a cross-functional project team and establishing an agencywide telework policy, had been fully implemented by all four agencies. Although some telework-related resources from GSA and OPM provide federal agencies with information on how to implement several of the key practices we identified, agencies may need additional guidance, guidelines, and/or individualized technical support to fully implement these practices."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Telework, also referred to as telecommuting or flexiplace, has gained  widespread attention over the past decade in both the public and private  sectors as a human capital flexibility that offers a variety of potential  benefits to employers, employees, and society.1,   The term telework refers  to work that is performed at an employee\u2019s home or at a work location  other than a traditional office.  Using such readily available flexibilities as  management tools is critical to addressing the federal government\u2019s human  capital challenges.  In the Office of Personnel Management\u2019s (OPM) 2003  report to Congress on the status of telework in the federal government, the  Director of OPM described telework as \u201can invaluable management tool  which not only allows employees greater flexibility to balance their  personal and professional duties, but also allows both management and  employees to cope with the uncertainties of potential disruptions in the  workplace, including terrorist threats.\u201d", "Throughout this report, the terms telework, telecommuting, and flexiplace are used  interchangeably. which selected federal agencies are implementing key practices in  developing telecommuting programs, and (4) identify additional  governmentwide actions that could be taken to encourage federal agencies  to increase telecommuting participation.", "We took several steps to address these objectives.  In order to characterize  the federal laws and their requirements that currently apply to  telecommuting within the federal agencies in the executive branch, we  identified and analyzed the relevant laws and discussed the requirements of  selected laws with agency officials.  To determine what GSA and OPM are  doing to coordinate and promote telecommuting in the federal government,  we interviewed GSA and OPM officials regarding their governmentwide  telework efforts and analyzed documents related to these efforts.  We  determined the extent to which selected federal agencies are implementing  key practices in developing telecommuting programs by first conducting a  review of literature and guidelines to identify these practices.  Then, we  interviewed agency officials and analyzed documents related to telework  implementation at four agencies\u2014the Department of Education  (Education), the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), GSA, and OPM.   These agencies were selected for various reasons, including function, size,  and reported level of telework participation.  This agency selection  process was not designed to produce findings that could be considered  representative of telework implementation in the federal government as a  whole, but rather to provide illustrative examples of the extent to which  selected individual agencies had used the key practices identified in our  literature review.  To identify additional governmentwide actions that could  be taken to encourage federal agencies to increase telecommuting  participation, we interviewed officials and union representatives from the  four selected agencies, as well as other unions representing federal  employees.  Our review was conducted in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.  (See app. I for additional  information on our scope and methodology.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Over the last decade, telework has emerged as a management tool in the  federal government.  Congress and the executive branch have shown  interest in telework, primarily based upon the belief that its use will benefit  the federal government.  Benefits of telework include reducing traffic  congestion and pollution, improving recruitment and retention of  employees, increasing productivity, and reducing the need for office space.   Employees also can realize benefits from teleworking, including reduced  commuting time; lowered costs in areas such as transportation, parking,  food, and wardrobe; removal of barriers for those with disabilities who  want to be part of the workforce; and improvement in the quality of  worklife and morale accruing from the opportunity to better balance work  and family demands.  Guidance issued by the Federal Emergency  Management Agency, along with telework-related literature, also suggests  that telework programs can facilitate emergency preparedness by helping  agencies to maintain continuity of operations in emergency situations,  thereby increasing agencies\u2019 effectiveness.  In light of the uncertainties  facing the United States today, telework can be a particularly relevant and  useful tool.", "The importance of telework to federal employees has been highlighted in  recent studies.  Based on its 2000 Merit Principles Survey, the U.S. Merit  Systems Protection Board (MSPB) reported that, of all the family-friendly  programs studied, telework showed the greatest disparity between  importance and availability, potentially making it the most desired but least  available family-friendly program.  In addition, the MSPB said that, of all  the work-life programs it asked about in the survey, only telework  appeared to have a relationship to employees\u2019 intentions regarding leaving  their employment in the coming year, with those who considered telework  important being more likely to plan to leave when it is not available (55  percent) than when it is available (44 percent).  According to OPM\u2019s 2002  Federal Human Capital Survey, almost 74 percent of federal employee  respondents said that telework was at least somewhat important to them.", "Despite this level of importance, more than 59 percent of the respondents  reported that this flexibility was not available to them.", "Since 1990, Congress has supported the telework initiative by holding  hearings and passing a number of laws related to telework, including laws  that provided for the establishment and funding of the GSA telework  centers.  Most significant was the Department of Transportation and  Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2001, Pub. L. No. 106-346, October  23, 2000.  Section 359 of this law provides the current mandate for telework  in the executive branch of the federal government.  This law, which was to  be implemented in 25 percent increments over 4 years, required each  federal agency to \u201cestablish a policy under which eligible employees of the  agency may participate in telecommuting to the maximum extent possible  without diminished employee performance\u201d and instructed OPM to provide  for the law\u2019s requirements to be met.", "Telework has also received significant attention in the executive branch  since 1990, when the President\u2019s Council on Management Improvement  approved plans for the implementation of a governmentwide pilot  flexiplace program.  In the executive branch, telework has been proposed  as a tool to address a number of issues, including establishing a family- friendly workplace, reducing traffic congestion and pollution, and enabling  people with disabilities to join the federal workforce.  Currently, GSA and  OPM share responsibilities for the federal government\u2019s telework initiative,  providing federal agencies with services and resources related to this  initiative.  To this end, both GSA and OPM have included strategies, goals,  and measures directly related to their efforts to support the  governmentwide telework initiative in their fiscal year 2003 annual  performance plans and their related strategic plans.  For example, GSA\u2019s  fiscal year 2003 performance plan includes a goal to increase the  percentage of federal employees that telework to 5 percent by the end of  fiscal year 2003 under its performance goal to increase the number of  agency programs meeting their social and environmental responsibilities in  areas of GSA\u2019s Office of Governmentwide Policy responsibility.", "Also among efforts in the executive branch was the formation of an  Interagency Telework Issues Working Group, with participants from 15  federal agencies.  GSA and OPM jointly established and led this group,  which canvassed agencies to identify policy actions needed to facilitate  agency use and expansion of telework.  A final report, issued in August  2002, contained a series of recommendations related to such policy  actions.", "Interest in and implementation of telework programs has also occurred in  states and foreign countries.  Several states piloted telework programs in  state government agencies in the mid- to late 1990s and have since  implemented telework in individual agencies or on a statewide basis.  For  example, in Florida, telework became a permanent option for state  employees in October 1998 after two 3-year pilot studies.  In Europe, about  6 percent of the workforce was teleworking as of 1999 and, in some  countries, the participation rate for telework was higher.  Finland, for  example, had a telework participation rate of about 17 percent of the  workforce in 1999.  However, only 4 percent of all teleworkers in European  countries worked for government entities.", "According to OPM\u2019s January 2003 report to Congress on the status of  telework in the federal government, 77 executive agencies reported that, as  of November 2002, 90,010 of their employees teleworked on either a regular  or episodic basis, which is 5 percent of those agencies\u2019 1,806,192  employees.  The U.S. Department of Labor reported that, in May 2001, 19.8  million persons, accounting for 15 percent of total employment, usually did  some work at home as part of their job.  However, only 17 percent of these  workers had a formal arrangement with their employer to be paid for the  work they did at home."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Laws and Their Requirements Cover a Gamut of Telework Issues", "paragraphs": ["Legislation related to telework began to emerge from Congress in 1990.   Since then, these provisions have typically, but not always, been included  in a variety of appropriations acts and have covered a wide range of issues  related to telework.  The statutory framework for telework includes  provisions that require agencies to take certain actions related to telework,  provide agencies with tools for supporting telework, and provide both GSA  and OPM with lead roles in the implementation of telework in the federal  government.", "Within this framework, the most significant congressional action was the  enactment of Section 359 of Pub. L. No. 106-346 in October 2000, which  provides the current mandate for telecommuting in the executive branch of  the federal government.  This law, for the first time, required each  executive branch agency to establish a telework policy \u201cunder which  eligible employees of the agency may participate in telecommuting to the  maximum extent possible without diminished employee performance.\u201d  It  also directed OPM to provide that the law\u2019s requirements were applied to  25 percent of the federal workforce by April 2001 and to an additional 25  percent of the federal workforce in each subsequent year, until 2004 when  the law is to be applied to 100 percent of the federal workforce.  The  requirements of this law should also be considered in combination with its  conference report and guidance that has been issued by OPM.", "The conference report accompanying Pub. L. No. 106-346 stated that  agencies shall \u201cdevelop criteria to be used in implementing [a  telecommuting] policy\u201d and \u201censure that managerial, logistical,  organizational, or other barriers to full implementation and successful  functioning of the policy are removed.\u201d  Furthermore, it stated that  agencies \u201cshould also provide for adequate administrative, human  resources, technical, and logistical support for carrying out the policy.\u201d  It  also clarified what constitutes eligibility for telework by defining an eligible  employee as \u201cany satisfactorily performing employee of the agency whose  job may typically be performed at least one day per week [by  telecommuting].\u201d", "On February 9, 2001, OPM sent a memorandum to department and agency  heads containing guidance on the requirements of Pub. L. No. 106-346 that  directed agencies to examine the barriers that inhibit the use of  telecommuting, act to remove them, and increase participation.  This  memorandum went on to say, \u201cThe law recognizes that not all positions are  appropriate for telecommuting; therefore, each agency must identify  positions that are appropriate in a manner that focuses on broad objective  criteria.  Once an agency has established eligibility criteria, subject to any  applicable agency policies or bargaining obligations, employees who meet  them and want to participate must be allowed that opportunity if they are  satisfactory performers.\u201d  OPM recently clarified this statement in a  publication entitled, Telework: A Management Priority\u2014A Guide for  Managers, Supervisors, and Telework Coordinators.  This guide, which  was released on May 8, 2003, indicates that agencies should offer eligible  employees the opportunity to telework by having supervisors extend the  option of teleworking to all employees they determine are eligible, using  established criteria.", "Congress also passed other laws that require agencies to take certain  actions related to telework.  One such provision requires executive  agencies to consider whether needs for additional space can be met using  alternative workplace arrangements, such as telework.  Another recent  provision, contained in the fiscal year 2003 appropriations for the  Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judiciary, and the Small  Business Administration, makes $100,000 available to each of the  departments and agencies covered by this provision only for the  implementation of telecommuting programs.  These departments and  agencies are required to provide the committees on appropriations with a  report on the status of their telecommuting programs every 6 months and  to designate a \u201cTelework Coordinator\u201d to oversee the implementation of  telecommuting programs.", "In addition to these provisions, another provision directs executive  agencies to make a minimum of $50,000 available annually for the  necessary expenses to carry out telecommuting programs, which would  permit employees of 20 specified federal departments and agencies,  including Education, GSA, OPM, VA, the Department of the Interior (DOI),  and the Department of Energy (DOE), to perform all or a portion of their  duties at GSA telework centers.  However, a provision has been included  in the appropriations acts for DOI and related agencies since fiscal year  2001 prohibiting several departments and agencies, including DOI and  DOE, from using appropriated funds for the use of \u201cGSA  telecommunication centers.\u201d  GSA officials believe that the provisions  contained in these appropriations laws were intended to apply to GSA  telework centers.  However, this remains unclear, because these statutes  pertain to \u201cGSA telecommunication centers,\u201d which is not a title by which  the GSA telework centers are known.  At least in some instances, though,  this provision has not been applied to the telework centers.  OPM\u2019s January  2003 report to Congress identified two of the agencies prohibited from  using funds as described by this provision\u2014DOI and DOE\u2014as having  provided funds for telework center usage fees in fiscal year 2002.", "Generally, when statutory provisions in separate laws are in conflict, as  may be the case with the laws detailed above, the requirements of the most  recently passed law supercede the requirements of the earlier law.  In this  case, the provision prohibiting the use of funds for \u201cGSA  telecommunication centers\u201d would take precedence over the provision that  requires specified agencies to make $50,000 available annually for use of  the GSA telework centers, but only for those departments or agencies that  are common to both provisions.  However, because of the lack of a  definition or explanation for \u201cGSA telecommunication centers\u201d in the  appropriations law and the fact that the legislative history does not provide  any insight, it is not clear whether the provisions are in conflict.  Given that  both of these provisions refer to one or more types of GSA operations, GSA  should work with Congress to determine what was meant by the phrase  \u201cGSA telecommunication centers\u201d and then issue guidance to the relevant  agencies to clarify these provisions and explain the impact of these laws on  agencies\u2019 telework programs.", "Congress has also provided agencies with several tools to support  telework.  For example, federal agencies were authorized to spend money  for installation of telephone lines, related equipment, and monthly charges  for federal teleworkers through legislation that was originally enacted in  1990 and made permanent in 1995.  In 1992, Congress established the first  federal telework centers, which were to be maintained by GSA.  Since  then, Congress has passed several laws to continue funding the centers,  change the formula for funding the centers, and add new telework center  locations.", "The legislative framework for telework also contains provisions that  provide both GSA and OPM with lead roles in the implementation of  telework in the federal government.  As stated above, Pub. L. No. 106-346  directs OPM to provide that the requirements of the law are applied as  specified with regard to the federal workforce.  In addition, $500,000 of the  money appropriated for OPM\u2019s salaries and expenses for fiscal year 2003 is  intended to be used by OPM to provide a telecommuting training program  to educate managers in executive branch agencies, where less than 2  percent of employees telework, about the benefits and logistics of  telework.  According to OPM\u2019s comments on a draft of this report, the  agency plans to conduct focus groups for managers in four locations across  the country this summer to identify reasons why some managers resist  permitting telework.  OPM plans to use the focus group data to tailor  agency telework training.  OPM indicated that it plans to train agencies\u2019  human resources directors and telework coordinators and provide them  promotional telework materials.  Congress has also provided GSA with a  lead role in the federal government\u2019s telework initiative, giving the agency  responsibility for maintaining the federal telework centers and the  authority to provide guidance, assistance, and oversight regarding the  establishment and operation of telework and other distributive work  arrangements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Clarity in OPM Guidance Led to Misleading Telework Data, but OPM Has Recently Taken Steps to Address This Issue", "paragraphs": ["Until recently, OPM had not defined a statement contained in its February  2001 guidance regarding the implementation of Pub. L. No. 106-346, which  told agencies that employees who wanted to participate in teleworking  must be allowed that opportunity.  Without such a definition, we found that  the agencies we reviewed did not use equivalent interpretations of this  statement, resulting in their reporting incomparable data to OPM.  These  data were subsequently included in OPM\u2019s 2003 report to Congress on the  status of telework in the federal government.  After we discussed this issue  with OPM officials, OPM reacted promptly by issuing new guidelines that  defined what it meant by allowing this opportunity.", "Our discussions with officials at the four agencies we reviewed and  analysis of data in OPM\u2019s January 2003 report to Congress revealed that,  without a definition from OPM regarding what constituted being allowed  the opportunity to telework, agencies had not always used equivalent  interpretations of this statement in reporting their data.  For example,  telework program officials at both GSA and OPM told us that, for their  internal programs, they considered eligible employees to have been  allowed the opportunity to telework if they chose to apply for telework or  discuss the option of teleworking with their managers, regardless of  whether they were actually approved for telework.  In keeping with this  interpretation, these two agencies reported, in response to OPM\u2019s 2002  governmentwide telework survey, that essentially the same number of  employees who were eligible for telework had also been given that  opportunity.  On the other hand, Education and VA reported significant  differences between the number of employees who were eligible for  telework and those who were given the opportunity to telework, which  demonstrated that they were using different interpretations of opportunity  than GSA and OPM.  Because these agencies were not applying equivalent  interpretations of the term \u201copportunity,\u201d the data that they provided in  response to OPM\u2019s survey and that OPM included in its report to Congress  were not comparable across agencies.  Moreover, OPM\u2019s 2003 report to  Congress showed these data as the number of eligible employees \u201coffered\u201d  telework, although OPM had not made it clear, in either the survey or in its  previously issued guidance, that agencies should interpret allowing the  opportunity to mean directly offering eligible employees the option to  telework.  Furthermore, characterizing all agencies\u2019 data in this manner is  misleading because, as shown above, some agencies did not use that  interpretation in reporting the data.", "We met with OPM officials in late April 2003 and informed them that the  lack of a written definition of what OPM meant when it asked agencies to  report how many eligible employees had been allowed the opportunity to  telework had resulted in incomparable telework data.  To its credit, OPM  reacted promptly by defining the statement in a set of frequently asked  questions that were distributed at its quarterly telework coordinators\u2019  meeting on May 6, 2003, and in a new telework guide for managers,  supervisors, and telework coordinators that was released 2 days later.   Both the frequently asked questions and the guide indicate that agencies  should offer eligible employees the opportunity to telework by having  supervisors extend the option of teleworking to all employees they  determine are eligible, using established criteria.  To ensure that the  information contained in the guide reaches all federal telework  coordinators, an OPM official said that a hard copy of this guide would be  mailed to each coordinator.  In addition, the guide has been posted at  www.telework.gov.", "OPM also further clarified the statement about allowing eligible employees  an opportunity to telework by including a definition in the draft survey it  plans to send to agencies in the fall to obtain data for its January 2004  status report to Congress.  Immediately following our meeting with OPM  officials, this draft survey was distributed at OPM\u2019s May 2003 quarterly  telework coordinators meeting.  As in last year\u2019s survey, respondents would  be asked for the number of eligible employees given the opportunity to  telework.  However, the following additional wording has been proposed  for that question:  \u201cHow many eligible employees are given the opportunity  to telework, i.e. are actively asked if they wish to telework or are able to  telework because their supervisor informed them they could telework on  some basis?\u201d  If this new definition is properly applied by all agencies in  reporting data to OPM, this should address the issue we found.  Also  included in the draft survey are two new proposed questions related to  allowing employees the opportunity to telework.  These questions ask how  employees were presented with the option to telework and how many  turned it down.", "The steps taken by OPM in response to our findings show a ready  willingness to address issues that are hindering telework implementation.   Continued efforts by OPM to publicize these new telework guidelines will  help to ensure that telework coordinators in federal agencies have a clear  understanding of the information they need to fully implement their own  telework programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GSA and OPM Provide Services and Resources to Support Governmentwide Telework Implementation, but Their Efforts Have Not Been Well Coordinated", "paragraphs": ["As discussed earlier, the legislative framework for telework has provided  both GSA and OPM with lead roles in the implementation of telework in the  federal government, providing each agency with responsibilities for the  telework initiative.  Given these responsibilities, GSA and OPM provide  federal agencies with a range of services and resources related to this  initiative.  Table 1 summarizes their efforts in this regard.", "As shown in table 1, some of the services and resources are offered jointly  by both agencies, while others are offered individually by both agencies or  uniquely by either GSA or OPM.  For example, each of these agencies  independently provides consulting, marketing, and training services, but  only OPM has undertaken an outreach effort to meet face to face with  agencies\u2019 telework coordinators and GSA has sole responsibility for federal  telework centers.", "In addition, although a GSA official told us that GSA has been promoting its  E-Connected Intelligent Remote Operations (EIRO) feature as a mobile  solution for government agencies, we found that this feature was not  functioning for a period of at least 5 months in 2003.  According to its Web  site, EIRO was supposed to have launched in March 2001 and was  intended to offer services and products from GSA Federal Supply  Schedules for mobile government work, including telework.  The EIRO  Web site also states that customers seeking mobile solutions could identify  providers that are highlighted as EIRO contractors by the EIRO logo at  \u201cGSA Advantage!\u201d, GSA\u2019s online shopping and ordering system; however, a  GSA official told us that this function was never operational.  Also,  although this official told us that EIRO had launched on schedule, from a  period of at least January 2003 through May 2003, we observed that this  feature was not functional.  We asked numerous GSA officials about the  status of this feature, but they were all unaware of the problems we were  experiencing.  In fact, one official told us that GSA had been promoting  EIRO to federal agencies as if it were a functioning feature.  Ultimately, a  GSA official told us that changes to the agency\u2019s Web portals must have  disabled the EIRO feature and assured us that GSA is pursuing solutions to  get it back online.", "Although GSA and OPM share responsibilities for the governmentwide  telework initiative and a GSA official recently indicated that GSA and OPM  have expressed a new commitment to working together, their past efforts  did not always demonstrate coordination.  According to officials at both  agencies, GSA and OPM have not developed a Memorandum of  Understanding or other formal agreement regarding their responsibilities  for the federal government\u2019s telework initiative or regarding which agency  will provide specific services, resources, and guidance.  Therefore, these  agencies have not established a delineation of their respective roles.  In  comments on a draft of this report, GSA and OPM said that they have  recognized the need to better outline separate and shared responsibilities  and that a Memorandum of Understanding was among the options they  were considering to clearly designate each agency\u2019s responsibilities.", "Despite the fact that GSA and OPM hold quarterly partnership meetings to  discuss telework-related issues in the federal government, officials from  both agencies told us that very little coordination has occurred at these  meetings.  Rather, the meetings have actually served as a means to raise  differences of opinion that have been identified by either agency, but the  resolution of those differences has proven to be difficult.  In addition,  according to the GSA and OPM officials, these meetings are used to present  updates on the status of the two agencies\u2019 independent governmentwide  telework efforts, not to collaborate on these efforts.  On occasion, officials  from each agency have asked officials from the other agency to provide  comments on their independent draft guidelines or other information.", "In addition, a GSA official told us that agencies had expressed concern  about conflicting messages they had received from GSA and OPM on  several topics, including dependent care and emergency government office  closings.  For example, officials from both GSA and OPM confirmed that  they had different positions with regard to dependent care.  GSA\u2019s position  is that employees can care for dependents when teleworking, as long as it  does not interfere with accomplishing tasks, while OPM\u2019s position was,  until recently, that dependents should not be in the home when an  employee is teleworking.  An OPM official told us that the agency held this  position because having dependents in the home while teleworking could  foster managerial resistance to telework.  In its recently released telework  guide for managers, supervisors, and telework coordinators, OPM revised  its position on this issue, stating that a teenager or elderly dependent might  be at home while the employee teleworks if those dependents are  independently pursuing their own activities.  It also said that teleworkers  should not generally be engaged in caregiving activities while working and  that dependent care arrangements should not typically change because the  employee is teleworking.", "Also, despite the fact that both GSA and OPM shared responsibility for  developing the governmentwide telework information Web site  (www.telework.gov), a GSA official told us that OPM, which hosts the joint  Web site, independently changed the layout and content of the site in late  2002 without consulting with or informing GSA about the changes.  The  GSA official also said that GSA subsequently met with OPM and the  contractor that redesigned the site to try to resolve some of GSA\u2019s  concerns.  According to the official, the contractor ultimately agreed with  GSA and recommended that OPM make changes to the site, because it  looked too much like an OPM site and not like the telework site for the  entire federal government.  While an OPM official confirmed this  information, she said that OPM has rejected these changes because of  \u201cinternal Web design policies.\u201d  In their combined comments on a draft of  this report, however, GSA and OPM indicated that there was no  disagreement regarding the Web site and that \u201cboth agencies continue to  actively and successfully collaborate on www.telework.gov.\u201d", "Furthermore, a GSA official told us that GSA had asked OPM to place a link  to the Interagency Telework Issues Working Group report on the  governmentwide telework Web site, but OPM had refused to do so, despite  the fact that the working group was jointly formed by both agencies.  An  OPM official told us that OPM has been hesitant to post this report because  many of its recommendations were directed at OPM and could not be  readily implemented.  In their combined comments on a draft of this report,  however, GSA and OPM said that the two agencies had jointly determined it  would be inappropriate to post the \u201cpre-decisional\u201d Interagency Telework  Issues Working Group report on the federal telework information Web site  until they had had the opportunity to analyze its findings, address issues  contained therein, and fully consider all recommendations.  GSA, though,  has already independently posted this report on its own Web site with a  disclaimer, stating: \u201cThis final report does not in any way, specific or  implied, represent the official views, positions, or policies of the U.S.  Government, OPM, GSA, nor any of the agencies participating on the  Working Group.  This report is currently under review by both OPM and  GSA.\u201d  Given that GSA and OPM co-led this group with participation from  15 federal agencies to identify policy actions needed to facilitate agency  use and expansion of telework and then make recommendations, we  believe that the report should be posted on www.telework.gov, with the  same or a similar disclaimer, in the interests of transparency.", "After we discussed the issues created by the lack of coordination between  GSA and OPM with both agencies, a GSA official indicated that GSA and  OPM expressed a new commitment to coordination, especially with regard  to the governmentwide telework Web site.

To compile information on telework at Education, a  database was developed, which uses information from telework  agreements and the department\u2019s payroll system.  Using this database,  Education can produce reports on a number of topics, including the  number of teleworkers, whether they telework on a regularly scheduled or  ad hoc basis, what regions or offices they work for, who their supervisors  are, and their grade levels.  However, an Education program official  acknowledged that although this system is designed to track telework  agreements, some agreements are not accounted for, such as informal  agreements that are unbeknownst to her or agreements that have not gone  through the whole process.  Furthermore, because it tracks agreements  and not actual usage, the system cannot measure telework utilization.  VA  currently does not have a database for telework and uses decentralized  data collection methods, but a program official indicated that the agency  plans to implement telework tracking via the time and attendance system.   Although this official said that she hopes this new tracking system will  address data inconsistency issues within the agency, she could not provide  a time frame for its implementation.", "OPM tracks its teleworkers by counting telework agreements and recently  developed a database to keep track of these agreements, although a  program official acknowledged that informal e-mailed telework  agreements that are sometimes used at OPM might not all be included in  the database because she did not receive them.  As stated above, systems  that rely on agreements to track telework participation do not actually  provide information about utilization rates.  At OPM this weakness is  compounded by the fact that the agency does not ensure that telework  agreements are used in all cases.  GSA does not have an agencywide  tracking system.  Coordinators for individual units at GSA calculate  telework data from telework agreements once a year in order to provide  the information GSA submits for OPM\u2019s annual governmentwide telework  survey.  However, no documentation is required for intermittent telework  arrangements at GSA, and, as a result, a program official acknowledged  that the number of these types of arrangements reported to OPM for its  2002 telework survey was a rough estimate.  She also said that the survey  instruments and reporting mechanisms used by OPM\u2019s governmentwide  telework initiative for its annual report on telework in the federal  government were a challenge in this area because of changes in the data  requested from year to year, which made it difficult to determine the kind  of system an agency needed to develop to best track the requested data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Identifying Problems and/or Issues with the Telework Program and Making Appropriate Adjustments", "paragraphs": ["ITAC\u2019s e-Work Guide recommends that organizations choose an evaluation  design that 1) allows the clearest judgment of the program\u2019s effectiveness  and 2) uses the evaluation results to develop an action plan to guide any  necessary changes for telework or for the organization.  It states that  organizations should use reliable and valid measures of all outcomes and  processes, including benchmarking and follow-up assessment  questionnaires, interviews, behavioral observations and ratings, or  organizational data, because the quality of measurement is extremely  important to enabling one to draw the proper conclusions regarding the  effectiveness of telework and whether or not it has met the original  objectives.", "Despite the importance of using data to evaluate and improve telework  programs, none of the four agencies we reviewed had fully implemented  this practice.  A program official at Education told us she had collected  data on the telework program and used these data to identify some  potential problem areas.  For example, she identified offices that had low  telework program participation rates and an office that had teleworkers  working only on an as-needed schedule and no one working on a fixed  schedule.  She used this information to target marketing efforts until she  was told to stop actively marketing the program.  In addition, a private  contractor conducted a survey about Education\u2019s telework program in  1999.  Although the survey\u2019s response rate was very low due, in part, to  technology incompatibilities across the department and a lack of support  by union officials, the survey yielded four recommendations, none of which  have been fully implemented.

Rather, she relies on  employees to bring problems to her attention and responds accordingly.  At  VA, a program official identified an issue with the data collected for OPM\u2019s  2003 report to Congress on the status of telework.  She believed the data  collected within VA was inconsistent and needed to be reexamined.  For  example, 102,000 positions were identified as being eligible for telework for  the January 2003 report, as opposed to 80,000 that had been identified for  the January 2002 report.

Additionally, the comments stated that the  department\u2019s \u201cmost significant comment\u201d was, as our draft noted, the need  for a clear, unambiguous, and universally accepted definition for what it  means to allow employees the opportunity to telework."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Department of Veterans Affairs", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Responses to Comments from VA", "paragraphs": ["1. VA agreed with our conclusion that there is a need for further guidance  and assistance from GSA and OPM regarding federal telework  implementation and suggested two areas where such guidance would  be helpful.  Specifically, VA indicated that OPM needs to redefine  participant eligibility criteria and that OPM and GSA should provide  guidance on how to effectively use telework in emergency situations.   2. VA expressed concern that the draft report, which stated that we used  participation rate as one of the criteria used in our selection of  agencies, did not recognize what VA considers to be a significant factor  accounting for its limited telework participation rate.  In this regard, VA  stated that a \u201csignificant number of VA employees are engaged in direct  patient care and benefit service delivery to veterans, which precludes  large-scale participation in telework.\u201d  As our draft noted, agencies  were selected to provide illustrative examples of the extent to which  individual agencies with varied sizes, reported utilization rates, and  missions had implemented the key practices identified in our literature  review.  Nonetheless, we have added additional language to our scope  and methodology section regarding the service delivery focus of VA\u2019s  mission.  3. VA also had several comments on our findings related to the status of  VA\u2019s implementation of the telework practices that we identified.  The  specific issues that VA raised and our response to each are summarized  as follows:  a. In its comments, VA noted that it had conducted two pilot programs.", "When we requested additional information from VA to support its  comment, VA provided us with information about two pilot programs  that did not relate to their current telework program.  VA also stated  that it did not conduct a pilot program for its current telework policy.   Because VA could not provide information about a pilot program for  its current telework policy, we did not change our assessment that  VA has not taken any steps to implement this practice. b. VA said it had established measurable telework program goals and an  the course of our work that VA did not have any measurable telework  goals or an implementation plan.  Therefore, we have not changed  our assessment that VA has not taken any steps to implement these  practices. c. VA commented, as our draft report had noted, that its revised  telework policy has a \u201cSelf-Certification Safety Checklist.\u201d  However,  as we also noted in our draft report, this policy is still in draft form  and was not in use during our review.  Because VA\u2019s current telework  policy does not contain a safety checklist and the draft checklist is  not in use, we have not changed our assessment that VA has not  taken any steps to ensure that teleworkers have safe and adequate  places to work off-site. d. VA indicated that it had developed a Telework Proposal form that  was designed to facilitate communication among supervisors,  employees, and managers.  However, that form is part of VA\u2019s revised  telework policy, which, as noted in our draft report, has not yet been  approved for use at VA and, therefore, was not considered in our  evaluation.  Moreover, this form, once approved, will not serve to  establish policies or requirements to facilitate communication  between managers and teleworkers, such as detailing the methods of  communication that should be used or the frequency with which  communication should occur while teleworking.  More importantly,  VA\u2019s existing telework policy does not establish such policies or  requirements to facilitate communication.  Given these  considerations, our assessment that VA has not taken any steps to  implement this practice remains unchanged. e. VA stated that the Telework Proposal form, which, as we noted, is  still a draft, allows it to track and evaluate the effectiveness of its  program as well as VA\u2019s success in achieving targeted participation  goals.  This form simply allows VA to count how many employees  have applied for telework and how many have been approved for  such an arrangement. Such information will be important and  valuable.  However, the form would not fully enable VA to evaluate  the effectiveness of its program or its success in achieving  participation goals in terms of the number of employees actually  teleworking and, equally important, the extent to which telework is  being used.  As we had noted in our draft report, a VA program  official had indicated to us that the agency plans to implement  telework tracking via the time and attendance system, which she  hopes will address data inconsistency issues within the agency.  Such  a tracking mechanism, if implemented, could be helpful in tracking  telework participation.  Based on these considerations, our  assessment that VA has taken some steps to implement this practice  remains unchanged.  f. VA also stated that the department consistently advises supervisors  and managers that performance standards for teleworkers and  nonteleworkers should be the same and said that this was consistent  with the criteria under our category of \u201cPerformance Management.\u201d   However, VA could not provide us with any information to support  this comment.  In fact, VA responded that it provides such advice \u201con  an as-requested basis,\u201d which does not constitute \u201cconsistently  advising.\u201d  Furthermore, VA\u2019s current telework policy does not  contain any statements related to using the same performance  standards for both teleworkers and nonteleworkers.  Given these  considerations, we have not changed our assessment that VA has not  taken any steps to ensure that the same performance standards are  used to evaluate both teleworkers and nonteleworkers. g. In addition, VA noted that its ability to conduct a technology  assessment for telework is compromised by the lack of clear  guidance regarding which positions are suitable to telework.  This  further illustrates our finding, as stated in our draft report, that  agencies may need additional guidance, guidelines, and/or  individualized technical support to fully implement the practices we  have identified.  However, VA\u2019s comment does not affect our  assessment that VA has not taken any steps to implement this  practice."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the General Services Administration and the Office of Personnel Management", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Responses to Comments from GSA and OPM", "paragraphs": ["1.", "In their combined comments, GSA and OPM agreed that telework is an  important tool for federal agencies and stated that they would  encourage and champion telework as a key human capital flexibility  and do everything possible to facilitate its acceptance and use.  The  agencies also agreed to implement our recommendation that they use  their lead roles in the federal telework initiative to assist agencies in  implementing the key telework practices we identified.  In this regard,  GSA and OPM stated that they will provide agencies with a checklist of  the practices we identified and recommend that agencies do a self- assessment of their telework programs using our analytical framework.   Both GSA and OPM will then offer to help agencies to improve in the  identified areas of deficiency.  OPM will also include the key telework  practices that we identified in telework training, which, as we had  noted in the draft report, is being developed for launch on its Web- based training site during fiscal year 2003.", "2.", "In addition, GSA agreed with our recommendation that it work with  Congress to determine what was meant by the phrase \u201cGSA  telecommunication center\u201d in Section 314, Division F, title III of Pub. L.  No. 108-7 and whether this provision is in conflict with the provision  contained in 40 U.S.C. 587(d)(2).  GSA stated that it will coordinate  internally and with the appropriate congressional committees to  resolve the conflicting language in the statutes and then provide  clarification to its customer agencies.   3. GSA and OPM disagreed with several of our findings relating to their  lead roles in the governmentwide telework initiative.  Below are  summaries of GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s comments and our responses: a. These agencies stated that, given the efforts they have made in  promoting telework, they were \u201ctaken aback\u201d by language in the draft  that noted confusion at the \u201cimplementation level\u201d throughout the  federal government regarding the policy guidance that they had put  forth to date.  However, as detailed in our draft report, our finding  was actually that conflicting messages from GSA and OPM on certain  telework-related matters had created confusion.  Apart from this  finding, we recognize GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s efforts to promote telework  and had included in our draft report many of the examples of those  efforts that GSA and OPM cited in their response, such as jointly  running the telework Web site to provide information and guidance,  OPM\u2019s rapid issuance of guidance in response to our finding related  to the lack of a definition for providing employees with the  opportunity to telework, and GSA\u2019s management and promotion of  the telework centers.  Also, our draft report discussed OPM\u2019s  outreach effort to meet face to face with agencies\u2019 telework  coordinators and, as GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s comments noted, this effort  was also described in our May 2003 report entitled Human Capital:  OPM Can Better Assist Agencies in Using Personnel Flexibilities.   However, while such promotional efforts can be constructive, they  do not address the confusion we identified as a result of GSA\u2019s and  OPM\u2019s conflicting messages.  b. GSA and OPM strongly disagreed with our finding that they have not  fully coordinated their governmentwide telework efforts in the past.   In one instance, they said that the draft report stated there were  unresolved disagreements between GSA and OPM on telework policy  issues concerning dependent care and emergency closing of  government offices, and that they believed there were no such  disagreements.  However, GSA and OPM also stated that, while they  believed that their responses to the dependent care and emergency  closing issues were not in conflict, they clarified them to avoid any  confusion.  We believe this is a noteworthy development because, as  stated in our draft report, agencies had expressed concern about  conflicting messages they had received from GSA and OPM on  several topics, including dependent care and emergency closings.", "More generally, we also indicated in our draft report that, because  GSA and OPM have not developed a Memorandum of Understanding  or other formal agreement regarding their responsibilities for the  governmentwide telework initiative, they should work together to  reach a formal agreement establishing a delineation of these  responsibilities.  In their comments, the agencies said that they have  recognized the need to better outline separate and shared  responsibilities and that a Memorandum of Understanding was  among the options they were considering to clearly designate each  agency\u2019s responsibilities.  We have added language to reflect GSA\u2019s  and OPM\u2019s commitment to address these areas. c. In addition, GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s comments said that it was unnecessary  for OPM to re-coordinate with GSA on the final version of the  telework guide for managers, supervisors, and telework coordinators  because GSA\u2019s comments had already been incorporated into the  guide.  Although we found that OPM had made substantive changes  to the guide subsequent to GSA\u2019s review, we now believe that, given  the concerns expressed by agencies, and underscored by Education\u2019s  and VA\u2019s comments on our draft report, it was sufficiently important  to issue the guide in a timely fashion, without a final review by GSA.   Relevant changes have been made to our report. d. According to GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s comments, GSA\u2019s senior program  executive for telework disputed our finding that GSA had expressed  concerns about OPM\u2019s changes to the joint OPM/GSA telework Web  site (www.telework.gov).  However, this statement varies from  information provided to us both by GSA and OPM officials during the  course of our review and by the senior OPM official for the  governmentwide telework initiative at our exit conference with OPM.   For example, during our exit conference, the senior OPM official for  the governmentwide telework initiative acknowledged changing the  telework Web site without GSA being informed or OPM getting input  from GSA.  She said that GSA was not very happy with the new look,  adding that GSA felt the changes were imposed on it by OPM without  any consultation.  Nonetheless, we have adjusted the report to reflect  the view of the GSA senior program executive. e. In their comments, GSA and OPM also said that the two agencies had  jointly determined it would be inappropriate to post the \u201cpre- decisional\u201d Interagency Telework Issues Working Group report on  the federal telework information Web site (www.telework.gov) until  they had had the opportunity to analyze its findings, address issues  contained therein, and fully consider all recommendations.   However, GSA has already independently posted this report on its  own Web site with a disclaimer, stating: \u201cOPM and GSA co-led the  Interagency Telework Issues Working Group by offering technical  guidance, support, and resources.  The findings and  recommendations made in this final report reflect the opinions of the  Working Group members.  This final report does not in any way,  specific or implied, represent the official views, positions, or policies  of the U.S. Government, OPM, GSA, nor any of the agencies  participating on the Working Group.  This report is currently under  review by both OPM and GSA.\u201d  Given that GSA and OPM co-led this  group with participation from 15 federal agencies to identify policy  actions needed to facilitate agency use and expansion of telework  and then make recommendations, we believe that the report should  be posted on www.telework.gov, with the same or a similar  disclaimer, in the interests of transparency. 4. OPM also raised issues with our analysis of its internal telework  program.  OPM stated that our draft report indicated that 12 of our 25  identified key practices still needed to be implemented at OPM.  While  our draft report showed that OPM had \u201cfully implemented\u201d 13 of the  practices, it went on to say that OPM had \u201ctaken some steps to  implement\u201d 5 of the remaining practices and had \u201cnot taken any steps  to implement\u201d the other 7 practices.  OPM\u2019s comments related to its  internal telework program maintained that it has fully implemented 24  of the 25 practices, stating that the 25th practice should not apply to it.   As we clarified in this report, some of the practices, such as developing  an implementation plan and establishing a pilot program, are historical  in nature and cannot be implemented at this time by agencies with  existing telework programs.  However, as we also clarified in the  report, agencies with existing programs that did not initially implement  some of the more developmental practices can still be successful with  sustained attention to the other practices we identified.", "In its comments, OPM stated that \u201cach comment listed was  conveyed to GAO during the interview process.\u201d  On the contrary,  OPM\u2019s comments, for the most part, contain new information and/or  information that does not correspond with what was conveyed to us  during our meetings with OPM officials.  Summaries of OPM\u2019s  comments, and our responses, are discussed below:   a. OPM disputed our finding that the agency had not established  measurable telework program goals, saying that it had done so by  meeting, even exceeding, the requirements of Section 359 of Pub. L.  No. 106-346.  OPM said that, \u201cn effect, the legislation has provided  the program goals for Federal agencies through 2004.\u201d  However, in  its May 2003 telework guide for managers, supervisors, and telework  coordinators, OPM discusses the importance of establishing  program goals and objectives for telework because they will be  helpful in conducting program evaluations of a telework program.   OPM\u2019s guide notes that \u201cey issues for evaluation for most agencies  include the effect of telework on productivity, operating costs,  employee morale, recruitment, and retention\u201d and that the evaluation  plan \u201cshould be based on quantifiable program goals and objectives  to allow for ease of measurement.\u201d  Section 359 of Pub. L. No. 106- 346 refers broadly to the federal workforce and OPM has not  provided any documentation illustrating how it has converted the  law\u2019s requirements into program goals to measure the effect of  telework on productivity, operating costs, employee morale,  recruitment, retention, or any other such desirable outcome.   Moreover, OPM\u2019s telework coordinator told us during the course of  our review that goals have not been set for OPM\u2019s internal program.   Given these considerations, our assessment of OPM for this practice  remains unchanged. b. OPM disagreed with our finding that it had not established a business  case for implementing a telework program, stating that the business  case for telework has been developed through various means,  including statements made in its governmentwide guidance,  information provided in training sessions for its managers, and by  referring its managers to the OPM/GSA telework Web site.  As  described in a source from which we drew our key practices, a  comprehensive business case for a telework program entails  identifying full costs and benefits to the extent practicable, prior to  implementation of the program, that are specific to the organization,  including IT components, facilities, recruiting, retention, contingency  support, and security and risk assessments.  The business case that  OPM refers to in its comments does not fully meet these criteria.   Furthermore, this comment does not correspond with what was  conveyed to us during our meetings with OPM officials.  Instead,  OPM\u2019s telework coordinator at the time its current program was  developed in 2001 told us that a business case for telework had not  been developed prior to implementing the telework program.  Given  these considerations, our assessment of OPM for this practice  remains unchanged.  c. OPM disputed our finding that it has only taken some steps to  provide funding to meet the needs of the telework program.  The  agency said that it has provided \u201cfull funding\u201d for its telework  program and that it has identified resources that have allowed it to  accommodate \u201cevery employee (who is otherwise eligible and wants  to telecommute) with appropriate computer equipment, technology  support, and remote connections.\u201d  OPM did not provide  documentation of this funding.  As our draft report indicated, OPM  has taken important steps to implement this practice, by paying the  salary for a telework coordinator and setting aside $50,000 in fiscal  year 2002 for telework center use, as required by law.  However, an IT  official at OPM said that there were times that the agency has  experienced shortages of the older computers it loans to  teleworkers.  He said that the people who absolutely need to  telework get computers immediately, if they require one, but that  people who would like to telework, but do not have a \u201cneed\u201d to do so,  have had to wait to begin teleworking until computers become  available.  According to this IT official, managers usually make the  decision about whether telework is a \u201cneed,\u201d although employees  will sometimes decide for themselves that it is not necessary for  them to telework.  Given these considerations, we did not change our  assessment that OPM had taken some steps to implement this  practice. d. OPM questioned the validity of our having assessed its telework  program against the practice of establishing a pilot program because  \u201cthe founding legislation\u201d did not include a requirement for  establishing pilot programs and because OPM is confident that a pilot  would not have added significant value to its program.  As noted in  our draft, we used a variety of sources, including GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s  telework guidance, to identify key practices.  Successful telework  experiences and related telework literature suggest that pilot  programs can be valuable at the outset of telework initiatives by  providing a means to test the concept and its integration within a  particular organization\u2019s environment.  However, as we recognize in  this report, agencies with existing telework programs that did not  implement this practice when the program was initially developed  can still have successful telework programs with sustained attention  to the other practices.  Because OPM did not establish a pilot  program at the outset of its telework program, our assessment of  OPM for this practice remains unchanged. e. OPM disagreed with our finding that it had taken some steps to  establish eligibility criteria to ensure that teleworkers are selected on  an equitable basis using criteria such as suitability of tasks and  employee performance, stating that it had fully implemented this  practice by providing objective eligibility criteria in its telework  policy.  Our draft report noted the progress OPM had made in this  area and that guidance was in place on eligibility criteria.  However,  OPM\u2019s telework coordinator also told us that the eligibility criteria  varied by OPM unit and may not be consistently applied.  Therefore,  while the OPM guidance is an important step, its consistent  application is not being ensured.  Thus, we continue to believe that  OPM has taken some steps to implement this practice. f. OPM disagreed with our finding that it had taken some steps to  establish policies or requirements to facilitate communication among  teleworkers, managers, and coworkers, stating that its policy and  associated forms serve to facilitate communication.  Based on  further analysis of the policy and its associated forms, we have  changed the report to reflect that OPM has fully implemented this  practice.   g. OPM disagreed with our finding that it has taken some steps to  develop guidelines on workplace health and safety issues to ensure  that teleworkers have safe and adequate places to work off-site,  because one of the appendixes included with OPM\u2019s telework policy  is a safety checklist for the alternate worksite.  As we noted in our  draft report, OPM\u2019s telework policy states that the telework  agreement should include a safety checklist.  Importantly, however,  the suggested checklist, included as an appendix to OPM\u2019s policy,  states that the employee \u201cmay use\u201d it to \u201cassist them in a survey of  the overall safety and adequacy of their alternate worksite.\u201d  It goes  on to say \u201cthe following are only recommendations and do not  encompass every situation that may be encountered.\u201d  Moreover, the  checklist does not have a signature line or any way for it to be  certified by the employee.  Because this checklist is only  recommended, not required, and does not need to be certified by the  employee, it is not sufficient to ensure that teleworkers have a safe  and adequate place to work off-site.  Therefore, we continue to  believe that OPM has taken some steps to implement this practice. h. OPM disagreed with our finding that it has not taken any steps to  ensure that the same performance standards, derived from a modern,  effective, credible, and validated performance system, are used to  evaluate both teleworkers and nonteleworkers, saying that the  performance standards that employees are evaluated against  annually are based on the duties and responsibilities of the  employee\u2019s position and not on whether the employee is a teleworker  or nonteleworker.  OPM further stated that the performance  standards are the same, regardless of where the work is performed.   As we stated in the draft report, although OPM\u2019s policy does state  that the employees\u2019 current performance standards will be used to  govern all telecommuting assignments, as well as those in the  telecommuters\u2019 current traditional federal offices.  However, it does  not include a statement requiring that the same performance  standards be used for teleworkers and nonteleworkers.  Without  such a statement, at a minimum, OPM cannot fully ensure that the  same performance standards are used to evaluate both teleworkers  and nonteleworkers.  Nonetheless, we have revised the report to  acknowledge that OPM has taken some steps to implement this  practice.  While these steps are important, there are steps that OPM  can take to more fully ensure that the criteria have been consistently  applied, such as periodically checking the performance appraisals for  consistency.   i. OPM disagreed with our finding that it had not taken any steps to  train all involved in its telework program, including, at a minimum,  managers and teleworkers, saying that it has provided extensive  training to both managers and employees.  However, this comment  does not correspond with what was conveyed to us during our  meetings with OPM officials.  According to both the current and past  OPM telework coordinators, OPM had provided mandatory training  to managers and optional training to employees when the telework  program began, more than 2 years ago.  In addition, they told us that  OPM has not provided any training since then.  Even the initial  training would not have been sufficient to train \u201call involved\u201d in the  telework program, because employees were not required to attend.   In response to OPM\u2019s comments, we have revised our report to  reflect OPM\u2019s initial training efforts by indicating that OPM has taken  some steps to implement this practice.  We are also pleased that OPM  indicated in its comments that, now that its agency restructuring has  been completed, it plans to provide continued outreach and training  on telework.  However, OPM cannot be considered to have fully  implemented the practice of training all involved in its telework  program until this training is actively provided to and required of all  relevant parties. j. OPM disputed our finding that it had not taken any steps to establish  standards for equipment in the telework environment, saying that  OPM has a standard platform for connectivity and has established a  protocol for requesting necessary equipment and connectivity.   During our review, an IT official from OPM told us that the equipment  standards had not yet been fully applied to agency-owned equipment,  but he expected this to be done between July and October 2003.   Based on OPM\u2019s more recent comments, we have revised our report  to reflect that OPM has taken some steps to implement this practice.   However, the IT official also told us that OPM does not have a  standard for employee-provided equipment.  Until OPM establishes  and applies its standards to employee-provided equipment, it will not  have fully implemented this practice. k. OPM disputed our finding that it had taken some steps to establish  processes, procedures, and/or a tracking system to collect data to  evaluate the telework program, stating that it collects and tracks a  variety of data that is used to evaluate and report on its telework  program.  According to OPM, because its policy states \u201completed  work agreements must be forwarded to the organizational  telecommuting contact for record keeping purposes,\u201d  the agency has  fully implemented this practice.  In our draft report, we recognize  OPM\u2019s policy that employees sign a work agreement with their  supervisor.  However, OPM\u2019s telework coordinator told us that work  agreements, whether in hard copy or e-mail form, are not always  completed and forwarded to her.  Additionally, while OPM endeavors  to track participation rates through these work agreements, the  agreements only provide information on how many employees have  been approved to telework, not how many are actually participating.   Without a tracking and evaluation system that accurately measures  program participation, OPM cannot be considered to have taken  more than some steps to implement this practice.  One such system  was suggested by OPM itself in the section of GSA\u2019s and OPM\u2019s  comments on our draft report that is related to those agencies\u2019  governmentwide leadership roles.  These comments said, \u201cOPM has  concluded from research that the best telework data is collected  through time and attendance tracking systems.  OPM will be issuing  guidance to agencies later this year on the use of this data source for  its next survey.\u201d  Such guidance will be an important step toward  helping all agencies to more accurately track and report such data  and so that they can use the data for evaluation and program  improvement purposes. l. OPM disputed our finding that it had not taken any steps to identify  problems and/or issues with the telework program and make  appropriate adjustments, indicating that the various surveys and data  it collects are used, not only to report on the number of employees  teleworking in the agency, but also to help inform enhancements to  its program.  However, OPM\u2019s telework coordinator indicated that  she does not actively seek to identify issues using any evaluation  tools.  Instead, as OPM pointed out in its comments, she relies on  employees to bring issues to her attention.  While employees can be  an important source of information, such data sources are  complements to, and not substitutes for, formal feedback  mechanisms and well-designed evaluations, as described in OPM\u2019s  recently released telework guide to managers, supervisors, and  telework coordinators.  Nonetheless, given these considerations,  we have revised our assessment of OPM for this practice to reflect  that it has taken some steps to implement this practice.  5. GSA did not disagree with our findings pertaining to its internal  telework program.  However, the agency did note several areas where it  would like us to revise statements relative to its implementation of the  key practices we identified.  Below is a summary of GSA\u2019s comments  and our responses:   a. GSA said that, since its program has been in place for more than 10  years, it does not have or need a current implementation plan.   Furthermore, GSA indicated that it had an implementation plan that  was utilized 10 years ago, when the program was first developed.   However, GSA stated that this plan was not kept in the files, because  it is no longer in use.  We agree that GSA should not develop an  implementation plan for a program that is already in place.  Our  analysis was focused on whether an agency had developed an  implementation plan to shape the design and implementation of its  program to ensure future success.  In this regard, GSA\u2019s telework  coordinator had told us that there was not a written implementation  plan for the telework program when it was first started.   Nevertheless, we have revised our report to indicate that we were  unable to assess GSA on this practice. b. GSA indicated that it does not have a central telework fund and that  individual organizations within GSA provide their own funding.  We  had considered this information in our analysis of the level of GSA\u2019s  implementation of this practice.  However, we have added GSA\u2019s  statement to our report to provide additional context.  Also, as  already noted in our draft report, GSA said that it had set aside the  required central funding for telecenter utilization. c. GSA noted that it has an operational telework program and,  consequently, there is no further need for piloting.  We agree with  GSA that there is no further need for piloting.  Our analysis in this  regard assessed whether or not an agency had established a pilot at  the beginning of its individual telework program.  GSA did not  establish a pilot program prior to implementation of its telework  program.  Therefore, our assessment of GSA for this practice remains  unchanged. d. In addition, GSA provided comments related to several other areas,  including:  1) its position on establishing telework eligibility criteria,  2) its emphasis on fairness toward teleworkers and others, and 3) its  existing lines of communication regarding telework, including its  network of telework coordinators in regions and organizations  throughout the agency, its provision of e-mail and on-line information  on telework, and its \u201cstrong emphasis on communication.\u201d  While  these comments were helpful in setting the context for GSA\u2019s internal  telework program, they were not relevant to our analysis and,  therefore, are not reflected in the body of our report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the audit, evaluation and investigative arm of  Congress, exists to support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities  and to help improve the performance and accountability of the federal government  for the American people.
