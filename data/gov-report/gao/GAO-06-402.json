OND, which holds responsibility for approving drugs, is involved in safety activities throughout the life cycle of a drug, and it has the decision-making responsibility to take regulatory actions concerning the postmarket safety of drugs. OND works closely with ODS to help it make postmarket decisions. ODS, with a primary focus on postmarket safety, serves primarily as a consultant to OND and does not have independent decision-making responsibility. ODS has been reorganized several times over the years. There has been high turnover of ODS directors in the past 10 years, with eight different directors of the office and its predecessors. In the four drug case studies GAO examined, GAO observed that the postmarket safety decision-making process was complex and iterative. FDA lacks clear and effective processes for making decisions about, and providing management oversight of, postmarket safety issues. The process has been limited by a lack of clarity about how decisions are made and about organizational roles, insufficient oversight by management, and data constraints. GAO observed that there is a lack of criteria for determining what safety actions to take and when to take them. Certain parts of ODS's role in the process are unclear, including ODS's participation in FDA's scientific advisory committee meetings organized by OND. Insufficient communication between ODS and OND has been an ongoing concern and has hindered the decision-making process. ODS does not track information about ongoing postmarket safety issues, including the recommendations that ODS staff make for safety actions. FDA faces data constraints in making postmarket safety decisions. There are weaknesses in the different types of data available to FDA, and FDA lacks authority to require certain studies and has resource limitations for obtaining data. Some of FDA's initiatives, such as the establishment of a Drug Safety Oversight Board, a draft policy on major postmarket decision making, and the identification of new data sources, may improve the postmarket safety decision-making process, but will not address all gaps. FDA's newly created Drug Safety Oversight Board may help provide oversight of important, high-level safety decisions, but it does not address the lack of systematic tracking of ongoing safety issues. Other initiatives, such as FDA's draft policy on major postmarket decisions and regular meetings between OND divisions and ODS, may help improve the clarity and effectiveness of the process, but they are not fully implemented. FDA has not clarified ODS's role in certain scientific advisory committee meetings. FDA's dispute resolution processes for disagreements about postmarket safety decisions have not been used. FDA is taking steps to identify additional data sources, but data constraints remain."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2004, several high-profile drug safety cases raised concerns about the  Food and Drug Administration\u2019s (FDA) management of safety issues  concerning drugs that have been approved for marketing. At  congressional hearings in September 2004, FDA was criticized for taking  too long to tell physicians and patients about studies linking the use of  antidepressants among children to an increased risk of suicidal behavior.  Similarly, at a congressional hearing in November 2004, it was alleged that  FDA did not act quickly enough on evidence it obtained in 2001 about the  cardiovascular risks of Vioxx, an anti-inflammatory drug. In these cases  and others there were disagreements within FDA about how to address  safety issues. There were also reports that some FDA scientists were  discouraged by supervisors from raising questions about the safety of  certain drugs.", "Problems with FDA\u2019s postmarket drug safety program have been raised  before. There have been numerous reviews by external and internal  groups dating back over 30 years that have identified problems with the  federal government\u2019s postmarket drug surveillance program and that have  made recommendations for improvement. Following passage of the  Prescription Drug User Fee Act of 1992 (PDUFA), additional concerns  were raised about drug safety. Under PDUFA, drug companies  (\u201csponsors\u201d) began paying fees to FDA, which used the funds to hire more  drug application reviewers and make other changes in order to speed up  the drug review process. As a result, FDA was able to review drug  applications and approve new drugs for marketing more rapidly than  before. However, the increased attention to timely drug approval decisions  led to increased attention to monitoring of postmarket safety as well,  which was reflected in the 2002 reauthorization of PDUFA. The 2002 act  states that FDA should continue to strengthen and improve the review and  monitoring of drug safety, and the PDUFA goals, incorporated by  reference into the act, state that FDA will allocate almost $71 million over  a 5-year period for postmarket drug safety. FDA subsequently increased its  risk management activities, drafted guidance for industry to help drug  companies assess and minimize drug risks, and used PDUFA revenues to  upgrade its system for adverse event reporting and to acquire external  sources of data. In late 2004 and 2005, in response to the safety issues  raised in the case of Vioxx and other drugs, FDA announced plans to  further strengthen its management of postmarket drug safety. These  initiatives, some of which are in an early stage of implementation, include  launching a new Web page to make public information on emerging drug  safety issues while FDA evaluates them, finalizing the risk management  guidance for industry, and making other organizational and policy process  changes.", "In light of the recent controversy about drug safety, you asked us to  conduct a review of FDA\u2019s current organizational structure and decision- making process for postmarket drug safety. In this report we (1) describe  FDA\u2019s organizational structure and process for postmarket drug safety  decision making, (2) assess the effectiveness of the postmarket drug safety  decision-making process, and (3) assess steps FDA is taking to improve  postmarket drug safety decision making.", "To describe FDA\u2019s organizational structure and process for postmarket  drug safety decision making, we analyzed FDA\u2019s organizational charts and  annual reports, the roles and responsibilities of staff working on drug  safety, documents describing internal FDA policies and procedures, and  other relevant FDA documents. Our review focused on two offices within  FDA\u2019s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) that are involved  in postmarket drug safety activities: the Office of New Drugs (OND) and  the Office of Drug Safety (ODS). We interviewed ODS, OND, and other  CDER managers and staff about their roles, responsibilities, workloads,  and the process for postmarket drug safety decision making. We also  interviewed former FDA officials and drug safety experts from outside  FDA. To assess the effectiveness of the postmarket drug safety decision- making process, we analyzed documents describing internal FDA policies  and procedures and interviewed FDA officials. In order to obtain an in- depth understanding of FDA\u2019s policies and procedures, we conducted case  studies of four drugs\u2014Arava, Baycol, Bextra, and Propulsid\u2014that help to  illustrate the current decision-making process. Each of these drugs  presented significant postmarket safety issues that FDA acted upon in  recent years, and they reflect differences in the type of adverse event or  potential safety problem associated with the drug, the safety actions taken,  and the OND and ODS staff involved. For our case studies we reviewed  relevant FDA documents and conducted interviews with OND and ODS  staff and former FDA staff who were directly involved in the cases. We  focused on (1) significant postmarket drug safety regulatory actions;   (2) analyses that ODS conducted on the safety concerns; and (3) internal  FDA meetings, especially those that involved ODS. We did not examine  other elements of the postmarket drug safety decision-making process,  such as internal OND meetings. In some cases there may be gaps in our  description of events because there was no documentation available about  that point in the process. We also did not evaluate the scientific validity of  FDA\u2019s data, methodologies, or decisions in these or other cases. Our cases  cannot be generalized to FDA\u2019s deliberations about postmarket drug safety  issues for other drugs. Finally, to assess FDA\u2019s actions to improve  postmarket drug safety decision making, we reviewed relevant FDA  documents and interviewed FDA officials and outside drug safety experts.  We conducted our review from December 2004 through March 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Postmarket Drug Safety and FDA\u2019s Role", "paragraphs": ["Before a drug can be marketed in the United States, its sponsor must  demonstrate to FDA that the drug is safe and effective for its intended use.  Because no drug is absolutely safe\u2014there is always some risk of an  adverse reaction\u2014FDA approves a drug for marketing when the agency  judges that its known benefits outweigh its known risks. After a drug is on  the market, FDA continues to assess its risks and benefits. FDA reviews  reports of adverse drug reactions (adverse events) related to the drug and  information from studies about the drug, including clinical trials and  studies following the use of drugs in ongoing medical care (observational  studies), conducted by the drug\u2019s sponsor, FDA, or other researchers. If  FDA has information that a drug on the market may pose a significant  health risk to consumers, it weighs the effect of the adverse events against  the benefit of the drug to determine what actions, if any, are warranted.  This decision-making process is complex and encompasses many factors,  such as the medical importance and utility of the drug, the drug\u2019s extent of  usage, the severity of the disease being treated, the drug\u2019s efficacy in  treating this disease, and the availability of other drugs to treat the same  disorder.", "CDER, the largest of FDA\u2019s five centers, is the organizational entity within  FDA that oversees the review of marketing applications for new drugs and  the postmarket monitoring of drugs once they are marketed. Within  CDER there are several key offices involved in activities related to  postmarket drug safety. OND is the largest of the offices with fiscal year  2005 expenditures of $110.6 million and 715 staff. In fiscal year 2005, more  than half of OND\u2019s expenditures, or $57.2 million, came from PDUFA  funds. OND\u2019s staff evaluate new drugs for efficacy and safety to decide if a  drug should be approved for marketing. OND also makes decisions about  actions to take when there are postmarket safety issues with a drug (for  example, revising the label to include adverse event information or having  FDA withdraw approval for marketing). For safety questions, OND  interacts with several FDA offices and divisions, but primarily with ODS.", "ODS is currently located within the Office of Pharmacoepidemiology and  Statistical Science (OPaSS), which is organizationally parallel to OND and  also contains the Office of Biostatistics. ODS is a much smaller office  than OND, with fiscal year 2005 expenditures of $26.9 million and 106  staff. In fiscal year 2005, $7.6 million of ODS\u2019s expenditures were from  PDUFA funds. ODS staff evaluate and monitor drug risks and promote the  safe use of drugs. While ODS is involved in both premarket and  postmarket drug safety issues, its primary focus is on postmarket safety.", "An important part of the drug approval and postmarket monitoring  process is the advice FDA receives from 16 human-drug-related scientific  advisory committees, composed of experts and consumer representatives  from outside FDA. Considered by FDA as important in helping the agency  accomplish its mission and maintaining public trust, these advisory  committees provide expert advice to the agency on a range of issues,  including safety. The committees are largely organized according to  specialized medical areas or conditions such as cardiovascular disease,  gastrointestinal conditions, or oncology. In 2002, FDA established the  Drug Safety and Risk Management Advisory Committee (DSaRM), 1 of the  16 human-drug-related scientific advisory committees, to specifically  advise FDA on drug safety and risk management issues. The committee is  composed of individuals from outside FDA with experience in the areas of  medication errors, risk communication, risk perception, risk management,  clinical trial methodology, evidence-based medicine, biometrics, and  pharmacoepidemiology. Since it was established, DSaRM has met nine  times, with four of those meetings held jointly with another drug-related  scientific advisory committee. DSaRM members have also been asked to  participate in other scientific advisory committees when safety issues  were discussed. ODS sets the agenda for DSaRM meetings, whereas OND  sets the agenda for the other scientific advisory committee meetings.", "Figure 1 describes the offices and external advisory committees involved  in postmarket drug safety at FDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FDA\u2019s Postmarket Drug Safety Authority", "paragraphs": ["In terms of postmarket drug safety surveillance, FDA has the authority to  require that drug sponsors report adverse events to FDA with different  reporting schedules based on the seriousness of the event and whether the  event has been previously identified and is included in the drug\u2019s label.  Sponsors must report serious, unlabeled adverse events to FDA within 15  days of learning about them. Sponsors are required to report other adverse  events quarterly for 3 years, then annually thereafter in the form of  periodic adverse event reports. In addition, health care providers and  patients can voluntarily submit adverse event reports to FDA through its  MedWatch program. Adverse event reports become part of FDA\u2019s  computerized database known as the Adverse Event Reporting System  (AERS).", "FDA has the authority to withdraw the approval of a drug on the market  for safety-related and other reasons, although it rarely does so. Since  2000 there have been 10 drug withdrawals for safety reasons, and in all of  these cases the drug\u2019s sponsor voluntarily removed the drug from the  market. FDA does not have explicit authority to require that drug sponsors  take other safety actions; however, when FDA identifies a potential  problem, sponsors generally negotiate with FDA to develop a mutually  agreeable remedy to avoid other regulatory action. For example, if FDA  determines that an approved drug may produce adverse events not  previously identified, FDA and the sponsor may negotiate on revised  labeling for the drug, and then FDA may issue an accompanying Public  Health Advisory for patients and health care providers that describes the  safety information. FDA may also request that the sponsor restrict the  distribution of the drug in order to minimize a significant risk associated  with the drug.", "FDA has limited authority to require that sponsors conduct postmarket  safety studies; it may impose such a requirement during the premarket  phase of drug development in two situations, and in one during the  postmarket phase. In two situations, FDA has the authority to require that  sponsors commit to conducting postmarketing studies as a condition of  approval. First, FDA\u2019s program for accelerated approval of new drugs for  serious or life-threatening illnesses (referred to as \u201csubpart H drugs\u201d)  allows FDA to more quickly approve drugs showing meaningful  therapeutic benefit with the caveat that the sponsor will conduct or finish  studies after the drug is marketed. Such drugs may be made available to  the public sooner but with less complete safety information than the  normal review process requires for approval. Second, in cases where  human efficacy studies of a drug may not be ethical or feasible, FDA may  rely on animal studies alone to approve the use of a drug and require  postmarket studies as a condition of approval when studies on humans  become feasible and ethical. For example, FDA approved a drug in 2003  that is used as a treatment for patients who have been exposed to a  chemical nerve agent called Soman. Evidence of the effectiveness of this  drug was obtained from animals alone because it is unethical to perform  such studies in humans. In either situation, FDA may withdraw approval of  these drugs if, for example, postmarket clinical studies fail to verify  clinical benefits, the sponsor fails to perform postmarketing studies with  due diligence, or postmarketing restrictions (for example, restricted  distribution) are inadequate to assure safe use of the drug. Finally, under  certain conditions, after a drug is approved, FDA can also require that  drug sponsors conduct postmarket studies of marketed drugs when such  studies are needed to provide adequate labeling to ensure the safe and  effective use of these drugs in children."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Two Distinct FDA Units Involved in Postmarket Drug Safety Activities", "paragraphs": ["Two distinct FDA offices are involved in postmarket drug safety activities.

OND\u2019s staff includes physicians,  pharmacologists, toxicologists, and microbiologists. The key decision  makers in OND\u2014division directors and office directors\u2014are physicians.  In general, OND staff take a clinical perspective in their work. According  to the Director of the office, OND\u2019s medical staff have expertise in medical  specialties as well as drug regulation, which he said gave them the ability  to integrate issues related to the disease, available therapy, effectiveness  of the drug, and relative safety. He also told us that OND staff are focused  on meeting patient needs and providing health care practitioners and  patients with a range of drugs for treatment of a specific disease or  condition. Finally, an important characteristic of OND\u2019s organization is  that OND\u2019s work and its pace are driven in part by PDUFA goals to  complete its review of drug applications within certain time frames.", "FDA estimates that 51 percent of OND\u2019s work time is devoted to drug  safety, either premarket or postmarket. In the drug development or  premarket phase, OND staff review safety and efficacy data from  sponsors\u2019 animal studies and human clinical trials to decide whether or  not to approve a drug. In some cases OND identifies safety concerns at the  time of approval that it believes can be managed, for example, by  educating patients and providers or restricting distribution to certain  populations. In these cases, OND works with ODS and the sponsor to  develop a risk management plan to outline these strategies. OND may also  request, or in cases where FDA has the authority, require that a sponsor  conduct a postmarketing study as a condition of approval.", "After a drug is on the market, OND receives information about safety  issues related to a drug\u2019s use and takes appropriate regulatory action. OND  receives information about safety issues in several ways. First, OND staff  receive notification of adverse event reports for drugs to which they are  assigned and they review the periodic adverse event reports that are  submitted by drug sponsors. Second, OND staff review safety information  that is submitted to FDA when a sponsor seeks approval for a new use or  formulation of a drug, and monitor completion of postmarket studies.  OND also partners with ODS and other CDER offices for information and  analysis to help it make postmarket drug safety decisions. When  considering postmarket drug safety issues, OND staff use evidence found  in clinical trials. For example, one OND manager told us that OND staff  typically review adverse event data related to a drug, obtain a consult from  ODS, and then review any clinical trial data. Then, if necessary, OND  makes a decision about what action should be taken, which may include  negotiating with a sponsor to change a drug\u2019s label, restricting its  distribution, or proposing to withdraw the drug\u2019s approval."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ODS Serves as a Consultant to OND", "paragraphs": ["ODS serves primarily as a consultant to OND and has an overall goal of  reducing preventable deaths and injuries associated with the use of drugs  with a primary focus on postmarket drug safety.

Although FDA\u2019s postmarket drug safety office has  been reorganized several times over the years, the consultant role of the  office has remained consistent. ODS was formed in 2002 when FDA  combined the Office of Postmarketing Drug Risk Assessment with the  MedWatch program (from the Office of Training and Communications)  and with patient labeling and risk communication functions (from the  Division of Drug Marketing, Advertising, and Communications). ODS was  established within the new Office of Pharmacoepidemiology and  Statistical Science (OPaSS).

According to the ODS Director, the management team consists of the  director, deputy director, an associate director for regulatory affairs, and  an associate director for science and medicine. ODS\u2019s three divisions are:  the Division of Drug Risk Evaluation (DDRE), the Division of Surveillance,  Research, and Communication Support, and the Division of Medication  Errors and Technical Support. The Division of Surveillance, Research, and  Communication Support is involved with the acquisition and analysis of  data related to drug safety. This division also reviews consumer-oriented  materials for content and patient-friendly language, such as medication  guides, which are dispensed with drugs that have serious safety concerns.  This division also disseminates safety information to the medical  community and general public through the MedWatch Web site. The  Division of Medication Errors and Technical Support is responsible for  conducting premarketing reviews of all proprietary names and labels of  drugs in order to minimize medication errors due to similar names or  confusion related to the labeling and packaging of drugs. This division also  provides postmarketing review and analysis of medication errors.", "ODS\u2019s DDRE is the primary unit responsible for postmarket drug safety  surveillance. Its staff of 47 include safety evaluators, who are generally  pharmacists, and epidemiologists, with many having either a Ph.D. in  epidemiology or an M.D. with epidemiologic training. The division\u2019s safety  evaluators are assigned to cover specific groups or classes of marketed  drugs. They primarily review reports of individual adverse events from  AERS in order to detect safety signals. The division\u2019s epidemiologists work  collaboratively with the safety evaluators, using population-level data to  analyze potential safety signals and put them into context. They also  review the published literature and conduct research through the use of  contracts and other agreements with researchers outside of government,  health care utilization databases, and surveillance systems. Finally, safety  evaluators and epidemiologists interact with international colleagues on  drug safety issues.", "ODS operates primarily in a consultant capacity to OND and does not have  any independent decision-making responsibility. When there is a safety  concern, ODS staff conduct an analysis and produce a written report for  OND called a consult. Safety consults conducted by DDRE staff include  analyses of adverse event reports and assessments of postmarket study  designs and risk management plans. In fiscal year 2004, DDRE completed  approximately 600 safety consults. A majority of DDRE\u2019s consults are  requested by OND. In fiscal year 2004, 71 percent of DDRE\u2019s consults were  requested by OND; 22 percent were requested by other sources; and   7 percent were self-initiated by DDRE. Over time, the proportion of DDRE- initiated consults has declined while the proportion of OND-requested  consults has increased.", "In general, ODS staff take a population-based perspective in their work,  which ODS staff we spoke with contrasted with the clinical perspective of  OND. They look at how a drug is being used in the general population and  its side effects, and they base their safety analyses on adverse event  reports, observational studies, and other population-based data sources.  ODS staff do not typically use clinical trial data for their safety analyses  and conclusions. In their postmarket work, ODS staff also do not operate  under PDUFA drug review goals and therefore do not face the same kinds  of deadlines that OND staff face.

One ODS staff member told us that  since drug safety issues often take a fair amount of time to resolve, it is  important to have consistency in leadership so that the leaders are  knowledgeable of ongoing issues.

As we have described, ODS safety  consults can be initiated within ODS or requested by OND, but typically  OND requests them. OND often requests an analysis because of  information it receives from the drug\u2019s sponsor about a safety concern.  ODS safety evaluators then search AERS for all relevant cases and develop  a summary of individual cases from the reports. The safety evaluators  assess the cases to determine whether the adverse events are drug-related  and whether there are any common trends or risk factors. ODS  epidemiologists sometimes collaborate with the safety evaluators by  estimating how frequently an adverse event occurs among the population  exposed to a particular drug, and they compare this estimate with how  frequently the same event occurs in a population not treated by the drug.  The epidemiologists also might use information from observational studies  and drug use analyses to analyze the safety issue. When completed, ODS  staff summarize their analysis in a written consult. The ODS division  director of the staff who worked on the consult typically reviews the  consult and either signs it, indicating agreement, or writes a memorandum  explaining what part he or she disagrees with and why. According to FDA  officials, OND staff within the review divisions usually decide what  regulatory action should occur, if any, by considering the results of the  safety analysis in the context of other factors such as the availability of  other similar drugs and the severity of the condition the drug is designed  to treat. Several CDER staff, including OND and ODS staff, that we  interviewed told us that most of the time there is agreement within FDA  about what safety actions should be taken. At other times, however, OND  and ODS disagree about whether the postmarket data are adequate to  establish the existence of a safety problem or support a recommended  regulatory action. In those cases, sometimes OND requests additional  analyses by ODS and sometimes there is involvement from other FDA  organizations. In some cases, OND seeks the advice of FDA\u2019s scientific  advisory committees, including DSaRM, for decisions about postmarket  drug safety. The recommendations of the advisory committees do not bind  the agency to any decision. According to FDA officials, if a decision is  made by OND that a safety action is warranted, then OND staff generally  work with the drug\u2019s sponsor to implement it.", "There was sometimes a lack of consensus in our drug case studies, and we  observed that ODS often performed a series of related analyses about the  same safety concerns for OND over a significant period of time. As an  illustration of this iterative decision-making process, OND requested in  2002 that ODS analyze cases of serious skin reactions associated with the  pain reliever Bextra after the drug\u2019s sponsor had communicated with OND  about this potential risk. ODS staff searched the AERS database and found  several related cases for review. They estimated the occurrence of  reported cases of serious skin reactions among Bextra users by using the  cases and drug utilization data. On the basis of their analysis, ODS  recommended that Bextra\u2019s label be updated to include this risk, and OND  followed the recommendation by working with the sponsor to update the  label in 2002. Between 2002 and 2004, ODS staff conducted five other  analyses of the occurrence of serious skin reactions associated with  Bextra, including two that were requested by OND. In March 2004, ODS  staff recommended that Bextra carry a boxed warning about its risks of  serious skin reactions. The ODS staff based their recommendation on their  finding that Bextra\u2019s risk for serious skin reactions was 8 to 13 times  higher than that for other similar drugs and 20 times higher than the  incidence rate in the population. The ODS Division Directors who  reviewed the analysis and recommendation agreed, but the OND review  division responsible for Bextra did not initially agree. About 5 months  later, the OND review division decided a boxed warning was warranted,  after ODS performed another analysis requested by OND, comparing  Bextra\u2019s risk with several other similar drugs, including Mobic. ODS  found no reported cases of serious skin reactions associated with Mobic.  In 2005, a joint meeting of FDA\u2019s Arthritis Advisory Committee and DSaRM  was held to discuss the postmarket safety of several anti-inflammatory  drugs including Bextra, with a focus on their cardiovascular risks. The  committees recommended, after presentations by FDA staff and others,  that Bextra should remain on the market.

For example, in the case of Bextra,  as described earlier, ODS and OND staff disagreed about whether the  degree of risk warranted a boxed warning, the most serious warning  placed in the labeling of a prescription medication. As another example,  there were differing opinions over taking stronger actions against  Propulsid, the nighttime heartburn medication which was associated with  cardiovascular side effects, or whether to modify the label. Between 1995  and 1997, Propulsid\u2019s label had been modified, including the addition of a  boxed warning, to warn consumers and professionals about the  cardiovascular side effects of the drug. In June 1997 a task force within  FDA, including OND and ODS staff, was convened to further evaluate the  efficacy and safety of Propulsid. FDA staff, including task force members,  later met to discuss several regulatory options, including proposing further  label modifications, presenting the agency\u2019s concerns to an advisory  committee, and proposing to withdraw approval of Propulsid. According  to a former OND manager, as a result of this meeting, FDA decided to seek  further label modifications. Some staff, from both OND and ODS, however,  supported stronger actions at this time, including proceeding with  proposing a withdrawal of approval. According to several FDA officials,  in the absence of established criteria, decisions about safety actions are  often based on the case-by-case judgments of the individuals reviewing the  data.", "Our observations are consistent with previous FDA reviews. In 2000, two  internal CDER reports based on interviews that FDA conducted with staff  indicated that an absence of established criteria for determining what  safety actions to take, and when, posed a challenge for making postmarket  drug safety decisions. The reports recognized the need to establish criteria  to help guide such decisions. In a review of the safety issues concerning  Propulsid, CDER staff recommended that a standardized approach to  postmarket drug safety issues be established, by addressing various issues  such as how to determine when to incorporate safety issues into labeling  and when stronger actions should supersede further labeling changes.  According to the report, several staff noted frustration with the numerous  changes made to Propulsid\u2019s label that were mostly ineffective in reducing  the number of cardiovascular adverse events. Similarly, after the diabetes  drug Rezulin was removed from the market in 2000 because of its risk for  liver toxicity, a CDER report focused on Rezulin also recommended that a  consistent approach to postmarket drug safety be developed, including  what regulatory actions should occur to address postmarket drug safety  concerns, and when they should occur.", "In addition to a lack of criteria for safety actions, we observed a lack of  clarity related to ODS\u2019s recommendations. In practice, ODS often makes  written recommendations about safety actions to OND but there is some  confusion over this role, according to several ODS managers, and there is  no policy that explicitly states whether ODS\u2019s role includes this  responsibility. The case of Arava illustrates this confusion. In 2002, the  OND review division responsible for Arava, a drug used to treat  rheumatoid arthritis, requested that ODS review postmarket data for cases  of serious liver toxicity associated with its use. The ODS staff who worked  on this analysis recommended that Arava be withdrawn from the market  because they concluded that the risk for serious liver toxicity exceeded its  benefits. The OND Division Director responsible for Arava felt that ODS  should not have included a recommendation in its consult because he  argued that this was the responsibility of OND, not ODS. Some of the  confusion may be the result of ODS\u2019s evolving role in postmarket drug  safety. A current and a former ODS manager told us that in the past, ODS\u2019s  safety consults were technical documents summarizing adverse events  with minimal data analysis and few recommendations. Over time the  consults have become more detailed with sophisticated data analyses and  more recommendations about what safety action is needed (for example,  label change, medication guide, drug withdrawal).", "ODS\u2019s role in scientific advisory committee meetings is also unclear.  According to the OND Director, OND is responsible for setting the agenda  for the advisory committee meetings, with the exception of DSaRM. This  includes who is to present and what issues will be discussed by the  advisory committees. For the advisory committees (other than DSaRM) it  is unclear when ODS staff will participate. While ODS staff have presented  their postmarket drug safety analyses during some advisory committee  meetings, our case study of Arava, and another case involving  antidepressant drugs, provide examples of the exclusion of ODS staff. For  example, in March 2003, the Arthritis Advisory Committee met to review  the efficacy of Arava, and its safety in the context of all available drugs to  treat rheumatoid arthritis. The OND review division responsible for Arava  presented its own analysis of postmarket drug safety data at the meeting,  but did not allow the ODS staff\u2014who had recommended that Arava be  removed from the market\u2014to present their analysis because it felt that  ODS\u2019s review did not have scientific merit. Specifically, the OND review  division felt that some of the cases in the ODS review did not meet the  definition of acute liver failure, the safety issue on which the review was  focused. The OND division also believed that in some of the cases ODS  staff inappropriately concluded that liver failure resulted from exposure to  Arava. After the meeting, ODS epidemiologists and safety evaluators  asked the ODS and OPaSS Directors to clarify ODS\u2019s role involving  postmarket drug safety issues, including its role at advisory committee  meetings. According to an FDA official, there was no written response to  this request.", "As another example of ODS\u2019s unclear role in scientific advisory  committees, in February 2004 an ODS epidemiologist was not allowed to  present his analysis of safety data at a joint meeting of the  Psychopharmacologic Drugs Advisory Committee and the Pediatric  Subcommittee of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee that was  held to discuss reports of suicidal thoughts and actions in children with  major depressive disorder during clinical trials for various antidepressant  drugs. According to statements by FDA officials at a congressional  hearing, OND believed that the ODS staff member\u2019s analysis, which  showed a relationship between the use of antidepressants and suicidal  thoughts and behaviors in children, was too preliminary to be presented in  detail. The analysis was based on pediatric clinical trial data that FDA  requested from the sponsors of several antidepressant drugs. FDA had  asked the sponsors to identify suicide-related events using specific  methods, and then ODS was asked to analyze all of the submitted data.  OND later decided that the sponsors may have been inconsistent in their  classification approaches and asked outside experts to perform additional  reviews of all the cases by rating whether particular events could be  classified as suicidal. The staff member who performed the ODS review,  however, believed that the available data were sufficient to conclude a  relationship between the use of antidepressants and suicidal thoughts and  behaviors in pediatrics and to recommend further safety actions. In his  consult, the ODS staff member also concluded that while additional  analyses would yield valuable information, they would also take several  more months to complete. In light of this delay, he recommended an  interim plan to discourage the use of all but one antidepressant in the  treatment of pediatric major depressive disorders. In December 2004,  ODS epidemiologists communicated to the CDER Director their position  that ODS\u2019s role should include the responsibility of presenting all relevant  ODS data at advisory committee meetings. According to an FDA official,  there was no written response to this request. However, in our interviews,  the Directors of CDER and OND told us that in retrospect they felt it was a  mistake for FDA to have restricted the ODS epidemiologist from  presenting his safety information at the meeting.", "Several ODS managers that we interviewed told us that there is also a lack  of clarity regarding the role of the epidemiologist in postmarket drug  safety work. Despite the fact that ODS\u2019s epidemiologists have some  defined responsibilities, there appears to be some confusion about the  scope of their activities and a lack of understanding on the part of OND  about their role and capabilities. A prior review of postmarket drug safety  identified similar issues. For example, in that review some  epidemiologists indicated that they should be able to maintain an  independent approach to their research and the publication of their  research. However, some OND review division directors indicated that the  work of the epidemiologists should be considered within the context of  CDER\u2019s overall regulatory mission. Further, the epidemiologists\u2019 research  conclusions do not necessarily reflect the conclusions of FDA but may be  perceived as such by the medical community. ODS managers indicated  that a current challenge for FDA is to determine how it should use its  epidemiologists and what their work products should be. According to the  current ODS Director, efforts are needed to help OND better understand  what epidemiologists can do. The epidemiologists themselves have asked  for greater clarity about their role and a stronger voice in decision making."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Lack of Communication and Limited Oversight Hinders the Decision- making Process", "paragraphs": ["A lack of communication between ODS and OND\u2019s review divisions and  limited oversight of postmarket drug safety issues by ODS management  have also hindered the decision-making process. The frequency and extent  of communication between ODS and OND\u2019s divisions on postmarket drug  safety vary. ODS and OND staff often described their relationship with  each other as generally collaborative, with effective communication. But  both ODS and OND staff said sometimes there were communication  problems, and this has been an ongoing concern. For example, according  to some current and former ODS staff, OND does not always adequately  communicate the key question or point of interest to ODS when it requests  a consult, and as ODS works on the consult there is sometimes little  interaction between the two offices. After a consult is completed and sent  to OND, ODS staff reported that OND sometimes does not respond in a  timely manner or at all. Several ODS staff characterized this as consults  falling into a \u201cblack hole\u201d or \u201cabyss.\u201d OND\u2019s Director told us that OND staff  probably do not \u201cclose the loop\u201d in responding to ODS\u2019s consults, which  includes explaining why certain ODS recommendations are not followed.  In some cases CDER managers and OND staff criticized the methods used  in ODS consults and told us that the consults were too lengthy and  academic.", "ODS management has not effectively overseen postmarket drug safety  issues, and as a result, it is unclear how FDA can know that important  safety concerns have been addressed and resolved in a timely manner.  According to a former ODS Director, the small size of ODS\u2019s management  team has presented a challenge for effective oversight of postmarket drug  safety issues. Another problem is the lack of systematic information on  drug safety issues. According to the ODS Director, ODS currently  maintains a database of consults that can provide certain types of  information such as the total count, the types of consults that ODS staff  conducted, and the ODS staff that wrote the consults. But it does not  include information about whether ODS staff have made  recommendations for safety actions and how the safety issues were  handled and resolved, including whether recommended safety actions  were implemented by OND. For example, ODS was unable to provide us  with a summary of the recommendations for safety actions that its staff  made in 2004 because it was not tracking such information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Data Constraints Contribute to Difficulty in Making Postmarket Safety Decisions", "paragraphs": ["Data constraints\u2014such as weaknesses in data sources and limitations in  requiring certain studies and obtaining data\u2014contribute to FDA\u2019s  difficulty in making postmarket drug safety decisions. OND and ODS use  three different sources of data to make postmarket drug safety decisions.  They include adverse event reports, clinical trial studies, and observational  studies. While data from each source have weaknesses that contribute to  the difficulty in making postmarket drug safety decisions, evidence from  more than one source can help inform the postmarket decision-making  process. The availability of these data sources is constrained, however,  because of FDA\u2019s limited authority to require drug sponsors to conduct  postmarket studies and its resources.", "While decisions about postmarket drug safety are often based on adverse  event reports, FDA cannot establish the true frequency of adverse events  in the population with AERS data. The inability to calculate the true  frequency makes it hard to establish the magnitude of a safety problem,  and it makes comparisons of risks across similar drugs difficult. In  addition, it can be difficult to attribute adverse events to particular drugs  when there is a relatively high incidence rate in the population for the  medical condition. For example, ODS staff analyzed adverse event  reports of serious cardiovascular events among users of the anti- inflammatory drug Vioxx in a 2001 consult. However, because Vioxx was  used to treat arthritis, which occurs more frequently among older adults,  and because of the relatively high rate of cardiovascular events among the  elderly, ODS staff concluded that the postmarket data available at that  time were not sufficient to establish that Vioxx was causally related to  serious cardiovascular adverse events. With AERS data it is also difficult  to attribute adverse events to the use of particular drugs because the  AERS reports may be confounded by other factors, such as other drug  exposures. For example, one AERS report described a patient who  developed cardiac arrest after he was given the drug hyaluronidase with  two local anesthetics in preparation for cataract surgery. Because local  anesthetics can lead to cardiac events, the ODS safety evaluator who  reviewed this case concluded that the causal role of hyaluronidase alone  could not be established.", "FDA may also use data from clinical trials and observational studies to  support postmarket drug safety decisions, but each source has  weaknesses that constrain the usefulness of the data provided. Clinical  trials, in particular randomized clinical trials, are considered the \u201cgold  standard\u201d for assessing evidence about efficacy and safety because they  are considered the strongest method by which one can determine whether  new drugs work. However, clinical trials also have weaknesses. Clinical  trials typically have too few enrolled patients to detect serious adverse  events associated with a drug that occur relatively infrequently in the  population being studied. They are usually carried out on homogenous  populations of patients that often do not reflect the types of patients who  will actually take the drugs, including those who have other medical  problems or take other medications. In addition, clinical trials are often  too short in duration to identify adverse events that may occur only after  long use of the drug. This is particularly important for drugs used to treat  chronic conditions where patients are taking the medications for the long  term. Observational studies, which use data obtained from population- based sources, can provide FDA with information about the population  effect and risk associated with the use of a particular drug. Because they  are not controlled experiments, however, there is the possibility that the  results can be biased or confounded by other factors.", "Despite the weaknesses of clinical trials and observational studies,  evidence from both types of studies helps inform FDA\u2019s postmarket drug  safety decision-making process. For example, clinical trials conducted by  drug sponsors for their own purposes sometimes provide information for  FDA\u2019s evaluation of postmarket drug safety issues. For instance, drug  sponsors sometimes conduct clinical trials for drugs already marketed in  order to seek approval for a new or expanded use. These studies may  also be conducted to support claims about the additional benefits of a  drug, and their results sometimes reveal safety information about a  marketed drug. For example, to support the addition of a claim for the  lower risk of gastrointestinal outcomes (such as ulcers and bleeding),  Vioxx\u2019s sponsor conducted a clinical trial that found a greater number of  heart attacks in patients taking Vioxx compared with another anti- inflammatory drug, naproxen. This safety information was later added to  Vioxx\u2019s labeling. In addition to relying on sponsors, ODS partners with  researchers outside of FDA to conduct postmarket observational studies  through cooperative agreements and contracts. For example, several  cooperative agreements supported a study of Propulsid using population- based databases from two managed care organizations and one state  Medicaid program, before and after warnings on contraindications were  added to the drug\u2019s label in 1998. The cooperative agreement researchers,  which included ODS staff, measured the prevalence of contraindicated use  of Propulsid, and found that a 1998 labeling change warning about the  contraindication did not significantly decrease the percentage of users  who should not have been prescribed this drug.", "FDA\u2019s access to postmarket clinical trial and observational data, however,  is limited by its authority and available resources. As described previously,  FDA does not have broad authority to require that a drug sponsor conduct  an observational study or clinical trial for the purpose of investigating a  specific postmarket safety concern. One senior FDA official and several  outside drug safety experts told us that FDA needs greater authority to  require such studies. Long-term clinical trials may be needed to answer  safety questions about risks associated with the long-term use of drugs,  such as those that are widely used to treat chronic conditions. For  example, during a February 2005 scientific advisory committee meeting,  some FDA staff and members of the Arthritis Advisory Committee and  DSaRM indicated that there was a need for better information on the long- term use of anti-inflammatory drugs and discussed how a long-term trial  might be designed to study the cardiovascular risks associated with the  use of these drugs. As another example, FDA approved Protopic and  Elidel, both eczema creams, in December 2000 and December 2001,  respectively. Since their approval, FDA has received reports of lymphoma  and skin cancer in children and adults treated with these creams. In March  2005, FDA announced that it would require label changes for the creams,  including a boxed warning about the potential cancer risk. An ODS  epidemiologist told us that FDA has been trying for several years to get the  sponsor to do long-term studies of these drugs, but that it has been  difficult to negotiate.", "In the absence of specific authority, FDA often relies on drug sponsors  voluntarily agreeing to conduct such postmarket studies. But the  postmarket studies that drug sponsors agree to conduct have not  consistently been completed. For example, one study estimated that the  completion rate of postmarket studies, including those that sponsors have  voluntarily agreed to conduct, rose from 17 percent in the mid-1980s to   24 percent between 1991 and 2003. FDA has little leverage to ensure that  these studies are carried out, for example, by imposing administrative  penalties.", "In terms of resource limitations, several FDA staff (including CDER  managers) and outside drug safety experts told us that in the past ODS has  not had enough resources for cooperative agreements to support its  postmarket drug surveillance program. Annual funding for this program  was less than $1 million from fiscal year 2002 through fiscal year 2005. In  October 2005 FDA awarded four contracts to replace the cooperative  agreements, and FDA announced that these contracts would allow FDA to  more quickly access population-level data and a wider range of data  sources. The total amount of the contracts, awarded from 2005 to 2010, is  about $5.4 million, which averages about $1.1 million per year, a slight  increase from fiscal year 2005 funding. The new contracts will provide  access to data from a variety of health care settings including health  maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations, and state  Medicaid programs.", "According to an FDA official, FDA does not conduct its own clinical trials  because of the high cost associated with carrying out such studies and  because FDA does not have the infrastructure needed to conduct them. It  was recently estimated that clinical trials designed to study long-term drug  safety could cost between $3 million and $7 million per trial. The  estimated cost of just one such trial would exceed the amount FDA has  currently allocated ($1.1 million) for its contracts with researchers outside  of FDA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "FDA Initiatives Are an Improvement, but Will Not Address All Gaps", "paragraphs": ["FDA has undertaken several initiatives to improve the postmarket drug  safety decision-making process, but these are unlikely to address all the  gaps.

The draft policy was  designed to ensure that all major postmarket safety recommendations,  such as the market withdrawal of a drug, would be discussed by involved  CDER managers, starting at the division level. The draft policy states that  CDER staff, including ODS staff, are to write a detailed memorandum  describing their recommendation for a major safety action. If the  immediate supervisor disagrees, he or she prepares a memorandum  explaining the nature of the differences, and then the division director  prepares a memorandum indicating how the issue should be resolved.

A Division Consensus Meeting is to be convened for every  recommendation regardless of whether there is initial agreement between  the staff member making the recommendation and the supervisor and  division director.

FDA has recently made some important organizational  and policy changes, but more could be done to improve management  oversight of postmarket drug safety issues, to improve the dispute  resolution process, and to strengthen the collaboration between OND and  ODS. In order to address the serious limitations of the data, FDA will need  to continue its efforts to develop useful observational studies and to  access and use additional healthcare databases. However, even if FDA is  successful in expanding its data sources for postmarket drug safety  surveillance, it would still benefit from information from long-term clinical  trials of certain drugs and the additional authority to require that these  studies be carried out."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["To improve the decision-making process for postmarket drug safety, the  Congress should consider expanding FDA\u2019s authority to require drug  sponsors to conduct postmarket studies, such as clinical trials or  observational studies, as needed, to collect additional data on drug safety  concerns."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve the postmarket drug safety decision-making process, we  recommend that the Commissioner of FDA take the following four actions:    establish a mechanism for systematically tracking ODS\u2019s  recommendations and subsequent safety actions;    with input from the DSB and the Process Improvement Teams, revise and  implement the draft policy on major postmarket drug safety decisions;  improve CDER\u2019s dispute resolution process by revising the pilot program  to increase its independence; and    clarify ODS\u2019s role in FDA\u2019s scientific advisory committee meetings  involving postmarket drug safety issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["FDA reviewed a draft of this report and provided comments, which are  reprinted in appendix V.

FDA did not comment  on our recommendations. In addition, FDA made six comments about  specific aspects of our draft report. First, concerning our description of  the complexity of the postmarket decision-making process, FDA stated  that the draft report implied the process is too complex and that FDA  should not be criticized for its difficult task of weighing the risks and  benefits associated with drugs with the data available to the agency. We  agree with FDA that postmarket drug safety issues are inherently complex.  For that reason, we believe that FDA needs to have greater clarity about  how decisions are made and to establish more effective oversight of the  decision-making process. Furthermore, we believe that our report fairly  characterizes the limitations of the data that FDA relies on in this complex  process. Because of the data limitations, we believe that FDA needs  greater authority to access certain kinds of postmarket safety data.  Second, FDA noted that factors other than PDUFA goals influence OND\u2019s  work and its pace. FDA also stated that ODS plays a role in certain  premarket safety activities and that PDUFA goals also apply to these  activities. We clarified these points in the report. Third, FDA stated that  referring to ODS as a consultant to OND understates the role of ODS in  drug safety and that CDER considers ODS and OND to be equal partners in  the identification and timely resolution of drug safety issues. As we stated  in the draft report, we found that the central focus of the process is the  iterative interaction between OND and ODS. Nonetheless, ODS does not  have any independent decision-making responsibility while OND has the  ultimate responsibility to make decisions about regulatory actions  concerning the postmarket safety of drugs. Further, both OND and ODS  refer to ODS reports on drug safety as consults. For these reasons, we  believe that our description of ODS as a consultant to OND is accurate.", "Fourth, FDA agreed with our statements about the role of the DSB and  indicated that the DSB has reviewed current mechanisms for identifying  safety issues and discussed ways to enhance the tracking of those issues.  Fifth, FDA commented that our examples of ODS staff being excluded  from advisory committee meetings imply that such disagreements occur  frequently. FDA stated that this is not the case, and that OND and ODS  work cooperatively in the vast majority of cases. However, our work  demonstrates a need for further clarification of ODS\u2019s role. Finally, FDA  commented that our case study chronology for Arava was incomplete  because it did not describe two meetings. We provided additional  clarification in the report about the meetings in the chronology for Arava.", "As we agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents  of this report earlier, we plan no further distribution of it until 30 days  from the date of this letter.
