Also, some University students, such as those who graduate from the military academies and the Reserved Officer Training Corps (ROTC) programs, have existing obligations before becoming University students.", "Overall, many factors are associated with the decision to make the military a career, including demographic and personal concerns such as age and family considerations, compensation, and nonphysician activities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Longer Pay-Back Requirements Contribute to Higher Retention of University Graduates", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD\u2019s retention data indicate a relationship between retention and accession source, the data do not indicate the reasons why these patterns occur. However, the longer obligation pay-back requirement is a key factor in the longer retention of University graduates. University graduates are expected to serve for about 11 years after graduation, including GME training, before they are first able to leave military service; compared to about 8 years for the regular scholarship program and 4 years for deferred scholarship program graduates. This longer pay-back obligation period is expected to lead many University graduates to decide to serve another 9 years until they are able to retire. University officials said the longer retention may be partially due to their recruitment criteria, under which they specifically attempt to select people who express an interest in making the military a career. Hence, the longer retention is consistent with students\u2019 stated intentions.", "Prior military obligation on the part of some of its students may also influence University retention. Two 1994 military studies identified military academy backgrounds, prior military experience, University attendance, and fellowship training as predictive factors in the retention of physicians in certain specialties. About 21 percent of all students at the University have attended the military academies or participated in ROTC programs. We previously reported that retention of these officers, regardless of profession, is high. Another 25 percent of all University students had prior military experience in that they were either currently on active duty at the time they enrolled or they had prior active duty or reserve experience.", "Many of these predictive factors could apply to scholarship program graduates as well. For example, Army scholarship program officials suggested that the retention experience of ROTC and military academy graduates in the scholarship program is similar to that of University graduates from the same sources. Moreover, scholarship program recruiters also look for people who are interested in making the military a career. Lower retention among deferred scholarship program graduates has been attributed to the fact that they are better able to network in the civilian sector during their civilian GME programs and create private sector opportunities for themselves. One DOD official who has contributed to a number of DOD retention studies believed the retention patterns for all physicians who stay 12 years is about the same, regardless of accession source."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Factors Affecting Decisions About a Military Career", "paragraphs": ["Many other factors influence physicians\u2019 decisions to stay in or leave the military. For example, personal characteristics, such as age and sex, family considerations, and working conditions have all been found to influence physicians\u2019 decisions. More often than not, financial considerations have been identified as a significant factor in retention. For example, in 1990, we conducted a survey of 1,500 military physicians to determine the factors that most influence their decisions to leave the military. Time spent on nonphysician tasks and gaps between military and civilian compensation were the most significant factors identified. Physicians also reported dissatisfaction with other aspects of military service, such as poor hospital equipment, the inability to provide continuity of care to patients, excessive amounts of quality assurance tasks, and limited opportunities to attend professional meetings and training.", "Although many factors affect retention, a key DOD official involved in DOD retention studies said that the options available to DOD to change retention patterns are limited. For example, there may be little that can be done about dissatisfaction with quality assurance procedures because these are needed for hospital accreditation. The official also said that even in those areas where DOD might have some control, such as physician compensation, there are limits on the amounts that DOD can pay. Moreover, he believes that for some medical specialties, DOD could not match the compensation that these physicians could earn in the private sector.", "Other studies that examined why physicians stay in the military identified the following reasons: the availability of teaching assignments and clinical research opportunities; lack of worry about malpractice and office management problems; more control over working hours; the collegial atmosphere of military medicine; and the opportunity to travel."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternative Strategies to Meet DOD\u2019s Long-Term Physician Needs", "paragraphs": ["Proponents of the University note that the University meets DOD\u2019s need for a small cadre of experienced military officers and leaders who, in their opinion, are better prepared for the special needs of military medicine.

Additional readiness training could be provided through a post graduate period specifically designed to enhance the physician\u2019s preparation for the special needs of military medicine.

Nevertheless, those who advocate the continuation of the University make strong arguments that the need for a cadre of military physician career officers and leaders remains, and that the University fulfills that need well. University supporters also note that in addition to providing a high quality medical education, the University provides other benefits such as medical research and archival programs, required continuing medical education for overseas medical personnel, and graduate education programs for allied health professionals. University officials stated that if the University were not performing these tasks, other DOD components would have to be tasked to carry them out.", "The early retention history for University graduates indicates that the majority of them are still in the military and fulfilling their service obligations. Also, our review of DOD\u2019s retention analyses shows that the University would likely continue to meet DOD\u2019s needs for a cadre of military physician career officers. However, based on our review of available information, we believe that if the University were closed, these needs could be fulfilled by alternative strategies, such as adjusting the pay-back requirements of scholarship students, revising the training approach for those students to incorporate additional military unique training sessions, or doing both.", "In our view, issues relating to the changed need for military physicians in war and peacetime settings are important factors to be considered as decisionmakers debate the future of both the University and scholarship programs. The changed wartime scenarios, which point to a reduction in the number of physicians needed to meet contingency requirements should, in our opinion, be taken into account as the future existence and the possible size of the accession programs are determined.

Rather than offering one unit of measurement, we have presented, in an iterative way, several units of measurement that we believe present a complete comparative analysis of the programs.", "We have revised the report to further emphasize the cost-avoidance activities of the University but, as stated earlier, we did not validate the University\u2019s estimates of cost-avoidance.", "The Assistant Secretary and University officials were concerned that we had not appropriately emphasized the University\u2019s unique contribution to military medicine. In response, we have revised the report to reflect the University\u2019s approach to providing a complete education in military medicine and made minor adjustments to the draft report. These adjustments were designed to attribute statements about the unique needs of military medicine and the University\u2019s contributions without appearing to question the credibility of our sources. However, we believe that judgments regarding the relative emphasis placed on various issues discussed in the report must be based on the evidence at hand. In this case, the evidence was based primarily on our review of military medical literature and discussions with military medical personnel who provided their opinions regarding the uniqueness of military medicine.", "Finally, in developing the matter for congressional consideration, we did not envision that DOD would have to provide additional justification for the accession programs.
