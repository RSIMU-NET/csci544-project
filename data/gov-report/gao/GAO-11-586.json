GAO was asked to determine (1) the scope and status of MIDAS, (2) whether MIDAS has appropriate program management, and (3) whether MIDAS has appropriate executive oversight and governance. To do so, GAO reviewed relevant department guidance and program documents and interviewed USDA officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["FSA plans to modernize the systems supporting its 37 farm programs with MIDAS. The implementation cost estimate is approximately $305 million, with a life cycle cost of approximately $473 million. However, the implementation cost estimate is uncertain because it has not been updated since 2007 and does not include cost elements that have since been identified, such as the selection of a commercial enterprise resource planning product. Following completion of its initial phase of program planning in October 2010, MIDAS entered its second of four phases--proof of concept and system design. However, the schedule for this phase, which was to be completed in October 2011, is now uncertain. While FSA officials report that the proof of concept activities are proceeding as scheduled, they have delayed a requirements review milestone until December 2011 and have not yet set a new date for the design review. As a result, the completion date for the second phase and its impact on subsequent phases is uncertain. FSA officials plan to revisit the cost and schedule estimates after completing requirements definition. FSA's program management approach includes many leading practices, but could be strengthened. For example, prior to the proof of concept and system design phase, plans were in place for organizational change and communication, requirements management, and risk. However, a few practices were either partially addressed or not addressed at all in program plans or in the implementation of those plans. For example, an integrated team has not yet been formed with representatives from IT programs that MIDAS depends on for its success. Moreover, the plans do not explicitly call for, and FSA has not produced, a schedule that reflects dependencies with those programs, and risks are not being regularly tracked as planned. FSA's uneven adoption of leading practices is likely to limit the agency's effectiveness in managing system development, and thus its ability to deliver system capabilities on time and within budget. Executive-level governance for MIDAS has not been clearly defined and does not fully follow department IT investment management guidance. Specifically, oversight and governance has been assigned to several department and agency bodies, but roles and escalation criteria are not clearly defined among them. Department officials reported that department guidance is being followed for monthly status reviews, but not for department-level reviews at key decision points. The lack of clarity and definition for the roles of the governance bodies could result in duplication or voids in program oversight, as well as wasted resources. Moreover, because MIDAS is not being governed according to the department's investment guidance, the department may not be rigorously monitoring and managing the program and its risks, and may not have the information it needs to make timely and appropriate decisions to ensure the success of MIDAS."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is recommending that USDA update cost and schedule estimates, address management weaknesses in plans and program execution, and clarify the roles and coordination among governance bodies.

Our reviews of these  practices and experience with federal agencies have shown that such  practices can significantly increase the likelihood of delivering promised  system capabilities on time and within budget. Organizations such as the  Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie Mellon University have issued  guidance on effective planning and management practices for  developing and acquiring software-based systems. These practices  include:  \uf0b7  Project planning and monitoring: Project planning establishes a  framework for managing the project by defining project activities and  their estimated cost and schedule, among other things. Project  monitoring provides an understanding of the project\u2019s progress, so  that appropriate corrective actions can be taken if performance  deviates from plans. Effective planning and monitoring employ a  range of resources and tools that promote coordination of and insight  into the project\u2019s activities, such as an integrated project schedule,  which identifies a project\u2019s dependencies with other projects to  facilitate coordination of their tasks and resources. \uf0b7  Requirements management: Requirements establish what the  system is to do, how well it is to do it, and how it is to interact with  other systems. Effective management of requirements involves  assigning responsibility for them, tracking them, and controlling  requirements changes over the course of the project. It also ensures  that requirements are validated against user needs and that each  requirement traces back to the business need and forward to its  design and testing. \uf0b7  Contract management: Effective contract management ensures that  contractor activities are performed in accordance with contractual  requirements and that the acquiring organization has sufficient  visibility into the contractor\u2019s performance to identify and respond to  performance shortfalls. It also ensures that the roles of multiple  contractors are clearly defined in a contract management plan, thus  avoiding confusion or duplication of effort in managing the tasks. \uf0b7  Risk management: Risk management is a process for anticipating  problems and taking appropriate steps to mitigate risks and minimize  their impact on project commitments. It involves identifying and  cataloging the risks, categorizing them based on their estimated  impact, prioritizing them, developing risk mitigation strategies, and  tracking progress in executing the strategies.", "For projects such as MIDAS, which involve complex and concurrent  activities, it is important that proven practices be implemented early in the  life of the project so that potential problems can be identified and  addressed before they can significantly impact program commitments.", "Federal guidance, along with our framework for managing IT  investments and our prior reviews of federal investments also point to  the importance of having executive-level oversight and governance for  the success of large IT investments. Executive attention helps to ensure  that such projects follow sound business practices for planning, acquiring,  and operating the IT system; meet cost, schedule, and performance  goals; and detect and address risks and problems that could impede  progress toward those goals. When multiple oversight boards govern an  investment, it is critical to define the roles and coordination among them  to avoid duplication of effort and to increase the effectiveness of the  oversight. To help institutionalize such oversight, OMB requires capital  planning and investment control processes, including a department-level  board with the authority to commit resources and make decisions for IT  investments. Such boards are to review the investments at key decision  points against standard evaluation factors. OMB also requires annual and  monthly reporting for such investments. Due to its concerns that  investment review boards have not always been effective, OMB recently  identified additional actions agencies should take to strengthen the  boards, including improving the timeliness and accuracy of program data  available to them."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "MIDAS Is Currently Being Defined; Cost and Schedule Estimates Are Uncertain", "paragraphs": ["FSA plans to modernize all the systems that support its 37 farm programs  (listed in app. II) with the MIDAS program.

When an  investment is governed by multiple boards or bodies, the roles and  coordination among these bodies should be clearly defined, including the  processes and criteria for escalating issues. In addition, we and OMB  recommend that federal agencies establish an executive board, typically  at the department level, to oversee major IT investments. This board  should review investments against criteria at key decision points, such as  investment selection. In addition, OMB requires departmental oversight of  the business cases for major IT investments and monthly status updates  of program cost, schedule, and performance information. Consistent with  federal guidance, USDA requires an executive board to oversee major IT  investments at key decision points and a monthly status review.", "Oversight and governance of MIDAS is the responsibility of several  department and agency bodies. Department-level oversight is performed  by the Senior Management Oversight Committee; the Project  Management/Design Decision Committee, which reports to the senior  committee; and a proposed third body called the Modernization Review  Board. In addition, the Modernization Program Management Review  Board operates at the agency level. FSA has not clearly identified this  board\u2019s position in the oversight hierarchy.

Charters and plans for the department Project Management/Design  Decision Committee and the agency Modernization Program  Management Review Board describe similar\u2014and potentially  overlapping\u2014roles for overseeing agency IT initiatives. Moreover, the  extent of oversight by the active bodies and criteria for escalating  issues related to cost, schedule, performance, and risk have not been  defined in charters or plans. \uf0b7  A key role has not been assigned. According to the MIDAS risk  register, the Project Management/Design Decision Committee and  Senior Management Oversight Committee are to coordinate  enterprise resource planning among MIDAS and other initiatives, such  as financial management. However, this coordination role has not  been described in charters or plans. \uf0b7  The role of the proposed board has not yet been defined. FSA  officials stated that the USDA Modernization Review Board is to  improve MIDAS governance, but its oversight responsibilities and  processes to do so have not yet been defined.", "These concerns have been recognized to some extent by FSA and the  department, but remain unresolved. In October 2010, the FSA  Modernization Program Management Review Board appeared to be  aware of this lack of clarity and recommended that a directory of  governance boards be developed and their respective responsibilities,  decision-making processes, and escalation path be defined. An April  2011 Project Management/Design Decision Committee briefing noted that  the proposed Modernization Review Board would mitigate the risk of  integrating MIDAS with other systems. However, as of May 2011, these  recommended improvements had yet to be provided.", "Regarding oversight of MIDAS, none of these boards reviewed MIDAS at  key decision points using criteria defined in department guidance. An  official from the department\u2019s CIO office stated that the Senior  Management Oversight Committee serves as the IT investment executive  board recommended by OMB and required by USDA, although the  committee\u2019s charter and other governance plans do not specify this role.  The committee reviewed MIDAS at the planning gate in October 2010,  but did not use the department\u2019s review criteria. Instead, the review  focused on contract deliverables and did not include project management  office documents such as the MIDAS risk assessment and project  management plan, as called for by department guidance.

The agency has made key decisions regarding the  scope of MIDAS, the contractors that will support system design and  development, and the incremental approach it will use to execute the  program. However, FSA\u2019s implementation cost estimate has yet to reflect  decisions and activities that have occurred since the estimate was  developed in 2007. In addition, key events for the proof of concept and  system design phase, currently under way, have been delayed.  Consequently, agency managers are revising the plans for completing  MIDAS requirements definition, system design, and the cost and  schedule for the program, but are unlikely to finalize these plans until  fiscal year 2012. Given the agency\u2019s prior difficulty with developing  reliable cost and schedule estimates, and our corresponding prior  recommendation, it is critical that FSA and USDA adopt a rigorous and  credible approach for revising estimates and complete them in a timely  manner, so that the department has a basis for effectively managing  program progress and making decisions about needed adjustments.", "The challenges USDA is facing in meeting its program commitments are  more likely to be overcome if it can adopt and execute effective  management practices. The management framework established by the  agency in a series of plans reflects many leading practices for program  planning and monitoring, requirements, contracts, and risk. Moreover,  FSA has followed through on these plans to some extent by staffing  government managers in these areas and instituting mechanisms to  promote use of the practices, such as contract provisions for earned  value management. However, MIDAS management could be further  strengthened through improved definition and execution of these and  other leading practices, specifically by chartering and operating an  integrated project team; fully documenting MIDAS dependencies on other  departmental IT initiatives in an integrated project schedule; clearly  identifying and reporting key incremental milestones to OMB; validating  all previously identified user concerns against MIDAS requirements;  clearly delineating contractor roles and responsibilities; and consistently  identifying and regularly tracking and reporting the status of MIDAS risks.  By applying its plans and embracing other proven management practices,  FSA will stand a better chance of surfacing and resolving issues before  they can derail the program.", "The agencywide impact of MIDAS and its dependence on other IT  initiatives point to the need for clearly defined and effectively executed  oversight. However, the roles and coordination among oversight bodies  are not clearly defined and USDA\u2019s well-defined investment oversight  guidance is not being fully executed.

We also reviewed the fiscal year 2012  business case (called the exhibit 300), program schedules, oversight  reviews from October 2010, and a 2010 FSA report to Congress to  identify the active contracts supporting MIDAS and to determine the  program\u2019s phases, due dates, and phase completion status. To determine  whether FSA completed the planning phase as scheduled, we identified  the deviation between the planned and actual completion dates. We also  examined selected products produced during that phase. We identified  the cost estimate and its limitations using these sources and a 2009 third- party report to Congress on FSA modernization. We interviewed USDA  and FSA officials to clarify information in the documents we reviewed and  to more fully understand the program\u2019s progress and status.", "To determine whether MIDAS has appropriate program management, we  identified leading management practices for four areas that we and others  have previously found to be important for the success of large information  technology (IT) programs\u2014planning and monitoring, requirements  management, contract management, and risk management. We then  reviewed plans to determine if they addressed these leading practices.  For the four management areas, we examined plans, organization charts,  and program records to determine whether and when managers had  been assigned. To the extent that MIDAS had progressed to a stage  where implementation of these practices would be appropriate, we  reviewed program artifacts and interviewed program officials to determine  the extent to which the practices were in place.", "We assessed a practice as being satisfied if the evidence provided by  USDA and FSA officials demonstrated all aspects of the leading practice.  We assessed a practice as being not satisfied if the evidence did not  demonstrate any aspect of the leading practice, or if no evidence was  provided by USDA or FSA for that practice. Finally, we assessed a  practice as being partially satisfied if the evidence demonstrated some,  but not all, aspects of the leading practice. Additional considerations in  our evaluation of each management area follow.  \uf0b7  Project planning and monitoring: We compared program plans,  including the project management plan and supporting  documentation, against leading practices to determine whether such  practices were specified in the plans. We also examined program  artifacts and records to determine the extent to which an integrated  project team, an integrated project schedule with external  dependencies, and tracking and reporting of program progress  outside the program were in place. Due to the early stage of the  program, we did not verify whether earned value management had  been executed and reported as planned or whether organizational  change and communications activities had been executed as planned. \uf0b7  Requirements management: We compared the requirements  management plan and related documents against leading practices to  determine whether such practices had been specified in the plans.  Because requirements were in the early stages of being defined  during the period of this review, we did not verify whether FSA was  executing its requirements management approach as planned.  However, we reviewed a 2008 requirements document containing  previously elicited user requirements and interviewed FSA officials to  determine how those requirements had been validated. \uf0b7  Contract management: We compared program plans, including the  project management plan and supporting documentation, against  leading practices to determine whether such practices had been  specified in the plans.

We reviewed the risk  inventory to determine whether duplicate contractor roles had been  identified as risks and how the risks were described. \uf0b7  Risk management: We compared the risk management plan and  supporting documentation against leading practices to determine  whether such practices had been specified in plans. We also reviewed  the November 2010 risk inventory to assess whether risks had been  aligned with risk factors such as mitigation plans and status. We did  not assess whether FSA assigned the risk indicators according to the  criteria in the risk management plan. To assess whether the risk  inventory was being updated, we compared the November 2010 risk  inventory to risk inventories from January 2011 and May 2011 to  characterize overall changes to risks, mitigation strategies, and status,  and to determine whether the inventories clearly captured progress in  addressing selected risks.", "To determine whether MIDAS has appropriate executive oversight and  governance, we reviewed USDA guidance for investment management,  project plans, charters, and meeting minutes for the governance bodies,  agency presentations, and 2009 and 2010 USDA and FSA reports to  Congress to identify the executive oversight and governance bodies,  responsibilities, and hierarchy for MIDAS.
