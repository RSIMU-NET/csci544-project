In recent years, a growing percentage of HECMs insured by FHA have ended because borrowers defaulted on their loans. While death of the borrower is the most commonly reported reason why HECMs terminate, the percentage of terminations due to borrower defaults increased from 2 percent in fiscal year 2014 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2018 (see figure). Most HECM defaults are due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or failing to pay property charges, such as property taxes or homeowners insurance. Since 2015, FHA has allowed HECM servicers to put borrowers who are behind on property charges onto repayment plans to help prevent foreclosures, but as of fiscal year-end 2018, only about 22 percent of these borrowers had received this option.", "FHA's monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the HECM program have weaknesses. FHA loan data do not currently capture the reason for about 30 percent of HECM terminations (see figure). FHA also has not established comprehensive performance indicators for the HECM portfolio and has not regularly tracked key performance metrics, such as reasons for HECM terminations and the number of distressed borrowers who have received foreclosure prevention options. Additionally, FHA has not developed internal reports to comprehensively monitor patterns and trends in loan outcomes. As a result, FHA does not know how well the HECM program is serving its purpose of helping meet the financial needs of elderly homeowners.", "FHA has not conducted on-site reviews of HECM servicers since fiscal year 2013 and has not benefited from oversight efforts by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). FHA officials said they planned to resume the reviews in fiscal year 2020, starting with three servicers that account for most of the market. However, as of August 2019, FHA had not developed updated review procedures and did not have a risk-based method for prioritizing reviews. CFPB conducts examinations of reverse mortgage servicers but does not provide the results to FHA because the agencies do not have an agreement for sharing confidential supervisory information. Without better oversight and information sharing, FHA lacks assurance that servicers are following requirements, including those designed to help protect borrowers."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss oversight of reverse mortgages  made under the Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program,  which is administered by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) within  the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). Reverse  mortgages are loans that allow seniors to convert part of their home  equity into payments from a lender while still living in their homes. While  reverse mortgages can help senior homeowners meet financial needs,  they also can present risks to borrowers.", "The vast majority of reverse mortgages are made under the HECM  program. As of the end of fiscal year 2018, FHA had insured more than 1  million HECMs, which included about 630,000 active loans and about  468,000 terminated loans. HECMs are originated and serviced by private  FHA-approved lenders and servicers. FHA insures these entities against  losses on the loans and charges borrowers premiums to help cover the  potential cost of insurance claims. While not involved in administering the  HECM program, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)  collects consumer complaints about reverse mortgages and supervises  nonbank reverse mortgage lenders and servicers for compliance with,  and enforces violations of, federal consumer financial protection laws.", "HECMs terminate when a borrower repays or refinances the loan or when  the loan becomes due and payable because the borrower died, moved, or  defaulted (see fig. 1). Defaults occur when borrowers fail to meet  mortgage conditions such as paying property charges (for example,  property taxes and homeowners insurance) or meeting occupancy  requirements. These borrowers risk foreclosure and loss of their homes if  they cannot satisfy the debt or correct the condition that resulted in the  default.", "Certain features of the HECM program can help borrowers delay and, in  some cases, avoid foreclosure. If a borrower falls behind on property  charges, servicers must generally temporarily advance property charges  on a borrower\u2019s behalf (known as servicer advances). However, servicers  may initiate foreclosure proceedings if the borrower does not catch up.  Additionally, since 2015, FHA has made program changes to allow  servicers to offer foreclosure prevention options to distressed HECM  borrowers and nonborrowing spouses of deceased borrowers.", "My testimony summarizes findings from our report on the HECM  program, which is being released today. Specifically, I will discuss (1)  what FHA data show about HECM terminations and the use of  foreclosure prevention options; (2) FHA\u2019s assessment and monitoring of  HECM portfolio performance and foreclosure prevention options; (3)  FHA\u2019s and CFPB\u2019s oversight of HECM servicers; and (4) FHA\u2019s and  CFPB\u2019s collection, analysis, and response to consumer complaints about  HECMs. For this work, we analyzed FHA loan data and reviewed FHA  and CFPB documents on HECM servicer oversight. We also reviewed  FHA and CFPB data on consumer complaints related to reverse  mortgages. We interviewed agency officials, the five largest HECM  servicers (representing 99 percent of the market), and legal aid  organizations representing HECM borrowers. We conducted the work on  which this statement is based in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. More details on our methodology can be  found in the issued report."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "HECM Defaults Have Increased, and Use of Foreclosure Prevention Options Is Limited", "paragraphs": ["Our analysis of FHA data found that 272,155 HECMs terminated from  fiscal years 2014 through 2018. The number of terminations rose from  about 24,000 in fiscal year 2014 to a peak of roughly 82,000 in fiscal year  2016, before declining to about 60,000 in fiscal year 2018.", "In recent years, a growing percentage of HECMs have terminated  because borrowers defaulted on their loans. While death of the borrower  is the most commonly reported reason why HECMs terminated, the  percentage of terminations due to defaults increased from 2 percent in  fiscal year 2014 to 18 percent in fiscal year 2018 (see fig. 2). Most  defaults were due to borrowers not meeting occupancy requirements or  failing to pay property charges. For about 30 percent of terminations, we  were unable to readily determine a termination reason from FHA\u2019s data.", "We also found that servicers\u2019 use of foreclosure prevention options for  HECM borrowers was limited or FHA did not have readily available data  to assess the extent of use. For example, since 2015, FHA has allowed  HECM servicers to offer borrowers who are behind on property charges  repayment plans to help prevent foreclosures, but as of the end of fiscal  year 2018, only about 22 percent of these borrowers had received this  option. Also, while FHA created a low-balance extension in 2016\u2014which  allows HECM servicers to delay calling a HECM due and payable if the  borrower owes less than $2,000 in unpaid property taxes or hazard  insurance\u2014FHA officials told us they do not track how often servicers use  this option. Our analysis of FHA data found that approximately 8,800  HECMs that terminated in fiscal years 2014 through 2018 had unpaid  property charges of less than $2,000 at the time of termination. Some of  these HECMs may have been eligible for a low-balance extension when  they terminated.", "Additionally, we found that it is difficult to estimate the universe of HECMs  potentially eligible for mortgagee optional election assignments\u2014an  option to help nonborrowing spouses stay in their homes after a  borrowing spouse dies. Under this option, if required conditions and time  frames are met, the servicer can assign the HECM to FHA. The  assignment defers repayment of the HECM as long as the nonborrowing  spouse fulfills certain conditions. According to information generated by  FHA, HECM servicers submitted 1,445 requests for mortgagee optional  election assignments from June 2015 (when FHA made this option  available) through September 2018. In total, FHA approved roughly 70  percent of the requests and denied the remaining 30 percent. However,  nonborrowing spouses were not listed on loan documentation for HECMs  originated prior to August 4, 2014. As a result, FHA does not know how  many eligible nonborrowing spouses could have, but did not, apply for the  mortgagee optional election assignment, or how many are potentially  eligible to apply for it in the future. FHA has begun reaching out to HECM  borrowers to inform them of the mortgagee optional election process and  ask them to self-identify whether there is a nonborrowing spouse  associated with their loan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Weaknesses Exist in HECM Termination Data, Performance Assessment, and Portfolio Monitoring", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s monitoring, performance assessment, and reporting for the HECM  program have weaknesses. Since fiscal year 2013, FHA has used the  Home Equity Reverse Mortgage Information Technology (HERMIT)  system to collect data on the servicing of HECMs, but the system does  not contain comprehensive and accurate data about the reasons why  HECMs terminate, a key servicing event. According to the HERMIT User  Guide, servicers should provide a reason in HERMIT when they terminate  a HECM. However, as noted previously, for about 30 percent of the  HECMs that terminated in fiscal years 2014 through 2018, we were  unable to determine the reason for termination. FHA officials told us  termination reasons are available on an individual loan basis in HERMIT  but not in an extractable form. FHA does not regularly track and report on  HECM termination reasons, due partly to this system limitation.", "In the report being released today, we are recommending that FHA take  steps to improve the quality and accuracy of HECM termination data.  These steps may include updating the termination reasons in the  HERMIT system for recording these data or updating the HERMIT User  Guide to more clearly instruct servicers how to record termination  reasons. FHA agreed with this recommendation. Comprehensive and  accurate data on HECM terminations would provide FHA with a better  understanding of loan outcomes\u2014information FHA and Congress need in  order to know how well the program is helping seniors age in place.", "FHA also has not established comprehensive performance indicators for  the HECM portfolio and has not regularly tracked key performance  metrics, such as the percentage of HECM terminations due to borrower  defaults, the proportion of active HECMs with delinquent property  charges, or the percentage of distressed borrowers who have received  foreclosure prevention options. For example, HUD\u2019s most recent strategic  plan and corresponding performance report do not include HECM-specific  performance indicators, and the last comprehensive evaluation of the  HECM program was done in 2000. FHA officials told us they were in the  planning phase for a new evaluation of the program but had not set a  start date and did not expect the evaluation to include an analysis of the  reasons for HECM terminations or the use of foreclosure prevention  options for borrowers in default. We are recommending that FHA  establish, periodically review, and report on performance indicators for  the HECM program and examine the impact of foreclosure prevention  options in the forthcoming HECM program evaluation. FHA agreed with  this recommendation. Better performance assessment could provide FHA  important information about how well the HECM program is working.", "Additionally, we found shortcomings in FHA\u2019s internal reporting and  analysis for the HECM program. For example, FHA has not developed  internal reports to comprehensively monitor patterns and trends in loan  outcomes, such as the percentage of HECM terminations due to borrower  defaults. FHA has generated some reports from HERMIT to help oversee  the HECM portfolio, but it has been slow to develop regular and  comprehensive reporting mechanisms. FHA officials told us that while  data on defaults and foreclosure prevention options have generally been  available in HERMIT since 2015, FHA was unable to obtain reports on  these topics until 2018 because of funding limitations with their HERMIT  system contractor. Our review of the regular and ad hoc reports FHA has  received from its HERMIT system contractor found that many are lists of  loans that meet criteria and do not provide summary statistics that could  be used to readily identify patterns or trends in metrics. Further, we found  the reports required additional analysis to generate meaningful  management information. In the report being released today, we  recommend that FHA develop analytic tools, such as dashboards or  watch lists, to better monitor outcomes for the HECM portfolio, such as  reasons for terminations, defaults, use of foreclosure prevention options,  or advances paid by servicers on behalf of HECM borrowers. FHA agreed  with this recommendation. With more robust program analysis and  internal reporting, FHA would be better positioned to detect and respond  to emerging issues and trends in the HECM portfolio.", "Finally, we found that FHA has not fully analyzed the implications of how  it prioritizes foreclosures for HECMs that servicers have assigned to FHA.  FHA officials told us the agency generally does not foreclose on  borrowers whose HECMs have been assigned to FHA and who are in  default due to unpaid property charges. As a result, defaulted borrowers  whose loans have not been assigned to FHA face a greater risk of  foreclosure than defaulted borrowers with FHA-assigned loans. In  addition, FHA\u2019s process may create a financial incentive for HECM  borrowers with assigned loans to not pay their property charges.  Therefore, we are recommending that FHA analyze the implications of its  prioritization process. FHA agreed with our recommendation. Such  analysis would help FHA to better understand how its process for  prioritizing foreclosures for assigned loans affects the HECM portfolio,  HECM borrowers, neighborhoods, and FHA\u2019s insurance fund."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FHA\u2019s Oversight of Servicers and Collaboration on Oversight between FHA and CFPB Are Limited", "paragraphs": ["FHA\u2019s oversight of HECM servicers has been limited in recent years.

FHA officials  said they planned to resume the HECM servicer reviews in fiscal year  2020, starting with three servicers that account for most of the market.  However, as of August 2019, FHA had not developed updated review  procedures (they were last updated in 2009) and did not have a risk- based method for prioritizing reviews. In the report being released today,  we recommend that FHA develop and implement procedures for  conducting on-site reviews of HECM servicers, including a risk-rating  system for prioritizing and determining the frequency of reviews. FHA  agreed with this recommendation. By resuming HECM servicer on-site  reviews and adopting a risk-rating system, FHA would be better  positioned to ensure that servicers are following program requirements,  including those designed to help protect borrowers.", "Additionally, we found that while CFPB has examined reverse mortgage  servicers and plans to continue doing so, according to CFPB officials the  bureau does not share results with FHA because the agencies do not  have an agreement in place to share supervisory information. CFPB  officials said CFPB and FHA had taken initial steps in 2017 toward  developing an information-sharing agreement. However, as of August  2019, an information-sharing agreement had not been completed.  Accordingly, we are recommending that FHA and CFPB work together to  complete an agreement for sharing the results of CFPB\u2019s examinations of  HECM servicers with FHA. CFPB generally agreed with this  recommendation, and FHA neither agreed nor disagreed. Sharing these  results could aid FHA\u2019s oversight of HECM servicers by providing  additional information about the servicers\u2019 performance and operations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CFPB Collects and Analyzes Consumer Complaints on Reverse Mortgages, but FHA Does Not Use All Available Data", "paragraphs": ["CFPB began collecting reverse mortgage consumer complaints in  December 2011 and has collected about 3,600 complaints since then.  CFPB officials told us they use consumer complaints as part of their  criteria for selecting entities to examine, including reverse mortgage  servicers, and to inform CFPB\u2019s educational publications. We conducted  a detailed analysis of a random, generalizable sample of 100 consumer  complaint narratives drawn from all the reverse mortgage complaints  CFPB received in calendar years 2015 through 2018. Based on our  review of complaint narratives, we found that some of the issues  consumers cited most commonly were foreclosures, poor communication  from lenders or servicers, problems at loan origination, estate  management, and unfair interest rates, fees, or costs.", "FHA collects and records inquiries and complaints about HECMs, and it  has access to CFPB data on reverse mortgage complaints. However,  FHA does not use its inquiry and complaint data to help inform HECM  program policies and oversight, and the way data are collected does not  produce quality information for these purposes. Additionally, we found  that FHA has not leveraged CFPB complaint data for HECM program  oversight.", "According to FHA officials, FHA\u2019s two main methods for collecting  customer inquiries and complaints are hotlines operated by the agency\u2019s  National Servicing Center and the FHA Resource Center. From calendar  years 2015 through 2018, the National Servicing Center received about  105,000 HECM-related calls. During this same period, the FHA  Resource Center received 147 HECM-related calls. In April 2019, the  FHA Resource Center became the primary entity for collecting, recording,  and responding to all HECM-related calls. FHA officials told us they  transferred these responsibilities from the National Servicing Center to  the FHA Resource Center to help improve call management.", "While this change could help improve customer service, it does not fully  resolve limitations we found in FHA\u2019s approach to collecting and  recording HECM inquiries and complaints that diminish the usefulness of  the information for program oversight. For example, both the National  Servicing Center and the FHA Resource Center do not collect call  information in a way that would allow FHA to readily analyze the data for  themes. Specifically, both centers do not reliably differentiate between  inquiries and complaints\u2014a potentially important distinction for  determining appropriate agency-level responses. Additionally, while both  the centers collect data on the reason for calls, neither does so in a  systematic way that would allow FHA to readily determine how frequently  issues are being raised. For example, neither center\u2019s data systems  contain standardized categories or menus with options for recording  reasons for calls.", "FHA officials said the agency uses complaint and inquiry data to improve  customer service. However, FHA does not analyze data for other  purposes that could enhance program oversight, such as determining  which HECM servicers and lenders receive the most complaints, targeting  entities for on-site reviews, or identifying topics that may need additional  borrower education. In the report being released today, we recommend  that FHA collect and record consumer inquiries and complaints in a  manner that facilitates analysis of the type and frequency of the issues  raised. FHA neither agreed nor disagreed with our recommendation. We  also recommend that FHA periodically analyze available internal and  external consumer complaint data about reverse mortgages to help  inform management and oversight of the HECM program. FHA agreed  with this recommendation. By improving the collection and use of  consumer complaint data and better monitoring its own and CFPB\u2019s  complaint data, FHA could improve its ability to detect and respond to  emerging consumer protection issues regarding HECMs.", "Chairman Clay, Ranking Member Duffy, and Members of the  Subcommittee, this completes my statement.
