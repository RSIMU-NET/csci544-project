Under federal law and corresponding  regulations, agencies are required to develop at least one employee  performance appraisal system. OPM is required to review and approve an  agency\u2019s performance appraisal system(s) to ensure it is consistent with  the requirements of applicable law, regulation, and OPM policy, and  defines the general policies and parameters the agency will use to rate  employees. Once the appraisal system is approved, the agency  establishes a performance appraisal program. The agency\u2019s performance  appraisal program\u2014which does not require OPM review or approval\u2014 defines the specific procedures, methods, and requirements for planning,  monitoring, and rating employee performance.

Each phase of  the performance management cycle plays an important part in helping to  provide structure and focus to an employee\u2019s roles and responsibilities  within the organization. Within each phase of the cycle, employees are  given the opportunity to provide input, ask questions, and request  feedback from their supervisors on their performance.", "One of the tools agencies can use to determine the effectiveness of their  performance management cycle is data from OPM\u2019s annual FEVS. To  help understand federal employees\u2019 opinions about what matters most to  them and how they feel about their jobs, their supervisors, and their  agencies, FEVS scores can help agencies identify challenges and  improve guidance. FEVS measures employees\u2019 perceptions of whether,  and to what extent, conditions characterizing successful organizations are  present in their agencies.

We have also reported  that supervisors who take performance management seriously and have  the necessary training and support can help poorly performing employees  either improve or realize they are not a good fit for the position.  However, some supervisors may lack experience and training in  performance management, as well as the understanding of the  procedures for taking corrective actions against poor performers. We  previously recommended that OPM, in conjunction with the Chief Human  Capital Officers (CHCO) Council, assess the adequacy of leadership  training that agencies provide to supervisors to help ensure supervisors  obtain the skills needed to effectively conduct performance management  responsibilities. In response, OPM conducted a survey to assess the  adequacy of leadership training that agencies provide to supervisors.

FEVS findings allow agencies to assess trends by  comparing earlier results with the 2017 results to (1) compare agency  results with the government-wide results, (2) identify current strengths  and challenges, and (3) focus on short- and long-term action targets that  will help agencies reach their strategic human resource management  goals. The recommended approach to assessing and driving change in  agencies utilizes FEVS results in conjunction with other resources, such  as results from other internal surveys, administrative data, focus groups,  exit interviews, and so on.

Three of four of the case study agencies\u2014BLS, CDC, and DEA\u2014use  supplemental survey data to help focus agency efforts to improve  performance management. For example, DEA developed its own internal  survey\u2014Leadership Engagement Survey\u2014in 2016 because it identified  leadership as a key driver for organizational climate and employee  engagement. According to agency officials, there was a strong internal  push to use the survey results to identify areas of improvement. The  fourth agency, OCC, had administered a separate internal engagement  survey from 2013 to 2016. According to agency officials, however, they  discontinued this effort to focus exclusively on FEVS as the primary  survey data source, and to reduce the redundancy of two surveys.

We did not find any reference to the CHCO Council\u2019s  website using OPM\u2019s internal search engine with the term \u201cperformance  management\u201d (see figure 14). As a result, agency officials and federal  employees who are looking for comprehensive information on  performance management using OPM\u2019s website may be unable to easily  find or access related performance management guidance or resources.", "A 2016 Office of Management and Budget memorandum on federal  agency public websites and digital services states that federal agency  public websites and digital services are the primary means by which the  public receives information from and interacts with the federal  government, provides government information or services to a specific  user group across a variety of delivery platform and devices, and  supports the proper performance of an agency function. The  memorandum states that, \u201cFederal websites and digital services should  provide quality information that is readily accessible to all.\u201d In addition,  federal internal control standards state that management should use  quality information to achieve the entity\u2019s objective. Quality information  should be appropriate, current, complete, accurate, accessible, and  timely. However, OPM does not have a process for regularly updating  its performance management website with new guidance and resources  to ensure that the information is readily available. Agency employees,  such as human capital specialists, who visit OPM\u2019s performance  management website may be unable to find or access the most recent  guidance and training available.", "In addition to its website, OPM officials stated that the agency recently  launched the Performance Management Portal (portal) in September  2017 on OMB MAX to communicate with agencies and provide  information and resources related to non-SES performance management,  as highlighted earlier. OPM officials said that the portal will be updated  with information regarding announcements or updated guidance as  needed, or when it is released and becomes available.", "Although not as comprehensive as the information included on OPM\u2019s  performance management website, the portal included slides from OPM\u2019s  semiannual facilitated performance management forums and updated  information on awards guidance for non-SES employees for fiscal year  2017\u2014neither of which were on OPM\u2019s website. As the government\u2019s  chief human resources agency, agencies may see OPM as their primary  source of performance management guidance. By establishing a process  to ensure that information on the performance management website is regularly updated to include the most recent guidance, agencies would  have access to the most current information."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "OPM Could Better Lead Efforts to Identify and Share Emerging Performance Management Research and Innovation", "paragraphs": ["OPM provides opportunities for agencies to share promising practices.  For example, OPM has several efforts in place that allow agencies to  share promising information with each other such as at its semiannual  Performance Management Forums (forums), annual Performance  Management Steering Committee meetings, and through the previously  mentioned portal. According to OPM, the forums provide agencies with  updated information, guidance, and support to encourage performance  excellence amongst employees.", "In 2017, OPM began holding annual steering committee meetings which  allow interagency representatives to discuss the needs of the federal  performance management community, to identify and/or request potential  content for future forums, and to share promising practices and lessons  learned regarding performance management, according to OPM officials.  However, there is no formal process in place or mechanism for agencies  to routinely and independently share their own experiences and lessons  learned in implementing performance management efforts. For instance,  the portal does not currently allow for agencies to post and share their  own promising practices with each other in a centralized location. Instead,  agencies must rely on OPM to post such information on the portal. OPM  officials stated that, although permission to view the portal is granted to all  users in the executive branch with a MAX account, OPM is the only  agency that has permission to make edits to the portal. OPM officials said  they are exploring options to allow for an interactive experience with other  agencies. Federal internal control standards state that management  should externally communicate the necessary quality information to  achieve the entity\u2019s objective. Additionally, our prior work on  collaboration practices has shown that agencies can enhance and sustain  collaborative efforts, and identify and address needs by leveraging  resources, such as through sharing information. Establishing a  mechanism to allow agencies to routinely share promising practices and  lessons learned from their experiences could assist agencies that are  undertaking or considering similar efforts and help inform agencies\u2019  decision-making related to performance management.", "In addition to driving modernization, OPM identified innovation as one of  its five values in its most recent strategic plan for fiscal years 2018  through 2022. Specifically, OPM stated that the agency \u201cconstantly  seeks new ways to accomplish its work and generate extraordinary  results. OPM is dedicated to delivering creative and forward-looking  solutions and advancing the modernization of human resources  management.\u201d OPM officials stated that innovation was included as one  of OPM\u2019s values because the agency seeks to embrace forward-leaning  policies and practices within all aspects of human capital management.", "While OPM officials told us that they maintain a constant scan of the  environment to identify and follow promising practices\u2014which could  include innovative concepts\u2014in the private sector and other sources to  include performance management and performance management  systems, they did not specifically identify which promising practices they  incorporated into guidance or training. In addition, when we asked OPM  to identify innovative performance management practices based on its  own research, officials provided us with articles from leading experts that  focused on eliminating performance ratings, using a growth mindset  concept, and the SCARF model\u2014status, certainty, autonomy,  relatedness, and fairness\u2014for collaborating with and influencing others.  They also provided references and their notes on new performance  management system programs at three corporations. OPM officials said  they have not placed these articles, references, or notes on their  performance management website or shared them with agencies, and  have no plans to do so at this time.", "Instead, OPM officials stated they were monitoring the progress of these  new practices to assess if the methods were effective in maximizing  employee and organizational outcomes, in addition to stimulating  collaboration and innovation. However, OPM provided no criteria in use to  determine when the results would be considered effective or when they  could be shared with agencies. Without OPM sharing their research  results, agencies may be unaware of current practices in the performance  management field because they may not be conducting their own  research. Including innovation as an agency value is not sufficient to  change an organization\u2019s culture for it to become innovative; it is  necessary to also introduce, for example, a strategy to identify and  address emerging research and promising practices in performance  management. Such a strategic approach could include criteria that  identify what research results to share with agencies, when to share  them, and by which process (for example, by website). It would also  enable OPM to increase transparency and consistency in identifying  emerging innovations.", "One of our case study agencies told us that in the absence of OPM  providing research results, the agency used its own resources to research  and identify leading practices in the private sector that could potentially  apply to their own performance management system, such as focusing on  ongoing performance conversations and recognition to increase  engagement and performance, while reducing burdensome administrative  requirements that do not add value. Officials at this agency stated that  OPM\u2019s guidance was not modernized to the extent that the human capital  and performance management industry was changing. Without OPM  taking the lead to share emerging and innovative research, agencies, and  therefore their employees, may not benefit from the best information  available.", "Although OPM identified innovation as one of its five values, we were  unable to find any recent information on innovation for performance  management in the government on OPM\u2019s website. Specifically, we used  \u201cinnovation performance management\u201d as a search term on the website  and found the \u201cPromoting Innovation in Government\u201d web page, which  included archived material and was no longer being updated (see figure  15). As a result, agencies that use OPM\u2019s website as a source of  performance management guidance would be unable to find any current  resources on performance management innovation. OPM officials  explained that older material is archived based on the current leadership\u2019s  vision. The officials also confirmed that OPM did not have other active  websites that contained innovative performance management practices  gathered from external sources, which could be shared with other federal  agencies. Implementing a strategic approach to sharing innovation in  performance management would then allow OPM to provide relevant and  updated information that agencies could use to modernize their  performance management systems."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Managing employee performance has been a long-standing government- wide issue. As the current administration moves to reform the federal  government to become leaner, accountable, and efficient, an effective  performance management system is necessary to increase productivity,  sustain transformation, and foster a culture of engagement that enables  high performance. Federal agencies have a primary responsibility for  managing their employees\u2019 performance, but OPM maintains a key role in  developing and overseeing human resources programs and policies that  support the needs of federal agencies. As the government\u2019s chief human  resources agency and personnel policy leader, OPM is responsible for  designing and promulgating regulations, policy, and guidance covering all  aspects of the employee life cycle, including performance management.  While OPM provides performance management resources on its website,  some information is not regularly updated and can be challenging to find.  Establishing a process to provide agencies with current, accurate, and  easy access to guidance and resources would provide them with the most  recent guidance and resources available.", "To be at the forefront of innovation, OPM must consistently challenge  traditional performance management practices, and identify opportunities  to present and promote new and creative solutions to agencies. Although  OPM has identified potential innovative and promising practices for  performance management through its own research, OPM has not  actively shared these practices with agencies. In addition, agencies do  not have access to a common forum by which they could routinely and  independently share their own promising practices and lessons learned to  avoid common pitfalls. In times of limited resources, developing a  strategic approach to identify and share emerging research and  innovations in performance management would help agencies inform  and, as needed, reform their performance management approaches.

Topic areas are employees\u2019  (1) work experience, (2) work unit, (3) agency, (4) supervisor, (5)  leadership, (6) satisfaction, (7) work-life, and (8) demographics. OPM has  administered FEVS annually since 2010. From 2002 to 2010, OPM  administered the survey biennially. FEVS includes a core set of  statements. Agencies have the option of adding questions to the surveys  sent to their employees. FEVS is based on a sample of full- and part-time,  permanent, non-seasonal employees of departments and large, small,  and independent agencies. According to OPM, the sample is designed to  ensure representative survey results would be reported by agency,  subagency, and senior leader status as well as for the overall federal  workforce. Once the necessary sample size is determined for an agency,  if more than 75 percent of the workforce would be sampled, OPM  conducts a full census of all permanent, nonseasonal employees.", "To describe government-wide trends in employee perceptions of  performance management, we selected 15 FEVS statements that  generally align with OPM\u2019s five phases of performance management  cycle: (1) planning and setting expectations; (2) continually monitoring  performance; (3) developing the capacity to perform; (4) rating  periodically to summarize performance; and (5) rewarding good  performance (see table 4). We used indexes such as the Employee  Engagement Index, the Human Capital Assessment and Accountability  Framework Results-Oriented Performance Culture Index, and the Public  Partnership for Public Service\u2019s Best Places to Work categories to help  guide our selection process of three FEVS statements per OPM  performance management phase. We did not look at how surveyed  employees responded to the statements when considering which ones to  select. Upon selection of our statements, we consulted with our internal  human capital (HC) experts as well as external HC experts at OPM and  the Merit Systems Protection Board to determine the appropriateness of  our FEVS statement selection and categorization. They generally agreed  that these statements aligned with the phases. However, FEVS was not  designed to measure performance management and, although these  statements all provide useful insights, they do not necessarily represent  all key aspects of performance management.", "In addition, we analyzed the 15 FEVS performance management-related  questions by supervisory status for the 24 Chief Financial Officers Act  (CFO Act) departments and agencies for the years 2010 through 2017.  We conducted this analysis because our prior work had shown that  supervisory status was the employee population variable that displayed  the greatest degree of difference in responses between the categories of  respondents in it. For this report, we did not analyze the extent of  differences in responses in the performance management questions by  other employee population groups, such as age or gender, because that  was outside the scope of our engagement. We examined the results for  the 15 FEVS questions by supervisory groups, and report the 4 that had  the greatest degree of differences by supervisory levels. All of these 4  had differences of at least 28 percentage points between the most and  least favorable categories of respondents while the remaining 11 had  differences in the range of 2 to 25 percentage points between the views  of senior leaders and nonsupervisory employees.", "We calculated the average percent of employees who agreed or strongly  agreed with the three statements comprising the phase for those who  answered all three statements to identify trends. Survey respondents who  did not answer one or more of the phase statements were not included.  Because OPM followed a probability procedure based on random  selections for most agencies, the FEVS sample is only one of a large  number of samples that could have been drawn. Since each sample  could have provided different estimates, we express our confidence in the  precision of the FEVS statement estimates using the margin of error at  the 95 percent level of confidence. This margin of error is the half-width of  the 95 percent confidence interval for a FEVS estimate. A 95 percent  confidence interval is the interval that would contain the actual population  value for 95 percent of the samples that OPM could have been drawn.", "To assess the reliability of the FEVS data, in addition to assessing the  sampling error associated with the estimates we examined descriptive  summary statistics and the distribution of both the survey data and the  human capital framework indexes, and assessed the extent of item- missing data. We also reviewed FEVS technical documentation. On the  basis of these procedures, we believe the data were sufficiently reliable  for use in the analysis presented in this report.", "To identify practices used by selected agencies to develop and implement  strategies to improve performance management, we complemented our  government-wide analysis with an additional analysis of agencies (those  agencies and units within 1 of the 24 CFO Act departments). Specifically,  we analyzed agency results for the same 15 statements in 2015 (the most  recent data available at the time) to select a nongeneralizable sample of  four agencies to obtain illustrative examples of how they approached  performance management and their strategies to improve performance  within their agencies. We calculated averages for the agencies based on  their scores for our selected statements, and rank ordered them based on  these averages. Among other attributes, these agencies had the highest  levels of employee agreement with FEVS statements dealing with their  performance management processes.", "We selected agencies that had the highest average scores for the  performance management phases. In addition to the FEVS data, we also  used secondary factors such as the number of respondents, agency size,  mission, and types of employees to identify the following agencies: (1)  Bureau of Labor Statistics, Department of Labor; (2) Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention, Department of Health and Human Services; (3)  Drug Enforcement Administration, Department of Justice; and the (4)  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Department of the Treasury.  We developed a set of standard questions that asked about agency  strategies to improve performance management and relevant successes,  which we administered to human resources/human capital officials and  other officials responsible for performance management at the agencies.  We reviewed and analyzed the responses the agencies provided, and  identified and reported examples of practices that all four described,  which are intended to improve performance management. We also asked  agencies about the types of guidance and resources they obtained from  OPM. The four common practices we identified do not represent the only  practices these agencies employ to improve performance management at  their agency. In addition, the practices are not intended to be  representative of all those employed by all other federal agencies.", "To evaluate the guidance and resources OPM provides to agencies to  improve performance management government-wide, we reviewed both  OPM\u2019s performance management website and the Chief Human Capital  Officers (CHCO) Council\u2019s website to identify available guidance,  resources, and tools. We compared these documents to OMB\u2019s  memorandum on federal agency public websites, OPM\u2019s strategic plan for  fiscal years 2018 through 2022, and internal controls. We observed the  Performance Management Portal, hosted on OMB\u2019s MAX website, in July  2018 with an OPM official as we did not have access to the portal. We  also reviewed agency documentation and other OPM-referenced  websites that contained performance management-related information.  We used OPM\u2019s internal site search engines and search terms, such as  \u201cperformance management\u201d and \u201cperformance management innovation,\u201d  to identify relevant guidance. During the course of our review, we  compared performance management guidance posted on the OPM and  CHCO websites as well as the portal, and identified discrepancies  between what we found on the respective websites. We discussed the  discrepancies with OPM officials and included their responses within the  report. To supplement the documentary evidence obtained, we also  interviewed officials from OPM, the CHCO Council, and selected case  study agencies to describe the extent to which OPM assists agencies on  performance management.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2016 to November  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
