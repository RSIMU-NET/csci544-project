The 2010 Guidance was SEC's primary form of communication to clarify companies' climate-related disclosure requirements. In addition, SEC issued individual comment letters to specific companies on their climate-related disclosures. These letters are publicly available and companies can view these letters to understand SEC's assessment of a particular company's disclosures. Representatives from industry associations with whom GAO spoke stated that they consider the disclosure requirements for climate-related risks to be clear and have no need for additional guidance.", "SEC issued two reports to Congress in 2012 and 2014 that examined changes in climate-related disclosures in select industries. SEC found that most of these filings included some level of climate-related disclosures and reported that there were no notable year-to-year changes. SEC staff also continue to periodically assess climate-related disclosures in addition to its regular disclosure review process. Additionally, in April 2016, SEC requested public input on modernizing certain business and financial disclosure requirements, including potential changes on reporting climate-related risks in SEC's filings. As of December 2017, SEC staff said they are considering recommendations for the Commission's consideration based on comments received.", "SEC faces constraints in reviewing climate-related and other disclosures because it primarily relies on information that companies provide. SEC senior staff explained that SEC's Division of Corporation Finance staff assess companies' filings for compliance with federal securities laws\u2014which require companies to disclose material risks\u2014but do not have the authority to subpoena additional information from companies. Additionally, companies may report similar climate-related disclosures in different sections of the filings, and climate-related disclosures in some filings contain disclosures using generic language, not tailored to the company, and do not include quantitative metrics. When companies report climate-related disclosures in varying formats and specificity, SEC reviewers and investors may find it difficult to compare and analyze related disclosures across companies' filings. SEC has tools, mechanisms, and resources\u2014including internal supervisory controls, regulations and guidance, a two-level filing review process, internal and external data, and staff training and experience\u2014that help SEC staff consistently review filing disclosures, according to SEC documents and staff. Representatives of industry associations told GAO that they consider the current climate-related disclosure requirements adequate and no additional climate-related disclosures are needed. However, some investor groups and asset management firms have highlighted the need for companies to disclose more climate-related information. But, members of SEC's Investor Advisory Committee told GAO that investors have not agreed on the priority of climate-related disclosures.

The  company responded that the current costs and impact of compliance with  the state law have not been material to the company and it would seek to  more clearly disclose such information in its annual filing for the coming  year. SEC staff did not issue any further comment on this issue. SEC  senior staff told us that they determine whether further comments are  needed based on whether the company\u2019s response is consistent with  other information the companies reported in other publicly available  documents, such as financial analyst reports or the company\u2019s  sustainability report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Climate-Related Disclosures Vary in Format and Specificity", "paragraphs": ["Climate-related disclosures vary in format because companies may report  similar climate-related disclosures in different sections of the annual  filings. We reviewed and identified illustrative examples of climate-related  disclosures in the annual filings of 116 S&P 500 Index companies, filed  with SEC in 2016, in the five industries in our review (see app. II for  additional information). We found, for example, one beverage company  reported its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the business  description section of its filing while another beverage company reported  a similar goal on carbon footprint reduction in the risk factors section of its  filing. As previously noted, SEC reviewers may compare a company\u2019s  disclosures to other companies\u2019 disclosures in the same industry to  identify potential missing disclosures if other companies in the same  industry have made similar disclosures. When companies report climate- related disclosures in varying format, SEC reviewers and investors may  find it difficult to navigate through the filings to identify, compare, and  analyze the climate-related disclosures across filings, especially given the  size of each individual filing. In addition, companies\u2019 filings may include  only a few mentions of climate-related disclosures. For instance, the  annual filings we reviewed for an insurance company, an oil company,  and a food company, respectively, were 389 pages, 117 pages, and 136  pages long. Within these filings, the corresponding number of mentions of  climate-related disclosures was 9, 13, and 6, respectively, based on our  analysis using Ceres\u2019 SEC Sustainability Disclosure Search Tool. Given  that SEC reviewers primarily rely on information companies disclose in  filings, it may be difficult to determine whether a low level of disclosure  indicates that the company does not face any climate-related risks or  does not consider the risks to be material.", "Also, climate-related disclosures in some companies\u2019 filings use  boilerplate language, which is not specific to the company, and the  information is unquantified. Our review of the annual filings of 116 S&P  500 Index companies found that some companies\u2019 climate-related  disclosures provided some quantitative information, while some other  companies\u2019 disclosures listed existing environmental regulations without  specifying the associated impacts on the companies. For example, one oil  and gas company stated in its annual filing that the imposition and  enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets  could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and  significantly reduce the value of the company\u2019s business. However, the  company did not provide any quantitative information on such impacts on  its business. Additionally, SASB reported in October 2016 that its analysis  of almost 1,500 disclosures in annual filings of 637 companies in 72  industries found that almost 30 percent of the disclosures SASB reviewed  did not include any climate-related information, some contained  boilerplate language or company-tailored narratives, and less than 20  percent of these disclosures included quantitative metrics."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC Has Mechanisms, Tools, and Resources to Help Its Staff Consistently Review Filing Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["Although SEC relies primarily on information companies provide in their  filings when reviewing climate-related and other disclosures, it has  mechanisms, tools, and resources to help its staff consistently review  filing disclosures, according to SEC documents and SEC staff we  interviewed.", "Internal supervisory control testing. As we reported in 2016,  Corporation Finance\u2019s Disclosure Standards Office (DSO) helps improve  consistency in oversight of filing reviews by conducting testing of internal  supervisory controls throughout the year. DSO is responsible for  managing Corporation Finance\u2019s internal supervisory control and  contributes to Corporation Finance\u2019s quality and process improvement  efforts. DSO senior staff told us that the office examined filing reviews  conducted by SEC staff on a random sample of filings in each year from  2014 through 2016. In DSO\u2019s reviews, DSO examined the documents  that are part of the filing reviews conducted by SEC staff, including the  underlying filings, filing review reports prepared by SEC staff, comment  letters issued, and the associated responses, among other things. Also,  DSO staff assessed whether SEC staff had followed the relevant  Corporation Finance policies and procedures. For example, DSO  checked whether staff followed procedures for second-level reviews and  issuing comment letters. However, DSO senior staff said they have not  conducted any review specific to climate-related disclosures. Corporation  Finance senior staff said DSO submits the results of its testing to its  managing executive for use in the division\u2019s management assurance  statements. We also reported in 2016 that DSO helped strengthen  components of Corporation Finance\u2019s internal control.", "Two-level review process. As discussed earlier, SEC generally  conducts two levels of review at key steps in the filing review process.  The two-level review process helps ensure that staff consistently review  disclosures across filings, according to SEC staff we interviewed. For  example, the second-level reviewers review the comment letters prepared  by the first-level reviewers before sending the letters to companies,  according to SEC\u2019s internal policies and procedures. Also, assistant  directors and senior assistant chief accountants of the 11 Corporation  Finance offices generally meet monthly to discuss recent trends and  issues identified in filing reviews in general, which helps ensure that staff  assess materiality consistently across industries, according to some SEC  staff.", "Regulations and guidance. SEC staff can consult regulations and  formal and informal SEC guidance for their filing reviews (see table 2 for  examples), according to SEC documents and staff we interviewed. SEC  posts relevant guidance and other information on its intranet site. Nearly  all SEC staff we interviewed said current guidance was sufficient to guide  their filing reviews, including the reviews of climate-related disclosures.", "Internal and external data. According to SEC\u2019s internal review guidance,  SEC staff are expected to consider internal and external data as part of  the filing review. As previously noted, some SEC staff told us they  consider information from prior filings, internal filing review reports, other  filings of companies in the same industry, and external data outside of the  filings to supplement their filing reviews. For example, SEC staff can  generally use internal and external databases to search prior years\u2019 filings  and filing-review-related comments and correspondence with companies.  Some SEC reviewers told us that they also compare disclosures with  external information, such as companies\u2019 voluntary sustainability reports  and financial analyst reports on companies\u2019 earnings and operations, to  look for inconsistencies in the companies\u2019 reporting. Although SEC  Corporation Finance staff can review external information such as the  company\u2019s sustainability report, they do not have the underlying  information the company used to determine whether a potential  disclosure was material or prepare the sustainability report and cannot  perform an independent assessment of the disclosure based on the  materiality of the underlying information. For example, SEC staff noted in  a 2016 comment letter to an oil company that SEC has compared and  identified potential inconsistency between the company\u2019s disclosures on  uncertainty about a new climate-related regulation and physical risks and  information in the company\u2019s sustainability report. The company stated  the climate-related regulatory risks were not material and climate-related  risks in their filing were consistent with information in its sustainability  report. SEC did not issue any further comments.", "Staff training. SEC staff have had some training on assessing materiality  and industry-specific issues but fewer training that discussed climate- related disclosures, according to SEC staff.", "Training on materiality. Most SEC staff we interviewed said training  on materiality assessment was part of staff training or their ongoing  on-the-job learning in their day-to-day work. Our review of some SEC  training materials showed that training discussions covered federal  securities laws and disclosure requirements, disclosure review, and  materiality but did not focus specifically on climate-related issues.  Also, some SEC staff said they consider materiality based on a given  company\u2019s specific facts and circumstances as they review filings in  their day-to-day work. For example, two SEC staff we interviewed  explained that second-level reviewers help first-level reviewers  understand how to apply specific facts and circumstances as they  consider materiality when they review filings.", "Training on industry-specific issues. All SEC staff we interviewed  noted that industry-specific training is provided by individual assistant  director offices. For example, some staff mentioned training on  disclosures for the oil and gas industry. Other staff noted that they  also share information on industry-specific issues as part of their  communication or meetings with supervisory staff. However, SEC  staff we interviewed did not recall any industry-specific training on  climate-related disclosures offered by individual assistant director  offices.", "Training on climate-related disclosures. Some SEC staff we  interviewed identified training on the 2010 Guidance when the  guidance was issued or a brownbag discussion on climate-related  disclosure issues including the Peabody Energy investigation in 2016.  According to SEC senior staff, the 2016 brownbag included a  discussion of the 2010 Guidance and was offered to all Corporation  Finance staff. In addition, our review of some meeting agendas  showed that these meetings sometimes included discussion items on  issues related to climate-related disclosures, such as the Peabody  Energy investigation and a proposed environmental regulation.  Furthermore, new SEC staff receive training on how to conduct filing  reviews in general but not specifically on climate-related disclosures,  according to some SEC staff.", "Most of the SEC staff we interviewed told us they consider the training  they have received to be sufficient for conducting filing reviews.  Additionally, an SEC OIG survey of SEC staff published in September  2017 asked both first- and second-level reviewers if they felt they had  received adequate training and guidance from SEC on how to conduct a  disclosure review. Of the 159 who answered as first-level reviewers, 82  percent said that they felt they received adequate training and guidance  to conduct disclosure reviews; and of the 130 who answered as second- level reviewers, 83 percent said that they felt they received adequate  training and guidance to conduct disclosure reviews. Other staff we  interviewed also noted that they receive training through their day-to-day  work on an ongoing basis or when new regulations are issued or the need  arises.", "Staff experience. All eight supervisory staff we interviewed indicated  that, as of August 2017, they had at least 10 years of experience at SEC  as filing reviewers, while the 12 nonsupervisory staff we interviewed  noted that they had from 2 to 18 years of such experience. Also, most of  the SEC staff we interviewed indicated that they had some prior  accounting or legal experience related to annual filing preparation or  review, but they did not have any direct prior experience on climate- related disclosures. However, most SEC staff we interviewed said they  generally do not need technical expertise to understand climate-related  disclosures. Some staff said they can consult mining or petroleum  engineers within Corporation Finance if the disclosures relate to other  subjects, such as oil and gas reserves."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Stakeholders Have Mixed Views on the Amount and Specificity of the Current Climate-Related Disclosures", "paragraphs": ["Stakeholders, including investor and industry groups, have different views  on whether additional climate-related disclosures, including the amount  and specificity, are needed. Some asset management firms and investor  groups have highlighted the need for companies to disclose more climate- related information to help investors make more informed investment  decisions. Three large asset management firms stated that they are  committed to engaging with and encouraging companies to provide  additional climate-related disclosures. For example, in 2017, one firm  supported shareholder proposals for two companies to report the impacts  of climate change on their operations. The proposals passed with  majority shareholder support. The Council of Institutional Investors and  Ceres stated in their letters commenting on SEC\u2019s April 2016 Concept  Release and also told us that the information on environmental risks,  including climate risks, has become more significant for investors and  companies. The two investor associations also noted that companies\u2019  climate-related disclosures in the risk factors and management\u2019s  discussion and analysis sections of the filings generally do not provide  investors with sufficient details. They further stated in their letters  commenting on SEC\u2019s April 2016 Concept Release that current climate- related disclosures are generally not comparable across companies\u2019  filings. Additionally, SASB reported that climate-related disclosures using  quantitative metrics may not be comparable because they lack  standardization.", "In contrast, representatives from the five industry associations with whom  we spoke all noted that they consider the current requirements for  climate-related disclosures adequate. They also do not believe additional  climate-related disclosures are needed in SEC filings as the filings should  include only climate-related information if it is material. Additionally, some  companies are providing climate-related information through channels  outside of SEC filings. Three of these industry associations also stated in  their letters commenting on SEC\u2019s April 2016 Concept Release that they  would like to keep the existing requirements for climate-related  disclosures.", "While some investor organizations we spoke with generally believe more  climate-related disclosures are needed, investors have not reached  agreement on the priority of advocating for climate-related disclosures or  the framework for companies to use to report these disclosures. For  example, some members of a subcommittee of SEC\u2019s Investor Advisory  Committee have identified climate-related disclosures as a priority issue,  but the subcommittee as a whole did not reach agreement that climate- related disclosures should be among its highest priorities. In addition, as  previously described, existing reporting frameworks include those  developed by CDP, Global Reporting Initiative, SASB, and the June 2017  FSB Task Force final recommendations. Given that these are voluntary  frameworks, companies can report climate-related information using any  of the frameworks or not use a framework at all. Further, stakeholders  advocating for climate-related disclosures have not agreed on whether to  adopt one of the existing reporting frameworks or develop a new  framework for companies to use in reporting climate-related disclosures.  For example, companies have not determined which of the existing  reporting frameworks to use or are uncertain on which framework is  preferred by investors for reporting climate-related disclosures, according  to one investor association, representatives of SEC\u2019s Investor Advisory  Committee, and an SEC senior staff of the Office of Investor Advocate.", "The SEC senior staff further stated that SEC may be hesitant to  recommend a particular framework for companies to use given the  uncertainties. Another organization focusing on climate-related  disclosures in its letter commenting on SEC\u2019s April 2016 Concept  Release suggested that SEC review and consider elements of existing  reporting frameworks. Furthermore, SEC\u2019s Investor Advisory Committee,  in its letter commenting on the Concept Release, recommended SEC  develop an analytical framework on climate-related disclosures, among  other things. Most recently in June 2017, the FSB Task Force reported  that its recommendations aim to provide a framework to help companies  more consistently disclose climate-related information and align their  reporting frameworks over time. In particular, the Task Force  recommends that companies include material climate-related disclosures  in their public filings and encourages standard-setting bodies to support  adoption of the recommendations. According to SEC senior staff, while  the Task Force recommendations may be helpful if the Commission were  to consider new rules on climate-related disclosures in the future, SEC  staff is not aware of any specific SEC actions or plans based on the  recommendations. Also, additional disclosure requirements or increased  scrutiny of companies\u2019 climate-related information\u2014which, if necessary,  SEC and Congress can consider\u2014could have mission and resource  implications for SEC\u2019s Division of Corporation Finance."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to SEC for review and comment.

We also selected the food and beverage industry because we  identified companies in this industry that have submitted climate-related  disclosures and can provide perspectives on these disclosures, and SEC  had not selected companies in this industry for review in its 2012 and  2014 congressional reports or ongoing periodic reviews of climate-related  disclosures. For all five industries, we searched companies\u2019 annual filings  to determine whether the industries include companies that have  submitted climate-related disclosures in SEC filings or are represented by  associations that have submitted comments on SEC\u2019s April 2016 Concept  Release related to business and financial disclosures in Regulation S-K.  Because we did not search companies\u2019 filings of all industries, industries  we focused on in this report may not be a comprehensive list of industries  that are affected by climate-related risks and views on the selected  industries are not generalizable to other industries we did not include in  our review.", "To address the first objective, we reviewed SEC\u2019s 2010 Guidance and  Division of Corporation Finance (Corporation Finance) policies and  procedures on review of disclosures. We determined the number of  comment letters SEC issued to individual companies on climate-related  disclosures from February 2010 to August 2017. Specifically, we  reviewed a 2014 report by Ceres, a nonprofit organization that works with  investors, companies, and public interest groups on sustainable business  practices, that analyzed and determined the number of SEC comment  letters to companies from February 2, 2010 (the date the 2010 Guidance  was released) to December 31, 2013. Additionally, using the same  keyword search terms\u2014such as \u201cclimate change\u201d and \u201cclimate  mitigation\u201d\u2014that were used in the Ceres report, we determined the  number of SEC comment letters issued to individual companies on issues  related to climate-related disclosures from January 1, 2014, through  August 11, 2017.

Examples of legislation or precursors for  possible regulation that do or could affect our operations include:  European Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), the program through which many of  the European Union (EU) member states are implementing the Kyoto Protocol. Our  cost of compliance with the EU ETS in 2015 was approximately $0.4 million (net  share pre-tax).  In Canada during 2015, the Alberta government amended the regulations of the  Climate Change and Emissions Act. The regulations now require any existing facility  with emissions equal to or greater than 100,000 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide or  equivalent per year to reduce its net emissions intensity from its baseline. The  reduction is increasing from the current 12 percent in 2015, to 15 percent in 2016  and to 20 percent in 2017. We also incur a carbon tax for emissions from fossil fuel  combustion in our British Columbia operations. The total cost of compliance with  these regulations in 2015 was approximately $4.7 million.  The U.S. Supreme Court decision in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497, 127 S.Ct.  1438 (2007), confirming that the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide as  an \u201cair pollutant\u201d under the Federal Clean Air Act.  The U.S. EPA\u2019s announcement on March 29, 2010 (published as \u201cInterpretation of  Regulations that Determine Pollutants Covered by Clean Air Act Permitting  Programs,\u201d 75 Fed. Reg. 17004 (April 2, 2010)), and the EPA\u2019s and U.S. Department  of Transportation\u2019s joint promulgation of a Final Rule on April 1, 2010, that triggers  regulation of GHGs under the Clean Air Act, may trigger more climate based claims  for damages, and may result in longer agency review time for development projects.  The U.S. EPA\u2019s announcement on January 14, 2015, outlining a series of steps it  plans to take to address methane and smog-forming volatile organic compound  emissions from the oil and gas industry. The current U.S. administration has  established a goal of reducing the 2012 levels in methane emissions from the oil and  gas industry by 40 to 45 percent by 2025.", "Carbon taxes in certain jurisdictions. Our cost of compliance with Norwegian carbon  tax legislation in 2015 was approximately $31 million (net share pre-tax).  The agreement reached in Paris in December 2015 at the 21st Conference of the  Parties to the United Nations Framework on Climate Change, setting out a new  process for achieving global emission reductions.", "In the United States, some additional form of regulation may be forthcoming in the future  at the federal and state levels with respect to GHG emissions. Such regulation could take  any of several forms that may result in the creation of additional costs in the form of  taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws  and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. We are  working to continuously improve operational and energy efficiency through resource and  energy conservation throughout our operations.  Compliance with changes in laws and regulations that create a GHG emission trading  scheme or GHG reduction policies could significantly increase our costs, reduce demand  for fossil energy derived products, impact the cost and availability of capital and increase  our exposure to litigation. Such laws and regulations could also increase demand for less  carbon intensive energy sources, including natural gas. The ultimate impact on our  financial performance, either positive or negative, will depend on a number of factors,  including but not limited to:", "Whether and to what extent legislation or regulation is enacted.", "The timing of the introduction of such legislation or regulation.", "The nature of the legislation (such as a cap and trade system or a tax on emissions)  or regulation.  The price placed on GHG emissions (either by the market or through a tax).  The GHG reductions required.  The price and availability of offsets.  The amount and allocation of allowances.  Technological and scientific developments leading to new products or services.
