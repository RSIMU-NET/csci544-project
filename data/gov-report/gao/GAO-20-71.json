IRS has done little research or reporting on the extent to which its online services are satisfying taxpayers' needs. Also, IRS has not set a target for using online services to help reduce taxpayer burden. Selected foreign and state revenue agencies' online services have developed online filing and communication capabilities, such as filing a tax return on the agency's website and offering electronic chats between revenue agency employees and taxpayers (see figure).", "IRS has long-term planning documents which detail online services it intends to develop, which include services to communicate digitally with taxpayers, to achieve its goal of modernizing the taxpayer experience. However, GAO found that IRS has not sufficiently considered taxpayer input in the prioritization process for these new services and instead prioritizes services primarily based on the potential benefit to IRS operations or how quickly a service might be developed. Without considering taxpayer input on user needs and preferences, IRS risks developing services that taxpayers do not use.", "A group of private sector tax preparation companies known as Free File, Inc., has a long-standing agreement with IRS in which the companies provide free electronic tax preparation and filing services to eligible taxpayers in exchange for IRS not offering its own filing capability. However, few taxpayers use these services and GAO found that IRS has given inadequate consideration to the full benefits and costs of the Free File agreement to all parties. Not considering these costs and benefits has implications for the future evolution of IRS's online services, including helping taxpayers electronically file amended returns."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making seven recommendations to IRS, including measuring and reporting on the effect of online services on satisfaction and taxpayer burden and setting a target for reducing burden, considering taxpayer input when prioritizing new online services, and ensuring that any renewal of the Free File agreement reflects benefits and costs.

Two  distinctions between these calculators and the online services our report  examines are that taxpayers do not have to establish their identity before  using a calculator and the calculators can be used to explore hypothetical  tax planning situations.

In December 2018, Congress  passed and the President signed the 21st Century Integrated Digital  Experience Act (IDEA Act) that includes requirements for agencies when  they are creating or redesigning a website or digital service that is  intended to be used by the public. Among these requirements are to  design the website or digital service around user needs, with data-driven  analysis influencing management and development decisions, using  qualitative and quantitative data to determine user goals, needs, and  behaviors.

This plan is to  include online services. The act also requires this customer service  strategy to identify metrics and benchmarks for quantitatively measuring  progress in implementing it. Similarly, the administration has established  a cross-agency priority goal called \u201cimproving customer experience with  federal services\u201d intended to improve the usability and reliability of the  most important online services, which contains requirements related to  IRS\u2019s online services that will be discussed in more detail later in this  report.", "In addition to these expectations for a high quality user experience, the  GPRA Modernization Act of 2010 (GPRAMA) requires, among other  provisions, strategic plans identifying Treasury\u2019s and other cabinet  departments\u2019 and other executive agencies\u2019 most important goals.

Initially, the  participating companies agreed to provide free electronic tax preparation  and filing services for eligible taxpayers. In return, IRS stated that it  would not offer its own free, online tax return preparation and filing  services.

To do this, IRS proposes  to develop new services including delivering taxpayer notices  electronically, modernizing online installment agreements, and  establishing omni-channel communication capabilities provided that IRS  continues to receive the requested resources from Congress.

This requirement took effect in June 2019. IRS  documents describing how new services were prioritized show that IRS  did not incorporate taxpayer research or input into the score it assigns to  each proposed service. Instead, IRS officials estimated the potential  taxpayer value of a new service. For example, supporting documentation  for one proposed project from the modernization plan to allow taxpayers  to receive notices electronically states that IRS expects taxpayers to  receive less paper mail and have easier online access to recent or  historical notices if the project is developed. IRS expects that electronic  delivery of notices will increase the timeliness of its service, which would  improve the taxpayer experience.", "After a new online service is selected and approved, IRS does obtain  input from taxpayers during the development phase, for example, to  improve usability of the service and fine-tune technical capabilities. OLS  officials provided us with documentation of user experience research they  conducted on how to improve specific design elements of existing online  services.

Specifically, the agreement states  that \u201cthe federal government has pledged to not enter the tax preparation  software and e-filing services marketplace.\u201d IRS\u2019s decision not to  develop and offer electronic filing on its website is a contrast to the  capabilities offered by some other countries and U.S. states. The Free  File agreement in its current form could potentially constrain the  development of new online services such as allowing taxpayers to file  amended returns on irs.gov. Online services have the potential to  decrease both taxpayer burden and costs for revenue agencies in the  long term.", "IRS\u2019s efforts to assist taxpayers with amending previously filed tax returns  illustrate the potential costs of renewing the Free File agreement without  consideration of IRS\u2019s long-term plans for online services. Irrespective of  the method used to file the original return, taxpayers must file an  amended return (Form 1040X) on paper. Officials in IRS\u2019s Wage and  Investment (W&I) business operating division provided a business case  they drafted proposing to give taxpayers the option of filing an amended  return electronically. The business case makes clear that IRS officials  believe the current paper-based process is inconvenient for taxpayers  because the vast majority of taxpayers are filing the original return  electronically. It is also costly and challenging for IRS to process these  paper forms with more than 3 million of these amended returns received  in processing year 2017. The business case says IRS has been  assessing a potential online service in this area for more than 10 years,  but has not moved forward due to technical and resource challenges.", "One approach IRS is exploring is to allow private sector tax preparation  and filing companies and practitioners to file an amended return on behalf  of a client, which would be similar to the current arrangement for original  returns established by the Free File agreement. The second approach  IRS is exploring is allowing taxpayers to correct the return with a new  online service on irs.gov. The business case states IRS currently prefers  the first approach of having taxpayers work with industry or a tax  practitioner because of a combination of cost and technical  considerations.", "The business case states that IRS officials have had discussions with  officials affiliated with Free File, Inc. According to IRS\u2019s account of these  discussions, industry is supportive of the first potential approach of having  taxpayers electronically file amended returns through their industry.  Further, IRS notes that some taxpayers who used software to prepare the  original return may find it convenient to use the same software to prepare  and file an amended return. However, the business case also states that,  \u201cthe costs are not insignificant\u201d for IRS in working with industry, even  though IRS plans to leverage existing systems as much as possible.", "A further complication is how IRS\u2019s plans to work with industry on  electronic filing of amended returns relate to the Free File agreement.  IRS\u2019s business case states that Free File, Inc. officials told them  participating companies would be willing to provide electronic filing of  amended returns for free, but as noted above less than 2 percent of  original returns are filed through Free File. While individual tax  preparation and filing companies could choose to offer electronic filing of  amended returns for free or include that capability in paid packages they  offer for filing an original return, the agreement in its current form would  not guarantee free access to electronically filing amended returns for the  vast majority of taxpayers who file an original return outside of Free File.", "If IRS were to return to its earlier idea of offering the capability to file an  amended return on irs.gov, that approach also comes with potential risks  for IRS regarding the Free File agreement.

However, as noted above, IRS made a commitment to  \u201cnot enter the tax preparation software and e-filing services marketplace\u201d.", "Our analysis determined that the Form 1040X is nearly identical to the  Form 1040, with the difference being that a taxpayer notes which lines he  or she needs to correct.

It changes your original return to include new information.\u201d  Therefore, the capability for taxpayers to file a Form 1040X on irs.gov  would put irs.gov closer to having an online filing capability for original  returns.", "In written documents that officials from Free File, Inc. provided to us, they  said they would need to see a specific proposal for electronic filing of  amended returns before they could comment. However, they made clear  that they believe any future development of IRS\u2019s online services should  continue to leave the task of preparing and electronically filing a tax return  to industry.

In the Taxpayer First Act, Congress directs IRS to develop a  new online service for taxpayers to report miscellaneous payments.  Specifically, Congress directed IRS to develop no later than January 1,  2023, an internet platform for persons to prepare and file the Form 1099,  which is used by persons to report payments made to taxpayers for such  things as rent and services performed by someone other than an  employee.
