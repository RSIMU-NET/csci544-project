To do so, GAO reviewed program documentation and interviewed relevant officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Contract award and performance of work tasks had been started for one of two planned pilot systems--the Strategic Asset Management system. However, as of mid-September, the project had fallen behind (by 2 months) and the contractor had missed the deadline for initiating and completing planned tasks and delivering work products such as a system security plan. In particular, the contractor had not started 11 of 34 tasks, including conducting a security assessment, and was behind schedule on 16 of the remaining 23 tasks, including analyzing business processes. Program officials generally attributed the delays to VA having insufficient program and acquisition staff to perform necessary activities associated with awarding and executing the pilot contract and to poor project management by the pilot system contractor. A second project--for the Integrated Financial Accounting System pilot--is expected to start in October 2009. VA has taken steps to institute effective management of FLITE; however, the department has not yet fully established capabilities needed to ensure that the program will be successfully implemented. Specifically, VA has (1) recently filled long-standing staff vacancies, and only one program office staff opening remains; (2) not developed a cost estimate that includes total program costs or reconciled its estimate with an independent estimate; (3) not performed key actions necessary for reliable earned value management; (4) not yet established a schedule that is reliable; (5) not identified all mandatory federal financial management system requirements and ensured that system requirements are based on business requirements; and (6) not addressed all of the findings of its independent verification and validation organization in a timely manner. Until VA reconciles its cost estimate, ensures compliance with earned value management system standards, establishes a reliable schedule, ensures all relevant federal and system requirements are identified and traceable, and addresses all independent verification and validation findings, it could continue to experience schedule delays and further increase its risk of not providing the financial and asset management capabilities that users need."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2005, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) has been undertaking  an initiative to develop an integrated financial management and  information system known as the Financial and Logistics Integrated  Technology Enterprise (FLITE).

They stated that in  July 2009, they began working with stakeholders to address schedule  issues and plan to improve the reliability of their schedule by finalizing a  revised integrated master schedule by October 2009.", "Until VA completes a revised integrated master schedule that includes all  key program activities broken down to a sufficient level of detail and  identifies all resources and dependencies, the program\u2019s efforts to  measure progress and identify potential problems will be impaired, and  the program will have increased risk of missing critical milestones for  system delivery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Not Identified and Effectively Managed All FLITE Requirements", "paragraphs": ["According to SEI guidance, the requirements for a system should describe  the functionality needed to meet user needs and perform as intended in  the operational environment. Federal agencies also must ensure that  their financial management systems comply with federal standards  mandated by the Federal Financial Management Improvement Act of  1996. Also according to SEI guidance, an organization can ensure syste requirements are based on business requirements by tracking the  requirements from inception of the project and agreement on a spe of business requirements to development of the system requirements,  detailed design, code implementation, and test cases necessary for  validating the requirements. Requirements must be traceable forwar backward (i.e., bidirectional traceability) through the development life  cycle. Traceability helps reduce the risks of fielding a system that does n meet the needs of its users, incurring schedule delays, and increasing  costs.", "VA has developed an initial set of 1,700 requirements that need to be  addressed in the development of the SAM and IFAS components. FLIT requirements consist of core financial and procurement requirements  related to the IFAS project, as well as inventory, supply, and real prope requirements related to the SAM project. To develop the initial set of  requirements for FLITE, program officials stated that they analyzed VA \u2019s  current and planned financial and asset management business processes  and researched the Financial Systems Integration Office\u2019s (FSIO) Core  Financial System Requirements and Inventory, Supplies, and Materials  System Requirements publications. The initial set of requirements wasfurther defined and refined by obtaining input from consultants and VA  financial and asset management experts. The department included all  mandatory core financial system requirements in its IFAS requirements but did not include all mandatory inventory, supplies, and materials  requirements in its SAM requirements. For example, our analysis sho that VA did not include requirements for recording whether goods and  services are accepted or rejected and for performing a systematic review wed  and follow-up of overdue in-transit items. Program officials explained  that they did not include these requirements because they had not  determined whether the requirements were applicable to the SAM project.  The officials agreed to incorporate the missing requirements. VA is also in  the process of finalizing its real property requirements for the SAM beta  phase and still plans to develop additional requirements related to  procurement for IFAS. Further, the department is identifying data analysis  and reporting requirements for the data warehouse.", "Regarding requirements traceability, SAM project officials acknowledge  that mapping system requirements to the related business requirements is  fundamental to effective requirements management. However, according  to FLITE officials, they made a business decision not to establish  bidirectional traceability between the business and system requirements  included in the SAM pilot request for proposals. Instead, they decided to  require the pilot contractor to establish traceability between the business  and system requirements after the contractor analyzes and refines the  requirements. According to the officials, the contractor plans to complete  these tasks by December 2009. In addition, program officials stated that  they plan to establish bidirectional traceability between IFAS business and  system requirements under the IFAS implementation contract scheduled  to be awarded in October 2009. In this regard, the IFAS request for  proposals states that the implementation contractor will be required to  finalize IFAS requirements, as well as maintain and document the  traceability of all requirements to design, develop, integrate, and test  specifications.", "As the department develops its requirements, it is important that all  relevant and applicable federal financial management system requirements  be identified and incorporated into the program\u2019s requirements to ensure  its planned financial management systems meet users\u2019 needs and comply  with applicable federal laws. Further, until they have established  traceability between the business and system requirements, VA will not be  positioned to know whether the system requirements are complete and  effectively address each business requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Has Begun Independent Verification and Validation of the FLITE Program, but All Findings Have Not Been Addressed in a Timely Manner", "paragraphs": ["According to recognized industry standards and our prior reports, the  purpose of independent verification and validation is to provide an  independent review of system processes and products to ensure that  quality standards are being met. As we have previously noted, the use of  independent verification and validation is a recognized best practice for  large and complex system development and acquisition programs such as  FLITE and involves an independent organization conducting unbiased  reviews of processes, products, and results to verify and validate that they  meet stated requirements and standards. VA policy recognizes the  importance of addressing independent verification and validation results  in a timely manner.", "Recognizing the importance of independent verification and validation, the  department\u2019s Systems Quality Assurance Service was tasked with  performing independent verification and validation activities for the FLITE  program. In April 2009, this organization developed a Software Quality  Assurance Plan to guide independent verification and validation activities  for the program. The plan was developed consistent with industry  standards and generally contained the required elements. The plan also  outlined reviews that would be performed by the Systems Quality  Assurance Service, including product (e.g., program and project  deliverables), process, internal controls, test readiness, and production  readiness reviews. In addition, the Systems Quality Assurance Service is  responsible for advising and assisting with the program\u2019s implementation  of a suite of tools to support requirements management, change  management, risk, and test management.", "Independent verification and validation of the FLITE program has been  focused primarily on the review of program and project deliverables.  According to program officials, as of September 2009, the Systems Quality  Assurance Service had reviewed 30 FLITE work products and provided  findings and recommendations to document owners. Out of 1,064 total  findings, 947 (approximately 89 percent) had been fully addressed by the  program or had been identified as obsolete by the Systems Quality  Assurance Service. Of the 117 remaining findings, 59 had been addressed  but had not yet been reflected in revised documents, and 58 required  additional attention. Of the 58 findings and recommendations that  remained open, the SAM pilot site readiness plan accounted for 18 that  were identified in December 2008. According to the Systems Quality  Assurance Service, these findings focused on the need for consistency  with other project documentation, clarity in the timing of site activities,  and incorporation of planned site-level activities into the program work  breakdown structure. In addition, according to department officials, the  FLITE acquisition strategy has two findings and recommendations that  were identified in December 2008 and that remain to be addressed. These  findings are related to VA\u2019s approach for acquiring SAM and IFAS  integration support and the program\u2019s focus on front-end acquisition  activities, rather than full life cycle acquisition processes. Unknown or  incomplete system integration requirements may result in significant  rework and adversely impact the program\u2019s cost, schedule, and quality.", "According to FLITE program officials, they have not had the human  capital resources they need to address all the independent verification and  validation findings and recommendations in a timely manner. As a result,  independent verification and validation findings that highlight important  program issues (e.g., determining an approach for integrating SAM and  IFAS) have not received the attention that they need. As discussed earlier,  the staff resources recently added could help address the program\u2019s  inability to focus sufficient attention on resolving findings from initial  independent verification and validation activities. It remains unclear  whether the program office will be positioned to efficiently resolve  findings raised when the scope of independent verification and validation  activities expands to include system testing and production readiness  reviews, which affect the extent to which FLITE components will meet  stated requirements and quality standards."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The pilot for VA\u2019s new asset management system has experienced a 2- month schedule delay just 5 months after award of the contract. While VA  has recently taken steps to address the staffing shortages that have  substantially contributed to this delay, it has not yet fully established the  management capability necessary for FLITE to be successful. For  example, the department\u2019s program cost estimate did not represent total  program costs, nor has the estimate been reconciled with an independent  estimate\u2014a process that could increase its reliability. Further, it has not  conducted EVM that is needed to ensure the reliability of the department\u2019s  programwide reporting on the initiative. Also, VA has not yet made  revisions that are needed to increase the reliability of the program\u2019s  integrated master schedule. In addition, the requirements for the two  major program systems, SAM and IFAS, do not yet address all the  functions expected of federal asset management and financial  management systems. Finally, key findings from independent reviews of  the program have not been fully addressed on a timely basis.", "As a consequence, the department is faced with significant challenges in  implementing FLITE\u2019s pilot systems as planned, while simultaneously  working to fully establish program management capabilities. Program  officials recognize the importance of reconciling their cost estimate,  ensuring compliance with EVM system standards, establishing a reliable  schedule, ensuring all relevant federal and system requirements are  identified and traceable, and addressing all independent verification and  validation findings. Further, they have stated that they plan to take such  actions. However, just as program officials needed the department\u2019s  support in filling long-standing program office vacancies, the full support  of the department\u2019s top management is critical to ensuring that planned  actions are executed.
