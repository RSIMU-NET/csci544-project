These internal controls include automated and manual checks of soldier incentive contracts to verify soldiers' eligibility for incentive payments. For example, ARNG implemented automated rules in its Guard Incentive Management System\u2014an online system that tracks incentive contracts\u2014to monitor a soldier's eligibility for an incentive by comparing the data received from multiple personnel systems against the soldier's contract. If any issues are found, the Guard Incentive Management System will flag the incentive case for review by state ARNG officials and will stop future payments until the issue is resolved.", "While these internal controls have improved accountability over soldier incentive payments, ARNG is still in the process of completing further actions. For example, in April 2017, ARNG issued the fiscal year 2017 Selected Reserve Incentive Program policy. However, ARNG did not incorporate changes as a result of this policy into the Guard Incentive Management System to ensure that the automated checks captured these policy changes\u2014including one that affects approximately 8,000 solider incentive contracts, according to ARNG officials. ARNG officials told us that they had not updated the Guard Incentive Management System with this policy because of technical challenges resulting from a transition in vendors for the Reserve Component Manpower System\u2014an information system that houses the Guard Incentive Management System. ARNG officials also told us that they plan to update the Guard Incentive Management System to include the 2017 policy in February 2018.", "GAO also found that ARNG had not developed and implemented a plan for future significant changes that could affect its internal controls over soldier incentive payments. These changes include, for example, the end of the current vendor contract in 2020 to support the Reserve Component Manpower System and the Army National Guard's migration to the Integrated Personnel and Pay System \u2013 Army that is scheduled to occur in 2018. Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government states that management should identify, analyze, and respond to significant changes that could affect an internal control system. Specifically, because conditions affecting an organization and its environment continually change, management needs to anticipate and plan for significant changes by using a forward-looking process to prepare for those changes. Without taking action to plan for such changes, ARNG puts itself at risk of making improper payments in the future.", "The Defense Finance and Accounting Service and the Defense Office of Hearings and Appeals review and adjudicate requests for waivers of incentive debt. DOD has taken two steps to improve the availability of documentation needed to adjudicate waiver cases.

We selected a nonprobability sample of six states based on the value of the incentives  their respective programs awarded in fiscal year 2016 and the number of  soldier contracts ARNG was considering for termination (termination  being a necessary step before beginning recoupments). The six states we  selected were California, Delaware, Illinois, Nebraska, Nevada, and  Virginia. We conducted site visits to each of our six selected states to  catalogue their procedures related to incentive payments. Specifically, we  conducted interviews with state incentive managers to discuss their  procedures for managing incentive payments, and we observed incentive  managers performing these procedures in information systems such as  the Guard Incentive Management System, among others. We also  discussed challenges they experienced using these systems. Although  the findings from our site visits to these six selected states are not  generalizable to all states and territories, they provide important insights  into how the incentive process is managed across a range of states.", "Because ARNG serves as the focal point for processing all incentive  cases, we also conducted interviews with ARNG officials to discuss their  roles in managing incentive payments, and we observed their use of the  Guard Incentive Management System. We discussed challenges they  experienced using the system. Based on these discussions, we  performed additional work to identify the steps that NGB was taking to  address these challenges. This work included reviewing documents  associated with the Reserve Component Manpower System and its  associated modules, such as the Guard Incentive Management System;  interviewing vendors that were awarded the contracts to manage the  Reserve Component Manpower System; and interviewing NGB officials to  discuss their roles in managing contracts associated with the Reserve  Component Manpower System and the ARNG Incentive Support Team.

The ARNG regulation for  Selected Reserve Incentive Programs includes over a dozen sub- categories of cash bonuses, such as those for newly enlisted soldiers,  active duty soldiers who join ARNG, and soldiers who re-enlist or extend  with ARNG. In addition to cash bonuses, ARNG makes incentive  payments as part of the Student Loan Repayment Program. Under this  type of incentive, ARNG disburses incentive payments directly to a third  party lender.", "The Director of ARNG is responsible for determining the overall policy for  the Selected Reserve Incentive Program and issued the regulation that  governs incentive procedures and eligibility criteria for soldiers entering  into an incentive agreement. On a periodic basis, ARNG updates the  policy for a specific fiscal year through a policy or an education and  incentive operational message. These updates, which are intended to  help ARNG meet its readiness requirements, can provide instructions on  the value and frequency of incentives, as well as directing the targeting of  incentives to address a particular skill or unit need. The updates can also  direct changes to eligibility requirements in order to enable a soldier to  receive an incentive.", "Each of the 54 states, territories, and the District of Columbia has a state  incentive manager in ARNG who provides oversight for authorization,  verification, validation, establishment, monitoring, and termination of all  incentive payments, including recoupment of incentives. State incentive  managers work with recruiting and retention personnel to assist in the use  of bonuses. For example, state incentive managers can ensure that the  contracts used by recruiting and retention personnel comply with ARNG  policy. Additionally, each ARNG unit has personnel who track information  on soldier performance, such as attendance, physical fitness, and  training. To manage these activities, ARNG uses the Reserve Component  Manpower System\u2014 an information system that houses manpower  readiness data and includes approximately 40 subsystems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improper Payments in the California ARNG", "paragraphs": ["A 2008 California National Guard audit revealed that Selected Reserve  Incentive Program incentives, including student loan repayments, were  being improperly paid to numerous California ARNG soldiers and that  some of these cases were results of fraud. In subsequent audits of  California ARNG, 17,485 soldiers were identified as having received a  bonus or student loan repayment in the period of 2004 through 2010 that  was potentially improper and subject to recoupment. By the end of 2016,  several follow-on reviews had identified improper incentive payments to  more than 1,400 soldiers.", "These investigations and audits determined that ARNG lacked internal  controls over its incentive process. For example, the state incentive  manager could authorize and approve an incentive and then forward the  payment request to the state\u2019s U.S. Property and Fiscal Office, the office  responsible for authorizing payment. To improve the process, in 2010  ARNG established a contract for an Incentive Support Team to, among  other things, review soldier incentives. In 2011, ARNG developed a  module within the Reserve Component Manpower System called the  Guard Incentive Management System. The Guard Incentive Management  System was designed to aid in managing the incentive process across all  states by providing an online system to track, monitor, and prioritize all  incentive cases. The Guard Incentive Management System was also  intended to increase oversight through automated notifications and  reporting features and to add a budget control mechanism for NGB and  the states, among other things. In 2012, ARNG began a phased  implementation of the Guard Incentive Management System in each state  and territory.

State incentive managers are responsible for ensuring that  soldiers receiving incentive payments are satisfying contractual  requirements.

ARNG officials  informed us that, if the soldier does not respond to the letter within 45  days, a debt is established in Defense Finance and Accounting Service  systems. In response, the soldier may provide documents to address the  issue or, should documents already exist, may request that NGB make an  exception to policy\u2014a determination by NGB that the circumstances of a  soldier\u2019s case merit allowing the soldier to retain the incentive payment.  Incentive managers in some states told us that they will assist soldiers in  requesting an exception to policy and will sometimes request these  exceptions on their behalf in the case of events\u2014such as a  reorganization of a state\u2019s ARNG units\u2014that could result in a large  number of soldiers not meeting the terms of their incentive contracts.

First, ARNG has  implemented the Guard Incentive Management System and expanded its  use over time to oversee its incentive contracts through automation. In  2012, ARNG began using the Guard Incentive Management System to  manage the life cycles of contracts between ARNG and soldiers for  incentives and education entitlements, including those for the Selected  Reserve Incentive Program. When a soldier signs a contract with a  recruiter or retention officer, the Guard Incentive Management System  alerts the state incentive manager that an incentive is ready for review.  ARNG has also implemented automated rules in the Guard Incentive Management System\u2014known as monitor rules\u2014that continuously  monitor a soldier\u2019s eligibility for an incentive. The system does this by  comparing the data it receives from multiple personnel systems against  the soldier\u2019s contract. If any issues are found, the Guard Incentive  Management System will flag the incentive case for review by the state  incentive manager and will stop future payments until the issue is  resolved. In California, for example, we observed an incentive manager  reviewing a case that had been flagged for violating a monitor rule  because the soldier was no longer in the unit stipulated in the incentive  contract. The incentive manager told us that the soldier was informed of  the situation and that corrective action would be required before any  additional payments could be made. If a soldier is deemed ineligible or  loses eligibility at any time during this process, the state incentive  manager will stop payments and review the case to determine whether  the contract needs to be terminated.", "State incentive managers are also required to verify certain eligibility  criteria and personnel documents manually in the Guard Incentive  Management System. State incentive managers use checklists to review  a soldier\u2019s incentive contract and unit orders to determine eligibility. The  Selected Reserve Incentive Program requires that incentive contracts of  more than three years be paid out in installments. State incentive  managers or their designees are required to manually review each  incentive contract before making an anniversary payment. During our site  visits, we observed state incentive managers using the Guard Incentive  Management System to review whether a soldier was eligible to receive a  payment. For example, in Nebraska we observed an incentive manager  using the Guard Incentive Management System to verify a soldier\u2019s  contract period, unit assignment, and physical fitness test scores, among  other items, to confirm the soldier\u2019s eligibility to receive a payment. In  Illinois, we observed an incentive manager using the Guard Incentive  Management System to verify a soldier\u2019s identity, unit transfer orders, and  an eligible student loan before approving a student loan repayment for  further review at the national level. We also observed an incentive  manager in Illinois reviewing a soldier\u2019s incentive contract, which was  being terminated because the soldier had failed to attend required drills.  ARNG personnel in each of the states we visited told us that the Guard  Incentive Management System provides a strong barrier against soldiers  receiving improper payments. The Guard Incentive Management System  also tracks and records each user\u2019s actions on each incentive case to  provide an audit trail, which we observed in multiple states.", "In addition to reviews conducted at the state level, ARNG conducts  another review of incentive payments using the Guard Incentive  Management System. Once a contract has been reviewed at the state  level, state incentive managers forward it to the ARNG Incentive Support  Team for another review. The ARNG Incentive Support Team has  provided assistance to all 54 states, territories, and the District of  Columbia, by conducting reviews of 100 percent of incentive payments  and terminations, among other things. After the ARNG Incentive Support  Team\u2019s review, ARNG officials perform a final review of an incentive  payment before it is certified. Specifically, ARNG officials review a  random sample of 10 percent of contracts from a batch of incentive  payments that the Guard Incentive Management System generates.  ARNG officials told us that if 25 percent or more of this 10 percent sample  is rejected because it contains errors, all of the contracts in the batch are  returned to the ARNG Incentive Support Team or their respective states  for additional review. If less than 25 percent are rejected, the individual  contracts with errors are returned to the ARNG Incentive Support Team  or their respective states for additional review. The remainder of the batch  passes ARNG review, and the Guard Incentive Management System  generates payment files electronically and transfers them to the Defense  Finance and Accounting Service, which disburses funds to the soldiers,  as shown in figure 1.", "Second, ARNG conducts periodic reviews of its incentive program.  Specifically, National Guard Regulation 600-7, Selected Reserve  Incentive Program\u2014issued in August 2014\u2014classifies incentive  programs as a high-risk function that should be evaluated every year to  mitigate risks, and that management controls must be evaluated at least  once every five years. Each of the six states we visited had either  conducted an internal review of its incentive program since 2016 or told  us that it had plans to conduct one within the next year. For example,  ARNG officials in Nevada had evaluated and certified the internal controls  of their incentive program in 2017, and ARNG officials in Delaware told us  that they plan to request an external evaluation of their incentive program  in 2018."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "ARNG Has Taken Steps to Address Some Weaknesses Affecting Its Internal Controls but Has Not Planned for Future Significant Changes", "paragraphs": ["ARNG took steps to address some identified weaknesses to its internal  controls for managing soldier incentive contracts, but has not developed  and implemented a plan for future significant changes that could affect its  internal controls. For example, in October 2015, a previous contract to  support the ARNG Incentive Support Team expired, and performance of  the follow-on contract was delayed for approximately two years\u2014until  September 2017\u2014by actions related to two GAO bid protests. From  October 2015 to January 2016, ARNG used a 3-month bridge contract  with the previous contractor to provide support and enable the ARNG  Incentive Support Team to continue to perform 100 percent reviews.  However, in January 2016, the ARNG Incentive Support Team stopped  conducting 100 percent reviews of incentive contracts. At that time,  according to ARNG officials, ARNG increased their review of incentive  contracts from 10 percent to 30 percent to help mitigate the loss of the  100 percent review that the ARNG Incentive Support Team had  previously provided. On September 30, 2017, the current contract for the  ARNG Incentive Support Team was awarded and according to ARNG  officials, the ARNG Incentive Support Team reinstated 100 percent  reviews of soldier incentive contracts on December 8, 2017. ARNG also  adjusted their review of soldier incentive contracts from 30 percent back  to 10 percent.", "As another example, in April 2017, ARNG issued the fiscal year 2017  Selected Reserve Incentive Program policy. Among other things, the  policy changed the eligibility requirement for receiving an incentive  payment based on soldier performance on the Army Physical Fitness  Test. Under the previous policy, soldiers who failed two consecutive  fitness tests would be ineligible to receive an incentive. The fiscal year  2017 policy changed this requirement to two failures during the lifetime of  a soldier\u2019s incentive contract, which could be up to six years. According to  ARNG officials, approximately 8,000 incentive contracts are affected by  this requirement. NGB requires the vendor managing the Reserve  Component Manpower System, which includes the Guard Incentive  Management System, to update the system with any policy changes.  However, ARNG officials told us that they had not updated the Guard  Incentive Management System with the fiscal year 2017 policy.  Therefore, the system\u2019s automated reviews are unable to check for this  eligibility requirement.", "Additionally, according to ARNG officials, ARNG did not publish official  guidance regarding this discrepancy. Instead, ARNG informally discussed  with state incentive managers that the fiscal year 2018 policy, once  issued, would eliminate this requirement. ARNG officials told us that a  separate transition of vendors for the Reserve Component Manpower  System that began in 2016 had delayed their ability to update the Guard  Incentive Management System with the fiscal year 2017 policy. ARNG  had not anticipated that the vendor would be unable to update the Guard  Incentive Management System as a result of technical challenges  following the transition. ARNG officials also told us that they are currently  developing the fiscal year 2018 policy and would update the Guard  Incentive Management System with this policy when it is ready. On  December 6, 2017, we provided our observations to ARNG on the  inability of the Guard Incentive Management System to perform  automated monitoring on these 8,000 incentive contracts. According to  ARNG officials, on December 7, 2017, they submitted a formal change  request to the vendor to incorporate this rule in the Guard Incentive  Management System, and they expect the rule to be incorporated in  February 2018.", "ARNG has also taken steps to address unforeseen technical issues that  have affected its incentive program. For example, ARNG officials told us  that they have implemented several recommendations that were made as  part of the Army\u2019s administrative investigation of the transition in vendors  managing the Reserve Component Manpower System, of which the  Guard Incentive Management System is a component. The investigation  determined that ARNG was not positioned to provide sufficient technical  oversight of the transition, and in September 2016, the investigation\u2019s  report recommended that ARNG, among other things, assign a highly  skilled Information Technology subject matter expert to provide oversight  of all government and contractor activities related to the Reserve  Component Manpower System. ARNG officials also told us they had  since assigned this expert and had implemented other recommendations  from the investigation, but were not tracking progress on those recommendations. Additionally, ARNG officials told us that, as of October  2017, they were in the process of revising their performance work  statement for the current vendor. These revisions may include, among  other things, providing other types of technical support and reducing the  amount of time that the system would be unavailable to ARNG and  others. Finally, ARNG officials told us that they plan to use an existing  Information Technology steering committee to provide oversight for the  Reserve Component Manpower System; however, these same officials  told us that the steering committee had not met from May 2017 through  October 2017.", "While ARNG has taken steps to remedy some technical issues and  weaknesses in its internal controls, it has not demonstrated that it has  learned from its past experiences by planning for significant changes to  its incentive program that could affect its internal controls, such as its  information systems not functioning correctly or data related to incentive  contracts not being readily updated or available for an extended period of  time. These changes include, for example, the next vendor transition for  the Reserve Component Manpower System, which is expected to be re- competed in 2020. Additionally, as ARNG continues deployment of the  Integrated Personnel and Pay System \u2013 Army in 2018, it is anticipated  that aspects of the Reserve Component Manpower System will change.

By  using the Guard Incentive Management System and requiring multiple  levels of review before incentives are paid, ARNG may have reduced the  likelihood of future widespread improper payments similar to what  occurred in California. However, it is important for ARNG to be forward  looking in preserving the integrity of its internal controls. ARNG has faced  challenges during the transition between vendors managing the system  that resulted in the weakening of internal controls, including those built  into the Guard Incentive Management System. To its credit, ARNG has  taken mitigating actions to prevent improper payments while attempting to  address those issues. These challenges, and the need for mitigating  actions, could have been prevented if ARNG had identified and prepared  in advance for challenges potentially resulting from the vendor transition.  If ARNG does not proactively identify, analyze, and plan to respond to  significant changes that could affect the internal controls to its incentive  program, there is an increased risk that additional weaknesses to its  internal controls could emerge and result in an increased likelihood of  improper payments."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation", "paragraphs": ["We are making one recommendation to ARNG:  The Director of the Army National Guard should develop and implement a  plan to identify, analyze, and address any significant changes that could  affect internal controls for its Guard Incentive Management System.
