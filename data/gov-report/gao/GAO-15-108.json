Under UBP, providers can charge varying prices, change connection speeds, or take other actions based on Internet data consumed. The 4 largest mobile providers in the country all use UBP to some extent; 7 of the 13 largest fixed providers now use UBP to some extent. Because prices can vary based on usage, it may be important that consumers be informed about data. GAO found that some tools offered by fixed providers to educate consumers regarding data can be confusing. For example, some provider estimates vary on data consumed for the same type of content. While mobile providers follow a voluntary code of conduct, developed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), to encourage useful, consistent consumer education, no similar code exists among fixed providers potentially resulting in confusion and a lack of consumer awareness regarding data needs.", "Participants in all eight of GAO's focus groups reported being subject to mobile UBP and expressed some concerns about it, such as difficulty tracking data usage among many devices. Yet participants accepted mobile UBP and adapted by, for example, limiting use of high-data content and by connecting to Wi-Fi. By contrast, only a few participants in three focus groups reported being subject to fixed Internet UBP. Participants expressed concerns about possible increases in prices for access caused by fixed-Internet UBP and the potential effect of limits on their fixed Internet, where they have not considered data usage. Participants exhibited confusion over data consumption\u2014for example thinking that low-data activities like online shopping consumed large amounts of data. Participants also expressed concern about difficulty tracking the wide range of devices accessing their fixed data allowance and that fixed UBP may negatively affect students, people working from home, and those with lower socio-economic status.", "The potential effects of UBP are uncertain and could depend on competition among providers. Based on economics literature, UBP can address the usage of the heaviest data users and can benefit consumers by providing more options as opposed to a one-size-fits-all unlimited data plan. The literature also suggests that providers could implement UBP to benefit consumers\u2014for example, by offering low-data, low-cost plans for those who do not want an unlimited data plan. While mobile providers GAO reviewed offer such plans, fixed providers\u2014generally facing less competition\u2014do so to a lesser extent. According to the literature, providers facing limited competition could use UBP to increase profits, potentially resulting in negative effects, including increased prices, reductions in content accessed, and increased threats to network security. Several researchers and stakeholders GAO interviewed said that UBP could reduce innovation for applications and content if consumers ration their data. While FCC is collecting data regarding fixed UBP, it is not using this data to track UBP use because it only recently started collecting the data specifically to analyze prices. As a result, although FCC is charged with promoting the public interest, it may not know if UBP is being used in a way that is contrary to the public interest and, if so, take appropriate actions."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Access to affordable broadband Internet is increasingly seen as being  crucial to improving access to information, quality of life, and commerce  and as a driver for economic growth and innovation.

Furthermore,  according to FCC, the top 15 percent of cable Internet subscribers use  over 145 GB of data a month and fiber-optic Internet subscribers use over  120 GB per month. Based on Cisco\u2019s estimate of data growth, noted  previously, of 21.5 percent per year for fixed Internet data, their data  usage could reach more than double common current data allowances of  150 or 300 GB by 2020 (see fig. 5). In addition, more users could be  affected by UBP in the future to the extent that average users begin using  more data-heavy applications and content providers continue to develop  more data-intensive content and applications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "UBP Can Be Used to Provide More Options to Consumers, but Benefits Unclear When Competition is Limited", "paragraphs": ["A second rationale for UBP is that it has the potential to increase  consumer welfare. According to economics literature, UBP can be  interpreted as a form of price discrimination, where sellers offer the same  or similar goods at different prices and consumers choose among these  versions. In a competitive market place, this practice may enhance  consumer welfare because firms may compete to offer different versions  of a product at competitively low prices. As a result, in a competitive  marketplace, providers could use UBP to innovate on the types of plans  they offer. For example, this scenario could allow low-data users to buy  plans with low data allowances at competitively lower prices, and heavier  data users could buy plans with higher data allowances that best meet  their needs. In contrast, in markets that are not very competitive, this kind  of price discrimination may not be beneficial because limited competition  gives the seller greater ability to make take-it-or-leave-it offers to  consumers\u2014who may face few choices to move to other providers\u2014that  may enhance providers\u2019 profits at the expense of consumer welfare. FCC  officials said that they believe economics literature is inconclusive on  these matters.", "There is generally more competition among mobile providers than among  fixed providers. According to FCC, 54 percent of households are in  census tracts that have more than two fixed providers with subscribers to  services with a download speed of at least 6 Mb/second and upload  speed of at least 1.5 Mb/s. By contrast, according to FCC, almost 98  percent of the U.S. population lives in census blocks with more than two  mobile providers. Participants in six of our eight focus groups said they  would look to switch providers if faced with fixed Internet UBP, but  participants in all eight groups said that they faced limited choice in  providers, which may limit their ability to select a data plan that best  meets their needs.", "All mobile providers and two fixed providers we interviewed told us that  they in part use UBP to offer more Internet plan options to meet individual  needs; as a result, providers don\u2019t require all consumers to pay for  unlimited data or high-speed data at a fixed price. Consequently,  consumers who want to use low amounts of data can pay less than those  who use more. For example, one mobile provider offers a 1 GB data plan  for $40 a month compared to $80 for a 6 GB data plan. The availability of low-price, low-data plans may also encourage some individuals or  households without Internet access to subscribe. However, according to  a recent survey by Pew Research, only 9 percent of non-Internet users  cited price as a reason for not accessing the Internet, suggesting that  the availability of low priced plans may not substantially increase the  number of new Internet subscribers.", "The extent to which mobile and fixed Internet customers have benefitted  from low-cost low-data plans is unclear at this time.", "While mobile customers can select a wide range of data plans,  customers who may potentially benefit from the reduced prices of low- data plans may not be taking advantage of them. For example, one  mobile provider we interviewed said that a \u201csmall percentage\u201d of its   Yet, according to  customers are on 500 MB or smaller data plans.Cisco, about 25 percent of mobile customers use less than 200 MB of  data a month.", "Fixed internet customers\u2014who as mentioned generally face less  choice in providers than mobile customers do\u2014generally have fewer  plan options than mobile customers, especially for low-cost, low-data  plans. However, it appears that a small percentage of customers  subscribe to such options even though, according to FCC data, 30  percent of cable Internet customers use about 25 GB of data a month  or less, meaning they could potentially take advantage of such plans.  Another reason why subscribers may not choose the low-data plan at  a discount is because the cost per GB of data is high and the small  discount (of at most 20 percent of the unlimited data plan price) may  not be worth the significant restriction in data usage from unlimited  data. Further, only two fixed providers we interviewed offer data plans  near or below the levels of median household data usage reported by  FCC.", "FCC\u2019s Open Internet Advisory Committee studied the issue of usage- based pricing and, believing that more fixed Internet customers could be  affected by UBP in the future, recommended in August 2013 that FCC  monitor fixed provider application of UBP. data\u2014such as on plan prices and data allowances used by selected fixed   While FCC officials said that they will consider how they can  providers.use these data in the future, at this time FCC only uses these data to set  a benchmark to ensure that providers receiving universal service funding  are providing broadband services in rural areas at prices comparable to  those in urban areas. FCC does not track providers\u2019 use of UBP as FCC  only recently started collecting data for the specific purpose mentioned  above. For example, FCC is not analyzing the data to determine how  many providers utilize UBP, levels of data allowances, and how those  allowances compare to average data consumption. As mentioned earlier,  the Telecommunications Act of 1996 calls on FCC to promote the public  interest in the provision of telecommunications services. Because FCC is  not conducting any broader analysis with these data, it may not have a  full understanding of how UBP is being used and its effects on  consumers.

Because UBP can  make it more expensive to watch data-heavy content such as streaming  video, it may discourage people from accessing such content and,  therefore, discouraging them from eliminating their television service. This  might adversely affect firms that provide online video streaming services  and reduce competition and innovation in the market for providing  streaming video content, thereby negatively affecting consumers.", "In addition, two industry stakeholders we interviewed believe UBP could  in general inhibit innovation that results from experimentation and  unlimited access to the Internet.

Mobile customers benefit from a voluntary code of  conduct that FCC helped facilitate to guide provider actions and  consumer education. Such a code helps enable more consistent and  transparent information provided to consumers. Because no code of  conduct exists for fixed providers, there is less assurance that information  provided to consumers is clear, consistent, and transparent, potentially  leading to consumer confusion over data usage and poor decisions  regarding data plans.", "Although few fixed Internet customers are affected by UBP at this time,  the number could grow to the extent that fixed Internet providers increase  their use of UBP and data use grows. Providers could implement UBP in  a way that benefits consumers\u2014for example, by offering low-data, low- cost plans for customers who do not want to pay for an unlimited data  plan they do not need. However, providers\u2014especially those facing  limited competition\u2014could use UBP as a means to increase their profits  which could result in UBP having negative effects, including increased  prices paid by consumers, reductions in content and applications  accessed by consumers, and increased threats to network security.", "Because fixed Internet customers generally have limited choice of  providers, they may be unable to switch providers to select a data plan  that best meets their needs. While focus group participants have adapted  to mobile data plans, they and other consumers may have a harder time  adapting to fixed-Internet UBP given the limited choice among providers  and challenges in reducing data usage\u2014as consumers have done for  mobile Internet\u2014at home if needed. While FCC has been collecting  relevant data on the use of UBP, including information on data  allowances, FCC is not using the data to gain an understanding of how  UBP is being used and what its potential effects are on consumers.

Make use of existing data collection sources to track fixed-Internet  UBP implementation and its effects on consumers nationwide so that  FCC can take actions, if necessary, to protect consumer interests."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to FCC for review and comment. FCC  provided a written response (see app. II) as well as technical comments  that we incorporated as appropriate. In response to our recommendation  that FCC collaborate with fixed Internet providers to develop a voluntary  code of conduct for consumer communication, FCC said that because the  number of consumer complaints regarding UBP by fixed providers  appears to be small and that UBP plans are less common for fixed  Internet customers than mobile customers, it is unclear that any action is  needed at this time. FCC added it will continue to monitor its complaints  and provider offerings for trends that might indicate that more action is  needed. We recognize that UBP plans are less common for fixed Internet  customers than mobile, but believe additional action is warranted as we  recommended. Given the trend toward greater use of UBP by fixed  providers, increased data usage, confusion by consumers regarding data  usage, our previous findings that consumers may not know to file  complaints with FCC, and the potential that limited competition among  fixed providers could result in their using UBP in ways that harm  consumers, we continue to believe that it is important for FCC to be more  proactive. For mobile Internet, FCC worked with providers to improve  consumer education regarding data through the Consumer Code for  Wireless Service only after many consumers faced significant problems  with their data usage. We believe FCC has an opportunity to protect  consumers before significant problems occur by collaborating with fixed  Internet providers now to develop a code of conduct.", "Secondly, in response to our recommendation that FCC use existing data  sources to track UBP implementation, FCC agreed to do so but noted that  its two data gathering efforts that collect some data relevant to UBP\u2014the  Urban Rates survey and Form 481\u2014were both designed for other  purposes. FCC added that as a result, while these efforts would allow it to  conduct some analyses regarding UBP\u2014such as plans offered by  providers and the terms of those plans\u2014it would not be able to conduct  certain analyses, such as the number of subscribers subject to UBP. We  agree that FCC should analyze the existing data as best as it can, taking  into account such limitations. However, we also believe that in conducting  such analyses, FCC, to the extent possible should consider using other  existing data as well\u2014such as data on median data consumption\u2014to  make the analyses as meaningful as possible.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees and the Chairman of the FCC.
