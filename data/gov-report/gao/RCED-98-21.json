Operators include more than 150 airlines, freight carriers, charter firms, and other companies certified by FAA and operating under part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations. The aircraft they operate range from planes such as a Fairchild Metroliner III, which typically carries a maximum of 19 passengers or about 5,000 pounds of cargo, to planes such as a Boeing 747-400, which is capable of carrying more than 400 passengers or 122 tons of cargo. Some of the largest companies, like United Airlines or American Airlines, may have 500 or more aircraft.", "With more aircraft flying, the need for maintenance and repair services has grown. Air carriers spent almost $6.5 billion for maintenance and repair on their aircraft in 1996, according to an industry estimate. This amount is an increase of $1.2 billion, or 23 percent, over the estimate of $5.3 billion in 1990. The term \u201cmaintenance and repair\u201d encompasses a wide variety of activities. Some activities involve frequent servicing, such as overhauling tires, wheels, and brakes. Others include more extensive renovation, such as airframe maintenance, that must be done as aircraft get older. FAA classifies maintenance and repair activities into six rating categories (see table 1.1), which it uses to designate the type of maintenance or activity it has certified a repair station to perform.", "Some major air carriers, such as American Airlines and United Airlines, have substantial maintenance facilities of their own. However, many air carriers, including smaller air carriers, have used third-party repair stations rather than invest in the additional staff and hardware needed to do the work in-house. Some new air carriers entering the passenger or air freight markets have chosen to rely heavily\u2014and in some cases, almost exclusively\u2014on repair stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "What Are Repair Stations?", "paragraphs": ["The term \u201crepair station\u201d spans a wide variety of operations. In 1996, there were almost 5,000 repair stations certified by FAA, about 2,800 of which performed maintenance work on aircraft used by air carriers. A repair station\u2019s certificate specifies the types of maintenance it can perform. Some repair stations specialize in one particular maintenance and repair category, while others may conduct work in several categories. As figure 1.1 shows, the types of maintenance most often included in the certificates of these 2,800 repair stations were for accessories and airframes.", "In addition to specifying the types of maintenance a repair station can perform, FAA may limit the scope of a repair station\u2019s activities. For example, whenever appropriate, FAA may issue a rating that limits a repair station\u2019s work to maintaining or altering only certain types of airframes, power plants, propellers, radios, instruments, or accessories. Such a rating may be limited to a specific model of aircraft, engine, or constituent part or to any number of parts made by a particular manufacturer. FAA also issues limited ratings for specialized work, such as nondestructive testing, maintenance on landing gear or emergency equipment, or other specific areas not included in any of the six standard rating categories.", "Repair stations vary considerably in size and scope of operations. For example, Tramco, Inc., located in Everett, Washington, is one of the largest repair stations in the United States, with hangar facilities of 450,200 square feet and a workforce of more than 2,000. At one time, this facility can accommodate five wide-body aircraft, such as Boeing 747s, and five narrow-body aircraft, such as Boeing 737s. The repair station primarily conducts regularly scheduled maintenance and modifications, and it also modifies new aircraft when specifications are changed after manufacturing is completed. Figure 1.2 shows maintenance being done on a Boeing 727 at this facility. By contrast, Precision Avionics & Instruments in Atlanta, Georgia, is a much smaller repair station. It employs 35 workers and has a facility of 24,000 square feet where it primarily services instruments, electrical and electronic components and accessories.", "While most domestic repair stations are operated independently of commercial airlines, a few are in-house maintenance operations that conduct work for other airlines on a contractual basis. For example, at its own maintenance facilities, Delta Airlines performs power plant maintenance for such carriers as American Airlines, Air Jamaica, Trade Winds, and Aeroflot Russian International Airlines.", "Repair stations that work on the aircraft of U.S. carriers are found throughout the rest of the world, though not in as great a number as repair stations in the United States. In all, about 270 FAA-certified foreign repair stations perform repair work for U.S. air carriers. For example, Sabena Technic, the maintenance arm of Sabena Belgian World Airlines, does engine repair work for Federal Express and other carriers at its facility in Brussels. Sabena has FAA\u2019s approval for work on airframes, power plants, radios, instruments, and accessories."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "How Does FAA Oversee Repair Stations?", "paragraphs": ["FAA\u2019s oversight of repair stations is divided into two phases\u2014certification and surveillance. Certification initially involves a repair station\u2019s applying to FAA for authority to perform certain types of maintenance on certain types of aircraft. FAA inspects the repair station to ensure that the applicant\u2019s proposed procedures are effective and that the equipment meets regulatory requirements. In addition, FAA also inspects facilities, personnel, and material as well as the repair station\u2019s inspection system. If FAA finds these things to be in order, it issues a certificate with a set of \u201coperation specifications\u201d that cover what maintenance activities the repair station is authorized to perform. Certification is handled in one of two ways, depending on whether the repair station is in the United States or abroad. FAA requires foreign repair stations to renew their certification at least every 2 years, but for domestic repair stations, certification is permanent unless it is surrendered by the applicant or suspended or revoked by FAA.", "Surveillance, usually in the form of inspections, follows certification. FAA\u2019s guidelines require its safety inspectors to perform a facility inspection of each domestic and foreign repair station at least once every year. For many of the larger domestic repair stations, this inspection is broken into multiple visits. For example, FAA inspectors visited Evergreen Air Center, one of the larger repair stations we reviewed in depth, more than 20 times during fiscal year 1996. Located in Marana, Arizona, Evergreen employs about 590 workers who conduct all types of maintenance on most types of large transport aircraft. FAA divides repair station inspections into two categories, avionics and maintenance. Avionics inspections focus on a repair station\u2019s overall program for aircraft electronic components, including personnel training, policies, and procedures. Maintenance inspections cover a repair station\u2019s overall maintenance program, including personnel training, policies, and procedures.", "FAA\u2019s certification and inspection activities are carried out by inspectors based in the United States and abroad (see table 1.2). On the domestic side, certification and inspection activities are carried out by more than 550 FAA inspectors, most of whom have many other responsibilities as well. Unless they are assigned to one of the largest operations, inspectors usually are responsible for more than one repair station. We examined the workloads of 98 inspectors at the FAA offices we visited and found that the number of repair stations these inspectors were responsible for ranged from 1 to 42, with a median workload of 12 repair stations. These repair stations varied in size and complexity. Most of the inspectors had many other surveillance responsibilities as well, such as overseeing training schools for pilots and mechanics, helicopter operators, agricultural operators, and air taxis. On the foreign side, about 50 FAA inspectors handle the oversight of repair stations, again with responsibility for multiple repair stations. Unlike their counterparts in the United States, however, inspectors in these offices generally have the oversight of repair stations as their primary responsibility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Who Else Has Oversight Responsibility for Repair Stations?", "paragraphs": ["Under Federal Aviation Regulations, air carriers must ensure that repair stations are conducting work that conforms with the air carriers\u2019 manuals and the applicable FAA regulations. As part of meeting this requirement, air carriers may use one or both of the following means:", "They may conduct their own audits of repair stations\u2014generally every 2 years\u2014to ensure that the facilities have the capability to perform the work in accordance with the air carriers\u2019 maintenance policies, procedures, and requirements.", "They may rely on audits conducted by the Coordinating Agency for Supplier Evaluation, an international industry organization of major airlines and aerospace and marine contractors. These audits are conducted\u2014again, generally every 2 years\u2014by staff from member airlines who use a standardized approach that includes Federal Aviation Regulation requirements. Because many airlines use the same repair stations, these audits eliminate the expense of redundant evaluations of repair stations.", "Repair stations, both foreign and domestic, are also potentially subject to review by the regulatory agencies of other countries. Many of the national aviation authorities in countries where repair stations are located have developed their own extensive inspection, surveillance, evaluation, and certification programs for repair facilities. Like FAA, many of these agencies review repair stations in other countries as well (including the United States). Twenty-seven European nations have banded together to coordinate their efforts through an organization called the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA), but many nations such as China conduct reviews on their own. Like FAA, these other regulators have set up their programs to help ensure compliance with their own national standards.", "Figure 1.3 summarizes the relationship of the various parties involved in the oversight of repair stations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Why Has FAA\u2019s Oversight of Repair Stations Been a Matter of Concern?", "paragraphs": ["Concern has arisen about FAA\u2019s oversight of repair stations for three reasons: Air carriers are relying on repair stations much more than in the past. Several recent accidents have involved aircraft maintained by repair stations. And FAA\u2019s oversight of repair stations is comparatively limited.", "Steady growth in air carriers\u2019 use of repair stations is one development that has focused additional attention on how FAA is carrying out its responsibility to oversee repair stations. Reliance on repair stations among air carriers has grown from an estimated 37 percent of total maintenance in 1990 to an estimated 46 percent in 1996.", "Reliance on repair stations has been particularly heavy among newer carriers such as ValuJet, Western Pacific, Reno Air, and Frontier Airlines. According to FAA officials with whom we spoke, newer carriers use repair stations extensively because they do not have enough repair work to make performing it themselves economical or because they want to ensure that they get an experienced cadre of mechanics with sound practices and procedures. For example, Reno Air uses AAR Oklahoma, Inc., to perform heavy airframe maintenance and major alterations of its MD-80s and MD-90s. Operating only 30 of these aircraft does not warrant Reno Air\u2019s investing in the in-house repair capabilities for this type of maintenance. And even though established air carriers tend to use repair stations less extensively than smaller, newer air carriers, the amount of maintenance they conduct is so great that if only a small percentage of their maintenance is performed at repair stations, it still represents a substantial amount of work. For example, a United Airlines official estimated that while the company contracts out only about 7 percent of its maintenance budget to repair stations, this amounted to about $126 million worth of work in 1996.", "A second, and significant, reason for concern about FAA\u2019s oversight of repair stations stemmed from domestic aviation accidents in 1995 and 1996. Table 1.3 describes four aviation accidents for which the National Transportation Safety Board found contributing factors that involved inadequate inspection or maintenance or improper handling of hazardous cargo by repair stations.", "A third reason for concern is the relatively limited amount of oversight that FAA gives repair stations compared with the oversight it gives air carriers. FAA is responsible for ensuring that repair stations comply with regulations, and the agency\u2019s annual guidance for surveillance sets forth minimum inspection requirements for all certificate holders. For fiscal year 1997, each repair station was to have a minimum of one facility inspection, while each air carrier was required to have many more inspections. An air carrier such as Alaska Airlines, for instance, had to have a minimum of 62 inspections."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["The Ranking Minority Member of the Aviation Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, and Senator Ron Wyden asked us to examine FAA\u2019s oversight of repair stations.

In general, we did the following:", "We reviewed the use of repair stations by eight air carriers, chosen because, like the industry as a whole, they varied greatly in the extent to which they used repair stations. The number of aircraft operated by these carriers ranged from 3 to 659.", "We reviewed operations at 10 repair stations, chosen because they represented a wide variety of locations (both domestic and foreign), types of repair activities, and size of operations. The repair stations ranged from a wheel and brake specialist with about 20 employees to facilities conducting many types of maintenance and employing more than 3,000 workers.", "We examined oversight activities and discussed the oversight of repair stations at FAA headquarters, 4 of FAA\u2019s 9 regional offices, 8 of FAA\u2019s 86 Flight Standards district offices, and 6 of FAA\u2019s 7 offices with international responsibilities. Our work at these offices included reviewing inspection files for nearly 500 repair stations.", "We conducted a survey of 275 FAA principal inspectors on their views about ways to improve the oversight of repair stations. Our survey had a response rate of 90 percent, and its results can be generalized to all FAA inspectors with responsibility for repair stations.", "We conducted our review from August 1996 through October 1997 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. In September 1997, we provided the Department of Transportation and FAA with a draft of this report for their review and comment. We met with FAA officials, including the Deputy Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification (acting on behalf of the FAA Administrator) to obtain FAA\u2019s comments. Those comments and our responses are included in the executive summary and chapters 2, 3, and 4.

We reviewed 19 instances in which FAA conducted a special team inspection of a facility that had received a one-person inspection within the previous year. These special team inspections identified far more deficiencies than inspections done by individual inspectors. Team inspections tend to be more comprehensive and focused, and team members are more organizationally independent of the repair station and have a more standardized approach to ensuring that all aspects of compliance with rules and regulations are checked. Many inspectors acknowledged the advantages of using a team rather than an individual inspector to review such facilities, stating that the pressure of other duties keeps them from conducting inspections on their own that thoroughly identify deficiencies and, thus, ensure compliance. Some FAA offices we visited have developed ways to conduct inspections using teams rather than individual inspectors and to do so without adversely affecting other demands on inspectors\u2019 time. Their actions hold promise as a \u201cbest practice\u201d that FAA could examine for broader application."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Number of Inspections Conducted Meets the Required Minimum", "paragraphs": ["Surveillance is one of the most important functions FAA inspectors perform to ensure safety and regulatory compliance in the aviation system. Each year, FAA identifies specific surveillance activities that must be conducted during the year, including an inspection of each repair station. This inspection is conducted by the FAA Flight Standards district office that maintains a repair station\u2019s certificate. According to FAA\u2019s guidance, the inspection is to cover all aspects of a repair station\u2019s operations, including the currency of technical data, facilities, calibration of special tooling and equipment, and inspection procedures. The inspection is also to ensure that the repair station is performing only work that it has approval to do. While FAA\u2019s guidance does not prescribe precisely how each inspection must be conducted, it provides some direction on how to perform a repair station inspection. It does not require inspectors to follow checklists or other prescribed approaches to conduct the inspection.", "FAA\u2019s guidance requires, at minimum, one maintenance or avionics facility inspection of each repair station per year. Those repair stations with both maintenance and avionics ratings receive at least two facility inspections, one examining maintenance capabilities and the other, avionics functions.", "The standard of one inspection per year has not changed in recent years as air carriers have increased their reliance on repair stations.", "All 2,800 repair stations in the United States and around the world doing work on aircraft flown by FAA-certified air carriers received the inspections FAA\u2019s guidance required in fiscal year 1996, according to officials at FAA headquarters. As partial verification of the FAA officials\u2019 statement, we reviewed FAA\u2019s Program Tracking and Reporting Subsystem (PTRS) data from the 13 FAA offices we visited to determine if the offices had made the facility inspections of the repair stations assigned to them. In all, these 13 offices were responsible for more than 950 inspections at over 750 repair stations working for FAA-certified air carriers. Our analysis of the data confirmed that these minimum inspection requirements were met."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Type of Inspection Varies", "paragraphs": ["How repair stations are inspected varies based on decisions made by both FAA managers and the inspectors themselves. The approach also varies depending on whether the repair station is in the United States or abroad. Moreover, review of some repair stations\u2019 activities is not limited to the annual facility inspection. Each year, FAA selects a few facilities for special, in-depth inspections, which FAA officials stated complement the surveillance conducted by individual inspectors. In the past 4 years, an average of only 23 of these inspections have been conducted at repair stations per year (less than 1 percent of the repair stations performing work for air carriers).", "In practice, most facility inspections of domestic repair stations are conducted by the individual inspectors who have been assigned the oversight responsibility for the repair stations. This approach is FAA\u2019s front line of surveillance of repair stations. The inspectors assigned responsibility for repair stations are also assigned oversight of other aviation activities such as air taxis, agricultural operators, helicopter operators, and training schools for pilots and mechanics. In addition, the inspectors have other duties such as certifying new operators and investigating accidents and incidents.", "In performing routine surveillance, an inspector may make repeated visits to a single facility to complete the inspection because there is too much to accomplish in just one visit. This is particularly true at larger, more complex repair stations. Inspectors responsible for such repair stations told us that they often make multiple visits to complete a single inspection. FAA\u2019s guidance to inspectors also recognizes that because the size of repair stations can vary from a one-person operation to a large overhaul facility, the size and complexity of the facility may warrant the inspection being conducted by a team, rather than by an individual inspector. Some FAA offices do, in fact, assign teams to inspect some facilities.", "Like domestic repair stations, foreign repair stations are inspected every year. Unlike domestic repair stations, however, foreign repair stations must renew their certification with FAA at least every 2 years. The renewal inspection assesses whether the foreign repair station continues to meet Federal Aviation Regulations and fulfills FAA\u2019s requirement for an annual facility inspection. The renewal inspection and the facility inspection cover the same aspects of repair station operations, according to FAA officials and inspectors with both domestic and foreign oversight experience. Like the facility inspection, the renewal inspection can be performed by an individual or by a team of inspectors. In the six offices we visited with responsibility for the oversight of foreign repair stations, both types of inspections were generally conducted by teams, particularly at larger repair stations.", "Each year, FAA does special, in-depth inspections at a small portion of the repair stations in the United States and abroad through its National Aviation Safety Inspection Program (NASIP) or its Regional Aviation Inspection Program (RASIP). FAA determines which facilities should receive additional oversight through these comprehensive reviews, selecting them on the basis of submissions from district and regional offices. In general, inspectors recommend, through their offices, facilities for special inspections based on inspection results or other reasons such as the size and complexity of operations. Although FAA\u2019s emphasis has been on in-depth inspections of air carriers, repair stations have been part of the special inspection effort. In fiscal years 1993 through 1996, FAA conducted 428 special, in-depth inspections, 92 (or 21 percent) of which were of repair stations. Unlike the facility or renewal inspections, special inspections are performed by teams of inspectors that are independent of the district offices that have oversight responsibility for the carriers or facilities being inspected."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Team Inspections Provide More Detailed Review Than Those Conducted by Individual Inspectors", "paragraphs": ["Individual inspectors generally identify far fewer deficiencies than teams do. Although most repair stations are not inspected by both individuals and teams, at the FAA offices we reviewed, 16 repair stations routinely inspected by individuals were also inspected by one or more special teams during fiscal years 1993 through 1996. These teams found a total of 347 deficiencies, of which only 15 (or 4 percent) had been identified by the individual inspectors in the 12 to 18 months prior to the special facility inspections.", "Because many of the deficiencies relate to work on specific aircraft or components, and because aircraft or components at a repair station vary from day to day, some variation in inspection findings is to be expected. However, a close look at the results suggests that individual inspectors, even when they make multiple visits to repair stations, may not identify many of the deficiencies that teams find. The special inspections we reviewed turned up many systemic deficiencies, such as problems with training or quality assurance, that appeared to be long-standing and that therefore could have been detected in earlier inspections. For example, a team conducting a special inspection found that a repair station\u2019s manual contained procedures for aircraft fuel servicing and fuel tank maintenance that may have been counter to the policies of the air carriers for which the work was done. The individual inspector, who had visited this repair station many times in the previous 18 months had not reported this problem.", "Often, the deficiencies identified in the special inspections but not in the regular inspections were significant. The findings of special inspections are categorized as (1) violations of Federal Aviation Regulations, (2) violations of the repair stations\u2019 FAA-approved repair station manuals, or (3) lack of systems to ensure continuing compliance. Of the deficiencies reported in the 19 special inspections on 16 repair stations we reviewed, one-third involved violations of FAA regulations (see fig. 2.1). For example, an inspection team found that a repair station was not segregating new and serviceable parts from those parts that were not serviceable. In another case, a repair station on three occasions approved an aircraft for return to service following a major repair that, according to the inspector\u2019s report, was not completed \u201cbased on FAA-approved technical data.\u201d", "Violations of a repair station\u2019s approved manual also accounted for about one-third of the deficiencies. For example, one team found a repair station did not inspect subcontracted work in accordance with its manual. A floor mechanic was performing these inspections, rather than the quality control inspector.", "We contacted 13 inspectors responsible for the repair stations covered by the 19 special inspection reports to obtain their views on why the special inspections found so many more deficiencies, including ones that appeared to be long-standing. They said the pressure of other duties kept their individual reviews from being more comprehensive. For example, one inspector was responsible for 7 other repair stations, 11 air taxi operators, 3 helicopter and agricultural operators, 11 executive aircraft, and more than 30 airmen. In addition, while they were at the repair stations, inspectors had to deal with employees\u2019 questions or concerns about matters unrelated to the inspections. All 13 inspectors said that for reasons such as these, an individual inspector has a greater chance of not identifying deficiencies, even after repeated visits."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Attributes of Quality Inspections More Prevalent in Team Inspections Than in Individual Inspections", "paragraphs": ["The quality of repair station inspections is important because surveillance is one of FAA\u2019s primary means for ensuring that repair stations continually meet Federal Aviation Regulations. FAA\u2019s guidance to inspectors states that if surveillance is to meet its intended purpose, quality inspections are essential. We developed four characteristics of a quality inspection based on our initial discussions with FAA officials and inspectors, staff from the U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s Office of the Inspector General who were involved with repair station work, Department of Defense officials responsible for audits of carriers with contracts for transporting military personnel, and airline quality assurance officials. These four characteristics, explained in table 2.1, are independence, comprehensiveness, focus, and standardization. In subsequent discussions, FAA officials and inspectors agreed that a quality inspection should have these four characteristics.", "The size and complexity of many large repair stations are such that an individual inspector may have difficulty maintaining these quality characteristics.

Many of the inspectors responding to our survey indicated that their ability to conduct a quality inspection was affected by factors related to comprehensiveness (see fig. 2.2). For example, 75 percent of the respondents said having too many inspection duties affected their ability to conduct comprehensive inspections to some degree, with 43 percent saying it was a major reason for the problem. (For a more detailed breakdown of the survey results for these and other survey topics, see app. III.) In addition, inspectors we spoke with at field offices said that it was very difficult to cover everything at a large or complex repair station. For example, one inspector said the week he spends at a large engine repair station is not enough time to complete a facility inspection. The size of the repair station and the complexity of the work being done, he said, makes it difficult to ensure that he is making a comprehensive inspection.", "In a team inspection, completing a portion of an inspection is the only duty of each team member. An inspector conducting an inspection alone faces work demands from other locations as well as divided responsibilities at the repair station being inspected. Inspectors\u2019 responses to our survey also reflected concerns about their ability to focus sufficiently during inspections (see fig. 2.3). For example, 80 percent of the inspectors responding indicated that spending time on other duties had an effect on the quality of the inspections they performed. For example, during our interviews, inspectors said they needed to spend time during inspection visits answering questions or clarifying regulations for repair station employees. They said such duties were part of their job, but some noted that these conflicting demands can interfere with their ability to focus on the inspection they are trying to conduct.", "Inspection results can be more useful to inspectors and FAA if there is assurance that all areas have been adequately covered. If all areas are covered, inspectors have greater assurance that the repair station complies with regulations. Checklists or other similar job aids are one way to provide this assurance and to do so in a structured, consistent manner. A checklist or similar job aid for repair station inspections would include all areas that inspectors must review as part of the inspection as well as how the regulations governing repair station activities relate to these areas. At present, however, FAA does not require the use of a checklist during a repair station inspection.", "We found evidence from a number of sources that the use of an effective checklist plays an important role in a thorough inspection. Officials from FAA, industry, and the Department of Defense (which reviews air carriers before awarding defense contracts) told us that they would question the comprehensiveness of any facility inspection of a repair station that was not done using a job aid or checklist. Air carriers and the Department of Defense reported that their own inspectors use such aids to guide their work. They said the scope of the inspection of many repair stations is large enough that it is not difficult to overlook a portion of what must be covered.", "While FAA does not require the use of a checklist or job aid for routine surveillance, teams, whether conducting routine or special inspections, are more likely than individual inspectors to use checklists or other job aids that help ensure that all areas are covered, based on our observations. We found that during team inspections, team members use the same structured approach, typically in the form of an inspection job aid or checklist, such as the NASIP checklist. For example, one overseas office that conducts its inspections with in-house teams has a job aid covering each portion of the inspection. By contrast, we found that the approaches used by inspectors conducting their own inspections varied greatly, and individual inspectors were less likely to use checklists or other job aids to ensure that all areas had been covered. For example, while one inspector showed us a detailed checklist he developed combining guidance from the Airworthiness Inspector\u2019s Handbook with the regulations applicable to repair stations, others said they do not use any job aid and work instead from memory when inspecting repair stations.", "We also found that when individual inspectors use a checklist, they tend to use one that is not detailed enough to ensure that compliance with regulations is checked. FAA\u2019s standard, most commonly used job aid, which is available to inspectors through the Flight Standards Automated System, is not directly tied to the standards that repair stations must meet. Although it lists items to review, it does not provide references to the regulations governing repair stations. By contrast, the checklist used during NASIP inspections provides this link, as do the checklists and job aids the aviation industry uses to evaluate repair stations. Officials at the regional and office levels have indicated that knowing how an inspection finding relates to the regulations is important for pursuing enforcement action when a violation is identified. We found one office that requires all inspectors to use a job aid tied to the regulations. The office manager said that by having all inspectors use a standardized approach, he has greater assurance that effective and comprehensive inspections are being performed and that repair stations are in compliance with regulations.", "We asked FAA headquarters officials what they thought of encouraging inspectors to make greater use of checklists and other job aids. They said that guidance and job task lists provided to inspectors encourage the development of good work processes by each inspector without removing the flexibility required for them to evaluate a repair station\u2019s compliance. However, the greater use of checklists or other job aids to help ensure that comprehensive inspections are being performed could be instituted in a way that does not diminish the inspectors\u2019 flexibility.

Their approaches hold promise both for making more efficient use of inspection staff and for improving the quality of surveillance. FAA headquarters officials support these efforts but will evaluate them before asking other offices to examine such an approach. We think it is appropriate for all district offices, especially those with high concentrations of repair stations, to reevaluate their organization and surveillance approach to determine if they can make better use of their current inspection resources. For example, an office may determine that local team inspections are appropriate and a good use of resources for repair stations that are large, complex, or have higher rates of noncompliance.", "An analysis of the widely varying inspection approaches also highlights the importance of a standardized checklist or other effective job aid in ensuring that inspections are comprehensive.

The inspectors attributed this quicker compliance to the renewal requirement for foreign repair stations. Under FAA regulations, foreign repair stations must renew their certificates within 12 months of initial issuance and then at least every 24 months thereafter. By comparison, domestic repair stations retain their certificates indefinitely unless their operations are so badly run that FAA elects to take legal action to suspend or revoke their certificates. According to some inspectors, because new certificates cannot be issued until problems are resolved, foreign repair stations have an incentive to correct problems more quickly. Because of the poor documentation of the inspection results for domestic repair stations, however, we were unable to validate the inspectors\u2019 views or to verify whether foreign repair stations achieve compliance in a more timely fashion than domestic repair stations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Opinions Vary on Advisability of Extending Renewal Requirement to Domestic Repair Stations", "paragraphs": ["Within FAA, the strongest support for extending the certificate renewal requirement to domestic repair stations comes from inspectors who have inspected both foreign and domestic repair stations. They solidly supported extending renewal to domestic repair stations to gain quicker resolution of noncompliance issues. Of the inspectors responding to our mail survey who had experience with foreign repair stations in fiscal year 1996, 89 percent supported extending the requirement. Similarly, 31 of the 34 inspectors we interviewed who had inspected both kinds of repair stations said they favored a domestic renewal requirement. In our discussions with inspectors, we were told that the lack of a renewal requirement makes inspectors less efficient because they must spend more time following up on repair stations with deficiencies and less time on much needed surveillance or other responsibilities. A specific deadline for correcting deficiencies to retain certification creates an incentive or sense of urgency to resolve deficiencies in a timely manner.", "Inspectors with experience only with domestic repair stations were somewhat less favorable toward certificate renewal. Our survey results show that 48 percent of the respondents who had experience only with domestic repair stations in fiscal year 1996 were not in favor of renewing domestic repair station certificates on a regular basis (for example, every 24 months) as a way to improve compliance. Our follow-up discussions with 39 inspectors who had experience only with domestic repair stations identified their reason for opposing such a requirement was a concern that substantially more work would be generated. However, this perception appears to be unfounded. The 34 inspectors we interviewed who had inspected both kinds of repair stations indicated that extending the requirement would not place additional requirements on inspectors. These inspectors said inspection requirements for renewal were the same as those for the annual facility inspection.", "Support for extending the renewal requirement was lowest among FAA management. They did not agree with inspectors who said that renewal would improve safety by obtaining quicker resolution of noncompliance problems. The Acting Manager of the Aircraft Maintenance Division said, for example, \u201cNo one has demonstrated that FAA would get one added ounce of safety if it revised the rule to require recertification of domestic repair stations.\u201d They also raised several concerns about adopting this approach.", "Additional resources would be needed. According to the Acting Manager of the Aircraft Maintenance Division, it would take too many resources (staff time, etc.) to recertify every repair station. We pointed out that according to inspectors who had done both facility and renewal inspections, the requirements were the same. For the most part, he did not provide us with further information about what additional resources would be needed if the recertification requirement were extended. FAA attorneys, however, said they would need additional resources to process any cases stemming from the denial of recertification.", "Current procedures already allow certificates to be revoked. The current enforcement process utilizes a range of enforcement actions\u2014from educational and remedial to punitive legal enforcement remedies, including fines and criminal sanctions in the most serious cases. When FAA determines that an immediate need exists to protect public safety, it can issue an emergency order revoking or suspending a certificate. However, although revoking a domestic repair station\u2019s certificate is a possibility if the facility remains out of compliance, it is a time-consuming process that can often take years. In a forthcoming GAO report on FAA enforcement actions, we analyzed all 2,200 certificate actions (this figure includes airlines, repair stations, pilots, etc.) taken during fiscal year 1996 and found that it took an average of 13 months to close an enforcement case. Our point is not that a sizeable number of repair stations have such serious deficiencies that FAA should undertake enforcement actions. Rather, it is that certificate renewal appears to operate as a sort of \u201cgate\u201d that helps ensure that repair stations quickly fix their problems, big or small, thus helping to bring their operations up to the quality intended by Federal Aviation Regulations.", "Due process could be a concern. A headquarters official said that if FAA allows an inspector to make the decision about whether a repair station keeps or loses its certificate, it could infringe on the due process requirements afforded domestic repair station operators. However, according to FAA attorneys, due process would not be a concern. The manager of the FAA Airworthiness Law Branch explained that as currently is the case with foreign repair stations, the final decision not to renew a certificate would rest with the Administrator. The same due process rights accorded to foreign repair stations would apply to domestic repair stations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Our audit work and recent work by the Department of Transportation\u2019s Inspector General have identified continuing problems with the documentation of inspections and the quality of data entered into the Program Tracking and Reporting Subsystem, FAA\u2019s tracking system. FAA\u2019s guidance is very limited in specifying what documentation offices should keep. As a result, the documentation contained in the files on domestic repair stations, which acts as the official record of dealings between FAA and repair stations, did not contain sufficient data for us to determine how quickly and completely deficiencies found during inspections were being corrected. While FAA\u2019s computer-based tracking system gives the agency means for overseeing the inspection program, problems with the quality of its data could jeopardize the reliability of FAA\u2019s new computerized system, the Safety Performance Analysis System, in determining when to target greater inspection resources to repair stations that warrant more intensive oversight than others. In previous reports, we have recommended that FAA develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to improve the quality of all data used in its databases. Until FAA completes the implementation of this strategy, the extent and the impact of the problems with the quality of the system\u2019s data will remain unclear.", "Data problems notwithstanding, there is some anecdotal evidence that foreign repair stations may have greater incentive than domestic repair stations to quickly fix deficiencies found during inspections because foreign repair stations are faced with a certificate renewal requirement and domestic repair stations are not. However, we were unable to verify this because of FAA\u2019s poor documentation, particularly for domestic repair stations. Quick correction of all problems, large or small, helps to ensure better repair station operations, and having to do less follow-up to determine whether repair stations have taken corrective action frees FAA inspectors to conduct other work. Views within FAA vary widely as to whether a certificate renewal requirement, which appears to be at the heart of quicker compliance, should be extended to domestic repair stations.

FAA is responsible for ensuring that repair stations comply with regulations; air carriers are responsible for ensuring that repair stations perform maintenance in accordance with the air carriers\u2019 manuals. The six initiatives were issued because FAA identified problems in the way some air carriers provided oversight of repair stations, according to FAA\u2019s Deputy Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification. Accordingly, FAA\u2019s initiatives focus on strengthening the oversight role of air carriers, not on modifying FAA\u2019s own approach to inspecting repair stations and ensuring that corrective action is taken.", "The six initiatives involve actions to be taken by the air carriers or by FAA inspectors overseeing air carriers (see fig. 4.1). Collectively, these initiatives require that (1) air carriers demonstrate regulatory compliance for each of their contract facilities doing substantial heavy maintenance or repairs; (2) FAA ensure that air carriers list all contractors performing substantial maintenance for them; and (3) air carriers audit repair stations they want to begin using. They also call for additional review by FAA inspectors\u2014mainly those inspectors who oversee air carriers.", "Because these initiatives were directed at air carriers, they had little or no effect on FAA\u2019s direct oversight of repair stations.

In July 1996, FAA headquarters issued the National Flight Standards Work Program Guidelines. These guidelines stated that air carriers would be required to demonstrate that programs at each major repair station complied with regulations. The guidelines required air carriers to list all repair stations performing substantial heavy maintenance in their operations specifications.", "For the FAA inspectors whose duties involve monitoring the air carriers (as opposed to monitoring the repair stations themselves), the guidelines stressed the importance of careful oversight but did not require specific actions on the inspectors\u2019 part. FAA headquarters officials said the guidelines left it to inspectors to decide whether to place more emphasis on the surveillance of repair stations as part of their oversight of air carriers. Matters in the guidance for inspectors to consider in making their decisions included a particular FAA office\u2019s work demands and the complexities or problem areas of the repair stations involved. Inspectors overseeing air carriers told us these initiatives have increased their awareness of the need to oversee repair stations working for air carriers, but inspectors overseeing repair stations told us the initiatives had not changed their oversight activities.", "FAA augmented the guidelines a month later with a handbook bulletin that provided more specific guidance for the last two initiatives shown in figure 4.1. The handbook bulletin defined \u201csubstantial maintenance\u201d for air carriers, thereby clarifying which repair stations needed to be included on an air carrier\u2019s operations specifications or audited by an air carrier prior to adding them to the list. The handbook bulletin\u2019s more specific guidance on these matters was as follows:", "To implement the initiative that all repair stations performing significant maintenance be listed, FAA inspectors were to list, by October 1, 1996, the repair stations that performed substantial maintenance, ensure that each repair station had had a current audit, include the repair stations as part of the operations specifications, and update FAA\u2019s Vital Information Subsystem database with the new operation specification information.", "To implement the initiative that air carriers conduct audits of any repair stations added to the list, FAA inspectors were to ensure, effective September 1, 1996, that air carriers audit any new maintenance repair station they want to add to their operations specifications. The audits\u2019 purpose was to ensure that the repair stations are capable of performing the contracted work in accordance with the carriers\u2019 approved programs. Under the handbook\u2019s procedures, FAA must also review and accept the audit before an air carrier can use the contractor.", "FAA officials told us about 150 air carriers needed to comply with the bulletin by identifying the repair stations performing substantial maintenance for them. The officials said all of the carriers had complied by late September or early October 1996. Subsequent to that, air carriers have added other repair stations to their operations specifications after having their audits of the repair stations approved by FAA inspectors. For example, one air carrier recently added two repair stations to its operations specifications after the FAA inspector reviewed and approved both repair station audits. In contrast, another FAA inspector responsible for an air carrier denied use of two new repair stations when he found deficiencies in the audit reports for both repair stations.", "FAA officials stated that the review of air carriers\u2019 audits of repair stations is something the inspectors will be doing on an ongoing basis. Any time an air carrier wants to add a repair station that does substantial maintenance, the carrier must audit the repair station and the principal maintenance inspector for that air carrier will need to accept the audit before the repair station can be used.

Aircraft, power plants, maintenance, alteration concepts, and technology have progressed substantially in the last three decades. However, very few substantive changes have been made to the regulations since 1962. Portions of the regulations are no longer appropriate or have become increasingly difficult to administer, while some other portions no longer make a significant contribution to aviation safety. As a result, FAA has had to grant exemptions and create special administrative procedures to handle situations not provided for adequately in the regulations.", "In 1975, FAA and industry officials recommended revising substantial requirements of the repair station regulations. According to FAA, minor amendments to the regulations were subsequently adopted, but no major revision was made. In 1989, in light of public meetings that were part of its regulatory review, FAA decided to revise the regulations completely. However, it has taken 8 years to prepare the revisions, FAA officials said. They attributed the delays to the project being preempted by other rulemaking and policy projects.", "FAA hopes to begin implementing revised regulations in the coming months. It has prepared revised regulations, and headquarters officials told us the revisions are now being reviewed by the Department of Transportation and the Office of Management and Budget. Officials did not know when the revisions would be published for comment in the Federal Register. FAA had established a target of summer 1997 for publishing these revisions, but this target was not met. FAA will consider the comments received before taking action on the proposed revisions. The Deputy Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification anticipated that FAA would receive voluminous comments, necessitating considerable time for review and response.", "FAA headquarters officials outlined several things they hoped to accomplish with the proposed regulations. First, they are proposing that domestic repair stations be required to have a quality control system that is based on the Joint Aviation Authorities\u2019 (JAA) system. Second, the proposed regulations simplify the repair station rating system and make the ratings less confusing than the existing system. Third, the proposed regulations impose training requirements for entry-level personnel. Existing regulations do not require that entry-level personnel be trained. They require only that repair stations use practical tests or employment records to determine the abilities of uncertified employees. Finally, the proposed regulations make repair stations responsible for controlling and evaluating their vendors. Existing regulations do not require that repair stations evaluate their subcontractors or vendors. They require only that repair stations have a method of inspecting incoming material to ensure that it is free from apparent defects or malfunctions. FAA attorneys noted that the proposed rule will remove the distinction between most domestic and foreign repair stations.", "There are indications that some in the repair station industry may oppose many of these changes. For example, the National Air Transportation Association, an industry association, stated that it expects that the proposed regulations will require new training programs, additional record-keeping requirements, and the implementation of quality assurance systems like the air carriers\u2019 quality assurance systems. This, the association predicts, will increase repair station costs, causing as many as a third of them to turn in their repair station certificates. The association contends that the anticipated proposed regulations will \u201ccripple the maintenance industry,\u201d and it plans to fight them. This opposition indicates that completing the rulemaking process may take a significant amount of time.", "The importance of completing this project can be seen in inspectors\u2019 responses to our survey. As figure 4.2 shows, most inspectors believe that various changes in the regulations would help them carry out their inspection duties. Of the inspectors we surveyed, most (88 percent) favored updating the regulations as a way to improve repair station regulatory compliance. In particular, most inspectors (77 percent) favored changes to require repair stations to notify FAA of the names of air carriers for which they do work. Most inspectors (78 percent) also favored changing regulations to require air carriers to provide their manuals or procedures along with the parts to be repaired by repair stations.", "Inspectors provided examples of why revised regulations are needed. One inspector said the regulations do not address new repair techniques such as nondestructive testing and repair of composite materials, which means that the inspector must evaluate a repair station\u2019s practices using his or her own judgment.

FAA\u2019s approved budget for fiscal year 1995 authorized 201 additional inspectors; for fiscal year 1996, 237 additional inspectors, and for fiscal year 1997, 300 additional inspectors.

FAA\u2019s current qualifications for entry-level inspectors require maintenance experience in a repair station, air carrier facility, or military repair facility, and 3 years of supervisory experience. The manager of the Human Resources Program Branch told us FAA requires that inspectors have 3 years of supervisory experience because they must be able to communicate orally and in writing with mechanics, engineers, and managers.

We and others have reported for several years that FAA\u2019s aviation safety inspectors are not receiving needed training. Most recently, in October 1996 we issued a report recommending that FAA evaluate the impact of recent budget reductions on critical safety-related functions, including training, and report the results to the Congress through the appropriations process. FAA inspectors\u2019 responses to our survey indicate that most inspectors continue to be concerned about the need for improved training. Specifically, 82 percent of the inspectors surveyed said they strongly or generally favored providing inspectors with maintenance and avionics training, including hands-on training, as a way to improve repair stations\u2019 compliance with regulations. Over three-quarters of the inspectors (80 percent) favored more training on inspection skills. Additionally, 45 percent said that the inability to get needed training is at least a minor reason why inspectors are not able to ensure repair stations\u2019 compliance with all aspects of the regulations. These results add support for our 1996 recommendation.", "Inspectors also expressed their concern about inadequate training in written comments on our survey forms. For example, one inspector stated that inspectors need specific training on aircraft and systems. Another inspector wrote, \u201cI have completed FAA repair station certification and surveillance course; however, that course does not educate in the procedures for overhaul.
