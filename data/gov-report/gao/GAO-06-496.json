Only half the states are including all participants, as required, in the performance data they submit to Labor--states were more likely to report participants who received training than those who received other benefits and services but not training. In addition, many states are not using all available data sources to determine participants' employment outcomes. This may result in lower reported outcomes because states may be inaccurately recording some workers as unemployed who actually have jobs. To compile their performance data, some states are using manual processes or automated systems that lack key capabilities to help minimizes errors, but many states have plans to improve their systems' capabilities. Labor reports data on TAA activity levels, services provided to TAA participants, and key performance measures. The performance data may be useful for providing a long-term national picture of program outcomes, but it represents participants who left the program up to 30 months earlier and, thus, is not useful for gauging the TAA program's current performance. Also, the performance information is not displayed using categories that would be informative to policymakers, such as type of service received and industry of dislocation. Most states find the performance information they receive from Labor to be at least moderately useful, but many want more information. Labor has taken steps to improve the quality of TAA performance data, but issues remain. In 2003, Labor began requiring states to validate their data, and most states reported that this increased awareness of data quality at the state and local level. However, the validation process does not address the problem of participants being excluded from the performance data. In fiscal year 2006, Labor instituted a set of common measures, and many states reported they are experiencing delays in implementing all required changes. States also expressed interest in receiving more opportunities to share lessons learned on topics relevant to TAA data quality."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["More than 150,000 manufacturing workers lost their jobs in fiscal year  2004 due to international trade. Most of these workers were eligible for  services under the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program, the  primary federal employment and training program serving trade-affected  workers. TAA, funded at about $1 billion in fiscal year 2005, provides  workers with a variety of services, including training and income support  after they exhaust their Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefits. The U.S.  Department of Labor (Labor) oversees the program, and states and local  areas administer services to TAA participants. Despite the role the TAA  program plays in helping trade-affected workers transition to new  employment, program outcomes have shown mixed results. Labor collects  some key performance information from states and uses it to track  program performance against three national goals in the areas of  employment, job retention, and wages. Since 2001, the TAA program has  exceeded the national goal for job retention in every year but one.  However, it has failed to meet at least one of the national goals each year,  and in fiscal year 2003, the program failed to meet all three. Further, the  Program Assessment Rating Tool (PART)\u2014a diagnostic tool that the  Administration uses to help formulate the budget\u2014rated the program  ineffective, in part because it failed to meet its national goals. It is unclear,  though, whether the outcomes reported in the goals accurately reflect the  program\u2019s achievements. Our previous work and work by Labor\u2019s  Inspector General have identified problems with the performance data  states submitted to Labor\u2014information was often incomplete, and many  states did not validate the information they reported to Labor.

In addition, to  gather in-depth information about how states manage their TAA  performance data, we conducted site visits in California, Iowa, Ohio,  Texas, and Virginia, where we interviewed state officials and visited at  least one local area in each state. We selected these states because they  represent different TAA data collection approaches (that is, states where  data are entered into information technology  systems at the local level  and those where data are entered at the state level), received a relatively  large share of TAA funds in fiscal year 2005, and are geographically  dispersed. In addition, to gather insights into data management strategies  and requirements, we interviewed Labor officials in headquarters and in  the regional offices and experts on data quality. We also reviewed  legislation, guidance, summaries of state TAA performance outcome  information, participant data submitted by states to Labor, and other  relevant reports and literature related to data quality.

Labor certifies  groups of laid-off workers as potentially eligible for TAA benefits and  services by investigating petitions that are filed on the workers\u2019 behalf.  Workers are eligible for TAA if they were laid off as a result of  international trade and were involved in making a product or supplying  component parts to or performing finishing work for directly affected  firms. Workers served by the TAA program have generally been laid off  from the manufacturing sector.", "Congress has amended the TAA program a number of times since its  inception. For example, in 1974 Congress eased program eligibility  requirements, and in 1988 Congress added a requirement that workers be  in training to receive income support. In 1993 Congress created a separate  North American Free Trade Agreement Transitional Adjustment  Assistance (NAFTA-TAA) program specifically for workers laid off  because of trade with Canada or Mexico. The most recent amendments to  the TAA program were included in the TAA Reform Act of 2002   (Pub. L. No. 107-210), which was signed into law in August 2002.

The TAA statute  lays out certain basic requirements that all certified petitions must meet,  including that a significant proportion of workers employed by a company  be laid off or threatened with layoff. In addition to meeting these basic  requirements, a petition must demonstrate that the layoff is related to  international trade. The law requires Labor to complete its investigation,  and either certify or deny the petition, within 40 days after it has received  it.

Seven states use only their  own states\u2019 UI wage records to determine participants\u2019 employment  outcomes.

These funds are used to cover all the administrative activities of  the program, such as reviewing waivers and training plans, processing  applications for job search or relocation allowances, and any associated  data collection and reporting. Some states also use these funds for direct  case management services to participants because they are the only TAA  funds available to provide these services.

These measures may be useful for assessing how well the program  is meeting its long-range goals to increase the employment,  retention, and earnings of participants. However, the use of these  measures requires states to wait from one to three quarters after  participants exit the TAA program before measuring the outcomes.  For example, although states record whether participants entered  employment in the first quarter after exit, two more quarters must  elapse before employment retention is measured. Participants who  exit the TAA program have their outcomes assessed in the first,  second, and third quarters after exit.
