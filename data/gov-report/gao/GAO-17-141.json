For example, NNSA's feasibility assessment includes a list of implementation concerns\u2014including general concerns related to the availability of resources and to identifying and implementing an information technology solution\u2014but does not provide any specific information regarding these concerns. In addition, NNSA's plan includes a cost estimate of between $10 million and $70 million but provides no details on how the estimate was developed beyond stating that it is based on professional judgment and input from NNSA's contractors. The plan also includes a \u201cnotional\u201d implementation timeline that calls for the plan's core elements to be completed in 3 to 5 years but does not include details on which elements are considered core elements.", "NNSA's financial integration plan does not fully incorporate leading strategic planning practices, which limits its usefulness as a planning tool as well as the effectiveness of NNSA's effort to provide meaningful financial information to Congress and other stakeholders. As GAO has reported previously, in developing plans for implementing new initiatives, agencies can benefit from following leading practices for strategic planning. These leading practices include (1) defining the missions and goals of a program or initiative, (2) defining strategies and identifying resources needed to achieve goals, (3) ensuring leadership involvement, and (4) involving stakeholders in planning. However, NNSA's plan does not fully incorporate any of these leading practices. For example, beyond the high-level cost estimate provided, NNSA's plan does not include a description of the specific resources needed to meet specific elements of the plan or define strategies that address management challenges, including the implementation concerns identified in the plan's feasibility assessment. In addition, NNSA did not involve key stakeholders in developing its plan. Because NNSA's plan does not incorporate leading strategic planning practices, it has not provided a useful road map for guiding NNSA's effort. NNSA officials told GAO that the plan they submitted to Congress was never intended to provide a road map to guide their efforts. Instead, they said the purpose of the plan was to identify general principles and a strategic vision for achieving financial integration. The NNSA official responsible for overseeing the plan's execution told GAO, he has begun to develop a more comprehensive and actionable plan to guide NNSA's effort. However, it is unclear when the new plan will be finalized or the extent to which it will incorporate leading practices. Until a plan is in place that incorporates leading strategic planning practices, NNSA cannot be assured that its efforts will result in a cost collection tool that produces reliable enterprise-wide information that satisfies the needs of Congress and program managers. Such information would better position NNSA to address long-standing contract and project management challenges.

NNSA is responsible for activities in pursuit of these missions,  which are largely executed at eight government-owned, contractor- operated sites that comprise the nuclear security enterprise. Since 1990,  however, DOE\u2019s management of contracts and projects, including those  executed by NNSA, has been on our list of areas at high risk for fraud,  waste, abuse, and mismanagement. As we have reported over the past  several years, NNSA\u2019s efforts to modernize the nuclear security  enterprise continue to involve cost overruns, schedule delays, and  problems with contract management and oversight. Effective  management and oversight of the contracts, projects, and programs that  support NNSA\u2019s mission are dependent upon the availability of reliable  enterprise-wide management information. Such information is needed to,  among other things, prepare budget requests, identify the costs of  activities, and ensure the validity of cost estimates. Accurate and reliable  information on costs is also needed by Congress so it can carry out its  oversight responsibilities and make budgetary decisions.", "As we have reported previously, however, NNSA and Congress have had  difficulty understanding and comparing costs across programs,  contractors, and sites because NNSA\u2019s contractors use different methods  of accounting for and tracking costs. For example, in 2010 we found that  NNSA could not accurately identify the total costs to operate and maintain  weapons facilities and infrastructure because of differences in sites\u2019 cost  accounting practices. Specifically, our analysis of sites\u2019 responses to a  data collection instrument showed that the total cost to operate and  maintain weapons facilities and infrastructure likely significantly exceeded  the budget request submitted to Congress for fiscal year 2009 for  Readiness in Technical Base and Facilities\u2014the program responsible for  providing the underlying physical infrastructure and operational readiness  for the nuclear security enterprise. We recommended that the  Administrator of NNSA develop guidance for contractors to consistently  collect information on the total costs to operate and maintain weapons  activities facilities. In response to our recommendation, NNSA developed  a tool to collect more consistent cost information. In 2013, however, we  found that NNSA was uncertain how it would use the data gathered by its  new cost collection tool and that data collected were reported at an  aggregate level and were not useful for comparing detailed costs across  contractors. We recommended, among other things, that NNSA clarify  the uses of the data gathered through its cost collection tool. Although  NNSA agreed to address our recommendation, NNSA officials have since  concluded that the cost collection tool is not capable of providing  enterprise-wide information in the way that NNSA had hoped.", "Because the cost of activities at different NNSA sites cannot be easily  compared and analyzed, it can be challenging for Congress to determine  if NNSA is operating in an efficient, cost-effective manner and thereby to  provide effective oversight. To address this issue, section 3128 of the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014 required NNSA  to develop and submit to Congress a plan for improving and integrating  financial management of the nuclear security enterprise, including  reporting program and project costs consistently, by no later than  December 26, 2014. On February 8, 2016, more than 13 months after the statutory reporting deadline, NNSA submitted its Plan for  Improvement and Integration of Financial Management of the Nuclear  Security Enterprise.

This report evaluates the extent to which NNSA\u2019s plan (1)  addresses the objectives of the act and (2) follows leading practices for  strategic planning.", "To determine the extent to which NNSA\u2019s plan addresses the objectives  of the act, we analyzed the statutory reporting requirements and  compared these with the information contained in the plan NNSA  provided to Congress in February 2016. To determine the extent to which  NNSA\u2019s plan follows leading practices for strategic planning, we reviewed  information contained in NNSA\u2019s financial integration plan and compared  it with leading practices in federal strategic planning, including practices  such as involving stakeholders in the development of mission, goals, and  strategies and developing strategies to address challenges that may  threaten an agency\u2019s ability to achieve its goal. We also interviewed  NNSA officials in charge of developing and implementing the plan. In  addition, we interviewed a non-generalizable sample of NNSA and  contractor officials representing various program offices and sites to learn  about (1) the extent to which they had a role in developing NNSA\u2019s  financial integration plan and (2) the current condition of cost collection,  including what systems are used to collect costs, what costs are  collected, and how they are collected. We selected our sample from the  program offices with the highest of fiscal year 2015 enacted  appropriations. We also interviewed officials from the Department of  Defense\u2019s Office of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation regarding  their experience in studying efforts to collect comparable contractor costs  at NNSA. We analyzed NNSA program offices\u2019 documentation on  systems the program offices were developing to collect common cost  reporting data and reviewed our and the DOE Inspector General\u2019s reports  on cost comparability at NNSA.

In general, federal Cost Accounting Standards govern  how federal contractors, including NNSA\u2019s contractors account for costs.  Federal Cost Accounting Standards provide direction for the consistent  and equitable distribution of contractors\u2019 costs to help federal agencies  more accurately determine the actual costs of their contracts, projects,  and programs. In particular, these standards establish requirements for  the measurement, assignment, and allocation of costs to government  contracts and provide criteria for the classification and allocation of  indirect costs.", "To allocate costs to programs, contractors are to classify costs as either  direct or indirect. Direct costs, are assigned to the benefitting program or  programs. Indirect costs\u2014those costs that cannot be assigned to a  particular program such as costs for administration and site support\u2014are  to be accumulated, or grouped, into indirect cost pools. The contractor is  to estimate the amount of indirect costs (accumulated into indirect cost  pools) that will need to be distributed to each program and adjust the  costs to actual costs by the end of the fiscal year. The contractor then is  to distribute these costs based on a rate in accordance with the cost  allocation model. The final program cost is the sum of the total direct  costs plus the indirect costs distributed to the program.", "In implementing this allocation process, federal Cost Accounting  Standards provide contractors with flexibility regarding the extent to which  they identify incurred costs directly with a specific program and how they  collect similar costs into indirect cost pools and allocate them among  programs. Therefore, similar costs may be allocated differently because  contractors\u2019 cost allocation models differ. Specifically, cost models may  differ in how they (1) classify costs as either direct or indirect, (2)  accumulate these costs into indirect cost pools, and (3) distribute indirect  costs to benefitting programs. Examples follow:", "Classification. Contractors may differ in how they classify costs as  direct or indirect. For example, electricity and other utility costs are  usually classified as indirect because they are not associated with a  single program; however, electricity costs could be charged directly if,  for example, a contractor installs a meter to track the electricity  consumption in a building used solely by one program.", "Accumulation. Contractors may differ in how they accumulate indirect  costs into indirect-cost pools. The number and type of cost pools used  to accumulate indirect costs may vary.", "Distribution. Management and Operating (M&O) contractors may  differ in how they distribute indirect costs accumulated into indirect- cost pools to programs.", "Because similar indirect costs can be allocated differently by different  contractors and contractors may change the way they allocate indirect  costs over time, it is difficult to compare contractor costs among sites.", "NNSA contractors also use different methods to track costs, according to  NNSA officials. Specifically, NNSA contractors use different work  breakdown structures (WBS) for tracking costs. A WBS is a method of  deconstructing a program\u2019s end product into successive levels (of detail)  with smaller specific elements until the work is subdivided to a level  suitable for management control. Within WBSs, cost elements capture  discrete costs of a particular activity of work, such as labor, material, and  fringe benefits. The use of different methods to track cost makes it difficult  for NNSA and others to understand or compare costs for comparable  activities across programs, contractors, and sites. For example, in 2011  we concluded that the cost savings that NNSA anticipated from the  consolidation of the M&O contracts for two of its production sites were  uncertain, in part, because historic cost data were not readily available for  NNSA to use in its cost analysis. More specifically, we found that a key  step in NNSA\u2019s process for estimating savings\u2014developing a  comparative baseline of historical site costs\u2013\u2013is a difficult and inexact  process because DOE and NNSA contractors use different methods for  tracking costs, and DOE\u2019s cost data are of limited use in comparing sites.", "To obtain more consistent information on costs, some program offices  have developed customized contractor cost reporting requirements and  designed various systems to collect the cost information needed to  manage their programs. For example, NNSA\u2019s Office of Defense  Programs began developing a data system in 2007\u2014the Enterprise  Portfolio Analysis Tool (EPAT)\u2014to provide a consistent framework for  managing the planning, programming, budgeting, and evaluation  processes within Defense Programs. EPAT has evolved to incorporate a  common WBS to allow managers to compare the budget estimates for  analogous activities across the nuclear security enterprise regardless of  which contractor or program is conducting them. However, NNSA officials  told us that neither EPAT nor other customized, program-specific cost  collection systems satisfy the section 3128 requirements for establishing  an NNSA-wide approach to collecting cost information. According to  NNSA officials, EPAT is not suitable because, among other reasons, it is  not designed to reconcile with the DOE\u2019s official accounting system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Requirement for NNSA to Develop a Plan to Improve and Integrate Financial Management", "paragraphs": ["Section 3128 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year  2014 requires NNSA to develop a plan for improving and integrating  financial management of the nuclear security enterprise.

The  Director of Financial Integration has taken steps to develop an actionable  plan, but it is unclear when the plan will be finalized or the extent to which  it will incorporate leading practices. Until a plan that incorporates leading  practices is in place, NNSA cannot be assured that its efforts will result in  a cost collection model that satisfies the information needs of Congress or  improves program and financial management through improved cost  analysis, cost estimating, and program evaluation. Such information  would better position NNSA to address longstanding contract and project  management challenges. Without proper planning NNSA could waste  valuable resources, time, and effort in its financial management  improvement and integration process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To help provide a roadmap to effectively guide NNSA\u2019s effort to integrate  and improve its financial management, we recommend that the NNSA  Administrator direct the Program Director of Financial Integration to  develop a plan for producing cost information that fully incorporates  leading practices."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to NNSA for its review and comment.
