Most grantees reported using their grants to fund efforts designed to strengthen academics, and we estimate that over three-quarters of the grantees reported initiatives that focused on improving student services (e.g., tutoring) and outcomes for students (e.g., course pass rates). The most commonly reported benefits were related to improvements in academic quality and student services and outcomes. While grantees reported a wide range of benefits, most also reported challenges in implementing their projects that sometimes resulted in the need for additional time at the end of the grant to complete their efforts. Education has developed objectives and strategies designed to strengthen Title III and Title V institutions by improving financial sustainability, technological capacity, academic quality, student services and outcomes, and institutional management. While Education has developed data to determine its progress in four of these areas, it is still in the process of developing data for measuring increased technological capacity. Education has developed plans and tools to enhance its monitoring of and assistance to Title III and Title V grantees, but it has made limited progress in implementing these initiatives. Specifically, Education has not fully implemented its monitoring plan or completed its new electronic monitoring tools, and a new training curriculum to enhance the monitoring skills of staff. We found that only one-quarter of staff conducted two required site visits, and most visits that were conducted were not selected based on the requisite risk criteria. Also, staff were not aware of updated department guidance and, as a result, did not always properly monitor grantees. We also found that Education's ability to provide technical assistance was limited. For example, Education has acknowledged that its failure to provide information on eligibility criteria has resulted in uncertainty about the eligibility of over three-quarters of Title V grantees."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Beginning in 1965, Congress created several programs under the Higher  Education Act (HEA) to support postsecondary institutions that provide  low-income and minority students with access to higher education.

Institutions eligible for funding  under Titles III and V include Historically Black Colleges and Universities  (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges, Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs), Alaska  Native and Native Hawaiian Institutions, and other undergraduate  postsecondary institutions that serve low-income students. While these  institutions differ in terms of the racial and ethnic makeup of their  students, they serve a disproportionate number of financially needy  students, and have limited financial resources, such as endowment funds,  with which to serve them. (See app. II for characteristics of Title III and  Title V institutions and their students.) Title III and Title V legislation  outlines broad program goals for strengthening participating institutions,  but provides grantees with flexibility in deciding what approaches will  best meet their needs. An institution can use the grants to focus on one or  more activities that will help it achieve the goals articulated in its  comprehensive development plan\u2014a plan that an applicant must submit  with its grant application outlining its strategy for achieving growth and  self-sufficiency. (See app. III for a description of how the grantees we  visited used the grants.) Table 1 briefly describes the characteristics and  eligibility criteria of Title III and Title V grant programs.", "Since its inception, one of the primary missions of Title III has been to  support Historically Black Colleges and Universities, which play a  significant role in providing postsecondary opportunities for African  American, low-income, and educationally disadvantaged students. These  institutions receive funding through Title III, part B, in part, to remedy  discriminatory action of the states and the federal government against  Black colleges and universities. Until the Higher Education Act was  amended in 1998, other institutions that serve financially needy students\u2014 both minority serving and nonminority serving\u2014competed for funding  under Title III, part A. In 1998, the Higher Education Act was amended to  create new grant programs designated for Tribal Colleges, Alaska Native  and Native Hawaiian Institutions, and Hispanic Serving Institutions. These  programs have provided additional opportunities for Minority Serving  Institutions to compete for Title III and Title V funding. Specifically, in  1999, 55 Hispanic Serving, Tribal, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian  Institutions were awarded new grants through the expanded programs.  Table 2 shows the increase in support since the new programs were first  funded in 1999.", "The grant programs are designed to increase the self-sufficiency and  strengthen the capacity of eligible institutions. Congress has identified  many areas in which institutions may use funds for improving their  academic programs. Authorized uses include construction, maintenance,  or renovation of educational facilities; purchase or rental of  telecommunications equipment or services; support of faculty  development; and purchase of library books, periodicals, and other  educational materials."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grantees Reported a Wide Range of Uses and Benefits for Title III and Title V Grants but Cited Some Implementation Challenges", "paragraphs": ["In their grant performance reports, grantees most commonly reported  using Title III and Title V grant funds to strengthen academic quality and  reported a wide range of benefits.

The goal of these efforts was to  enhance faculty effectiveness in the classroom by providing training and  development opportunities for faculty and to improve the learning  environment for students by improving academic offerings and providing  appropriate educational materials, such as laboratory equipment and  library materials. Some examples include:    Spelman College, a historically black women\u2019s college in Georgia, used  part of its Title III, part B grant to fund a two-semester course that focused  on the dispersion of Africans throughout the world. This writing-intensive  course introduced students to their cultural background and how it relates  to the experiences of others in order to promote critical thinking and  interdisciplinary research. Spelman College has plans to develop a minor  in this area.", "The University of the Incarnate Word, a Hispanic Serving Institution in  Texas, used most of its Title V grant to strengthen student learning by  focusing on four areas of faculty development: pedagogy, technology,  globalization, and mentoring.

An estimated 76 percent  reported enhancements to faculty development, including increased  faculty participation in professional development activities. We estimate  that 80 percent of the grantees reported improving academic quality by  making enhancements to academic programs, including revising and  developing courses, establishing new academic programs, receiving new  accreditations, and acquiring equipment, library books, and other  educational materials. Some examples of benefits derived include the  following:    At the University of the Incarnate Word, where most of the faculty have  received intensive technology training, over 200 members of the faculty  are using an online course management system as a Web-based  resource for instruction. Faculty can create Web pages for the courses  they teach, allowing students to access course syllabi and assignments  as well as communicate with their professor and other students in the  class.", "The College of Southern Idaho, a Title III, part A Strengthening  Institutions grantee in Idaho, reported that with Title III funding it was  able to enhance more than 30 courses and develop a new accredited  health science program in radiologic technology.

This area includes  tutoring, counseling, and student service programs designed to improve  academic success, along with those efforts the primary focus of which is  increasing student outcomes such as retention and graduation rates,  academic achievement, and entering higher degree programs. Examples of  how grantees have focused their activities on improvements in this area  include:    Morehouse College, a historically black college in Georgia, used part of its  Title III grant to fund a wellness center for its all-male student body. The  center provides individual and group counseling and offers workshops and  seminars on topics like depression and the skills students need to achieve  academic success. The center also offers services to accommodate the  increase in students documented with learning disabilities.", "United Tribes Technical College, a tribal college in North Dakota, focused  on increasing retention and persistence of its students by using its   Title III grant to renovate a one-stop center for student services, pay  tutors, and equip a wired computer laboratory in the facility.", "The University of Texas at San Antonio, a Hispanic Serving Institution in  Texas, used most of its Title V grant to establish learning communities  where students enroll in clusters of courses in which the course content is  linked.

In the area of student services,  grantees primarily reported increases in the numbers of students using  student services, such as counseling and tutoring. Increase in student  retention was the most commonly reported benefit in the area of student  outcomes. For example, Laredo Community College, an HSI in Texas, used  its Title V award to construct and renovate science facilities to meet the  growing demand for science courses.

We estimate that two-thirds of  grantees reported technology-related benefits, including overall  improvements to the technological infrastructure, increases in the number  of classrooms wired for the Internet, and increases in Internet access and  the numbers of computers available to faculty and students. Several of the  grantees we visited credited Title III and Title V programs with helping  them to stay current technologically. For example, Morehouse College  credited Title III funding with helping the institution establish a  technological infrastructure. Title III paid for the installation of high-speed  Internet lines, wiring all buildings on campus, including dormitories, and  connecting all the buildings to a common network. An official at  Morehouse told us that the college\u2019s emphasis on technology stems from  the need to compete with other institutions for the best students and to  ensure that students graduate with technology skills that are necessary for  the workplace.

Examples of ways grantees can use grant  funds to improve fiscal stability include such activities as establishing or  enhancing a development office to improve contributions from alumni and  the private sector, establishing or improving an endowment fund, and  increasing research dollars. Seventy-one percent of grantees in the Title  III, part B program, and 63 percent of grantees in the Title III, part A Tribal  Colleges program reported at least one activity focused on improving  fiscal stability. Only one grantee from the Title III, part A Alaska Native  and Native Hawaiian program had an activity focused on improving fiscal  stability, which may be due to greater limitations on how Alaska Native  and Native Hawaiian institutions have been able to use funds in this area.  For example, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian institutions have not  been able to use grant funds to improve endowment funds, whereas  grantees in the other programs have. One example of how a grantee has  used funds to improve fiscal stability is:    Sitting Bull College, a tribal college with campuses in North Dakota and  South Dakota, used grant funds to develop its fund-raising capacity and  to establish an endowment. Because the college does not receive any  state funding, it relies heavily on federal funding, primarily from the  Bureau of Indian Affairs. College officials think that increasing fiscal  stability is central to becoming more self-sufficient.", "An estimated 57 percent of the grantees reported that they derived  benefits related to their efforts to improve fiscal stability, primarily  through endowment building. Grantees from the Title III, part A Tribal  Colleges program and Title V, part A HSI program reported increases in  their endowments most frequently. Laredo Community College, an HSI in  Texas, was able to establish an endowment that will provide scholarships  for math and science students in perpetuity. Over 5 years it matched  $250,000 from its Title V grant with private contributions. Officials said as  a 2-year institution, the college didn\u2019t have much experience with fund  raising prior to the grant, and having the ability to use federal funds to  match private donations energized both the campus and the community to  raise funds. These fund-raising efforts have led to endowments for other  academic programs, such as business and nursing.

For example, officials from Sitting  Bull College told us that its remote location made it difficult to attract and  retain qualified personnel. To address this problem, the institution has  focused on providing training and education to faculty and staff to develop  talent from within the college. Other challenges were not cited frequently  but included construction delays, challenges implementing technology and  distance learning, and state budget shortages.", "As a result of implementation challenges, grantees often needed additional  time to complete planned activities.  According to department regulations,  grantees generally have the option of extending the grant for 1 year after  the 5-year grant cycle has ended to obligate remaining funds.

Follow-up can take many forms, ranging from telephone calls and   e-mails to on-site compliance visits and technical assistance. Technical  assistance can involve many activities designed to aid the institution in its  administration of the grant. Although Education\u2019s preferred approach is to  try to inform grantees of steps they can take to address grant  administration issues, grantees can also be subject to some restrictions  based on risk assessments. For instance, if a grantee is designated as \u201chigh  risk,\u201d Education can impose conditions on the grantee\u2019s ability to access  grant funds.

Education anticipates that the  system will improve its monitoring process by providing staff ready access  to such important information as regulatory citations and alerting staff to  needed monitoring actions. Officials think moving to electronic monitoring  from a paper-based process will improve recordkeeping and  documentation, enhancing the ability to identify and track areas of  concern for individual grantees and across the programs.", "Also, as a key component of its e-monitoring system, Education has  developed the online institutional performance reporting process.  Specifically, Education implemented an annual reporting process in fiscal  year 2003 that requires grantees to submit standardized information about  their performance electronically. As a result, the new performance reports  were designed to allow department staff to more quickly and  systematically identify and follow up with grantees on difficulties they are  facing regarding their grants.

He said that one of the  department\u2019s goals is to move from focusing on the process of awarding  grants to a more programmatic emphasis where the needs of the grantees  guide the services that are offered. One of the key areas of technical  assistance that Education is targeting for improvement is educating  grantees about eligibility criteria. In response to concerns Education\u2019s  Inspector General raised about awards made in the Title V, part A  Developing Hispanic Institutions program, earlier this year Education  completed a review of all Title V grantee files to determine whether  grantees were eligible for the awards. On the basis of this review,  Education concluded that there were questions surrounding the eligibility  of more than three-quarters of the 220 grantees that have received funds  through the program. Education found that 12 institutions should not have  received grants because their percentages of low-income Hispanic  students were below the required 50 percent. In other cases, the  department indicated that it could not determine eligibility because  institutions made calculation errors, institutions did not report  percentages, or the institutions\u2019 calculation methods could not be  determined. The department concluded that 47 of the grantees used the  correct calculation method and met the eligibility assurance requirement  that at least half of its Hispanic students are low-income but noted that  there were still concerns that some of these institutions may have had  documentation problems. Education has attributed these irregularities to  confusion about how to meet eligibility requirements stemming from  insufficient guidance it provided to applicants as well as an institutional  lack of systematic data collection.  As a result, Education decided that it  would not take action in this specific instance against any of the grantees  with eligibility concerns. Education has taken steps to address the  problem, including developing new guidance for applicants and verifying  all eligibility assurances that applicants submit. Education plans to assist  grantees with the eligibility process at pre-application workshops.", "Education\u2019s ability to target assistance is limited in two ways: it does not  readily use the feedback it obtains from grantees, and its feedback  mechanisms may not encourage open communication. For example, a  senior official told us that feedback Education collected via surveys from  grantees at conferences has not been used in planning assistance efforts.  Additionally, one of Education\u2019s feedback mechanisms may limit  communication because it identifies grantees and is tied to funding  decisions. Specifically, Education provided grantees with the opportunity  to comment on ways to improve the services the department provides in  their annual performance reports, which department staff review to  determine whether sufficient progress has been made to continue funding.  Department officials told us that Education is considering ways to collect  feedback from grantees separate from the performance reporting process  for all its grant programs."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Congress has demonstrated its support for Title III and Title V programs  by expanding the number of institutions covered and by nearly doubling  funding to these programs since 1999. Title III and Title V programs are  designed to provide additional resources to institutions that face  challenges providing a quality education to low-income and minority  students who are typically underrepresented in postsecondary education.  While Title III and Title V programs provide important resources to  address some of the most critical needs of these institutions, the need for  monitoring and assistance does not end with the award of a grant. These  institutions, because they have limited resources, sometimes need  additional assistance to help them implement their projects. Consequently,  Education\u2019s role in monitoring and providing assistance to Title III and  Title V grantees is critical to the success of these programs. Education has  taken steps to enhance its monitoring and assistance efforts. However, by  failing to carry out an effective process to identify and target oversight and  assistance to at-risk grantees, Education has fallen short of ensuring that  these institutions have all the tools they need to fulfill the programs\u2019  objectives. Education recognizes that it must work in partnership with its  grantees to enhance the quality of and access to postsecondary education  and has put in place plans that would allow it to better monitor and assist  grantees.

We reviewed grant  applications and grantee performance reports to develop a standardized  data collection instrument. We completed the data collection instrument  for each grantee in our sample, and each record was independently  reviewed by another staff person for clarity and accuracy.", "To identify these recipients, we obtained from Education a list of grantees  for specific grant cycles. The grant cycles were chosen to allow us to  review documentation from as many years of the 5-year grant cycle as  possible or to allow for the review of comparable information. For  example, we selected 1999-2004 as the grant cycle for grantees from three  of the programs in our review because 1999 was the first year awards were  made in these programs. For the Title III, part B program, we looked at  available data from the 2002-2007 grant cycle because performance reports  comparable to those provided by grantees in other programs were not  available from a previous grant cycle. The grant cycles are shown in   Table 8.", "We stratified our sample by the five programs and within these strata  randomly selected grantees. Our sample was statistically drawn and  weighted so that we could generalize the results of our review across  programs. As with all samples, our review of grant files is subject to  sampling errors. The effects of sampling errors, due to the selection of a  sample from a larger population, can be expressed as confidence intervals  based on statistical theory. Sampling errors occur because we use a  sample to draw conclusions about a larger population. If a different  sample had been taken, the results might have been different. To recognize  the possibility that other samples might have yielded other results, we  express our confidence in the precision of our particular sample\u2019s results  as a 95 percent confidence interval. The 95 percent confidence interval is  expected to include the actual results for 95 percent of samples of this  type. Our sample sizes were selected to give us results within +/- 10  percentage points of what we would have obtained if we had surveyed the  entire study population within each program. Because we included the  entire population for the Title III, part A programs that cover Tribal  Colleges, Alaska Native Institutions, and Native Hawaiian Institutions,  there is no sampling error associated with the results presented for these  programs. Each sample element was subsequently weighted in the analysis  to account for all members of the population, including those that were  not selected. When we make estimates to the entire population of  grantees, we are 95 percent confident that the results we obtained are  within +/- 7 percentage points of what we would have obtained if we had  included the entire population within our review unless otherwise noted.", "We analyzed data from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data  System (IPEDS) to better understand the kinds of students they serve.   To assess the completeness of the IPEDS data, we reviewed the National  Center for Education Statistics\u2019 documentation on how the data were  collected and performed electronic tests to look for missing or out-of- range values. On the basis of these reviews and tests, we found the data  sufficiently reliable for our purposes.
