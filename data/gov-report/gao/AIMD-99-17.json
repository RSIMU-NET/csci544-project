The agreed-upon procedures, along with our audit of the IRS\u2019 fiscal year 1997 Custodial Financial Statements, and work performed at other Department of the Treasury offices and bureaus, was necessary to provide a sufficient basis to assist those IGs in forming an opinion on the financial statements of their respective departments and the relevant trust funds those departments administer, such as DOT\u2019s Highway Trust Fund and DOL\u2019s Black Lung Disability Trust Fund.", "Our previous report presented errors we identified in performing these procedures, but did not discuss the underlying internal control weaknesses that allowed these errors to go undetected, nor did it discuss actions needed to address these weaknesses. This report discusses such weaknesses and presents our recommendations for corrective action."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The federal government levies excise taxes on entities and individuals for the purpose of financing general federal activities and specific government programs. Several different bureaus and offices within Treasury collected about $59 billion of excise taxes in fiscal year 1997. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms accounted for about $13 billion in excise taxes on alcohol, tobacco products, and firearms while the U.S. Customs Service accounted for about $1 billion in excise taxes on imported and exported goods and services.", "However, the majority of excise taxes are accounted for by IRS. In fiscal year 1997, IRS collected about $45 billion in excise taxes on the purchase, use, or inventory of various types of goods or services, such as gasoline and airline tickets. The various excise taxes accounted for by IRS are deposited into the general fund of the Treasury and into nine different trust funds, which are administered by six agencies or federal entities. The trust funds that received fiscal year 1997 tax revenues are shown in table 1. A list of excise taxes by trust fund is included in appendix II.", "Administering agencies for the trust funds receiving excise tax revenue rely on the Treasury to accurately collect and distribute federal tax revenue to the appropriate trust funds. Because it collects federal tax revenue and then distributes it to government trust funds, Treasury is considered a servicing organization by agencies administering the trust funds as well as by the auditors of these agencies. Consequently, the administering agencies and their auditors need to rely on Treasury, through its various bureaus and offices, including IRS, to properly account for and distribute the amounts transferred from the government\u2019s general fund to the applicable trust funds.", "Excise taxes are deposited into the general fund as received. However, the information that ultimately determines how these receipts are actually distributed is generally submitted via the Form 720, Quarterly Federal Excise Tax Return. Because data are not available to allocate excise taxes to the appropriate trust funds when deposits are made, Treasury uses a process to estimate the initial distribution of excise taxes. This process involves the use of economic models prepared by the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA) to estimate the initial distribution of tax receipts. Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) uses these estimates to prepare entries for the initial distributions to the trust funds, which are recorded by the Bureau of the Public Debt (BPD) in the books and records of the trust funds maintained by Treasury. Subsequent to this initial distribution, IRS certifies quarterly the amounts that should have been distributed to the excise tax-related trust funds based on the tax returns. FMS uses these certifications to prepare adjustments to the initial trust fund distributions. These adjustments are recorded by BPD. There is typically a 6-month lag between the quarter end and the excise tax certification by IRS. Figure 1 provides an overview of the entire process of collecting, distributing, and certifying excise tax revenue reported to the trust funds.", "IRS relies on a combination of manual and automated procedures to prepare its certification of excise taxes to be distributed to the trust funds. IRS calculates the trust fund distributions based on assessment information in the master file. As quarterly excise tax returns are received, IRS personnel input the liability amounts by type of excise tax, such as Diesel Fuel Tax, into its master file. The tax types are identified by IRS numbers, or abstract numbers, which are preprinted on the Form 720. It is these abstract numbers that ultimately determine how amounts are distributed to the appropriate trust funds.", "The assessment information by type of excise tax is electronically transmitted from the master file to IRS\u2019 Automated Quarterly Excise Tax Listing (AQETL) system. An IRS analyst, who has sole responsibility for preparing the excise tax certifications, accesses this system, analyzes the data for reasonableness by, for example, comparing current period assessments to amounts reported in prior periods, and makes adjustments, as necessary. The analyst may identify necessary adjustments by analyzing significant variations from prior quarter reported assessment amounts. After making any needed adjustments, the analyst generates a report from the AQETL system which summarizes the assessment data by excise tax type. The analyst uses this report to prepare the certifications for all tax distributions other than taxes related to the Highway, Airport & Airway, and Inland Waterways Trust Funds.", "For the Highway, Airport & Airway, and Inland Waterways Trust Funds, the analyst manually enters the assessment data from the report generated from the AQETL system onto electronic spreadsheets. These spreadsheets contain distribution rates to allocate the assessments between the trust funds and the general fund based on the assessment data entered by the analyst. The distributions from these spreadsheets, and the AQETL-system report for the other taxes, become the basis for preparing the quarterly excise tax certification letters. IRS submits the certification letters to FMS, which uses it to prepare adjustments to the initial distributions based on the OTA estimates to bring them in line with the IRS certified amounts. These adjustments are sent to BPD, which records the entries in the books and records of the trust funds maintained by Treasury.

The taxpayer multiplies these amounts against the preprinted tax rates on the Form 720 to report the excise tax assessment. Thus, information contained on the tax form allows IRS to mathematically verify liability amounts reported by the taxpayer.", "However, we found that IRS did not require its personnel to verify that the tax assessment amounts calculated by the taxpayers and reported on the returns agree with the supporting information provided on the tax returns. This led to inconsistencies between the assessed amount and supporting information provided by taxpayers, which IRS did not detect and correct. In 13 of the 230 taxpayer returns we reviewed, either assessment amounts we recalculated based on information contained in the return differed from the tax assessment reported on the return or all the required information was not included on the return to verify the assessment amount calculated by the taxpayer.", "IRS procedure manuals required that IRS personnel review tax returns that contain $1 million or more in excise tax assessments for reasonableness and accuracy. The manuals provided guidance for performing the reviews; however, this guidance was too general. As a result, the types of reviews performed by IRS analysts varied. In some cases, tax calculations were verified and taxpayers were contacted if data were missing, while in other cases, the return was only scanned for reasonableness.", "The lack of adequate and consistent review procedures increases the likelihood that incorrect assessment amounts reported by the taxpayer on the tax return would not be detected and corrected by IRS.", "As a result of our agreed upon procedures work, IRS officials indicated that IRS has acted to address the internal control weaknesses discussed above.", "Specifically, these officials indicated that IRS implemented procedures to improve the review of tax returns over $1 million. Also, IRS now requires the math verification of all tax assessments, as applicable, and analysts are required to follow-up with taxpayers to clarify inconsistent information on tax returns.", "We also noted that IRS centralized its excise tax processing in the Cincinnati Service Center to improve the consistency of processing and reviewing excise tax returns and to more closely monitor refund claims. Within that center, IRS established an Excise Program Section that specializes in reviewing excise tax returns and refund claims. It is significant that many of the errors we identified during our agreed upon procedures work related to tax returns processed at other service centers prior to IRS centralizing its excise tax processing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inputting Errors Not Caught Through Review", "paragraphs": ["As discussed above, taxpayers report the majority of excise taxes to IRS quarterly using the Form 720. Taxpayers record on the Form 720 assessment amounts owed for each abstract number listed on the form.  IRS uses the Form 720 to input assessment information into the master files.", "We found errors in this input process in fiscal year 1997. Specifically, we found that all or a portion of the assessment amounts for 13 of the 230 taxpayer returns reviewed were recorded in incorrect abstract numbers in the master file. In one case, IRS incorrectly recorded assessments of $176 million from the tax return in one abstract, yet the tax return indicated that this amount should have been divided among eight different abstracts. Because the abstract numbers identify the type of excise tax (for example, Diesel Fuel Tax) to which the assessment applies and are used in the certification of amounts ultimately distributed to the various trust funds, this directly affected the accuracy of IRS\u2019 certifications. IRS officials indicated that these errors would be corrected in subsequent certifications made in fiscal year 1998.", "The structure of the Form 720 itself contributed to several errors. The Form 720 tax return is a complex tax form consisting of three distinct parts and two additional schedules. Information on the schedules includes details on excise tax assessments by semimonthly period (Schedule A), and adjustments to correct errors in previously filed Form 720s and claims against previously paid taxes (Schedule C). The information on Schedule C containing the claim and adjustment data is broken down by abstract number; however, it is aggregated into one total line on page 2 of the Form 720. Consequently, taxpayers record on the Form 720 assessment amounts owed for each abstract number listed on the form but do not reflect claims and adjustments, by abstract, on pages 1 and 2 of the Form 720. To assist in processing the tax return, IRS requires its staff to copy claims and adjustments listed on Schedule C, by abstract, to pages 1 and 2 of the Form 720. This procedure provides the data entry staff with the capability of inputting assessment, claim, and adjustment amounts, by abstract, directly off the first two pages of the tax return form without having to scan the schedules for claim and adjustment amounts to be input. However, the procedure of IRS staff manually copying claim and adjustment amounts from the schedules prepared by taxpayers increases the risk of errors, and consequently the likelihood that assessment, claim, and adjustment amounts will be incorrectly recorded in the master files.", "Nine of the 13 errors that we identified were the result of (1) IRS personnel incorrectly copying the adjustment information from the Schedule C to pages 1 and 2 of the tax return, (2) IRS personnel failing to copy adjustment information from the Schedule C to pages 1 and 2 of the tax return, or (3) data entry personnel misreading the handwritten adjustments made by other IRS staff on the Form 720 when inputting this information into the master files. For example, in one case, a taxpayer claimed a credit of $683,000, consisting of a $685,000 decrease for gasoline tax and a $2,000 increase for aviation fuel tax. However, IRS staff incorrectly recopied the credit amounts from the Schedule C to page 1 of the Form 720, resulting in the entire amount being recorded as gasoline tax. In another case, a taxpayer claimed a credit for $681,000 for taxed diesel fuel. An IRS employee copied the abstract number unclearly to page 1 of the Form 720, and the amount was erroneously recorded as a credit to tax on dyed diesel fuel used in trains.", "In total, in the 13 cases, we identified $179 million of IRS errors in inputting excise tax return information to the master files. The Comptroller General\u2019s Standards for Internal Controls in the Federal Government specifies that transactions are to be promptly recorded and properly classified. The identified errors may have been avoided had procedures been in place to verify the input process. Also, errors resulting from the need for IRS staff to transfer information from the attached schedules to pages 1 and 2 of the Form 720 for each abstract could be avoided by revising the tax return form so that taxpayers, and not IRS personnel, enter the claim and adjustment amounts by abstract from Schedule C to pages 1 and 2 of the tax return."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Certification Errors Not Prevented or Detected", "paragraphs": ["As discussed previously, one analyst is responsible for compiling the quarterly certifications.

We found that there is no supervisory review of the analyst\u2019s work until the certification letters are prepared, at which point they are forwarded to the Branch Chief for a high-level review and signature. We found no evidence that a detailed supervisory review is performed of the documentation supporting the certifications at any point during the certification process. Finally, we found that IRS does not review the distribution rates contained on the OTA-provided spreadsheet used to allocate certain assessments between the general fund and the Highway Trust Fund.

The lack of adequate supervisory review can lead to incorrect certifications and inaccurate distributions to the trust funds.", "We found a number of such errors that occurred in fiscal year 1997. For example, we found that assessment amounts were (1) inadvertently omitted from the certifications and (2) did not agree with supporting documentation. In one case related to heavy vehicle use tax, the supporting schedule summarizing the tax return information reflected an assessment amount of $195 million but the amount certified was $128 million. As a result, the certified amount for the Highway Trust Fund was understated by $67 million. In another case, assessments for compressed natural gas totaling over $500,000 were omitted from the Highway Trust Fund certification.

Consistent with these changes, we modified the recommendation to eliminate the reference to having the taxpayer net the tax liability, by abstract number, for any adjustments or claims, by abstract number, as reported on the accompanying Schedule C.
