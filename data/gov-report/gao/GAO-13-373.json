To address these objectives, GAO surveyed all 50 states and the District of Columbia, examined data from pilot programs spanning about 2 years, and interviewed officials from three state-based programs.", "HHS provided technical and clarifying comments, which GAO incorporated as appropriate."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified three states\u0097Maine, Montana, and Washington\u0097that have developed pilot programs focused on replacing older manufactured homes using a combination of state and federal funds. The three programs were relatively small, accounting for about $4.5 million in spending and responsible for replacing 81 homes, over about 2 years. The programs differed in requirements, including whether the land that the replacement home would occupy had to be owned or could be leased; the types of financing used, with some replacements requiring recipients to take on a partial mortgage; and the types of replacement homes.", "Program officials and representatives of organizations that aided them from the three state replacement pilot programs identified three key types of challenges in implementing these programs. First, they told GAO that many potential beneficiaries were not eligible to participate because (1) they had liens on their existing properties, (2) they did not own or have a long-term lease for the land the homes would be placed on, or (3) their credit histories made them ineligible for any type of loan. Second, these officials told GAO that some potential beneficiaries were unwilling to participate because they were: (1) mistrustful that such a program would be legitimate; (2) unwilling to take on any debt, regardless of the poor condition of their home; (3) unwilling to move from their current location; or (4) unwilling to take on increases in property taxes resulting from increased home value. Third, they identified challenges that were primarily logistical in nature, such as the need to construct wheelchair ramps or update utilities, which could raise the cost of replacement.", "In the three pilot replacement programs GAO examined, the energy savings did not fully offset the costs of replacing older manufactured homes over a typical loan period. The two programs that maintained information on energy use and estimated savings spent an average of about $56,119 per unit to replace each older manufactured home and estimated about $489 in annual energy savings per home. The average cost of replacement homes varied across the three programs GAO examined. The least costly program GAO examined was Montana\u0092s, which replaced some older manufactured homes with used, but newer and more energy efficient models, with an average cost of about $42,339 per home.

These older manufactured homes are  generally considered to have some of the poorest energy efficiency of all  housing units. Many of the occupants of these homes qualify for federal  assistance to help pay their energy bills through the U.S. Department of  Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Low Income Home Energy  Assistance Program (LIHEAP). LIHEAP helps cover home energy  expenditures\u2014 key components of which are home heating and, in some  cases, cooling expenditures. In 2011, LIHEAP covered about 8 million  low-income households through payments to homeowners, occupants,  landlords, or others. LIHEAP is a federal block grant program in which  funds are provided to grantees, including states, territories, and tribes and  tribal organizations, based on a number of factors, such as climate and  income. Grantees then provide LIHEAP funds to eligible beneficiaries. To  be eligible, household income must be below varying thresholds set by  the federal government. In fiscal year 2013, Congress appropriated about  $3 billion for LIHEAP nationwide.", "Questions have been raised about whether improving the energy  efficiency of older manufactured homes or replacing them with newer,  more energy efficient models would save the federal government money  by reducing federal spending on LIHEAP. A portion of LIHEAP funds can  be used to improve the energy efficiency of these homes but, in many  cases, because of the ways these homes were built, and their sometimes  poor condition, improving their energy efficiency cannot be accomplished  cost effectively. Some states have conducted pilot programs to replace  older manufactured homes; however, LIHEAP funds are statutorily  prohibited from being used for new construction\u2014which includes  replacing existing homes.", "You asked us to identify and review state-based or other programs that  have replaced older manufactured homes\u2014particularly those built before  1976\u2013\u2013with newer, more energy efficient models, and the extent to which  these programs may be cost-effective based on reduced energy costs.  Our objectives for this report were to (1) identify states that have funded  programs to replace older manufactured homes with more energy  efficient models and describe these programs; (2) identify challenges, if  any, these states reported facing in implementing these programs; and  (3) determine the extent to which these programs resulted in energy  savings sufficient to offset replacement costs.", "To identify which states had replacement programs, we surveyed LIHEAP  grantees from all 50 states and the District of Columbia and received a  100 percent response rate. We examined budgets, eligibility criteria,  beneficiary records, and program evaluations conducted at the state level  for the three programs we identified. To learn more about these programs  and identify challenges states reported facing in implementing them, we  interviewed officials from each state program, as well as representatives  of organizations and agencies that aided these programs or were  knowledgeable about the owners of manufactured homes in each state.  We determined early in the course of our work that these programs were  not designed to save LIHEAP funds, but we examined available  information about the energy savings that resulted from these programs  and the extent to which they offset replacement costs, which could inform  deliberations about whether such programs could help reduce LIHEAP  costs. State officials provided data spanning about 2 years of operation of  these programs on funding sources, replacement program costs, and  energy costs, to the extent that they collected these data. To assess the  reliability of the data, we compared summary documents with individual  replacement records, where possible, and discussed the data with state  officials who compiled it. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report.", "We conducted this performance audit from February 2012 to March 2013  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Camping or travel trailers\u2014typically  smaller structures that can be pulled by car or small truck\u2014are another  type of manufactured home but are generally designed to be temporary  dwellings rather than permanent residences.", "To implement the National Manufactured Housing Construction and  Safety Standards Act of 1974, the Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) began to issue and enforce standards for the  construction, design, performance, and installation of manufactured  homes to ensure their quality, durability, affordability, and safety. HUD  may enforce these standards directly, or they may be enforced at the  state level. These standards preempt state and local laws that are not  identical to the federal standards and apply to all manufactured homes  produced after June 15, 1976.", "Before 1976, there were few provisions for ensuring the safety or quality  of manufactured homes. Many of these older homes were built with little  or no insulation, thin walls and roofs, uninsulated heating and cooling  systems, and inefficient louvered windows (known as jalousie windows).", "Further, over time many of these older manufactured homes deteriorated  to the point that their windows and doors no longer seal tightly to protect  the interior from the weather. According to the Maine Housing Authority,  which conducted a study in 2007 of pre-1976 manufactured homes, many  of these older manufactured homes have depreciated to the point where  they have no market value. In addition, officials knowledgeable about  housing and weatherization have stated that some pre-1976  manufactured homes may be unsuitable for weatherization (i.e., making  long-term energy efficiency improvements). For example, these homes  typically have roofs made of thin metal sheets seamed together and walls  built with 2-inch by 2-inch studs; therefore, neither the ceilings nor the  walls can accommodate insulation. In addition, most of these older  manufactured homes are beyond the scope of federal and state  weatherization programs; that is, officials responsible for implementing  these programs have generally determined that such homes have  become too deteriorated to warrant weatherization or are unsafe for  weatherization crews to work on. Approximately 80 percent of older  manufactured homes are in the South and West U.S. Census Regions, as  are approximately 84 percent of newer manufactured homes. Figure 1  shows an example of a manufactured home built before 1976.", "As part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, Congress formally authorized  the Energy Star program to identify and promote energy efficient products  and buildings, including manufactured homes. The Energy Star program  is designed to identify products that deliver the same or better  performance as comparable models while using less energy. An Energy  Star-rated manufactured home is a home that has been designed,  produced, and installed by the home manufacturer to meet Energy Star  requirements for energy efficiency. Such requirements include increased  insulation, tightly sealed air ducts, and Energy Star-qualified windows.  Each Energy Star-rated manufactured home is inspected while it\u2019s being  built in the factory and during on-site installation to verify that it meets  Energy Star standards for energy efficiency.", "In addition, Title XXVI of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981  established LIHEAP to help low-income households\u2014particularly those  with the lowest incomes that pay a high proportion of their household  income on home energy expenditures\u2014pay their home heating and  cooling costs.funding grants to states and other entities that, in turn, provide the funds  to eligible households. States, territories, and tribes and tribal  organizations that wish to assist low-income households in meeting home  energy expenditures may apply for a LIHEAP block grant. These grantees  then provide payments on behalf of the eligible households directly to  energy providers (e.g., utilities), homeowners, occupants, landlords, or  others. Grantees provide LIHEAP assistance to eligible beneficiaries up  to the maximum eligible payment for that beneficiary as determined by  the grantee. Grant funds are distributed in this manner until the grantees\u2019  annual funding has been entirely expended or the fiscal year has ended.  LIHEAP funding, adjusted for inflation, was highest from 1981 to 1986  and from 2009-2011, witnessing a decline in real terms in the years in  between these two periods. For 2012, LIHEAP allocated to state grantees  funding that ranged from about $6.1 million, for Hawaii, to about $375.5  million, for New York. For 2012, LIHEAP allocated to U.S. territory  grantees funding that ranged from about $58.7 thousand, for the Northern  Mariana Islands, to about $4.2 million, for Puerto Rico, and for all tribes  and tribal organizations funding of about $38.4 million.", "LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides  While the federal government establishes overall LIHEAP guidelines,  each grantee operates its own program. For example, federal law  stipulates that a LIHEAP-eligible household\u2019s income generally must not  exceed the greater of 150 percent of the poverty level or 60 percent of the  state\u2019s median income. However, LIHEAP grantees may not set their  maximum income threshold for applicants below 110 percent of the  poverty level, but they may give priority to those households with the  highest home energy expenditures or needs in relation to income.  LIHEAP grantees may set additional criteria for allocating LIHEAP funding  to recipients. For example, they may give priority to households with  vulnerable occupants, which HHS defines as those who are at least 60  years old, disabled, or 5 years old or younger.", "LIHEAP does not require grantees to match federal funds, but some  grantees choose to supplement funds. Grantees also have the flexibility  to use up to 15 percent of their LIHEAP funds\u2014or up to 25 percent under  certain circumstances\u2014for state weatherization programs that provide  funds to improve home energy efficiency, typically by upgrading insulation  and heating and cooling equipment.

The programs differed in program requirements, the types  of financing used, and the types of replacement homes used.", "Maine. Maine has conducted one replacement pilot and has one ongoing  program. Maine Housing Authority\u2019s (MaineHousing) replacement pilot\u2014 conducted from November 2008 through August 2010\u2014was the largest- scale pilot we identified to replace older manufactured homes. Under the  pilot, Maine replaced 35 older manufactured homes with new, Energy  Star-rated manufactured homes. The program was funded with  approximately $2 million in state funds provided by the Housing  Opportunities for Maine (Maine HOME) Fund along with $148,000 in  mortgage financing from MaineHousing\u2019s Home Mortgage Program.", "According to Maine officials, the intent of the program was for the  beneficiary to secure a 30-year first mortgage at a 5.25 percent interest  rate with Home Mortgage Program funds for part of the cost of the  replacement home and a second deferred mortgage with the Maine  HOME funds for the balance\u2014deferred in this case meaning that  beneficiaries made no interest or principal payments if they stayed in the  home. However, of the 35 beneficiaries, 9 could afford the 30-year first  mortgage. Loans for these 9 beneficiaries ranged from $8,000 to $40,000,  which covered an average 24 percent of the cost of their replacement  homes, with the balance covered by the second, deferred Maine HOME  mortgage. For the remaining 26 beneficiaries who were unable to afford  the 30-year first mortgage, the replacement was wholly funded using a  Maine HOME deferred mortgage. Under either loan structure, no down  payment or application fee was required. According to Maine officials,  potential beneficiaries were selected with input from community action  agencies and were drawn from LIHEAP rolls. To be eligible,  beneficiaries\u2019 manufactured homes were required to have been built  before 1976 and deemed unsuitable for weatherization. Beneficiaries  were also required to own the land on which the home was situated. The  first pilot ended in 2010 when all the available funding was used, and  officials told us they have another pilot ongoing.", "Montana. Montana\u2019s replacement pilot\u2014conducted from December 2008  through September 2010\u2014replaced 19 manufactured homes with more  energy efficient models. It was initially conceived not as a pilot, but as an  ongoing program; however, when private underwriting for loans for  replacement homes could not be secured, the program was turned into a  pilot. Under the pilot, beneficiaries received a replacement home using a  combination of state funds and federal grant funds. Total funding for the  program was approximately $804,448 and consisted of $354,886 from the  state\u2019s general fund and about $449,562 funded by a combination of  Montana Board of Housing first-time homebuyer assistance and the U.S.  HUD\u2019s HOME Investment Partnerships (HUD HOME) Program. Funding  for each replacement home was determined on a case-by-case basis.  Under the program, money from Montana\u2019s general fund was used to  provide direct, 15- to 20-year loans at a 2 percent interest rate for all  program beneficiaries, which beneficiaries were required to repay in full  with monthly payments. Based on the beneficiaries\u2019 ability to pay, these  loans ranged from $9,500 to about $20,000. The remainder of the  financing was provided using HUD HOME and Montana Board of Housing  funds, which the beneficiary was not required to pay back as long as they  complied with program rules, such as the requirement that beneficiaries\u2019  homes be owner-occupied. Potential beneficiaries were identified through  community outreach by participating community action agencies based  on the condition of the homes and household income and the presence of  vulnerable occupants. Unlike Maine, the pilot did not require the  beneficiary to own the land on which the home was situated but required  that the beneficiary\u2019s lease on the land exceed the terms of the loan.  Montana\u2019s pilot was unique among the pilots we reviewed in that nearly  half of the replacement homes were previously owned manufactured  homes. Officials told us they chose to purchase previously owned homes  to reduce costs. In addition, unlike the other state pilots we reviewed,  Montana\u2019s pilot did not require replacement homes to be Energy Star  rated; however, according to program officials they were generally  significantly more energy efficient than the homes they replaced. The pilot  ended in October 2010, when it had used all the available funds. Montana  officials told us they have no immediate plans to make the pilot an  ongoing program or to conduct another pilot.", "Washington. Washington\u2019s replacement pilot\u2014conducted from July 2008  through March 2009\u2014replaced 27 manufactured homes with new,  Energy Star-rated manufactured homes. The pilot was funded by a $2  million grant funded by HUD\u2019s HOME Program. Under the pilot,  beneficiaries received a deferred, forgivable 15-year loan, which required  no down payment and no monthly payments on the loan. Like  Montana\u2019s pilot, the beneficiary was not required to own the land on  which the home was situated; however, unlike Montana, the pilot required  the beneficiary to have only a 1-year lease on the land. Initially, each  project was limited to $60,000 total cost; however, in some cases, utility  upgrades and other costs necessitated granting waivers to the investment  limit and making amendments to replacement contracts. Like Montana\u2019s  and Maine\u2019s pilots, potential beneficiaries were selected with input from  participating community action agencies from a list of occupants who  were vulnerable (e.g., older individuals and families with young children)  and whose homes were in need of weatherization assistance but were  deemed to be beyond repair. The pilot ended in March 2009 when all the  available funding was used. State officials told us that they would like to  make the pilot an ongoing replacement program or conduct another pilot,  but that they have no immediate plans to do so because of a lack of  funding sources, among other challenges.", "Table 1 provides a comparison of the three replacement programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Reported Facing Challenges, Including Difficulty Finding Potential Beneficiaries Who Were Eligible and Willing to Participate", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all three state replacement pilot programs and  representatives of organizations and agencies that aided these programs  told us that they faced three key types of challenges: (1) many potential  beneficiaries were not eligible to participate; (2) some potential  beneficiaries were not willing to participate; and (3) other logistical  challenges, such as finding suitable replacement homes within a  reasonable distance to transport them to beneficiaries, which resulted in  higher costs.", "Specifically, officials and representatives of organizations and agencies  that aided these programs told us that many potential beneficiaries were  not eligible to participate for three key reasons:", "Liens on their property. Officials in Maine with an agency helping to  identify potential participants told us that their program stipulated that  potential beneficiaries could not have any liens\u2014such as outstanding  property taxes or sewage fees, or foreclosure proceedings\u2014on the  property that would receive the replacement home. They told us that a  property with a lien had a higher risk of foreclosure. These officials  told us that, as a result, many potential beneficiaries were disqualified  due to liens on their properties.", "Did not own or have a long-term lease for the land. In Maine, potential  beneficiaries were required to own their properties and, in Montana,  they were required to have long-term leases. Officials from these  programs told us that these policies were intended to improve the  likelihood of beneficiaries staying in their replacement homes.  However, these officials told us that many potential beneficiaries were  disqualified because they lived in manufactured home parks, where  lots are typically held on shorter-term leases.", "Poor credit histories. Officials from all states told us that, in some  cases, potential beneficiaries\u2019 credit histories, which made them  ineligible for any loan, were so poor that it was deemed too risky to  enroll them in the replacement program.", "In addition, these officials and representatives of organizations and  agencies that aided these programs told us that, in the pool of eligible  potential beneficiaries, some were unwilling to participate because they  were:", "Mistrustful of program\u2019s legitimacy. Some potential beneficiaries were  doubtful that such a program would be legitimate. For example, one  organization assisting with the program in Montana told us that they  spent a lot of time in the early stages of the replacement program  convincing potential beneficiaries that the pilot was not a scam. In  Washington and Maine, where some community action agencies had  already replaced dilapidated homes, they told us that trust in the  larger program was not a significant issue.", "Unwilling to take on any debt. One official in Maine and an  organization assisting with the program in Montana told us that some  potential beneficiaries, especially among the elderly population, were  just not willing to take on new debt regardless of the poor condition of  their home, and there were no loan terms under which they would  accept a replacement home.", "Unwilling to move from their current location. Older manufactured  homes are typically smaller than new ones, so many replacement  homes were larger than the homes they replaced. In some cases\u2013\u2013 particularly when homes were located in older manufactured home  parks\u2013\u2013the replacement homes would not fit on the lots. In some  cases, organizations assisting in programs told us that they were able  to find another location, but it would have required a move to a new  school district, which caused some potential beneficiaries with school- aged children to choose not to participate in the program.", "Unwilling or unable to pay tax increases. Some potential beneficiaries  may be unwilling, or unable, to pay the increased property taxes that  would result from the increased value of their homes. For example, a  Maine official described a situation where a potential beneficiary\u2019s  home was built in 1957 and had no taxable value, so property taxes  were assessed solely on the value of the land. After replacement, the  sales value of the new home would be added to the land value, and  the beneficiary\u2019s property taxes would have tripled. Because this  potential beneficiary could not afford this tax increase, he or she  chose not to participate.", "Officials from all three pilots also identified other challenges that were  primarily logistical in nature. For example, a representative assisting the  Montana program told us that it was difficult and time-consuming to find  suitable replacement homes within a reasonable distance to transport  them to beneficiaries. In addition, in Maine, where the homes to be  replaced were required to have been built before 1976, officials told us  they faced difficulties in confirming the date of construction of some  homes. Officials from all three pilots told us that some of these logistical  challenges would translate into higher costs. For example, officials in  Washington and Montana told us that many of their administrative costs  were not covered by the program funding. These officials told us they  were willing to take on these costs under a pilot, but that their  administrative costs would have to be covered if the pilot became an  ongoing program. A representative assisting the Montana program told us  that some replacement homes were damaged during transport, leading to  additional costs. In addition, representatives knowledgeable of the  replacements in all three states told us that some replacement homes  required unforeseen additional ad hoc construction such as wheelchair  ramps or updates to utilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Energy Savings Alone Did Not Fully Offset the Costs of Replacing Older Manufactured Homes, but Replacements May Have Had Other Benefits", "paragraphs": ["In the three replacement pilot programs we examined, the energy savings  alone were not sufficient to fully offset the costs of replacing older  manufactured homes, but program officials told us that these programs  were not specifically focused on doing so and that they had health and  welfare benefits for beneficiaries. Specifically, the two programs that  maintained information on energy use and estimated savings spent an  average of about $56,119 per unit to replace each older manufactured  home and estimated about $489 in annual energy savings per home.", "The average cost of replacement homes varied across the three  programs we examined. The least costly program we examined was  Montana\u2019s, which replaced some older manufactured homes with used,  but newer and more energy efficient models, with an average cost of  about $42,339 per home. Maine\u2019s replacement program was the most  costly but replaced homes with new Energy Star-qualifying homes, and  cost about $62,024 per home. Officials from all three programs noted that  the costs of a specific replacement can vary widely depending on whether  other site-specific steps are required, such as installing foundations and  upgrading utilities. Because of the varied costs, and the varying extent to  which programs tracked and recorded those costs, we were not able to  consistently compare total replacement costs across programs. Table 2  provides a comparison of the number of replacements, cost per  manufactured home, and estimated annual energy savings, where data  were available.", "Officials reported that the replacement homes in these programs were  significantly more energy efficient, resulting in improved quality of life for  the beneficiaries and significantly lower projected energy costs on a  square foot basis; however, officials in all three states said these energy  savings alone were generally not sufficient to pay for the cost of the  replacement over a typical loan period. In the case of Maine and  Montana, where some beneficiaries paid a monthly payment toward the  cost of their replacement homes, those payments may slightly reduce the  total cost of the program. However, in both cases, officials told us that  those payments were so small that they had little impact in offsetting the  overall total replacement costs across the program, though they may  have offset the costs of a specific replacement.", "In addition, we analyzed costs and projected energy savings for individual  replacement homes where data were available, and we found the data  confirmed that the energy savings were not sufficient to recover the costs  of replacing the homes over a typical loan period.Montana\u2014where the average replacement cost was $42,339\u2014the  average projected energy savings on a replacement home were  estimated to be $1,070 per year. In Maine\u2014where the average cost was  $62,024, the post-replacement energy savings were approximately $240  per year. Newer manufactured homes are often larger, so the total annual  home energy costs increased for some beneficiaries; which may account  for the lower average energy savings in Maine, where all replacement  homes were new. For example, there were six cases in Maine where  annual home energy costs increased by at least $300 per year after  replacement, and three of those six cases increased by more than $500  per year. According to Maine officials, these could have been cases  where a beneficiary\u2019s existing one-bedroom home was replaced by a  new, two- or three-bedroom home. Nonetheless, there were eight cases  in Maine where annual energy costs decreased by more than $500.  Officials overseeing the program in Washington state did not track  estimated or actual energy savings and, as a result, we were not able to  examine those figures for Washington. Washington state officials told us  they did not collect data on home energy costs before and after  replacement because the programs were focused on improving housing  and not on energy savings.", "In addition, these state-funded replacement programs were not designed  to help save LIHEAP funds. Because the eligibility for and level of  LIHEAP benefits are determined primarily by income, replacing older  manufactured homes does not eliminate the beneficiaries\u2019 eligibility for  LIHEAP benefits. State officials informed us that, in virtually all cases, the  beneficiaries of the replacement programs continued to qualify for and  receive LIHEAP benefits. As a result, the replacement of older  manufactured homes with newer, more efficient homes may not eliminate  the need for assistance to recipients in paying their energy bills.", "Nonetheless, state officials told us that these replacement programs were  not specifically designed for energy savings to offset replacement costs,  and some officials told us that energy efficiency gains were secondary to  the health and welfare benefits of getting occupants into safer, more  weather-tight manufactured homes. Program officials cited less  measureable benefits of replacement, including fewer trips to the doctor,  greater physical security; improved safety in the home, especially for  vulnerable beneficiaries; and strengthened community identity. For  example, they told us that beneficiaries of replacement homes reported  being sick less often, reducing the beneficiary\u2019s health bills and\u2014as all  beneficiaries were below the poverty level\u2014public health costs.
