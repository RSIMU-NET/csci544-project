According to GAO's review of CMS records for this period, the majority of these incidents involved such things as electronic probing of CMS systems by potential attackers, which did not lead to compromise of any systems, or the physical or electronic mailing of sensitive information to an incorrect recipient. None of the incidents included evidence that an outside attacker had successfully compromised sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information.", "Consistent with federal guidance, CMS has taken steps to protect the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by the systems and connections supporting Healthcare.gov, including the Federal Data Services Hub (data hub). The data hub is a portal for exchanging information between the federal marketplace and CMS's external partners. To protect these systems, CMS assigned responsibilities to appropriate officials and documented information security policies and procedures.", "However, GAO identified weaknesses in technical controls protecting the data flowing through the data hub. These included", "insufficiently restricted administrator privileges for data hub systems,", "inconsistent application of security patches, and", "insecure configuration of an administrative network.", "GAO also identified additional weaknesses in technical controls that could place sensitive information at risk of unauthorized disclosure, modification, or loss. In a separate report, with limited distribution, GAO recommended 27 actions to mitigate the identified weaknesses.", "In addition, while CMS has taken steps to oversee the security and privacy of data processed and maintained by state-based marketplaces, improvements are needed. For example, CMS assigned roles and responsibilities to various oversight entities, met regularly with state officials, and developed a reporting tool to monitor performance. However, it has not defined specific oversight procedures, such as the timing for when each activity should occur, or what follow-up corrective actions should be performed if deficiencies are identified. Further, CMS does not require sufficiently frequent monitoring of the effectiveness of security controls for state-based marketplaces, only requiring testing once every 3 years.", "GAO identified significant weaknesses in the controls at three selected state-based marketplaces. These included insufficient encryption and inadequately configured firewalls, among others. In September 2015, GAO reported these results to the three states, which generally agreed and have plans in place to address the weaknesses.

Specific controls include, among other  things, those related to identification and authentication of users,  authorization restrictions, and configuration management. As required by  FISMA, NIST has issued guidance for agencies on how to select and  implement controls over their information systems.

For example, it assigned overall responsibility for securing  the agency\u2019s information and systems to appropriate officials, including  the agency Chief Information Officer and Chief Information Security  Officer, and designated information system security officers to assist in  certifying information systems of particular CMS components.
