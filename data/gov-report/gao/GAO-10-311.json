To accomplish this, GAO reviewed asset fielding schedules, test plans and reports, as well as pertinent sections of Department of Defense (DOD) policy to compare MDA's current level of accountability with that of other DOD programs. GAO's fiscal year 2009 assessment of MDA's cost, schedule, and performance progress is more limited than previous assessments because MDA removed key components of schedule and performance goals from its annual report of goals. In addition, though it had committed to, MDA did not report total cost estimates in 2009."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal year 2009 was an unprecedented year of transition for MDA as it experienced its first change of administration, its third MDA Director, shifts in plans for missile defense in Europe as well as a shift in focus for technology development from intercepting missiles during the boost phase to the early intercept phase. Such changes present new challenges for MDA but also opportunities to strengthen acquisition approaches. (1) Progress: MDA achieved several accomplishments. For example, MDA revised its testing approach to better align tests with modeling and simulation needs and undertook a new targets development effort to resolve longstanding problems supplying sufficient and reliable targets. The agency also demonstrated increased levels of performance for some elements through flight and ground testing. Fiscal year 2009 testing indicates an increased level of interoperability among multiple elements, improving both system-level performance and advancing the BMDS models and simulations needed to predict performance. In addition, the agency delivered 83 percent of the assets it planned to deliver by the end of fiscal year 2009. (2) Challenges: While there was progress, all BMDS elements had delays in conducting tests, were unable to accomplish all planned objectives, and experienced performance challenges. Poor target performance continued to be a problem, causing several test delays and leaving several test objectives unfulfilled. The test problems also precluded MDA from gathering key knowledge and affected development of advanced algorithms and homeland defense. These test problems continued to affect the models and simulations used to assess the overall performance of the BMDS. Consequently, comprehensive assessments of its capabilities and limitations are still not possible. MDA also redefined its schedule baseline, eliminating goals for delivering integrated capabilities so we were not able to assess progress in this area. Despite these problems, MDA proceeded with production and fielding of assets. (3) Transparency, Accountability, and Oversight: In 2009, the significant adjustments MDA made to its acquisition approach--terminating the block structure; reducing, eliminating, or not reporting key baselines; and terminating its capability declaration process--and adjustments to the material reported to Congress reduced the transparency and accountability MDA had begun to build. However, MDA is beginning to implement several initiatives--including the adoption of key principles of DOD acquisition regulations--that could improve transparency and accountability and lay the foundation needed for oversight. If these initiatives are implemented in accordance with knowledge-based acquisition principles, an opportunity exits to improve the BMDS acquisition by ensuring MDA programs begin with realistic, transparent plans and baselines. While these initial steps hold promise, they will take time to fully implement and once implemented they will need to be sustained over time and consistently applied."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Fiscal year 2009 was an unprecedented year of transition for the Missile  Defense Agency (MDA) as it experienced its first change of administration,  its third MDA Director, its third Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS)  acquisition strategy, and a reduction of approximately $1 billion from its  annual budget request. Established in 2002 and directed by the President  to \u201cdeploy a set of initial missile defense capabilities beginning in 2004,\u201d  MDA has developed and deployed missile defense capabilities while  struggling to provide the transparency and accountability necessary for  the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) largest single acquisition program\u2014 spending between approximately $7 billion and $9.5 billion per year.", "Since 2002, Congress has directed GAO to assess MDA\u2019s annual fiscal year  cost, schedule, testing, and performance progress in developing the  BMDS.

According to this mandate we are  required to assess MDA\u2019s fiscal year progress against the annual goals it is  required to report to Congress each February. However, as agreed with  your staff, this year we are providing a more limited assessment of MDA\u2019s  progress than we have in the past because MDA removed key components  of the schedule and performance goals it had previously reported from its  annual report of goals. MDA also did not report the total acquisition cost  goals that it had committed to include in this year\u2019s report, nor did it  report top-level test goals.

Although  prior reports have included an assessment of MDA\u2019s cost progress on its  prime contracts, we will report on this analysis in more detail in a separate  report. In addition, given the number, scope and breadth of changes made  to missile defense this year, we discuss those changes as well as their  implications on acquisitions.", "In order to provide some measure of MDA\u2019s progress, given the late and  limited goals established by MDA, we had to determine alternative  comparison points and we discussed these with MDA and our  congressional clients. We assessed MDA\u2019s progress in testing by  comparing the tests conducted against the goals as presented in its  October 2008 Integrated Master Test Plan and the annually submitted  budget justification documents. In terms of performance, we assessed the  capabilities demonstrated through the tests. For schedule, we compared  progress against fiscal year 2008 goals, budget justification material, and  the September 2008 execution master fielding schedule.", "To assess progress during fiscal year 2009, we examined the  accomplishments of eight BMDS elements that MDA is currently  developing and fielding: the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense (Aegis BMD);  Airborne Laser (ABL); BMDS Sensors; Command, Control, Battle  Management, and Communications (C2BMC); Ground-based Midcourse  Defense (GMD); Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS); Targets  and Countermeasures; and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense  (THAAD). These elements collectively account for about 76 percent of  MDA\u2019s research and development budget. We also examined MDA\u2019s  Fiscal Year 2009 BMDS Accountability Report, Program Execution  Reviews, test plans and reports, and production plans. We interviewed  officials within program offices and within MDA functional directorat such as the Directorate for Advanced Technology. In addition, we  discussed the elements\u2019 test programs and results with the BMDS  Operational Test Agency and DOD\u2019s Office of the Director, Operational  Test and Evaluation.", "To follow up on the progress MDA made to improve transparency and  accountability, we held discussions with officials in MDA\u2019s Directorate Business Operations to discuss MDA\u2019s block structure termination. In  addition, we reviewed pertinent DOD policies to compare MDA\u2019s current  level of accountability with that of other DOD programs. We interviewed  officials from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquis Technology and Logistics to discuss its role in conducting quarterly  execution reviews as well as the oversight role of the Missile Defe Executive Board.

Since ballistic missiles have  different ranges, speeds, sizes, and performance characteristics, MDA is  employing an integrated and layered architecture to provide multiple  opportunities to destroy ballistic missiles before they can reach their  targets. The system\u2019s architecture includes networked space-based  sensors as well as ground- and sea-based radars, ground- and sea-based  interceptor missiles, and a command and control, battle management, and  communications network providing the warfighter with the necessary  communication links to the sensors and interceptor missiles.", "A possible engagement scenario to defend against an intercontinental  ballistic missile would occur as follows:  Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume  of a missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible  attack.", "Upon receiving the alert, land-  or sea-based radars are directed to  track the various objects released from the missile and, if so designed,  to identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors,  countermeasures, and debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a kill vehicle mounted atop a  booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat. The interceptor boosts  itself toward a predicted intercept point and releases the kill vehicle.", "The kill vehicle uses its onboard sensors and divert thrusters to detect ead. With a combined closing  identify, and steer itself into the warh speed of approximately 10 kilometers per second (22,000 miles per  hour), the warhead is destroyed above the atmosphere through a to kill\u201d collision with the kill vehicle.", "Some interceptors use sensors to steer themselves into the inbound  ballistic missile. Inside the atmosphere, weapon systems kill the ballistic missile using a range of mechanisms, such as direct collision between the  interceptor missile and the inbound ballistic missile, or using the  combined effects of a blast fragmentation warhead (heat, pressure, and  shrapnel) in cases where a direct hit does not occur.", "In the August 2009 BMDS Accountability Report, MDA presents the BMD performance from the perspectives of homeland defense and  regional/theater capabilities. Homeland defense uses the capabilities of  s  Ground-based Interceptors (GBI), Aegis BMD assets, and BMDS radar against the threat from intercontinental and intermediate-range ballist ic  missiles, while regional and theater defense use Aegis BMD Standard  Missile-3 (SM-3) and THAAD interceptors with mobile radars against  threats from medium-range missiles and short-range ballistic missiles.", "Table 1 provides a brief description of eight BMDS elements that are  currently under development by MDA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Significant Adjustments Made to Missile Defense in Fiscal Year 2009", "paragraphs": ["The new administration proposed significant changes to the BMDS  program in 2009 including program terminations and changes to some of  the BMDS elements we reported on in the past, as well as changes to plans  for missile defense in Europe. Administration proposals culminated in  reductions of approximately $1 billion from MDA\u2019s budget request for  fiscal year 2010. In the spring of 2009, the Secretary of Defense  recommended termination of the Multiple Kill Vehicle element. Originally  designed as an optional warhead for all midcourse interceptors, MDA  terminated the Multiple Kill Vehicle element because of feasibility issues  raised about this technology, which was still in its early stages of  development, as well as a decision to refocus MDA\u2019s resources on new  technologies aimed at early intercept of ballistic missiles. MDA also  terminated its Kinetic Energy Interceptor element because of technical  issues, its incompatibility with operational infrastructures, and delays  during development. It was originally designed as a mobile land-based  missile defense system to destroy medium, intermediate, and  intercontinental ballistic missiles during the boost and midcourse phases  of their flight. The ABL program was also significantly affected by the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s proposal to designate it as a technology program  and cancel the plans for the purchase of a second aircraft that would have  provided an operational capability. In addition, MDA requested increased  funding for the Aegis BMD and THAAD programs for fiscal year 2010  following administration recommendations. MDA plans to use these funds  to move both elements toward meeting full funding policies, to increase  production for Aegis BMD and THAAD interceptors, to increase the  interceptor production rate and number of THAAD batteries, and to  increase the number of Aegis BMD ships.", "MDA is also responding to the new administration\u2019s shift in its approach to  European missile defense. In September 2009, DOD altered its approach to  European defense, which originally focused on GBIs from the GMD  element and a large fixed radar as well as transportable X-Band radars,  and is now focusing on providing defenses against long-range threats to  the United States and short-, medium-, and intermediate-range Iranian  threats to Europe. This new \u201cPhased, Adaptive Approach\u201d consists  primarily of Aegis BMD sea-based and land-based systems and  interceptors, as well as various sensors to be deployed over time as the  various capabilities are matured. According to DOD, this new approach  offers a number of improvements over the previous architecture, such as  providing missile defenses sooner with greater flexibility to meet evolving  threats, providing more opportunities to involve close allies, and delivering  greater capability to defend against a large number of threat missiles.", "In addition, during fiscal year 2009, MDA transitioned to a new Director  and the agency\u2019s development effort was rebalanced to focus more on  regional/theater missile defense. This rebalancing included shifting  technology development efforts from boost-phase intercept technologies  to early intercept technologies (or ascent phase). MDA officials state that  because early intercept technology initiates intercept as early as possible  to execute a shoot-look-shoot tactic and defeat a threat before  countermeasures are deployed, it will ultimately reduce the number of  interceptors required to defeat a raid of threat missiles and save on the  costs of maintaining a significant number of expensive interceptors to  destroy advanced countermeasures in a later phase of a threat missile\u2019s  flight. According to the MDA Director, this technology will force the  deployment of countermeasures early in flight where they are less  effective.", "In June 2009, MDA also began to change its acquisition management  strategy. From its inception in 2002 to December 2007, MDA managed the  acquisition of missile defense capabilities by organizing the development  effort into 2-year increments known as blocks. Each block was intended to  provide the BMDS with capabilities that enhanced the development and  overall performance of the system. The first 2-year block\u2014Block 2004\u2014 fielded a limited initial capability that included early versions of the GMD,  Aegis BMD, Patriot Advanced Capability-3, and C2BMC elements as well  as various sensors. The agency\u2019s second 2-year block\u2014Block 2006\u2014 culminated on December 31, 2007, and fielded additional BMDS assets. On  December 7, 2007, according to MDA in response to recommendations  from GAO, MDA\u2019s Director announced a new acquisition management  strategy to better communicate its plans and goals to Congress. The  agency\u2019s new approach was based on fielding capabilities that address  particular threats as opposed to a biennial time period. This approach  divided fielding capabilities into five blocks.", "The capabilities-based five-block approach included several positive  changes, including the commitment by DOD to establish total acquisition  costs and unit cost for selected block assets, including in a block only  those elements or components that will be fielded during the block, and  abandoning the practice of deferring work from one block to another.  MDA was still transitioning to this new capabilities-based block approach  when the MDA Director terminated it in June 2009\u2014a year and a half after  it was created. According to MDA, the agency terminated the capability- based block structure to address the explanatory statement accompanying  the Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 2009, which stated that  MDA\u2019s \u201cjustification materials should no longer be presented in the Block  format, but rather by fiscal year for each activity within the program  element.\u201d The agency has decided that it will manage the BMDS as a single  integrated program and is in the process of determining how it will  implement changes to its acquisition management strategy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Progress Made in Fiscal Year 2009", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009, MDA achieved several noteworthy accomplishments.

In March 2009 we reported that MDA\u2019s Integrated  Master Test Plan\u2014its test baseline\u2014was not effective for management  and oversight because it was revised frequently, only extended through the  following fiscal year and was not well integrated with other key aspects of  testing such as target acquisitions. Most of the annual revisions to the test  baseline were occurring either because MDA changed the substance of  tests, changed the timing of tests, or added tests to the baseline. In other  instances, MDA canceled planned tests which also affected the test  baseline. In addition, the BMDS Operational Test Agency identified several  limitations in the previous BMDS test program, including unaccredited  models and simulations, flight test artificialities, and inadequate modeling  of some environmental conditions.", "Members of Congress also expressed concern with MDA\u2019s test approach.  For example, in the fiscal year 2008 National Defense Authorization Act  conference report, conferees noted that MDA failed to ensure an adequate  testing program and that its test and targets program needed to be  managed in a way that fully supported high-priority near-term programs.", "MDA extensively revised its test plan in fiscal year 2009 to address many  of these concerns. For example, the new Integrated Master Test Plan  bases test scenarios on modeling and simulation needs and extends the  test baseline through 2015, which allows for better estimation of target  needs, range requirements, and test assets. As part of the revised test plan,  MDA scheduled dedicated periods of developmental and operational  testing, during which the system configuration will remain fixed to allow  the warfighter to carry out training, tactics, techniques, and procedures for  developmental and operational evaluation. Additionally, the new test plan  will provide sufficient time after test events to conduct a full post-test  analysis.

According to the Director of MDA, this new target approach is based on  streamlining a set of classes of targets to increase quality control of an  inventory of identical targets that represent general threat characteristics  to account for intelligence uncertainties. He further stated that a goal of  the new target acquisition strategy is to minimize the number of targets  needed to emulate specific threats and establish backup targets, which  will be available in 2012.", "Targets have been a recurring cause of flight test delays, cancellations, and  failures since 2006. In the past, we reported that the THAAD program was  unable to achieve its first intercept attempt in 2006 because the target  malfunctioned. The program also experienced target anomalies in 2007  that precluded the completion of two radar characterization tests. During  the same year, the GMD program experienced long-term effects on its  flight test schedule when it was unable to achieve all primary test  objectives because of a target failure. We also reported in March 2009 that  the Aegis BMD program was unable to conduct an intercept because the  target was not available. In addition, in its January 2009 report to the  defense committees, MDA acknowledged target availability and reliability  problems and reported its plan for a new target acquisition strategy to  address these issues and improve costs, quality, and reliability.", "In revising its target acquisition strategy, MDA solicited input from  industry in an effort to better understand possible new target solutions  that might be available to improve cost, quality, and performance. To  leverage industry capability and promote a more competitive contract  environment, MDA decided to use multiple contractors with multiple  contracts instead of a single prime contract, increasing its flexibility to  respond to changing program requirements. The agency plans to award a  new contract for each class of target needed to execute the BMDS test  plan. MDA will begin making decisions on contract awards and new target  designs over the next year. According to program officials, MDA originally  planned to issue five requests for proposals for new contracts in fiscal year  2010 and one additional request in fiscal year 2011. However, to reflect  changes in the test plan and subsequent changes to the acquisition  strategy, the program now plans to issue two requests for proposals in  fiscal year 2010 and one in fiscal year 2011. The Targets and  Countermeasures program anticipates that the first targets will be  delivered under the new strategy in fiscal year 2012, and the first  intercontinental ballistic missile target is expected to be delivered in fiscal  year 2013.", "MDA also made progress in several ongoing target development efforts  that could enhance the ability to test the BMDS. During fiscal year 2009,  the Targets and Countermeasures program made progress in developing  four new targets\u2014the LV-2 target, Aegis Readiness Assessment Vehicle-C  target, a new medium range target, and the Extended-Long Range Air  Launched Target. Each target adds a new capability to MDA\u2019s target  portfolio. For example, the LV-2 target provides the potential for  significantly expanding the intermediate range payload and range  performance over current inventory capabilities. The Aegis Readiness  Assessment Vehicle-C target provides a new, low-cost capability as it is  designed to contribute additional separating and maneuvering capabilities  in short- and medium-range targets. MDA\u2019s new Medium Range Target  provides improved kill assessment capability at this range. In addition,  the new Extended-Long Range Air Launched Target is a medium-range  target that provides a greater range capability than previous air-launched  targets and adds the ability to deploy associated objects\u2014a capability not  currently available in other similar target types.

These tests marked the first  time ABL demonstrated a complete low-power engagement sequence  against a boosting target. In addition, the ABL was able to demonstrate its  ability to fire its high energy laser in an airborne environment during a  flight test in August 2009. During this test, the laser was fired into a  calorimeter on board the aircraft to capture the laser\u2019s energy and  measure performance characteristics of the laser\u2019s beam.", "The Aegis BMD program also demonstrated increased levels of element  performance through Navy fleet exercises and developmental tests. For  example, Aegis BMD demonstrated, for the first time, its capability to  destroy a ballistic missile in the terminal phase of flight using Standard  Missile-2 Block IV missiles while simultaneously conducting a mission  using the Standard Missile-2 Block IIIA missile against a cruise missile  target. The program also conducted successful developmental component  tests for the next generation of the Aegis BMD interceptor\u2014the SM-3  Block IB. Developmental testing will continue into 2010. In addition, the  program successfully demonstrated that the latest software release of the  Aegis BMD system had the capability to support the program\u2019s next  generation interceptor during simulated SM-3 Block IB engagements.", "The C2BMC program also satisfied multiple test objectives and increased  its capability in fiscal year 2009. The program participated in many system- level tests during the year that enabled it to demonstrate multiple  capabilities, including improved situational awareness and sensor  management. During testing, C2BMC used multi-sensor correlation and  provided integrated situational awareness for weapons release decisions.", "GMD, for the first time, used information from multiple sensors to develop  and successfully conduct an intercept of a live target during a flight test. In  December 2008, target information from four different sensors and  satellite data were input into the GMD fire control system to develop an  intercept plan. The involvement of multiple sensors provides better  information to develop an engagement. In addition, GMD made progress in  addressing BMDS Operational Test Agency concerns regarding the  formatting, tracking, and accounting of messages from GMD sensors. For  example, MDA added test instrumentation to collect data for  regional/theater tests communications. However, the agency still faces  ongoing challenges assessing timeliness with the exchange of messages at  the strategic level. According to BMDS Operational Test Agency officials,  they continue to work with MDA to resolve this issue. Key to the  integration and functionality of the BMDS is communications and message  traffic. The timely reception of messages from sensors to weapon systems  is key to support decisions and achieve effective intercepts. In March 2009,  we reported that these data management problems prevented the analysis  of the timeliness of message data, according to BMDS Operational Test  Agency officials.", "The STSS program successfully completed the ground testing and  integration of components to support the launch of its two demonstration  satellites in September 2009.

This test was also designed to demonstrate a  long-flight time for the GBI and GMD\u2019s capability against  countermeasures. In early 2009, MDA altered the target to present a more  representative threat.

In addition, a Short Range Air Launch  Target planned for use in a third quarter fiscal year 2009 THAAD flight test FTT-11, had a component failure and subsequently needed to be  requalified.

Program officials told us that they would have cost,  schedule, and performance baselines finalized and documented as part of  the decision to proceed with new contract awards. These baselines,  however, will be very detailed and spread across multiple documents and  therefore are unsuitable for internal and external oversight. The officials  further stated that they do not intend to establish top-level cost, schedule,  and performance baseline measures similar to approved program  baselines that are established for DOD\u2019s major defense acquisitions to  provide accountability. In September 2008, we reported that MDA had  difficulty in developing and supplying new targets in part because a sound  business case was not developed before significant decisions were made.  In that report we recommended that MDA develop cost, schedule and  performance baselines as part of an effort to establish a sound business  case for each new class of target under development.", "As part of the new target development efforts, MDA also developed a new  cost model.

These tests were designed with  characteristics needed for radar observation in support of advanced  discrimination algorithm development. However, target problems  prevented an opportunity for the radar to exercise all of the planned  algorithms, causing a loss of expected data. Similarly, in a 2008 sensor  characterization test, the target failed to release its countermeasures,  which prevented the sensors from collecting expected data. Consequently,  MDA was unable to fully develop discrimination algorithms as planned.", "In fiscal year 2009, MDA continued to be unable to develop its advanced  algorithms as planned as key tests that were designed to reduce the  maturation risk were affected by targets.

MDA also delayed the other planned flight test,  FTG-06, beyond fiscal year 2009 because of target issues and an anomaly  with a component of the Sea-Based X-band radar. As of June 2009, MDA  estimated this test to cost over $236 million while the Defense Contract  Management Agency estimated the cost to exceed $310 million.

In establishing MDA in 2002, the  Secretary of Defense directed the agency to develop the BMDS as a single  program using a capabilities-based, spiral upgrade approach to quickly  deliver a set of integrated defensive capabilities. To accomplish this  mission, MDA was granted exceptional flexibility in setting requirements  and managing the acquisition. This flexibility allowed MDA to begin  delivering an initial defensive capability in 2004, but at the expense of  transparency and accountability.", "Since our first MDA report in 2004, we have repeatedly found that MDA\u2019s  approach for building its cost, schedule, and performance goals hindered  transparency and limited accountability of the BMDS development effort.  Specifically in April 2004, we reported that MDA\u2019s goals did not provide a  reliable and complete baseline for accountability purposes and decision  making because these goals varied year to year, did not include all  associated costs, and were based on assumptions about performance that  were not explicitly stated. These conclusions still hold true for several  aspects of the BMDS acquisition strategy. For example, MDA\u2019s goals  change continuously, cost baselines have yet to be established, and some  details regarding performance goals are still not explicitly stated. Since  2004, we have also made recommendations to develop baselines and  report variances to those baselines to promote a higher level of  transparency and accountability for the agency; to adjust its block strategy  to ensure that it was knowledge-based and aligned with agency goals; and  to strengthen oversight by, for example, having the Missile Defense  Executive Board (MDEB) consider the extent to which MDA could adapt  and adopt aspects of DOD\u2019s standard acquisition policies to enhance  oversight.", "Members of Congress have also expressed concerns regarding the block  strategy, acquisition management strategy, accountability, and oversight of  MDA. For example, in 2007, the House Appropriations Committee directed  MDA to \u201cdevelop a system-wide plan to report according to the spirit of  existing acquisition laws to improve accountability and transparency of its  program.\u201d More recently, in the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008, Congress required MDA to establish acquisition cost,  schedule, and performance baselines for each system element that has  entered the equivalent of the systems development and demonstration  phase of acquisition or is being produced or acquired for operational  fielding. MDA is not yet fully compliant with this requirement. However,  officials indicated that they are working toward fulfilling this requirement,  but the expected date for full compliance was unknown at the time of our  audit.", "While MDA has committed to take actions to address concerns about  accountability and transparency, it has made limited progress in  implementation, as shown in table 6.", "MDA\u2019s termination of its capabilities-based block approach in June 2009  marked the third acquisition management strategy for the BMDS in the last  3 years and effectively reduced transparency and accountability for the  agency. As previously noted, MDA has organized the development of the  BMDS using two different block approaches in the past\u2014(1) sequential 2- year blocks of BMDS-wide integrated capabilities and (2) five capabilities- based blocks of different MDA elements against particular threats.  Changing the block structure is problematic because each time the block  structure is changed, the connection is obscured between the old block  structure\u2019s scope and resources and the new block structure\u2019s rearranged  scope and resources. This makes it difficult for decision makers to hold  MDA accountable for expected outcomes and clouds transparency of the  agency\u2019s efforts.", "In March 2008, we reported that the agency\u2019s capabilities-based block  approach had begun to provide improvements to transparency and  accountability, but as we recommended, transparency and accountability  could have been further improved with MDA\u2019s development and reporting  of full acquisition cost estimates as well as independent verification of  those costs."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New MDA Initiatives Provide Opportunity to Increase Transparency and Accountability", "paragraphs": ["Although key controls and mechanisms needed to establish a sound  acquisition process for MDA are still lacking, MDA has initiatives  underway that could improve the transparency, accountability, and  oversight of the acquisition of the BMDS. In June 2009, the MDA Director  testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee that MDA is  responding to the Weapon System Acquisition Reform Act of 2009  through the establishment of acquisition milestone decisions. These  decisions are designed to ensure appropriate competitive acquisition  strategies. He further noted that as the Acquisition Executive for the initial  phases of missile defense, he is implementing milestone review and  baseline reporting processes that are closely aligned with the principles of  DOD\u2019s acquisition policies, commonly referred to as the DOD 5000 series.  He further noted that he recognized the need to incorporate the tenets of  the DOD 5000 series to ensure that programs are affordable, are justified  by the warfighter, and demonstrate acceptable risk through a milestone  review process overseen by the MDEB. He also stated that MDA intends to  separate the management of its technology and development programs.  The Director testified that under his authority, potential programs that  may provide technological or material solutions for MDA will undergo a  Milestone \u201cA\u201d decision to determine if they should become programs.  These technology-based programs will be managed by knowledge points  and incubated until maturity, at which time MDA along with the service  acquisition executive will be able to make a Milestone \u201cB\u201d decision as to  whether the program should be converted to a development program. He  explained that the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics will make Milestone \u201cC\u201d production decisions regarding the  programs.", "We were only able to obtain limited insight into these initiatives because  the agency only determined how they will be implemented at the end of  our audit and was just beginning to implement them. In regards to the  milestone decisions, the Director of MDA indicated that the agency is  undertaking a baseline phase review process. The agency is transitioning  to managing the six developmental baselines at the project element level.  These baselines will be approved in developmental baseline reviews and  managed through quarterly performance element reviews. MDA has  identified three phases of development where baselines are approved\u2014 technology development, product development, and initial production  phases\u2014which may ensure that the appropriate level of knowledge is  obtained before acquisitions move from one phase to the next. Approval of  the product development and initial production baselines will be jointly  reviewed by the Director of MDA and the respective service acquisition  executive. In addition, while our draft was being reviewed by MDA, the  Director of MDA provided us with initial information regarding the  definition of these new phases and the process for establishing cost,  schedule, or performance baselines. Based on our initial briefing on MDA\u2019s  new process, it may include many of the necessary elements of a sound  business case\u2014such as establishing top-level cost, schedule, and  performance measures that are available internally and externally for  oversight.", "Although we were unable to fully evaluate MDA\u2019s new initiatives, these  initiatives do offer an opportunity for the agency to increase transparency  and accountability if they are implemented in accordance with knowledge- based acquisition principles, leading to the establishment of sound  business cases and realistic baselines.", "Over the past 10 years, we have conducted extensive research on  successful programs and have found that successful defense programs  ensure that their acquisitions begin with realistic plans and baselines prior  to the start of development. We have previously reported that the key  cause of poor weapon system outcomes, at the program level, is the  consistent lack of disciplined analysis that would provide an  understanding of what it would take to field a weapon system before  system development begins. We have reported that there is a clear set of  prerequisites that must be met by each program\u2019s acquisition strategy to  realize successful outcomes. These prerequisites include the following:    Establishing a clear, knowledge-based, executable business case for  the product. An executable business case is one that provides  demonstrated evidence that (1) the identified needs are real and  necessary and can best be met with the chosen concept and (2) the  chosen concept can be developed and produced within existing  resources\u2014including technologies, funding, time, and management  capacity. Knowledge-based acquisition principles and business cases  combined are necessary to establish realistic cost, schedule and  performance baselines. Without documented realistic baselines there  is no foundation to accurately measure program progress.", "Separating technology development activities from product  development activities. As noted earlier, the Director of MDA plans to  separate technology development and product development for the  BMDS. The process of developing technology culminates in  discovery\u2014the gathering of knowledge\u2014and must, by its nature, allow  room for unexpected results and delays. When immature technologies  are brought onto the critical path of product development programs  too early, they often cause long delays in an environment where large  workforces must be employed; complex tools, plants, and facilities  must be operated; long and expensive supplier networks must be paid;  and the product itself must sometimes be redesigned once the final  form of the technologies is known. Ensuring that only mature  technologies are brought into product development is a key step for  successful programs.", "Employing early systems engineering discipline in order to develop  realistic cost and schedule estimates prior to development start.  Early systems engineering provides the knowledge a product  developer needs to identify and resolve performance and resource  gaps before product development begins, either by reducing  requirements, deferring them to the future, or increasing the estimated  cost for the weapon system\u2019s development. Requirements that are too  risky given the state of technology and design should not be allowed  into this expensive environment. MDA\u2019s Director noted that he has  taken steps to enhance systems engineering by designating a senior  executive position to establish engineering policy, ensure the  disciplined practice of systems engineering fundamentals, and develop  the systems engineering competencies of the missile defense  workforce; creating knowledge centers; and increasing the number of  recent engineering school graduates. While these initiatives hold  promise for the future, they could provide further enhancements if  they are used as the foundation to develop realistic cost and schedule  estimates for the BMDS.", "These practices could address MDA\u2019s past problems of initiating programs  and beginning system development based on limited systems engineering  knowledge. These programs depended on critical technologies that were  immature and not ready for product development or production.

This flexibility has allowed concurrent  development, testing, manufacturing and fielding and enabled MDA to  quickly develop and field the first increment of capability in 2005.  However, while this approach has expedited the fielding of assets, it also  resulted in less transparency and accountability than is normally present  in a major weapon program. Since the program\u2019s inception, MDA\u2019s lack of  baselines and its management of the BMDS with high levels of uncertainty  about requirements and program cost estimates effectively set the missile  defense program on a path to an undefined destination at an unknown  cost. Across the agency, these practices left programs with limited  knowledge and few opportunities for crucial management oversight and  decision making concerning the agency\u2019s investment and the warfighter\u2019s  continuing needs. At the program level, these practices contributed to  quality problems affecting targets acquisitions, which in turn, hampered  MDA\u2019s ability to conduct tests as planned.", "As MDA transitions to new leadership, a new acquisition strategy, a new  test strategy, and a shift in emphasis toward early intercept capabilities,  the agency has an opportunity to chart a course that enables transparency  and accountability as well as flexibility, and it appears committed to doing  so. Importantly, the Director of MDA has begun new initiatives in  accordance with guiding principles of DOD\u2019s acquisition policies, which  already embrace knowledge-based practices and sound management  controls. The Director of MDA intends to apply these new policies to each  element or appropriate portions of the elements, as is currently done  across DOD, in order to provide a foundation for the Congress and others  to assess progress and hold senior leadership accountable for outcomes.", "These initial steps are promising, but it will take time to fully implement  them and once implemented they will need to be sustained and the tools  consistently used in order to establish accountability. If this is done  effectively, with baselines set at a program level, MDA can respond to  strategic changes affecting the overall configuration of the system without  losing basic knowledge about cost, schedule, and performance. Such  actions do not have to result in a slower or more burdensome acquisition  process. In the past, weapon programs often rushed into systems  development before they were ready, in part because DOD\u2019s acquisition  process did not require early formal milestone reviews and programs  would rarely be terminated once underway. Over time, in fact, these  changes could help programs replace risk with knowledge, thereby  increasing the chances of developing weapon systems within cost and  schedule targets while meeting user needs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["As MDA implements its initiatives to improve transparency, accountability,  and oversight, and begins efforts to manage and oversee MDA at the  element level, we recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct MDA to  take the following eight actions:    Establish cost, schedule, and performance baselines for the acquisition  of each new class of target when it is approved by the Director prior to  proceeding with acquisition and report those baselines to Congress.", "Obtain independent Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation cost  estimates in support of these cost baselines.", "Ensure that program acquisition unit costs for BMDS assets are  reported in the BMDS Accountability Report, to provide Congress with  more complete and comprehensive information by including  development costs.", "Update DOD\u2019s Plan to Enhance the Accountability and Transparency  of the Ballistic Missile Defense Program to reflect MDA\u2019s current  initiatives and include dates for fulfilling each commitment.", "Report top-level test goals for each element, or appropriate portions  thereof, to Congress in the next BMDS Accountability Report.", "Develop and report to Congress in the annual BMDS Accountability  Report a measure for schedule baseline goals that incorporates  delivering integrated capabilities to the warfighter.", "Develop and report to Congress in the annual BMDS Accountability  Report the dates at which performance baselines will be achieved.", "Report to Congress variances against all established baselines.", "Several of these actions, such as establishing cost, schedule, and  performance baselines, have been recommended in prior GAO reports or  addressed in legislation.

The department noted that these baselines are  contained in multiple documents and will be brought together in a Target  Program Baseline prior to contract award. However, MDA should ensure  that the Target Program Baseline establishes top-level cost, schedule, and  performance baseline measures similar to approved program baselines  that are established for DOD\u2019s major defense acquisitions and available for  internal and external oversight.

In response to this recommendation, DOD stated that  manufacturing of SM-3 Block IB missiles to support testing is under way,  but the production decision for SM-3 Block IB missiles used for fleet  operation is planned to occur after criteria listed in our recommendation  have been met. However, during our review, we found that the 18 SM-3  Block IB missiles in question were originally justified in the fiscal year  2010 budget request as needed for \u201cflight testing and for delivery to the  fleet as operational assets.\u201d In addition, Aegis BMD Program Office  responses related to this matter indicate that these missiles will be used  operationally if a security situation requires it. Furthermore, according to  MDA\u2019s September 2009 SM-3 Block IB utilization plan briefed and  approved by the MDA Acquisition Strategy Board, only 2 of these missiles  are specifically designated for flight tests, while 10 are to be used for fleet  deployment and 6 are to be used for either fleet proficiency training or  fleet deployment.
