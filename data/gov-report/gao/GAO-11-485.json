As of March 25, 2011, $191 billion of this $275 billion had been paid out. GAO was asked to determine if Recovery Act contract and grant recipients have unpaid federal taxes and, if so, to (1) determine, to the extent possible, the magnitude of known federal tax debt which is owed by Recovery Act contract and grant recipients; and, (2) provide examples of Recovery Act contract and grant recipients who have known unpaid federal taxes. To determine, to the extent possible, the magnitude of known tax debt owed by Recovery Act contract and grant recipients, GAO identified contract and grant recipients from www.recovery.gov and compared them to known tax debts as of September 30, 2009, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). To provide examples of Recovery Act recipients with known unpaid federal taxes, GAO chose a nonrepresentative selection of 30 Recovery Act contract and grant recipients, which were then narrowed to 15 based on a number of factors, including the amount of taxes owed and the number of delinquent tax periods.

This represented nearly 5 percent of the approximately 80,000 contractors and grant recipients in the data from www.Recovery.gov as of July 2010 that GAO reviewed. Federal law does not prohibit the awarding of contracts or grants to entities because they owe federal taxes and does not permit IRS to disclose taxpayer information, including unpaid federal taxes, to federal agencies unless the taxpayer consents. The estimated amount of known unpaid federal taxes is likely understated because IRS databases do not include amounts owed by recipients who have not filed tax returns or understated their taxable income and for which IRS has not assessed tax amounts due. In addition, GAO's analysis does not include Recovery Act contract and grant recipients who are noncompliant with or not subject to Recovery Act reporting requirements. GAO selected 15 Recovery Act recipients for further investigation. For the 15 cases, GAO found abusive or potentially criminal activity, i.e., recipients had failed to remit payroll taxes to IRS. Federal law requires employers to hold payroll tax money \"in trust\" before remitting it to IRS. Failure to remit payroll taxes can result in civil or criminal penalties under U.S. law. The amount of unpaid taxes associated with these case studies were about $40 million, ranging from approximately $400,000 to over $9 million. IRS has taken collection or enforcement activities (e.g., filing of federal tax liens) against all 15 of these recipients. GAO has referred all 15 recipients to IRS for further investigation, if warranted."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Individuals, businesses, and other entities owed the U.S. government  about $330 billion in known unpaid taxes, including interest and penalties,  as of September 30, 2010, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

We  also obtained known tax debt data from IRS as of September 30, 2009. To  determine the extent to which Recovery Act contract and grant recipients  had known unpaid federal taxes, we used the taxpayer identification  number (TIN) as a unique identifier, and electronically matched IRS\u2019s tax  debt data to the population of Recovery Act contract and grant recipients.

Because we considered the number of  delinquent tax periods in selecting these 15 recipients, we were more  likely to select recipients who owed primarily payroll taxes; our prior  work has shown delinquent payroll taxes to be an indicator of potential  abusive or criminal activity.

To  implement these requirements, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) worked with the newly established Recovery Board to deploy a  nationwide system at www.federalreporting.gov (FederalReporting.gov)  for collecting data submitted by the recipients of funds. OMB set the  specific time line for recipients to submit reports and for agencies to  review the data. Recipients are required to submit the reports in the month  after the close of a quarter, and, by the end of the month, the data are to be  reviewed by federal agencies for material omissions or significant  reporting errors before being posted to the publicly accessible  Recovery.gov.

According to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), a  responsible prospective contractor is a contractor that meets certain  specific criteria, including having adequate financial resources and a  satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics. However, the FAR  does not currently require contracting officers to take into account a  contractor\u2019s tax debt when assessing whether a prospective contractor is  responsible and does not currently require contracting officers to  determine if federal contractors have unpaid federal taxes at the time a  contract is awarded.

Subsequent legislation  increased the maximum allowable levy amount to 100 percent for  payments to federal contractors and other vendors for goods or services  sold or leased to the federal government. The continuous levy program,  now referred to as the Federal Payment Levy Program (FPLP), was  implemented in 2000. Under the FPLP, each week IRS sends the  Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service (FMS) an  extract of its tax debt files. These files are uploaded into the Treasury  Offset Program. FMS sends payment data to this offset program to be  matched against unpaid federal taxes.

Cases excluded from the FPLP for statutory  reasons include tax debt that had not completed IRS\u2019s notification  process, or tax debtors who filed for bankruptcy protection or other  litigation, who agreed to pay their tax debt through monthly installment  payments, or who requested to pay less than the full amount owed through  an offer in compromise. Cases excluded from the FPLP for policy  reasons include those tax debtors whom IRS has determined to be in  financial hardship, those filing an amended return, certain cases under  criminal investigation, and those cases in which IRS has determined that  the specific circumstances of the cases warrant excluding it from the  FPLP."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Recovery Act Contract and Grant Recipients Are Estimated to Owe More Than $750 Million in Known Unpaid Federal Taxes", "paragraphs": ["At least 3,700 recipients of Recovery Act contracts and grants are  estimated to owe $757 million in known unpaid federal taxes as of  September 30, 2009, though this amount is likely understated for reasons  discussed below.
