Specifically, each fiscal year, hundreds of VA facilities individually enter their mail expenditure and volume data into a GSA database that collects mail data from federal agencies. These data are collected through inconsistent processes. For example, some facilities use mailing equipment and associated software that can automatically track volume and costs by service provider and mail class, while other facilities' equipment may be too old to have this capability or they use spreadsheets, bills, or receipts to track their costs. These processes are inconsistent because VA's different components and facilities contract for mailroom equipment independently of one another. VA lacks an overall plan to procure mailing equipment strategically. Through such procurement, VA could implement a system that would more consistently track data on mail expenditures and volume. This step would not only improve the reliability of these data but could also allow VA to take advantage of price discounts typically available under broader contracts.", "Measuring performance : VA is unable to evaluate the overall efficiency of its mail program because its mail management policy does not include agency-wide goals and performance measures for its mail operations, and it has inconsistent measures across its facilities. For example, of the 10 VA facilities GAO reviewed, some assessed performance using customer service, efficiency, volume, and cost, while others used annual expenditures, among other measures. Updating the policy to include agency-wide goals and performance measures would allow VA to track progress toward consistent goals and provide it with crucial performance information needed to make programmatic decisions.", "Mail managers with appropriate authority and responsibilities : VA's ability to oversee mailing practices across its facilities is limited because it has not provided its mail managers with appropriate authority and responsibilities, per federal internal control standards. The agency mail manager's responsibilities are limited to oversight of VA's mail policy, with no operational role in mail management. Additionally, mail managers for the Veterans Health Administration and Veterans Benefits Administration reported that they advise individual facilities on mail management but have no authority to direct their mail operations.

Given the  growth in reported mail costs, you asked us to review VA\u2019s mail  management practices. This report examines the extent to which VA  manages its outgoing mail effectively.", "To perform this work, we identified key elements of an effective mail  management program by reviewing federal mail management  requirements in the Federal Management Regulation (FMR), which  governs mailing activities in federal agencies. The applicable elements  from the FMR are: (1) reporting reliable mail data, (2) measuring  performance, and (3) having mail managers with the authority to manage  the program. We also identified applicable federal internal control  standards, including the control environment, control activities, and  information and communications. To determine the extent to which VA  has effectively implemented these key elements and internal controls as  part of its mail management program, we obtained and reviewed key  documents, such as VA\u2019s mail management policy and contract  documentation for the Veterans Health Administration\u2019s (VHA)  Consolidated Mail Outpatient Pharmacy (CMOP) program. We also  conducted interviews with management officials from the VA Central  Office, the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), VHA, and the CMOP  program on mail management practices in different components and  facilities across the agency. We also interviewed officials from the U.S.  Postal Service (USPS) and VA\u2019s two primary mailing equipment  providers, Neopost and Pitney Bowes. We reviewed the reliability of the  mail expenditure and volume data VA reported to the General Services  Administration\u2019s (GSA) Simplified Mail Accountability Reporting Tool  (SMART) in fiscal years 2015 and 2016. The SMART tool is used by  GSA to collect mail data from federal agencies, as part of GSA\u2019s efforts to  oversee federal mail practices and ensure that agencies are managing  their mail operations efficiently and effectively. In an effort to assess the  validity of VA\u2019s reported mail volume and costs, we reviewed VA\u2019s  reported fiscal year 2015 and 2016 expenditure and volume data with its  service providers, USPS, United Parcel Service (UPS), and FedEx. To  supplement our work at the national level, we collected information on the  mail practices in place at the 10 VA facilities with the highest mail volume  reported in SMART in fiscal year 2015. We collected information from  each facility including on their SMART-reporting process, their use of  performance measures for mail operations, and the role of facility mail  managers. We observed mail operations and interviewed mailroom  personnel at a VBA regional benefit office and a VHA medical center.  While findings from these facilities are not generalizable to all VA  facilities, they provide examples of VA\u2019s mailing practices. To obtain  information on GSA\u2019s oversight of VA\u2019s mail management efforts, we  interviewed officials responsible for mail management policy from GSA\u2019s  Office of Government-Wide Policy. Finally, to learn about issues veterans  may face in receiving mail from VA, we interviewed representatives of  and obtained information from Disabled American Veterans and the  American Legion.

See figure 1 for a description of the services each  administration and their associated facilities provide, and examples of  outgoing mail.", "VA sends hundreds of millions of pieces of mail annually as part of its  mission to provide care and benefits to veterans and their dependents.  For example, VBA mails correspondence related to compensation and  copies of documents to veterans service organizations, and VHA mails  prescription medications and letters to notify veterans of medical  appointments. Within VHA, the CMOP program processes high-volume  prescription mailings from medical centers using an automated  dispensing system. The CMOP program includes seven facilities across  the country that together mail 84 million parcels annually (filling  approximately 80 percent of VA\u2019s total prescriptions each year).", "Within VA, each administration and local facility has discretion regarding  how to handle outgoing mail. For example, a facility can use USPS as its  service provider, or it can choose to use a different service provider, such  as UPS or FedEx. SMART data indicate that most of VA\u2019s outgoing mail  was sent via USPS in fiscal year 2016, although VA facilities also used  UPS and FedEx. In addition to choosing service providers, VA facilities often have contracts to purchase or lease mailing equipment such as  postage meters. As noted above, the CMOP program handles large- scale prescription mailings and contracts with a vendor that provides mail- manifesting services (i.e., the weighing and application of pre-paid  postage or freight charges to parcels, and the delivery of parcels to USPS  or a third-party carrier) for the seven CMOP facilities.", "VA, as any other federal agency, is required to follow certain provisions in  the FMR regulating mail management. Specifically, the FMR prescribes  policy and requirements for the effective, economical, and secure  management of incoming, internal, and outgoing mail and materials in  federal agencies. Among other things, the FMR includes reporting,  performance measurement, and agency mail manager requirements.", "Reporting Requirements: Large federal agencies must provide annual  mail management reports to GSA using the web-based SMART  application. The FMR requires large agencies to submit mail  management reports to ensure agencies have the policies,  procedures, and data to manage their mail operations efficiently and  effectively. Among other data, mail management reports must  include: total expenditures paid to each mail service provider, total  volume of mail pieces, volume and expenditures on mail that was  undeliverable as addressed, number of full-time equivalent employees  and contractors who have taken training to earn professional  certifications, and expenses paid on additional contracts for mail  services. Each year on October 1, GSA opens SMART for agencies  to manually input their data for the prior fiscal year. According to the  manual for the SMART application, agencies are to enter annual  expenditures and number of pieces mailed under each mail class and  service provider, and the application calculates a cost per piece  automatically. The agency mail manager is required to compile data  from all offices or components and submit one report for the agency to  GSA by December 1 each year. Aggregating the SMART data at the  agency level allows GSA to compare one agency to another on  performance measures such as cost per piece. GSA officials said they  review overall trends, training, whether mail piece counts are  consistent with the expenditures, variances from the previous year,  and whether the data suggest the need for any revisions to the FMR.", "Performance Measurement Requirements: All federal agencies must  have performance measures for mail operations at the agency level  and in all mail facilities and program levels. Performance measures  are required so that the agency can gauge the success of agency mail  management plans and processes by comparing performance over  time and among organizations. Further, according to the FMR,  performance measures enhance resource allocation and provide  accountability.", "Agency Mail Manager Requirements: Federal agencies are required  to have an agency mail manager who should be at a managerial level  that enables the official to speak for the agency on mail  management. The FMR enumerates general responsibilities that the  agency mail manager should carry out including, among others,  establishing written policies and procedures for timely and cost- effective dispatch and delivery of mail; ensuring agency-wide  awareness and compliance with service provider standards and  operational procedures, and promoting professional certification for  mail managers and mail center employees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Is Not Managing Its Mail Program Effectively", "paragraphs": ["VA is not managing its mail program effectively, as it lacks key elements  of an effective mail management program, including having reliable data  on mail volume and expenditures, agency-wide performance measures,  and mail managers with appropriate authority and responsibilities.

Facilities also did not consistently report data on mail that was  undeliverable as addressed. We found in 2015 that VBA did not keep  data on its undeliverable mail, and in our review, VHA\u2019s mail manager  could not confirm whether VHA facilities accurately track these data.  Additionally, according to VHA\u2019s mail manager, many medical centers  do not account for their on-site pharmacies\u2019 outgoing mail in their  SMART data.", "Anomalous Data: Several facilities submitted data of questionable  accuracy. For example, a regional benefit office reported spending  $9,108 to mail 29 pieces of Priority Express Mail (equating to a cost of  $314 per piece), and a medical center reported spending $507,000 to  mail 13,000 pieces of USPS Business Reply Mail (equating to a cost  of $39 per piece). According to VA, these and other figures were  based on typographical errors by VA personnel in entering the  expenditure and volume data.", "We also provided VA\u2019s fiscal year 2015 and 2016 data to FedEx and  UPS: neither could validate the information we obtained from SMART  with their own records.", "To collect data for SMART reporting, VA relies on data submitted by its  facilities, and these facilities use inconsistent processes for tracking the  data. Specifically, according to VA officials, many facility mail rooms use  mailing equipment like postage meters to track data on mail volume and  expenditures. The types of mailing equipment that facilities use vary  considerably in the capability to track mail volume and expenditure data.  For example, VA officials reported that facilities with newer mailing  equipment may have also purchased enhanced accounting software from  the vendor that enables them to track mail expenditures and volume by  service provider and individual classes of mail\u2014such as Priority or First- Class Mail. Conversely, other facilities\u2019 equipment may not be configured  or may be too old to accept the accounting software to be able to track  classes of mail separately. In addition, facilities may rely on manual-entry  methods, such as Excel spreadsheets, or copies of bills and receipts from  service providers to track mail volume and expenditure data. As a result,  VA has no assurance that facilities are tracking their mail information  consistently or completely.", "The mail volume and expenditure data from roughly 200 VA facilities are  individually entered into SMART by VA personnel. VA has no agency- wide system for tracking mail volume and expenditure data, and therefore  VA\u2019s administration-level mail managers have limited ability to validate  the data before the agency mail manager submits the mail management  report to GSA. VHA\u2019s and VBA\u2019s mail managers told us they look for  anomalous entries, but they cannot verify the data\u2019s accuracy without  individually contacting the personnel who input the data to check their  sources (e.g., the mailing equipment, spreadsheets, or service provider  bills and receipts). Neither VHA\u2019s nor VBA\u2019s mail manager could provide  us assurance that the SMART data from their administration were  accurate. They also reported that they lack the authority to compel  facilities to report data to SMART. GSA officials reported that they check  for data entries in SMART that vary by at least 10 percent from the  previous year\u2019s entry and discuss questionable data with reporting  agencies, but it is each agency\u2019s responsibility to report accurate  information. GSA officials also told us the challenges VA has encountered  in reporting to SMART are typical of other agencies. We reported in our  2015 High-Risk Series update that VHA oversight efforts are often  impeded by its reliance on facilities\u2019 self-reported data\u2014such as  certification from medical centers that specialty care consultations have  been completed\u2014 which lack independent validation and are often  inaccurate or incomplete.", "VA\u2019s inconsistent processes for tracking mail data are in part the result of  fragmented procurement practices for mailing equipment across the  agency in which different components of VHA and VBA make contracting  decisions for mailroom equipment independently. Specifically, VA does  not strategically acquire equipment that allows facilities to consistently  collect, track, validate, and report mail data. According to the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), strategic sourcing is the collaborative  and structured process of critically analyzing an organization\u2019s spending  and using this information to make business decisions about acquiring  commodities and services more effectively and efficiently. For example,  VBA reported that each of its 56 regional benefit offices negotiates and  purchases its own contract with authorized vendors. VHA reported that  the contracts for mailing equipment at its 170 medical centers are  established at various levels \u2014in some cases, medical centers may  establish their own contracts, while in others, a Veterans Integrated  Service Network (VISN) establishes a contract for all the medical centers  within a region.", "Because of this procurement process, VA is missing opportunities to track  mail expenditure and volume data consistently and facilitate the SMART- reporting process. Further, VA may be expending unnecessary additional  funds on procuring mail equipment and missing opportunities to take  advantage of its substantial buying power. Strategic sourcing involves  consolidating similar requirements to manage them collectively and reap  cost savings and efficiency gains. If an organization has business units  across many locations or functions, it is often most economical for a  central office to negotiate procurement contracts on behalf of the entire  organization. In the case of VA, it is likely that having facilities or other  units individually negotiate contracts is not cost-effective because this  practice does not take advantage of the extent of price discounts that  might be available under procurement contracts covering much larger  segments of the agency. In fact, representatives from VA\u2019s two primary  mailing equipment providers told us that the agency lacks a consistent  contracting approach to address its mailroom needs. Representatives  from one provider estimated that it has about 3,000 contracts with VA facilities and said that if VA were to negotiate fewer contracts at higher  levels of the department, VA would almost certainly reap cost savings.  For example, representatives said that VHA\u2019s VISNs could negotiate  contracts for multiple medical centers within a region, rather than each  medical center purchasing its own standalone mailing equipment.", "While VBA has taken preliminary steps to source its mailing equipment  strategically, VA lacks an overall plan to source its contracts for mailing  equipment in a more strategic manner. VBA officials told us in July 2016  that its administration and field operations offices were collaborating to  establish a blanket purchase agreement for mailing equipment in 56  regional benefit offices across the country. According to VBA, the contract  is intended to provide opportunities to negotiate improved discounts and  leverage buying power through volume purchasing, among other things.  Officials stated that they also intend to include software in the contract  that would consolidate data across the regional benefit offices and allow  centralized reporting to SMART through web-based accounting software  linked to VBA Central Office. VBA initially targeted the end of fiscal year  2017 to finalize the contract; however, in February 2017, officials said that  it will take several years to establish the contract because some regional  benefit offices will not be able to join until their current contracts expire.  VBA officials stated that they were interested in including VHA in the  contract in order to obtain better prices. However, they said that VBA has  not had any detailed discussions with VHA about the contract and told us  that differences in the administrations\u2019 management structures could  affect the process. Moreover, VHA\u2019s mail manager told us that he does  not have the authority to coordinate VHA\u2019s involvement in the contract  with VBA. By not contracting to procure more standardized equipment,  VA is missing opportunities to track and report mail data more  consistently and realize cost savings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA\u2019s Mail Policy Does Not Include Agency-Wide Goals and Performance Measures", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s mail policy does not include agency-wide goals and performance  measures for mail operations, and as a result, VA is unable to determine  the extent to which its mail operations are efficient and effective. We have  previously found that results-oriented organizations set performance  goals to clearly define desired program outcomes. The FMR requires  that federal agencies have performance measures for mail operations at  the agency level and in all mail facilities and program levels. We have  previously found that measuring performance allows organizations to  track progress toward goals and provides managers with the crucial  performance data needed to make management decisions. On its  website, GSA suggests that federal agencies establish performance  measures for outgoing mail that address elements of mail operations,  such as cost per piece by mail class and the percentage of outgoing mail  that is returned as undeliverable as addressed, as well as management  measures such as the annual hours of training per full-time equivalent  employee, and measures for contracts and service level agreements,  such as the appropriate postage meter size for a mail center operation.", "VA\u2019s mail policy includes no agency-wide goals or performance measures  for mail operations; however, officials stated that performance measures  may have been developed by individual facilities. At the 10 facilities we  reviewed, we found that they were not using a consistent set of  performance measures. These facilities reported using various  performance measures for mail operations, such as metrics regarding  customer service, efficiency, volume, cost, accuracy, and staff  performance. For example, officials from one medical center said that  they measure customer service, efficiency, safety, and security, while  officials at another medical center said they measure annual expenditures  from the prior fiscal year. Officials from two regional benefit offices  indicated that they have implemented timeliness standards for their mail.  VHA\u2019s CMOP program also has performance measures for delivery of  prescription medications but these metrics are implemented for the  program\u2019s vendor, not an on-site mail operation. The CMOP program  outsources management of its prescription drug mail to a logistics vendor  that is responsible for manifesting parcels and providing them to USPS or  third-party providers for delivery. For example, the vendor must resolve  delivery inquiries within 48 hours and transport parcels to arrive at USPS  within 36 hours and return recalled or damaged parcels in the next  available truck.", "VA lacks agency-wide performance measures for mail operations  because its mail management policy does not address the FMR  performance measures requirement.

In July 2016, VA  officials told us that efforts to update the policy involving collaboration with  GSA, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, and USPS were  under way. However, in February 2017, VBA and VHA mail managers we  spoke to said they were unaware of any such efforts. As of May 2017, VA  had not provided documentation of this ongoing effort. The lack of an  updated policy is not unique to VA\u2019s mail management. For example, we  previously found that in 2016, almost 60 percent of VHA\u2019s policies had not  been reviewed in at least 5 years to ensure they are up to date and still  relevant.

However, as stated previously, the VA directive was issued  in 1996 and has not been updated to incorporate current mail  management regulatory requirements. Additionally, according to the  agency mail manager, mail operations in VHA and VBA facilities are the  responsibility of the administration-level mail managers. However, the  VHA and VBA mail managers reported that although they advise  individual facilities on mail management, they have no authority to direct  their mail operations. For example, VHA\u2019s mail manager told us that  individual facilities pursue mailing discounts independently. Additionally,  while VBA has broadly outlined the responsibilities of the VBA mail  manager in a documented position description, the VHA mail manager  has no documented responsibilities. Further, while the FMR recommends  that the agency mail manager ensure that all facility- and mail-program  level personnel receive appropriate training and certifications to perform  their assigned duties, the VHA mail manager said he has never been  encouraged to attend any training, and both the VHA and VBA mail  managers said that they do not have the authority to require mail  management employees to attend training. In addition, VA has not  assigned mail management as the primary duty for its mail managers.  According to VA, most mail manager positions are secondary duties for  the designated officials. VA has devolved responsibility for mail  management to VA\u2019s three administrations and their hundreds of facilities,  with varying degrees of autonomy.

VA risks being unable to ensure that  its facilities are managing their mail costs as effectively as possible,  including obtaining available discounts. VA officials told us the agency  relies on a decentralized program because of its size, the volume of mail  generated, and the unique nature of each administration\u2019s mission.
