This landmark legislation was enacted 5 years ago thanks to the hard work of this Committee and its House counterpart. But, as I will outline today, a great deal more perseverance will be required to sustain the current momentum and successfully overcome decades of serious neglect in fundamental financial management operations and reporting methods.", "To address these problems, the 1990 CFO Act spelled out an ambitious agenda of long overdue reforms. The CFO Act established a CFO structure in 24 major agencies and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide the necessary leadership and focus. To help instill greater accountability and fix pervasive and costly control breakdowns, financial statements were required to be prepared and audited, beginning with those for fiscal year 1991, for revolving and trust funds and commercial activities. For 10 agencies, audited financial statements were required as part of a pilot program to test this concept for an agency\u2019s entire operations. Moreover, the CFO Act set expectations for the deployment of modern systems to replace existing antiquated, often manual, processes; the development of better performance and cost measures; and the design of results-oriented reports on the government\u2019s financial condition and operating performance by integrating budget, accounting, and program information.", "Important progress is being achieved to bring about these sweeping reforms and rectify the devastating legacy from inattention to financial management. OMB continues to play an important leadership role and a cadre of qualified CFOs are now in place and are seeking to make needed improvements. Similarly, the Inspectors General (IG) are embracing their new financial audit responsibilities. Additionally, much needed comprehensive accounting standards are nearing completion, and efforts are underway to further strengthen the quality of financial reporting. In short, financial management is finally becoming a top priority of federal managers.", "Moreover, the regular preparation of financial statements and independent audit opinions required by the 1990 act are bringing greater clarity and understanding to the scope and depth of problems and needed solutions. These annual public report cards are also generating increased pressure to fix long-standing problems. The success of these efforts formed the basis for congressional action last year to pass the Government Management Reform Act of 1994, which expanded to all 24 CFO Act agencies the requirement for the preparation and audit of financial statements for their entire operations, beginning with those for fiscal year 1996. This essential expansion of the CFO Act\u2019s requirements provides a greater impetus for accelerated governmentwide implementation of financial management reform.", "Also the 1994 act requires the preparation and audit of consolidated executive branch financial statements, beginning with those for fiscal year 1997. For the first time, the American public will have an annual report card on the results of current operations and the financial condition of its national government. This, in conjunction with the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2019 financial statements will set the foundation for the federal government to have the same kind of financial reporting as had already been required (1) by the securities laws for the private sector, partly in response to the stock market crash of 1929 and (2) by the Single Audit Act for state and local governments, driven in part by financial crises such as experienced by New York City in the early 1970s.", "Making these reforms a reality in the federal government, however, remains a challenge for us all. Today, I want to focus on the four main implementation challenges to build upon the progress to date and put lasting improvements in place. They are: first, successfully implementing the expanded requirements for audited financial statements to improve the reliability of data for decision-making and strengthen the efficiency of financial operations and controls; second, continuing to build stronger financial management organizations by upgrading skill levels, enhancing training, and ensuring that CFOs possess all the necessary authorities within their agencies to achieve change; third, devising and applying more effective solutions to address difficult problems plaguing agencies\u2019 underlying financial systems; and fourth, designing comprehensive accountability reports to permit more thorough and objective assessments of agencies\u2019 performance and financial conditions, as well as to enhance the budget preparation and deliberation process.", "In addition to achieving improvements in financial management at the federal level, this Committee has spearheaded greater oversight of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal spending at the state and local levels through the passage of the Single Audit Act in 1984. This act helps provide accountability for federal payments and instill fundamental elements of good financial management in state and local governments. The Committee in considering amendments to the act, which I will also address, to improve the effectiveness of the single audit process.", "I want to commend the Committee for holding this hearing; sustained congressional attention to implementation of financial management legislation will be important in instilling greater accountability throughout the federal government and helping better control the cost of its operations. Thanks in large part to the legislative impetus of the expanded CFO Act and the Government Performance and Results Act\u2014efforts led by this Committee\u2014decisionmakers will ultimately have available unprecedented, reliable information on both the financial condition of programs and operations and the performance and costs of these activities.", "Also, I will discuss the role this Committee could play in continuing to build on the foundation established through these laws for establishing a strong financial management organizational structure and revolutionizing the type and quality of financial information for decisionmaking. I believe this Committee, with the support of GAO, can work with the rest of the Congress to ensure that the wealth of new information to be generated through these statutory requirements will be provided to and used by appropriations, budget, and authorizing committees of the Congress and to bring the CFO Act\u2019s goals to fruition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Reliability and Financial Operations Are Beginning to Improve", "paragraphs": ["To date, CFO Act financial audits have resulted in greater data reliability and improved financial operations. Under the expanded act, all 24 CFO Act agencies can begin to gain the benefits demonstrated by those agencies that have already successfully undergone full-scale financial audits. This is absolutely critical and will put the federal government on a par with the private sector and state and local governments, which have already made the necessary investment in financial management.", "There is widespread consensus that the preparation and audit of financial statements has been the primary catalyst to increase the reliability of financial data and improve financial operations. During the past 5 years, due to the CFO Act\u2019s requirement, we have seen audit coverage substantially increase to almost half of the government\u2019s annual gross budget authority. Beginning with fiscal year 1996, due to the expanded CFO Act, audit coverage will expand to cover the entire operations of the 24 CFO Act agencies, which currently account for virtually all of the government\u2019s outlays.", "Also, agencies are progressing in receiving unqualified audit opinions. In four cases, (the Social Security, General Services, and National Aeronautics and Space Administrations and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission) unqualified opinions were rendered on fiscal year 1994 financial statements covering agencies\u2019 entire operations. These agencies, which covered about 23 percent of the government\u2019s fiscal year 1994 outlays, have demonstrated that preparing auditable financial statements is possible and, with priority and emphasis, can be achieved by the remaining 20 CFO Act agencies as well.", "In addition, there has been significantly greater commitment by the administration and agencies to effectively implement the CFO Act\u2019s expanded financial statement preparation and audit requirements. For example, OMB made it clear from the outset that it would not grant any waivers, although it has the authority to waive the requirement for fiscal years 1996 and 1997; thus, helping to ensure greater adherence to the statutory timetable. Also, OMB, Treasury, and GAO have been meeting with agency CFOs and IGs to build consensus, and we have generally seen a good commitment being given to preparing and auditing financial statements. For instance, some agencies, such as the Departments of Interior and Education, are on an accelerated schedule to having agencywide financial statements 1 year before the act requires. Several CFOs and IGs have caveated their optimism, however, by the prospects that funding constraints could hold for dampening this momentum and hampering plans for meeting the act\u2019s fiscal year 1996 requirement.", "It is essential that this time frame be met. As we have discussed in prior testimonies before the Congress, audited financial statements have provided significantly more accurate and useful information on the government\u2019s financial status and its operations. Further, CFO Act financial audits have provided a greater understanding of the extent and nature of the financial control and systems problems facing the government, and a better appreciation for the limited extent to which the Congress and program managers can rely on the information they receive. Effective implementation of the CFO Act\u2019s expanded requirement for audited financial information is essential for more informed decision-making and better accountability in virtually every major aspect of the government\u2019s operations, as the following examples illustrate."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Improving Revenue Collection Operations Essential to Fund the Government", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 1994, the federal government collected a reported over $1.3 trillion in revenue, primarily from individual and corporate income taxes and import duties, fines, and fees. Reliable financial data are necessary to ensure that the government assesses and collects more of the revenue that is due from these sources. This, however, is not yet the case, as shown by our financial audits at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the U.S. Customs Service."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Internal Revenue Service", "paragraphs": ["The process of preparing and auditing financial statements for the government\u2019s primary revenue collection agency has surfaced significant problems affecting its operations and credibility. For example, through these audits, it came to light during our first audit of IRS\u2019s financial statements\u2014those for fiscal year 1992\u2014that IRS could not verify or reconcile its $1.3 trillion in reported revenues to its accounting substantiate amounts for various types of taxes reported, such as social security, income, and excise taxes, although the amounts of these taxes are to be separately maintained; reconcile its cash accounts with Treasury\u2019s; substantiate its billions of dollars of gross and net accounts receivables, adequately account for its annual operating funds.", "To its credit, IRS has made a commitment to institute changes. Through the strong support of the Commissioner, the agency has made important strides to address its far-reaching financial management problems. IRS successfully implemented a new administrative accounting system in fiscal year 1993 that can better account for its more than $7 billion in annual operating funds. It entered into an agreement with the Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Finance Center and now has control over its $5 billion payroll operations, which was lacking at the time of our first audit. It has taken physical inventories of its equipment and is beginning to get full control over these assets. IRS has ongoing efforts, including the use of outside contractors, to resolve its cash reconciliation problems and to strengthen its internal controls over payments.", "Finally, although necessary systems changes to bring revenue accounting up to reasonable expectations have not been completed, better estimates of collectible delinquent taxes are now being developed as part of the financial statement preparation process so that the Congress will have the information needed to better gauge potential collectibility and to ask questions as to why amounts are not collectible. For example, the audit for fiscal year 1992 disclosed that IRS had $65 billion in delinquent taxes outstanding, not the $110 billion IRS reported and, of the $65 billion, only $19 billion was estimated to be collectible. This type of data would provide a more reliable basis than has been available in the past on the merits of adding collection personnel.", "The future holds even greater potential. First, IRS is beginning to address the systems issues that will enable it to reliably show by type of tax how much has been actually received and who pays the tax. For example, excise taxes, such as petroleum companies and chemical manufacturers, among others, pay to fund environmental cleanup activities, are to be segregated by type and are used to achieve specific policy goals. But our financial audit showed that IRS\u2019s accounting system does not have this capability. Consequently, whether it be the Superfund Trust Fund or the Highway Trust Fund, a fund may be receiving more or less than it is due.", "Social security taxes are somewhat different in concept but the problem is the same. Under law, the Social Security Administration (SSA) receives social security taxes based on wage information reported by employers to IRS even if the taxes are ultimately not paid. This results in amounts going to the Social Security Fund from other tax sources, and while the IRS knows that there is a discrepancy, it cannot yet identify that amount so that decisionmakers will know the cost of this policy. As a result of the financial audit, IRS is now working to address these problems.", "Future systems changes should also result in extending the application of accrual accounting to the tax revenue stream so that IRS and the Congress will have somewhat better information about the taxes IRS should be collecting. Further, because the CFO Act calls for the development of better cost and performance data, IRS will have an opportunity to better justify and manage tax compliance initiatives. For example, over the years, questions have been raised over the amount of revenue to be generated from adding revenue agents or initiating special compliance initiatives.", "Such questions can only be conclusively answered by improving the basic reliability of IRS\u2019s underlying data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The U.S. Customs Service", "paragraphs": ["Financial audits of the Customs Service, the government\u2019s second most important revenue collector, revealed problems similar to those at IRS. These problems impaired Customs\u2019 ability to effectively ensure that carriers, importers, and their agents complied with laws intended to ensure fair trade practices and protect the American people from unsafe and illegal imported goods. Further, these audits found that Customs did not adequately ensure that all goods imported into the United States were properly identified and that the related duties, taxes, and fees on imports, reported to be over $21 billion for fiscal year 1993, were properly assessed and collected; have adequate controls to detect and prevent excessive or duplicate have adequate accountability over tons of illegal drugs and millions of dollars of cash and property seized or used in its enforcement efforts; and have adequate controls over the use and reporting of its operating funds.", "The Commissioner of Customs has expressed a strong commitment to resolve these problems and recognizes that a significant and sustained effort by Customs\u2019 management will be required. Acting on this commitment, Customs has developed and tested nationwide, a new program to reliably measure the trade community\u2019s compliance with trade laws. This program is expected to achieve better overall compliance with trade laws and tighter controls to ensure that the government receives all of the import taxes, duties, and fees to which it is entitled. This information will also help Customs ensure that it is making the best use of its limited inspection and audit resources.", "Moreover, Customs has developed and applied methodologies for more accurately reporting its collectible accounts receivable. It also reorganized its debt collection unit, formalized its collection procedures, and aggressively pursued collection of old receivables. According to Customs, this effort resulted in collections of over $35 million. Customs also began conducting nationwide physical inventories of its seized assets to improve the safeguards over this property and has taken steps, such as implementing basic reconciliations of records, to ensure more adequate control over the use and reporting of its operating funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Providing Accountability for National Defense Expenditures", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) must have accurate financial information and internal controls to manage the Department\u2019s vast resources\u2014over $1 trillion in assets, 3 million military and civilian personnel, and a budget of over $250 billion for fiscal year 1995. Effective financial management is critical to assuring that these resources are productively employed in meeting our nation\u2019s defense objectives.", "Unfortunately, DOD does not have effective financial management operations and the seriousness of its financial management problems caused us to add it to our high-risk list. No single military service or major component has been able to withstand the scrutiny of a financial statement audit. This failure has serious implications. Good financial management runs deeper than the ability to develop accurate financial records. It is being able to (1) provide managers with visibility and control over inventories, (2) project material needs, and (3) effectively balance scarce resources with critical needs.", "The CFO Act audits have served as an important catalyst for identifying and focusing management attention on the full extent and scope of the financial problems facing the Department. Since 1990, we and the DOD auditors have made over 350 recommendations to help resolve the financial management weaknesses identified throughout the Department.

We reviewed the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 1994 financial reports as a measure of the Navy\u2019s current ability to prepare reliable financial statements. In our pending report, we conclude that, to an even greater extent than the other military services, the Navy is plagued by troublesome financial management deficiencies involving tens of billions of dollars.", "DOD has recognized the seriousness of its financial management problems and the need to take action. Secretary Perry and Comptroller Hamre have been candid in their assessments of the status of current processes and practices. Further, the Department\u2019s financial reform blueprint\u2014presented in February 1995\u2014offers a good perspective of the corrective actions which must be taken. We believe this plan represents an important first step in committing DOD to real action.", "As we testified earlier this year, however, very serious management challenges face the Department as it moves to make the blueprint a reality. We recommended that DOD determine what skills are required to ensure that the plan is developed and implemented and to establish an independent, outside board of experts to provide counsel, oversight, and perspective to reform efforts.", "We are also concerned about the pace of needed improvements at DOD. According to a recent DOD IG report, DOD\u2019s development of new accounting systems will not be completed until the end of fiscal year 1998 and, consequently, DOD\u2019s IG will not be able to render audit opinions on any of the military services\u2019 general fund operations until March 2000 at the earliest.", "As we testified last month, given the serious and pervasive nature of DOD\u2019s financial management problems, and the need for more immediate progress, the Department needs to consider additional steps to (1) establish a skilled financial management workforce, (2) ensure that financial management systems are capable of producing accurate data, and (3) build an effective financial management organization structure with clear accountability.

At September 30, 1994, the government reported (1) $241 billion in nontax receivables, of which $49 billion, or over 20 percent, was reported to be delinquent and (2) $694 billion in guarantees of outstanding loans for which it was contingently liable. There are four principal credit agencies: the Department of Agriculture, with 56 percent of the loans; the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), with 11 percent of the loans and 55 percent of the guarantees; the Department of Education, with 7 percent of the loans and 11 percent of the guarantees; and the Department of Veterans Affairs, with 23 percent of the guarantees.", "We have long been concerned about the quality and reliability of financial information on credit programs.

Agency managers need accurate and reliable information on a day-to-day basis to effectively manage multibillion dollar loan and loan guarantee portfolios and to determine the value and collectibility of debts owed the government.

HUD\u2019s CFO, for instance, maintains records of, and provides HUD\u2019s budget office with, information on obligations and unexpended balances but is not involved in formulating the budget or allocating and reallocating funds throughout the year. At Education and Labor, CFOs have responsibility for budget execution but not for budget formulation. We believe that each CFO Act agency should recognize that both these functions can best be integrated with the agency\u2019s other financial activities by delegating responsibility for them to the CFO.", "Also, at many CFO Act agencies, financial management responsibility rests with the CFO but is carried out by the financial leaders at the agencies\u2019 components, which can create problems. For instance, we recently reported that the Department of Agriculture\u2019s CFO has neither the authority within the Department nor the mechanism to enforce compliance with its financial standards. To overcome this kind of situation, we believe it is important for CFOs to have a strong role in and authority over component financial management matters.", "Additionally, some CFOs have responsibility for operational functions, such as procurement and grants management, in addition to those directly related to agency financial management. While functions such as these can provide opportunities for much needed integration of different functional areas, they also have the potential to distract the CFOs from concentrating on financial management issues throughout the agencies.", "Another serious problem the CFOs face in building an effective supporting structure is attracting and retaining well qualified financial management personnel and working to upgrade staff skills in a constrained budget environment. Financial audits have shown with greater clarity the extent and nature of the government\u2019s financial management personnel shortages and the importance of overcoming them.", "These audits have consistently disclosed agencies having extraordinary financial management problems in even the fundamental areas of making reconciliations, documenting adjustments, ensuring that inventories are taken, and making supervisory reviews of accounts and transactions. Weaknesses such as these lead us to believe that fundamental skill levels and training issues must be addressed quickly.", "Moreover, implementing the CFO Act\u2019s objective of upgrading financial operations, such as developing performance measurement systems and integrating budget and accounting data, will require significantly enhanced staff skills. Focusing on these areas is difficult when agencies\u2019 basic financial and control weaknesses remain unchecked. Top managers are, however, beginning to get a sense of the extraordinary effort that will be needed to upgrade financial management organizations and to fix known problems.", "In this regard, OMB\u2019s July 1995 Federal Financial Management Status Report and Five-Year Plan addresses the need to develop a quality financial management workforce by implementing methods to assist agencies in recruiting and retaining qualified financial management personnel. CFOs, though, have a significant challenge in building effective organizations to meet the CFO Act\u2019s challenges.", "To help in this area, in June 1992, the Association of Government Accountants made 30 recommendations covering all facets of the financial personnel challenge, from recruiting talented staff to reducing turnover. The CFO Council\u2019s Human Resources Committee is working to implement these strategies through such activities as coordinating efforts to provide low-cost, effective financial management training and developing a plan for establishing core competencies and standards for all CFO-related positions.", "Investments must be made in training to ensure that financial management personnel increase their professional skills to keep pace with emerging technology and developments in financial management. However, financial management training is often a neglected aspect of ensuring high-quality financial operations. In our discussions with the 24 CFO Act agencies, most said they had not established formal training programs to enhance the skills and knowledge of financial management staff.", "However, some agencies have acted. The Department of Energy, for example, has established a training program for financial managers that all of its CFO offices are required to implement and that is based on employees\u2019 individual development plans. Also, the Department of Education requires its financial personnel to complete 40 hours of continuing professional education annually.", "We have called for financial management personnel to be required to participate in a minimum amount of continuing professional education.Government auditors are required to attend 80 hours of continuing professional education every 2 years, and this requirement has helped enhance audit quality and professionalism.", "We believe, though, that upgrading and training financial management staff requires much greater short-term attention to identify more specifically the extent of the skills gap and how it can be most effectively narrowed or closed. We plan to study this area in more depth in the coming months and will report the results to the Committee.", "In this regard, the Committee can be of assistance by challenging the CFOs to clearly identify financial management skill shortages in terms of personnel needs to effectively achieve the CFO Act\u2019s financial management objectives.

Our Strategic Information Management (SIM) Self-Assessment Toolkit, for example, has been used by several agencies, including IRS and HUD, and has already resulted in several million dollars in savings. In August 1995, we issued an exposure draft of our Business Process Reengineering Assessment Guide, which is currently being pilot tested at several agencies. Additionally, we have worked with OMB in finalizing Evaluating Information Technology Investments: A Practical Guide, which will provide agency managers a systematic and objective means of assessing the risk and maximizing the return associated with planned IT investments.", "Further, the Congress is taking steps to improve federal IT management.

We will be glad to work with the Committee as it considers this proposal.", "Key to the FASAB approach was extensive consultation with users of financial statements early in their deliberations to ensure that the standards will result in statements that are relevant to both the budget allocation process as well as agencies\u2019 accountability for resources. Users were interested in getting answers to questions on such topics as:", "Budgetary integrity: What legal authority was provided to finance government activities and was it used correctly?", "Operating performance: How much do programs cost and how were they financed? What was achieved? What are the government\u2019s assets and are they well managed? What are its liabilities and how will they be paid for?", "Stewardship: Has the government\u2019s overall financial capacity to satisfy current and future needs and costs improved or deteriorated?

OMB also has prompted progress by giving special emphasis in the fiscal year 1996 Circular A-11, Preparation and Submission of Budget Estimates, to increasing the use of information on program performance in budget justifications. Moreover, OMB Director Rivlin instructed her agency to use performance information in making budget recommendations. In preparation for the fiscal year 1997 budget cycle, OMB held performance reviews in May with agencies on performance measures and recently issued guidance on preparing and submitting strategic plans. Further progress in implementing GPRA will occur as performance measures become more widespread and agencies begin to use audited financial information in the budget process to validate and assess agency performance.", "OMB is also making efforts to design new financial reports based on FASAB\u2019s recommended standards that contain performance measures and budget data to provide a much needed, additional perspective on the government\u2019s actual performance and its long-term financial prospects. While there are a myriad of legislatively mandated reporting requirements which could be presented in separate reports, I think that decisionmakers would find that a single report relating performance measures, costs, and the budget would be most useful. This reporting approach is consistent with the CFO Council\u2019s proposal for an Accountability Report, which OMB is pursuing.", "The Government Management Reform Act of 1994 authorized OMB, upon proper notification to the Congress, to consolidate and simplify statutory financial management reports. The CFO Council has proposed two annual reports, a Planning and Budgeting Report and an Accountability Report. The two consolidated reports would be used to present a comprehensive picture of an agency\u2019s future plans and performance by addressing (1) how well the agency performed (accountability) and (2) the road map for its future actions (planning and budgeting).", "The consolidation of current reports into the Accountability Report would eliminate the separate requirements under various separate laws\u2014such as GPRA, the Federal Managers\u2019 Financial Integrity Act, the CFO Act, and the Prompt Payment Act.

It is supposed to link resources requested with planned actions.", "OMB is undertaking to have six agencies produce, on a pilot basis, Accountability Reports providing a comprehensive picture of each agency\u2019s performance pursuant to its stated goals and objectives. We agree with the overall streamlined reporting concept and believe that, to be most useful, the Accountability Report must include an agency\u2019s financial statements and the related audit reports. The ultimate usefulness of the Accountability Report will hinge on its specific content and the reliability of information presented. In this regard, OMB and the CFO Council will be more fully defining the information to be included in the Accountability Reports during the pilot phase. We will work with OMB and agencies throughout the pilot program. The pilot concept has worked well in the past under the CFO Act and GPRA."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Performance, Costs, and the Budget", "paragraphs": ["Of course, the ultimate goal of more reliable and relevant financial data is to promote more informed decision-making. This requires that financial data produced be understood and used by program managers and budget decisionmakers. The changes underway to financial reporting have been undertaken with a goal of making financial data more accessible to budget decisionmakers. The budget community\u2019s involvement in the FASAB standard-setting process and OMB\u2019s accountability proposal have contributed to this. The future challenge is to further integrate financial reports with the budget to enhance the quality and richness of the data considered in budget deliberations. As I will discuss below, improving the linkages between accounting and budgeting also call for considering certain changes in budgeting such as realigned account structures and the selective use of accrual concepts.", "Perhaps the chief benefit of improving this linkage will be the increased reliability of the data on which we base our management and budgetary decisions. From an agency perspective, having audited information on the value of assets and liabilities, as well as the full costs of program outputs, will permit more informed judgments in strategic planning and program priority setting. Coupled with internal control assessments, such information will also enable agencies to better target areas requiring greater management attention or reform. For example, as I discussed earlier, the IRS financial audit revealed that the accounts receivable inventory was largely uncollectible\u2014important information that permits IRS to better target its collection resources and permits more informed appropriations decisions on the level of resources necessary to collect these funds.", "From a budgetary decision-making perspective, the new financial reports will improve the reliability of the budget numbers undergirding decisions. Budgeting is a forward-looking enterprise, but it can clearly benefit from better information on actual expenditures and revenue collection. Numbers from the budget will be included in basic financial statements and thus will be audited for the first time.", "Having these numbers audited was one of the foremost desires of budget decisionmakers consulted in FASAB\u2019s user needs study and stems from their suspicion\u2014well warranted I might add\u2014that the unaudited numbers may not always be correct. For example, decisionmakers rely on data based on IRS systems on the amounts of revenue collected for each type of tax. However, as highlighted earlier, our audit revealed that the IRS\u2019s reported revenue of $1.3 trillion for fiscal year 1994 could not be verified or reconciled to accounting records maintained for individual taxpayers in the aggregate and amounts reported for various types of taxes collected could not be substantiated. This means that the amount credited to the Social Security Trust Fund is different than the amount of social security taxes actually collected.", "Financial audit reports have also revealed important information on the actual costs of credit programs which can inform future budgetary decisions. Specifically, the fiscal year 1994 financial audit reports of the Farmers Home Administration, the Federal Housing Administration, the Federal Family Education Loan Program, and the Small Business Administration revealed that agencies\u2019 estimates of the subsidy costs of their credit programs reflected in the budget are not accurate. Based on these audits, budget decisionmakers know that they have reason to question the amount of future budget requests for these programs.", "The new financial reports will also offer new perspectives and data on the full costs of program outputs and agency operations that is currently not reported in our cash-based budget. Information on full costs generated pursuant to the new FASAB standards would provide decisionmakers a more complete picture of actual past program costs and performance when they are considering the appropriate level of future funding. For example, the costs of providing Medicare are spread among at least three budget accounts \u2014the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, and the Program Management account. Financial reports would pull all relevant costs together.", "The different account structures that are used for budget and financial reporting are a continuing obstacle to using these reports together and may prevent decisionmakers from fully benefiting from the information in financial statements. Unlike financial reporting, which is striving to apply the full cost concept when reporting costs, the budget account structure is not based on a single unifying theme or concept. As we reported recently, the current budget account structure evolved over time in response to specific needs.", "The budget contains over 1,300 accounts, with nearly 80 percent of the government\u2019s resources clustered in less than 5 percent of the accounts. Some accounts are organized by the type of spending (such as personnel compensation or equipment) while others are organized by programs. Accounts also vary in their coverage of cost, with some including both program and operating spending while others separate salaries and expenses from program subsidies. Or, a given account may include multiple programs and activities.", "When budget account structures are not aligned with the structures used in financial reporting, additional analyses or crosswalks would be needed so that the financial data could be considered in making budget decisions. If the Congress and the executive branch reexamine the budget account structure, the question of trying to achieve a better congruence between budget accounts and the accounting system structure should be considered.", "In addition to providing a new, full cost perspective for programs and activities, financial reporting has prompted improved ways of thinking about costs in the budget. For the most part, the budget uses the cash basis, which recognizes transactions when cash is paid or received. Financial reporting uses the accrual basis, which recognizes transactions when commitments are made, regardless of when the cash flows.", "Cash-based budgeting is generally the best measure to reflect the short-term economic impact of fiscal policy as well as the current borrowing needs of the federal government. And for many transactions, such as salaries, costs recorded on a cash basis do not differ appreciably from accrual.", "However, for a select number of programs, cash-based budgeting does not adequately reflect the future costs of the government\u2019s commitments or provide appropriate signals on emerging problems. For these programs, accrual-based reporting may improve budgetary decision-making. The accrual approach records the full cost to the government of a decision\u2014whether to be paid now or in the future. As a result, it prompts decisionmakers to recognize the cost consequences of commitments made today.", "The credit arena is a good example of how financial reporting has informed budget decision-making. Beginning in fiscal year 1992, accrual budgeting principles were applied to loans and loan guarantee programs with the implementation of credit reform. Cash treatment of these programs sent misleading signals by recording costs only when cash flowed in and out of the federal Treasury. Under this approach, loan guarantees, for example, were recorded as having no costs in the year in which program commitments were authorized, regardless of future costs flowing from this commitment. By contrast, under credit reform, the budget reflects the present value of subsidy costs to be incurred over time up front at the time when commitments are made.", "It may be appropriate to extend the use of accrual budgeting to other programs, such as federal insurance programs\u2014an issue we are currently studying at the request of the Chairman, House Budget Committee. For example, the cash position of the nation\u2019s deposit insurance system proved to be a lagging indicator of the underlying troubles faced by thrifts in the 1980s.

This Committee could be instrumental in fostering a constructive dialogue and gaining their support, which is vital to obtaining the resources and investment needed to carry out these efforts.", "This type of partnership is needed to better link financial and performance data to the budget and program decision-making. The development of new information may for a time outpace the capacity of the process to fully utilize it. Just as federal accounting standards are being tailored to better address the unique needs of federal policymakers, the cost concepts used in budgeting, as well as the budget presentations themselves, may warrant reconsideration. This calls for a concerted congressional effort to rethink how the budget should be structured and presented to best take advantage of this new information. Again, the Committee could be instrumental in bringing together key congressional stakeholders to consider appropriate changes.", "Finally, the Committee can continue to support evolutionary refinements to reporting approaches. For example, the new financial reports can be even more useful when they are streamlined, rather than the present approach of generating separate reports.

Single audits are important accountability tools over the hundreds of billions of dollars that the federal government provides to state and local governments and nonprofit organizations.", "In June 1994, we reported to the Committee on the Single Audit Act\u2019s important role. It has helped institutionalize fundamental elements of good financial management in state and local governments, such as preparing financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, obtaining annual independent comprehensive audits, assessing internal controls and compliance with laws and regulations, monitoring subrecipients, tracking federal funds, and resolving audit findings.", "In addition, the single audit process is an effective way of promoting accountability over federal assistance because it provides a structured approach to achieve audit coverage over the thousands of state and local governments and nonprofit organizations that receive federal financial assistance. Moreover, particularly in the case of block grants\u2014where the federal financial role diminishes and management and outcomes of federal assistance programs depend heavily on the overall state or local government controls\u2014the single audit process provides accountability by focusing the auditor on the controls affecting the integrated federal and state funding streams.", "Mr. Chairman, let me emphasize that block grants need not mean the absence of federal accountability provisions. Our extensive studies of the block grant experience in the 1980s led us to conclude that reasonable financial and program accountability provisions can help sustain block grants as a stable source of intergovernmental aid. Of course the definition of what is reasonable can be controversial. Overly-intrusive accountability provisions can threaten to overturn the efficiencies gained from flexible funding, while overly-limited provisions can undermine continued congressional support for the programs by depriving the Congress of information on how the funds are used and what results are achieved.", "Clearly, block grants call for a careful balancing of state and federal concerns. It is in this context that the Single Audit Act can play an especially helpful role in promoting financial accountability for the proper stewardship of federal funds. The act\u2019s focus on overall state controls applied to state entities supported with federal and state funding is very consistent with the block grant approach where states are encouraged to manage federal and state funds on an integrated basis to support state priorities. It also gives state officials an annual report card on the financial management of their own entities.", "While strongly supporting the single audit concept, we have identified opportunities to strengthen the single audit process while at the same time reducing the burden on state and local governments and nonprofit organizations. The legislation this committee is considering to amend the Single Audit Act would strengthen the single audit process in several key areas.", "First, the bill would expand the Single Audit Act to include nonprofit organizations. The act currently applies only to state and local governments while nonprofit entities are administratively covered under an OMB Circular. Expanding the Single Audit Act to include nonprofit organizations establishes uniform single audit requirements for state and local governments and nonprofit organizations, which would accomplish what this committee contemplated when the act was debated.", "Second, the dollar threshold that establishes which nonfederal entities must have audits under the act would be raised. Raising the minimum threshold from $25,000 to $300,000 would exempt thousands of entities from federally mandated audits while still covering 95 percent of federal assistance to state and local governments.", "Third, programs would be selected for testing based on risk. Currently, the act requires auditors to select and test programs based solely on the amount of federal financial assistance the programs receive. Adopting a risk-based approach would increase the effectiveness of the single audit process.", "Fourth, the single audit reports would be more useful. Program managers we contacted did not find current reporting to be user friendly, principally because of the number of auditor\u2019s reports. Single audit reports often include seven separate reports from the auditor. The proposed legislation would require auditors to include a summary of the results of the work. OMB adopted this approach several years ago at the federal level by including in financial statement audit reports under the CFO Act a new Overview section highlighting key results. We found that it was extremely helpful in providing insights to report users.", "Fifth, reducing the reporting time frame from the currently allowed 13 months to 9 months would significantly improve the timeliness of the reports. Timeliness alone does not determine the value of a report. But, the lack of timeliness can seriously degrade the value of a report. We understand that some auditors have concerns about meeting a shorter time frame. However, we believe that oversight of the hundreds of billions of federal dollars covered by the single audit process is degraded by reports that are issued more than a year after the end of the period audited. Over time, I hope that it will be the rule, rather than the exception, for the audit reports to be submitted in less than 9 months.", "Sixth, the legislative proposal would provide greater flexibility than the current act allows in carrying out this important oversight activity. The proposed legislation does so by providing the OMB Director authority to adjust some aspects of the single audit process to mesh with changing circumstances. For example, the OMB Director could authorize pilot projects to test alternative ways of achieving the goals of the legislation. The authorities provided the Director should not increase the burden on nonfederal entities. Rather, it is designed to make the Single Audit Act process adaptable to changing circumstances while continuing to promote sound financial management and provide effective oversight over federal resources.", "The 10 years of experience under the Single Audit Act has shown that the single audit process is a highly effective way to provide accountability for federal awards to state and local governments.
