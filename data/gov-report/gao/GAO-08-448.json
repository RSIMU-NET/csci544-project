Funded at $8 billion to nearly $10 billion per year, it is the largest research and development program in the Department of Defense (DOD). The program has been managed in 2-year increments, known as blocks. Block 2006, the second BMDS block, was completed in December 2007. GAO assessed MDA's progress in (1) meeting Block 2006 goals for fielding assets, completing work within estimated cost, conducting tests, and demonstrating the performance of the overall system in the field, and (2) making managerial improvements to transparency, accountability, and oversight. In conducting the assessment, GAO reviewed the assets fielded; contractor cost, schedule, and performance; and tests completed during 2007. GAO also reviewed pertinent sections of the U.S. Code, acquisition policy, and the charter of a new missile defense board."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["MDA made progress in developing and fielding the BMDS during Block 2006 but fell short of meeting its original goals. Specifically, it fielded additional assets such as land-based interceptors and sea-based missiles and upgraded other assets, including Aegis BMD-equipped ships. It also met most test objectives, with a number of successful tests conducted. As a result, fielded capability has increased. On the other hand, it is difficult to assess how well BMDS is progressing relative to the funds it has received because fewer assets were fielded than originally planned, the cost of the block increased by at least $1 billion, some flight tests were deferred, and the performance of the fielded system remains unverified. In particular, GAO could not determine the full cost of Block 2006 because MDA continued to defer budgeted work into the future, where it is no longer counted as a Block 2006 cost. Also making cost difficult to assess is a work planning method--referred to as level of effort--used by contractors that does not link time and money with what is produced. When not appropriately used, level-of-effort planning can obscure work accomplished, portending additional cost in the future. MDA is working to minimize the use of this planning method--a needed step as contractors overran their fiscal year 2007 budgets. Performance of the fielded system is as yet not verifiable because too few tests have been conducted to validate the models and simulations that predict BMDS performance. Moreover, the tests that are done do not provide enough information for DOD's independent test organization to fully assess the BMDS' suitability and effectiveness. GAO has previously reported that MDA has been given unprecedented funding and decision-making flexibility. While this flexibility has expedited BMDS fielding, it has also made MDA less accountable and transparent in its decisions than other major programs, making oversight more challenging. MDA, with direction from Congress, has taken several steps to address these concerns. MDA implemented a new way of defining blocks--its construct for developing and fielding BMDS increments--that should make costs more transparent. For example, under the newly-defined blocks, MDA will no longer defer work from one block to another. Accountability should also be improved as MDA will, for the first time, estimate unit costs for selected assets and report variances from those estimates. DOD also chartered a new board with more BMDS oversight responsibility than its predecessor, although it does not have approval authority for some key decisions made by MDA. Finally, MDA will begin buying certain assets with procurement funds like other programs. This will benefit transparency and accountability, because procurement funding generally requires that assets be fully paid for in the year they are bought. Previously, MDA, with Congressional authorization, was able to pay for assets incrementally over several years. Additional steps could be taken to further improve oversight. For example, MDA has not yet estimated the total cost of a block, and therefore, cannot have its costs independently verified--actions required of other programs to inform decisions about affordability and investment choices. However, MDA does plan to estimate block costs and have them verified at some future date."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 2002, the President of the United States directed the Department of  Defense (DOD) to begin fielding an initial Ballistic Missile Defense System  (BMDS) capable of defending the U.S. homeland, deployed troops, friends,  and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of flight.

This is a challenging  expectation, requiring a complex combination of defensive components\u2014 space-based sensors, surveillance and tracking radars, advanced  interceptors, and a battle management, command, control, and  communications component\u2014that work together as an integrated system.", "A typical scenario to engage an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM)  would unfold as follows:  Infrared sensors aboard early-warning satellites detect the hot plume of  a missile launch and alert the command authority of a possible attack.", "Upon receiving the alert, land- or sea-based radars are directed to track  the various objects released from the missile and, if so designed, to  identify the warhead from among spent rocket motors, decoys, and  debris.", "When the trajectory of the missile\u2019s warhead has been adequately  established, an interceptor\u2014consisting of a kill vehicle mounted atop a  booster\u2014is launched to engage the threat. The interceptor boosts itself  toward a predicted intercept point and releases the kill vehicle.", "The kill vehicle uses its onboard sensors and divert thrusters to detect,  identify, and steer itself into the warhead. With a combined closing  speed on the order of 10 kilometers per second (22,000 miles per hour),  the warhead is destroyed above the atmosphere through a \u201chit to kill\u201d  collision with the kill vehicle.", "To develop a system capable of carrying out such an engagement, MDA,  until December 2007, executed an acquisition strategy in which the  development of missile defense capabilities was organized in 2-year  increments known as blocks. Each block was intended to provide the  BMDS with capabilities that enhanced the development and overall  performance of the system. The first 2-year block\u2014Block 2004\u2014fielded a  limited initial capability that included early versions of the GMD, Aegis  BMD, Patriot Advanced Capability-3, and C2BMC elements. The agency\u2019s  second 2-year block\u2014Block 2006\u2014culminated on December 31, 2007, and  fielded additional BMDS assets. Block 2006 also continued the evolution of  Block 2004 by providing improved GMD interceptors, enhanced Aegis  BMD missiles, upgraded Aegis BMD ships, a Forward-Based X-Band- Transportable radar, and enhancements to C2BMC software.

Although MDA did  not meet its original block fielding goals, it was able in nearly all instances  to meet or exceed its revised goals.

According to DOD, the full upgrade of Thule is  the most economical option and it meets DOD\u2019s desire to retain a single  configuration of upgraded early warning radars. The Thule early warning  radar upgrade is being accomplished by two separate contract awards.   Raytheon was awarded a contract in April 2006 to develop and install  prime mission equipment; while Boeing was expected to receive a contract  in January 2008 to integrate the equipment into the BMDS ground  communication network.", "In March 2005, MDA included three C2BMC suites as part of its fielding  goal for Block 2006.

Faced with a $30 million reduction in C2BMC\u2019s fiscal year  2006 budget, MDA in March 2006 revised this goal to replace the 3 suites  with 3 less expensive Web browsers. However, by the end of Block 2006,  MDA found an innovative way to increase combatant commands\u2019  situational awareness and planning capability. In 2005, the C2BMC  program conducted a network load analysis and concluded that situational  awareness and planning capability\u2014equivalent to that provided by a suite- -could be gained by combining Web browsers and planners. To prove that  this approach would work, MDA fielded 4 Web browsers and one planner  at the U.S. European Command. MDA learned that this combination of  hardware, fielded in the quantities needed to meet a command\u2019s needs and  connected to an existing server, provided the situational awareness and  planning capability of a suite at less cost. MDA extended this approach by  fielding one Web browser and one planner at four other locations\u2014U.S.  Forces Japan; U.S. Forces Korea; the Commander of U.S. Strategic  Command; and the Commander of the Space and Missile Defense  Command.

During fiscal year 2007, some prime contractors performing work for the  BMDS overran their budgeted costs. To stay within its revised budget,  MDA was forced to reduce the amount of work it expected to accomplish  during the block. The full cost of the block cannot be determined because  of the deferral of work from one block to another. In addition, some MDA  prime contractors too often employ a planning methodology that has the  potential to obscure the time and money that will be needed to produce  the outcomes intended. If the work does not yield the intended results,  MDA could incur additional future costs. While MDA struggled to contain  costs during Block 2006, the agency awarded two contractors a large  percentage of available fee for performance in cost and/or program  management although the contractor-reported data showed declining cost  and schedule performance.

We estimate that at completion, the cumulative overrun in the  contracts could be between about $1.3 billion and $1.9 billion. Our  predictions of final contract costs were developed using formulas  accepted within the cost community and were based on the assumption  that the contractor will continue to perform in the future as it has in the  past. It should also be noted that some contracts include more than Block  2006 work. For example, the STSS contract includes work being  accomplished in anticipation of future blocks. Our analysis is presented in  table 3 below. Appendix II provides further details on the cost and  schedule performance of the contractors outlined in the table.", "Technical problems and software issues caused several BMDS elements to  overrun their fiscal year 2007 budgeted costs. In addition, 4 of the 10  contracts we reviewed contained some kind of replanning activity during  fiscal year 2007 and the ABL contract was partially rebaselined.  Contractors may replan when they conclude that the current plan for  completing the effort remaining on the contract is unrealistic. A replan can  include reallocating the remaining budget over the rest of the work,  realigning the schedule within the contractually defined milestones, and  setting either cost or schedule variances to zero or setting both to zero. A  rebaseline is similar, but it may also add additional time and/or funding for  the remaining work.", "The ABL contractor was overrunning both its fiscal year 2007 budget and  schedule early in the year. Although by year\u2019s end it appears that the  contractor recovered, the contractor would have continued to overrun  both its budget and its schedule if most of the contract had not been  rebaselined. The contractor realized cost and schedule growth as it  worked to solve software integration problems in the Beam Control/Fire  Control component and dealt with a low-power laser needed for flight  tests that was not putting enough energy on the target. After encountering  these problems, the ABL contractor did not have sufficient schedule or  budget to complete the remaining contract work. Therefore, in May 2007,  the program allowed the contractor to rebaseline all of the remaining work  devoted to developing, integrating, flight testing, and delivering the ABL  prototype. The rebaselining effort added about $253 million to the contract  and extended the contract\u2019s period of performance by more than a year.", "The THAAD prime contractor\u2019s cost overrun of $91.1 million was primarily  caused by technical problems related to the element\u2019s missile, launcher,  radar, and test components. Missile component cost overruns were caused  by higher than anticipated costs in hardware fabrication, assembly, and  support touch labor for structures, propulsion, and other subassembly  components. Additionally, design issues with the launcher\u2019s missile round  pallet and the electronics assembly that controls the launcher caused the  contractor to experience higher than anticipated labor and material costs.  The radar component ended the fiscal year with a negative cost variance  as more staff was required than planned to resolve hardware design issues  in the radar\u2019s prime power unit. The contractor also experienced negative  cost variances with the system test component because the Launch and  Test Support Equipment required additional set-up time at the flight test  range.", "The STSS contractor\u2019s $67.7 million fiscal year 2007 cost variance is  primarily attributed to problems that occurred during thermal vacuum  testing of the first satellite. Since the satellites are legacy hardware built  under a former program, there are no spares available for testing. As a  result, the contractor needed to handle the parts carefully to avoid damage  to the hardware, increasing the time devoted to the test. Further test  delays occurred when a number of interface issues surfaced during testing  and when the cause of component problems could not be easily traced to  their source. The program office believes that the cost variance would  have been less if design engineers had been available during testing.  Because engineers were not present to quickly identify the cause of  component problems, a time-consuming analysis of each problem was  needed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Total Block 2006 Costs Cannot be Determined", "paragraphs": ["In March 2007, we reported that a full accounting of Block 2006 costs was  not possible because MDA has the flexibility to redefine block outcomes.

For  example, MDA deferred some Block 2004 work until Block 2006 so that it  could use the funds appropriated for that work to cover unexpected cost  increases caused by technical problems recognized during development,  testing, and production. With the deferral of the work, its cost was no  longer counted as a Block 2004 cost, but as a Block 2006 cost. As a result,  Block 2004\u2019s cost was understated and Block 2006\u2019s cost is overstated.

According to earned value experts and the National Defense Industrial  Association, while it is appropriate to plan such tasks as supervision or  contract administration as LOE, it is not appropriate to plan tasks that are  intended to result in a product, such as a study or a software build, as LOE  because contractors do not report schedule variances for LOE work.  Therefore, when contractors incorrectly plan discrete work as LOE,  reports that are meant to allow the government to assess contractor cost  and schedule performance may be positive, but the government may not  have full insight into the contractor\u2019s progress. The greater the percentage  of LOE, the weaker the link between inputs (time and money) and  outcomes (end products), which is the essence of earned value analysis.", "Essentially, depending on the magnitude of LOE, schedule variances at the  bottom line can be understated.

In such  cases, the government may have to expend additional time and money to  achieve the outcomes desired.

Table 4 presents the percentage of work in each BMDS  prime contract that is categorized as LOE.", "The Aegis BMD SM-3, MKV, ABL, and C2BMC contractors planned more  than half of certain work as LOE. In several instances, MDA Earned Value  Management officials and program office reviewers agreed that some of  the LOE work could be redefined into discrete work packages. For  example, from January through December 2007, the C2BMC contractor  planned 73 percent of its work as LOE. This included activities such as  software development and integration and test activities that result in two  definable products\u2014software packages and tests. At the direction of the  C2BMC Program Office, the C2BMC contractor redefined some contract  work, including software development and integration and test activities,  as discrete, reducing the amount of LOE on the contract to 52 percent.", "The Aegis BMD element also reported a high percentage of LOE for its  Standard Missile-3 contract, particularly considering that its products\u2014 individual missiles\u2014are quite discrete. In August 2007, the element  reported that the contractor had planned 73 percent of the contract work  as LOE. The portion of the work that contained this amount of LOE was  completed in March 2007 with an underrun of $7.2 million. Although the  contractor reported an underrun for this work upon its completion, the  high percentage of LOE may have, over the contract period, distorted the  contractor\u2019s actual cost and schedule performance. Similarly, it is  important to note that the amount of LOE for the SM-3 work that is  currently ongoing is considerably less. Program officials told us that prior  to the commencement of this segment of work, the MDA Earned Value  Management Group and program officials recommended that the program  minimize the amount of LOE on its contracts.

The board then recommends to a fee determining official the  amount of fee to be paid.  MDA\u2019s Director is the fee-determining official  for all BMDS prime contracts that we assessed.", "During fiscal year 2007, MDA awarded approximately 95 percent, or $606  million, of available award fee to its prime contractors. While the cost,  schedule, and technical performance of several contractors appeared to be  aligned with their award fee, two contractors were rated as performing  very well in the cost and/or program management elements and received  commensurate fees even though earned value management data showed  that their cost and schedule performance was declining.  On the other  hand, MDA did not award any fee to the THAAD contractor for its  management of contract cost during a time when earned value data  showed steadily increasing costs. Although DOD guidance discourages the  use of earned value performance metrics in award fee criteria, MDA  includes this as a factor in several of its award fee plans. The agency  considers many factors in rating contractors\u2019 performance and making  award fee determinations, including consideration of earned value data  that shows cost, schedule, and technical trends.  In addition, MDA has  begun to revise its award fee policy to align agency practices more closely  with DOD\u2019s current policy that better links performance with award fees.", "The ABL and Aegis BMD weapon system contractors received a large  percentage of the 2007 award fee available to them for the cost and/or  program management element. MDA rated the ABL contractor\u2019s  performance in cost and program management elements as \u201cvery good,\u201d  awarding the contractor 88 percent of the fee available in these  performance areas. According to the award fee plan, one of several factors  that is considered in rating the contractor\u2019s performance as very good is  whether earned value data indicates that there are few unfavorable cost,  schedule, and/or technical variances or trends. During the February 2006  to January 2007 award fee period, earned value data shows that the  contractor overran its budget by more than $57 million and did not  complete $11 million of planned work. Similarly, the Aegis BMD weapon  system contractor was to be rated as to how effectively it managed its  contract\u2019s cost. The award fee plan for this contractor also directs that  earned value be one of the factors considered in making such an  evaluation. During the fee period that ran from October 2006 through  March 2007, MDA rated the contractor\u2019s cost management performance as  outstanding and awarded 100 percent of the available fee. Earned value  data during this time period indicates that the contractor overran its  budget by more than $6 million.

In an effort to rectify this problem, the agency released a  revised award fee policy in February 2007 to ensure its compliance with  recent DOD policies that are intended to address award fee issues  throughout the Department. Specifically, MDA\u2019s policy directs that every  contract\u2019s award fee plan include:    Criteria for each element of the award fee that is specific enough to  enable the agency to evaluate contractor performance and to  determine how much fee the contractor can earn for that element. The  criteria is to clearly define the performance that the government  expects from the contractor for the applicable award fee period and  the criteria for any one element must be distinguishable from criteria  for other elements of the award fee;    An emphasis on rewarding results rather than effort or activity; and    An incentive to meet or exceed agency requirements.", "Additionally, MDA\u2019s policy calls for using the Award Fee Advisory Board  to not only make award fee recommendations to the fee determining  official, but to also biannually report to MDA\u2019s Director as to whether  award fee recommendations are consistent with DOD\u2019s Contractor  Performance Assessment Report\u2014a report that provides a record, both  positive and negative, on a given contract for a specific period of time.

In December 2006, the  program stopped a test after a crew member changed the ship\u2019s doctrine  parameters just prior to target launch, preventing the ship\u2019s fire control  system from conducting the planned engagement. During this test event,  the weapon system failed to recognize the test target as a threat, which  prevented the SM-3 missile from launching. Also, according to program  officials, the system did not provide a warning message which contributed  to the mission being aborted prematurely and prevented the Aegis BMD  program from meeting its test objectives. However, 4 months later, the  same flight test event was successfully completed and all test objectives  were met. During that event, the program was able to demonstrate that the  Aegis BMD could simultaneously track and intercept a ballistic missile and  an anti-ship cruise missile. In June 2007, the program successfully  completed its first flight test utilizing an Aegis BMD destroyer to intercept  a separating target, and in November, the program conducted its first test  that engaged two ballistic missile targets simultaneously.

However, the  fourth test was delayed, initially due to target availability driven by late  modifications to the target hardware configuration.  Additionally, during  pre-flight testing, the contractor found debris in the interceptor. This  caused the interceptor to be returned to the factory for problem  investigation.

One such activity was the execution of the program\u2019s first of four key  knowledge points\u2014a ground test to demonstrate ABL\u2019s ability to acquire  and track a target while performing atmospheric compensation. The test  was conducted in December 2006, 3 \u00bd months later than planned. At the  culmination of the test, program officials noted two problems. First, the  system\u2019s beam control/fire control software was not integrated as  anticipated. In addition, the energy that the low-power laser placed on the  target during the test was not optimal. According to program officials,  both of these issues were resolved before the system began flight testing  the full beam control/fire control component in February 2007. However,  the delays caused the program to further postpone a key lethality  demonstration\u2014a demonstration in which the ABL will attempt to shoot  down a short-range ballistic missile\u2014until last quarter of fiscal year 2009.

To demonstrate the achievement of the two knowledge points,  the contractor performed a flight test that showed the low-power laser  was integrated and the beam control/fire control functioned sufficiently to  perform target tracking and atmospheric compensation against an  airborne target board.

The  STSS program is integrating two demonstration satellites with sensor  payloads from legacy hardware developed under a former program. The  use of legacy hardware has complicated the test program because spares  needed for testing are not available. In order to preserve the condition of  the legacy components, the program must exercise caution in handling the  components to prevent damage, which has caused delays in testing.  Additionally, a thermal vacuum test on the first space vehicle, to assess the  ability of the satellite to operate in the cold vacuum of space, took twice as  long as scheduled, due to a number of interface issues. Although the  program was able to complete the integration and test of both  demonstration satellites in 2007\u2014major objectives for the program\u2014funds  were not available to launch the satellites as planned. Program officials  believe that the satellites could be launched as early as April 2008 and as  late as July 2008, 1 year later than originally scheduled.

However, insufficient data exists to fully assess  whether MDA achieved its revised performance goals. The performance of  some fielded assets is also questionable because parts have not yet been  replaced that were identified by auditors in MDA\u2019s Office of Quality,  Safety, and Mission Assurance as less reliable or inappropriate for use in  space. In addition, tests of the GMD element have not included target suite  dynamic features and intercept geometries representative of the  operational environment in which GMD will perform its mission and  BMDS tests only allow a partial assessment of the system\u2019s effectiveness,  suitability, and survivability.", "MDA uses a combination of simulations and flight tests to determine  whether performance goals are met. Models and simulations are needed to  predict performance because the cost of tests prevents the agency from  conducting sufficient testing to compute statistical probabilities of  performance. The models and simulations that project BMDS capability  against intercontinental ballistic missiles present several problems. First,  the models and simulations that predict performance of the GMD element  have not been accredited by an independent agency. According to the  Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation without accredited  models, GMD\u2019s performance cannot be predicted with respect to (1)  variations in threat parameters that lie within the bounds of intelligence  estimates, (2) stressing ground-based interceptor fly-outs and  exoatmospheric kill vehicle engagements, and (3) variations in natural  environments that lie within meteorological norms. Second, too few flight  tests have been completed to ensure the accuracy of the models\u2019 and  simulations\u2019 predictions. Since 2002, MDA has only completed two end-to- end tests of engagement sequences that the GMD element might carry out.  While these tests provide some evidence that the element can work as  intended, MDA must test other engagement sequences, which would  include other GMD assets that have not yet participated in an end-to-end  flight test. For example, MDA has not yet used the Sea-based X-band radar  as the primary sensor in an end-to-end test. Additionally, officials in the  Office of the Director, Operational Test and Evaluation told us that MDA  needs more flight tests to have a high level of confidence that GMD can  repeatedly intercept incoming ICBMs. Further testing is also needed to  demonstrate that Aegis BMD can provide real-time, long-range  surveillance and tracking data for the GMD element. In March 2006, we  reported that the cancellation of a GMD flight test prevented MDA from  exercising Aegis BMD\u2019s long-range surveillance and tracking capability in  a manner consistent with an actual defensive mission. Program officials  informed us that the Aegis BMD is capable of performing this function and  has demonstrated its ability to surveil and track ICBMs in several  exercises. However, MDA has not yet shown that Aegis BMD can  communicate this data to GMD during a live intercept engagement and  that GMD can use the data to prepare a weapon task plan for actual\u2014 rather than simulated\u2013\u2013interceptors. Officials in the Office of the Director  for Operational Test and Evaluation told us that having Aegis BMD  perform long-range surveillance and tracking during a live engagement  would provide the data needed to more accurately gauge performance.", "Similarly, MDA has not yet proved that the FBX-T radar can provide real- time, long-range surveillance and tracking data for the GMD element. On  several occasions, MDA has shown that the FBX-T can acquire and track  targets of opportunity, but the radar\u2019s data has not yet been used to  develop a weapon system task plan for a GMD intercept engagement.  Because the radar\u2019s permanent location in Japan does not allow MDA to  conduct tests in which the FBX-T is GMD\u2019s primary fire control radar, the  Director, Operational Test and Evaluation, in 2006 recommended that  prior to emplacing a second FBX-T at its permanent location that MDA test  the radar\u2019s capability to act as GMD\u2019s primary sensor in an intercept test.", "Confidence in the performance of the BMDS is also reduced because of  unresolved GMD technical and quality issues. The GMD element has  experienced the same anomaly during each of its flight tests since 2001.  This anomaly has not yet prevented the program from achieving any of its  primary test objectives, but to date neither its source nor solution has  been clearly identified or defined. Program officials plan to continue their  assessment of test data to identify the anomaly\u2019s root cause and have  implemented design changes to mitigate the effects and reduce risks  associated with the anomaly. The reliability of emplaced GMD interceptors  raises further questions about the performance of the BMDS. Quality  issues discovered by auditors in MDA\u2019s Office of Quality, Safety, and  Mission Assurance nearly 3 years ago have not yet been rectified in all  fielded interceptors. According to the auditors, inadequate mission  assurance and quality control procedures may have allowed less reliable  parts or parts inappropriate for use in space to be incorporated into the  manufacturing process, thereby limiting the reliability and performance of  some fielded assets. The program has strengthened its quality control  processes and is taking several steps to mitigate similar risks in the future.   These steps include component analysis of failed items, implementing  corrective action with vendors, and analyzing system operational data to  determine which parts are affecting weapon system availability.  MDA has  begun to replace the questionable parts in the manufacturing process and  to purchase the parts that it plans to replace in fielded interceptors.   However, it will not complete the retrofit effort until 2012.", "Additionally, test officials told us that although the end-to-end GMD test  conducted during 2007 demonstrated that for a single engagement  sequence military operators could successfully engage a target, the target  represented a relatively unsophisticated threat because it lacked specific  target suite dynamic features and intercept geometry.  Other aspects of the  test were more realistic\u2014such as closing velocity and fly-out range\u2014but  these were relatively unchallenging.  While the test parameters may be  acceptable in a developmental test, they are not fully representative of an  operational environment and do not provide high confidence that GMD  will perform well operationally.", "Finally, because BMDS assets are being fielded based on developmental  tests, which are not always representative of the operational environment,  operational test officials have limited test data to determine whether all  BMDS elements/components being fielded are effective and suitable for  and survivable on the battlefield.  MDA has added operational test  objectives to its developmental test program, but many of the objectives  are aimed at proving that military personnel can operate the equipment.  In  addition, limited flight test data is available for characterizing the BMDS\u2019  capability against intercontinental ballistic missiles.  Up until 2007, the  overall lack of data limited the Office of the Director of Operational Test  and Evaluation, in annual assessments, to commenting on the operational  realism of tests and recommending other tests needed to characterize  system effectiveness and suitability.  In 2007, tests provided sufficient  information to partially quantify the effectiveness and suitability of the  BMDS' midcourse capability (Aegis BMD and GMD) and to fully  characterize a limited portion of the BMDS' terminal capability (PAC-3).   However, according to the Office of the Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation, further testing that incorporates realistic operational  objectives and verification, validation, and accreditation of models and  simulations will be needed before the performance, suitability, and  survivability of the BMDS can be fully characterized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Efforts Underway to Improve BMDS Management and Oversight", "paragraphs": ["Since its initiation in 2002, MDA has been given a significant amount of  flexibility in executing the development of the BMDS.

As we reported in  2007, MDA operates with considerable autonomy to change goals and  plans, which makes it difficult to reconcile outcomes with original  expectations and to determine the actual cost of each block and of  individual operational assets.

As we noted in our fiscal  year 2006 report, MDA\u2019s past block structure did not estimate unit costs  for assets considered part of a given block or categorize block costs in a  manner that allowed calculations of expected or actual unit costs. For  example, the expected cost of Block 2006 GMD interceptors emplaced for  operational use was not separated from other GMD costs. Even if MDA  had categorized the interceptors\u2019 cost, it would have been difficult to  determine the exact cost of these interceptors because MDA acquires and  assembles components into interceptors over several blocks and it has  been difficult to track the cost of components to a specific group of  interceptors. Under the new block construct, MDA expects to develop unit  costs for selected block assets\u2014such as THAAD interceptors\u2014and  request an independent verification of that unit cost from DOD\u2019s Cost  Analysis Improvement Group.  MDA will also track the actual unit cost of  the assets and report significant cost growth to Congress.  However, MDA  has not yet determined for which assets a unit cost will be developed and  how much a unit cost must increase before that increase is reported to  Congress.", "The new construct also makes it clearer as to which assets should be  included in a block. Under the agency\u2019s prior block construct, assets  included in a given block were sometimes not planned for delivery until a  later block. For example, as we reported in March 2007, MDA included  costs for ABL and STSS as part of its Block 2006 cost goal although those  elements did not field or plan to field assets during Block 2006. Agency  officials told us those elements were included in the block because they  believed the elements could offer some emergency capability during the  block timeframe.", "Finally, the new block construct should improve the transparency of each  block\u2019s actual cost. Under its prior construct, MDA deferred work from  one block to another; but it did not track the cost of the deferred work so  that it could be attributed to the block that it benefited. For example, MDA  deferred some work needed to characterize and verify the Block 2004  capability until Block 2006 and counted the cost of those activities as a  cost of Block 2006. By doing so, it understated the cost of Block 2004 and  overstated the cost of Block 2006. Because MDA did not track the cost of  the deferred work, the agency was unable to adjust the cost of either block  to accurately capture the cost of each. MDA officials told us that under its  new block construct, MDA will no longer transfer work, along with its  cost, to a future block.

Instead, when a  firm commitment can be made to Congress for a block of capability, MDA  will develop a budget baseline for the block.  This budget will include  anticipated funding for each block activity that is planned for the 6 years  included in DOD\u2019s Future Years Defense Plan.  MDA officials told us that if  the budget for a baselined block changes, MDA plans to report and explain  those variations to Congress. At some future date, MDA does expect to  develop a full cost estimate for each committed block and is in discussions  with DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group on having the group verify  each estimate; but documents do not yet include a timeline for estimating  block cost or having that estimate verified.  For accountability, other DOD  programs are required to provide the full cost of developing and producing  their weapon system before system development and demonstration can  begin. Until the cost of a block of BMDS capability is fully known, it will  be difficult for decision makers to compare the value of investing in a  block of BMDS capability to the value of investing in other DOD programs  or to determine whether the block of capability that is being initiated will  be affordable over the long term.", "The new block construct does not address whether the assets included in  a block will be transferred at the block\u2019s completion to a military service  for production and operation.  Officials representing multiple DOD  organizations recognize that the transfer criteria established in 2002 are  neither complete nor clear given the BMDS\u2019s complexity. Without clear  transfer criteria, MDA has transferred the management of only one  element\u2014the Patriot Advanced Capability-3\u2014to the military for  production and operation. Joint Staff officials told us that for all other  elements, MDA and the military services have been negotiating the  transition of responsibilities for the sustainment of fielded elements\u2014a  task that has proven arduous and time consuming. Although MDA  documents show that under its new block construct the agency should be  ready at the end of each block to deliver BMDS components that are fully  mission-capable, MDA officials could not tell us when MDA\u2019s Director will  recommend that management of components, including production  responsibilities, be transferred to the military. MDA officials maintain that  even though a particular configuration of a weapon could be fully mission- capable, that configuration may never be produced because it could be  replaced by a new configuration.  Yet, by the block\u2019s end, a transfer plan  for the fully mission-capable configuration will have been drafted,  developmental ground and flight tests will be complete, elements and  components will be certified for operations, and doctrine, organization,  training, material, leadership, personnel, and facilities are expected to be  in place.", "Another issue not addressed under MDA\u2019s new block construct is whether  the concurrent development and fielding of BMDS elements and/or  components will continue. Fully developing a component or element and  demonstrating its capability prior to production increases the likelihood  that the product will perform as designed and can be produced at the cost  estimated. To field an initial capability quickly, MDA accepted the risk of  concurrent development and fielding during Block 2004.  For example, by  the end of Block 2004, the agency realized that the performance of some  Ground-based interceptors could be degraded because the interceptors  included inappropriate or potentially unreliable parts. MDA has begun the  process of retrofitting these interceptors, but work will not be completed  until 2012. Meanwhile there is a risk that some interceptors might not  perform as designed. MDA also continued to accept this risk during Block  2006 as it fielded assets before they were fully tested.

When the MDSG was chartered in 2002, it was  to provide constructive advice to MDA\u2019s Director. However, the Director  was not required to follow the advice of the group. According to a DOD  official, although the MDSG met many times initially, it did not meet after  June 2005. This led, in 2007, to the formation of the MDEB.  This board\u2019s  mission is to review and make recommendations on MDA\u2019s  comprehensive acquisition strategy to the Deputy Secretary of Defense. It  is also to provide the Under Secretary of Defense, Acquisition, Technology  and Logistics, with a recommended strategic program plan and a feasible  funding strategy based on \u201cbusiness case\u201d analysis that considers the best  approach to fielding integrated missile defense capabilities in support of  joint MDA and warfighter objectives  The MDEB will be assisted by four standing committees. These  committees, which are chaired by senior-level officials from the Office of  the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Staff, could play an important  oversight role as they are expected to make recommendations to the  MDEB, which in turn will recommend courses of action to the Under  Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics (USD  AT&L) and the Director, MDA, as appropriate. The following table  identifies the chair of each standing committee as well as key committee  functions.", "The MDEB will not have access to all information normally available to  oversight bodies.  For other major defense acquisition programs, the  Defense Acquisition Board must approve the program\u2019s progress through  the acquisition cycle. Further, before a program can enter the System  Development and Demonstration phase of the cycle, statute requires that  certain information be developed.  This information is then provided to the  Defense Acquisition Board. However, in 2002, the Secretary of Defense  allowed MDA to defer application of the defense acquisition system that  among other things require programs to follow a defined acquisition cycle  and obtain approval before advancing from one phase of the cycle to  another. Because MDA does not follow this cycle, it does not enter System  Development and Demonstration and it does not trigger the statutes  requiring the development of information that the Defense Acquisition  Board uses to inform its decisions. For example, most major defense  acquisition programs are required by statute to obtain an independent  verification of program cost prior to beginning system development and  demonstration, and/or production and deployment.  Independent life- cycle cost estimates provide confidence that a program is executable  within estimated cost and along with other DOD-wide budget demands.  Although MDA plans to develop unit cost for selected block assets and  request that DOD\u2019s Cost Analysis Improvement Group verify the unit  costs, the agency does not initially plan to develop a block cost estimate  and, therefore, cannot seek an independent verification of that cost. In  addition, even when MDA estimates block costs, the agency will not be  required to obtain an independent verification of that cost, because, as  noted earlier, the BMDS program operates outside of DOD\u2019s acquisition  cycle. Although not required, MDA officials told us that they have initiated  discussions with the Cost Analysis Improvement Group on independent  verifications of block cost estimates.", "Statute also requires an independent verification of a system\u2019s suitability  for and effectiveness on the battlefield before a program can proceed  beyond low-rate initial production. After the test is completed, the  Director for Operational Test and Evaluation assesses whether the test  was adequate to support an evaluation of the system\u2019s suitability and  effectiveness for the battlefield, whether the test showed the system to be  acceptable, and whether any limitations in suitability and effectiveness  were noted. However, a comparable assessment of the BMDS assets being  produced for fielding will not be available to the MDEB.  As noted earlier,  the limited amount of testing completed, which has been primarily  developmental in nature, and the lack of verified, validated, and accredited  models and simulations prevent the Director of Operational Test and  Evaluation from fully assessing the effectiveness,  suitability, and  survivability of the BMDS in annual assessments.", "MDA will also make some decisions without approval from the MDEB or  any higher level DOD official. Although the charter of the MDEB includes  the mission to make recommendations to MDA and the Under Secretary of  Defense for AT&L on investment options, program priorities, and MDA\u2019s  strategy for developing and fielding an operational missile defense  capability, the MDEB will not have the opportunity to review and  recommend changes to BMDS blocks. According to a briefing on the  business rules and processes for MDA\u2019s new block structure, the decision  to initiate a new block of BMDS capability will be made by MDA\u2019s  Director. Also cost, schedule, and performance parameters will be  established by MDA when technologies that the block depends upon are  mature, a credible cost estimate can be developed, funding is available,  and the threat is both imminent and severe. The Director will inform the  MDEB as well as Congress when a new block is initiated, but he will not  seek the approval of either.", "Finally, there will be parts of the BMDS program that will be difficult for  the MDEB to oversee because of the nature of the work being performed.  MDA plans to place any program that is developing technology in a  category known as Capability Development. These programs, such as ABL,  KEI, and MKV, will not have a firm cost, schedule, or performance  baseline. This is generally true for technology development programs in  DOD because they are in a period of discovery, which makes schedule and  cost difficult to estimate. On the other hand, the scale of the technology  development in BMDS is unusually large, ranging from $2 billion to about  $5 billion dollars a year\u2014eventually comprising nearly half of MDA\u2019s  budget by fiscal year 2012. The MDEB will have access to the budgets  planned for these programs over the next 5 or 6 years, each program\u2019s  focus, and whether the technology is meeting short-term key events or  knowledge points. But without some kind of baseline for matching  progress with cost, the MDEB will not know how much more time or  money will be needed to complete technology maturation. MDA\u2019s  experience with the ABL program provides a good example of the  difficulty in estimating the cost and schedule of technology development.", "In 1996, the ABL program believed that all ABL technology could be  demonstrated by 2001 at a cost of about $1 billion. However, MDA now  projects that this technology will not be demonstrated until 2009 and its  cost has grown to over $5 billion. While the uncertainties of technology  development must be recognized, some organizations suggest ways to  establish a baseline appropriate for such efforts. For example, the Air  Force Research Laboratory suggested a methodology to estimate a  technology\u2019s cost once analytical and laboratory studies physically  validate analytical predictions of separate elements of the technology."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "MDEB Could Play Key Role In Proposal to Return BMDS to Standard Requirements Process", "paragraphs": ["In an effort to further improve oversight, the Joint Requirements Oversight  Council proposed a plan to transition the BMDS into standard DOD  processes.

The  Vice Chairman believed that the council should exercise oversight of MDA  in order to improve Department-wide capability integration.

Instead, he noted that the Deputy Secretary of Defense recently  established the MDEB to recommend and oversee the implementation of  strategic policies and plans, program priorities, and investment options for  the BMDS.

The  Congressional Research Service reported in 2006 that \u201cincremental  funding fell out of favor because opponents believed it could make the  total procurement costs of weapons and equipment more difficult for  Congress to understand and track, create a potential for DOD to start  procurement of an item without necessarily stating its total cost to  Congress, permit one Congress to \u2018tie the hands\u2019 of future Congresses, and  increase weapon procurement costs by exposing weapons under  construction to uneconomic start-up and stop costs.\u201d Our analysis of  MDA developed costs, which are presented in table 7, also shows that  incremental funding is usually more expensive than full funding, in part,  because inflation decreases the buying power of the dollar each year.", "The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 directed MDA  to submit a plan to transition from using research and development funds  exclusively to using procurement, operations and maintenance, military  construction, and research and development funds by March 1, 2008.  However, it allowed MDA to continue to use research and development  funds in fiscal year 2009 to incrementally fund previously approved missile  defense assets.  The act also directed that beginning in fiscal year 2009, the  MDA budget request include, in addition to RDT&E funds, military  construction funds and procurement funds for some long lead items such  as those required for the third and fourth THAAD fire units and Aegis BMD  SM-3 Block 1A missiles. MDA did not request long lead funding for either  THAAD or SM-3 missiles in its fiscal year 2009 budget because MDA has  slipped the schedule for procuring fire units 3 and 4 by one year, and the  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 was not signed in  time to allow MDA to adjust its budget request for SM-3 missiles.", "Congress also provided MDA with the authority to use procurement funds  for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 to field its BMDS capabilities on an  incremental funding basis, without any requirement for full funding.  Congress has granted similar authority to other DOD programs. In the  conference report accompanying the Fiscal Year 2008 National Defense  Authorization Act, the conferees indicated that if MDA wishes to use  incremental funding after fiscal year 2010, DOD must request additional  authority for a specific program or capability. Conferees cautioned DOD  that additional authority will be considered on a limited case-by-case basis  and that future missile defense programs will be funded in a manner more  consistent with other DOD acquisition programs.", "Since 2002, MDA has been granted the flexibility to incrementally fund the  fielding of its operational assets with research and development funds.

After reviewing the agency\u2019s incremental funding plan for future  procurements of THAAD fire units and Aegis BMD missiles, we analyzed  the effect of fully funding these assets using present value techniques and  found that the agency could save about $125 million by fully funding their  purchase and purchasing them in an economical manner. Our analysis is  provided in table 7. In addition, more detailed analysis is available in  appendix III.", "According to our analysis, fully funding the THAAD and Aegis BMD assets  will, in all instances, save MDA money.

As a result, fielded  capability has increased. On the other hand, some problems continue that  make it difficult to assess how well the BMDS is progressing relative to the  funds it has received and the goals it has set for those funds.  First, under  the proposed block construct, MDA plans to develop a firm baseline for  each block and have it independently reviewed.  However, MDA has not  yet developed estimates for full block costs, so the initial baseline  incorporates the budget for each block only through DOD\u2019s Future Years  Defense Plan.  Second, while MDA expects to estimate unit costs and track  increases, it is unclear as to what criteria will be used for reporting  variances to Congress. Third, while MDA has gotten some contractors to  lower the portion of work planned as level of effort, a substantial amount  of work remains so planned. Fourth, while it may not be reasonable to  expect the same level of accountability for technology development efforts  as it is for development and production of systems, the high level of  investment\u2014up to half of its budget\u2014MDA plans to make in technology  development warrants some mechanism for reconciling the cost of these  efforts with their progress. Finally, MDA fields assets before development  testing is complete and without conducting operational testing. We have  previously recommended that MDA return to its original non-concurrent,  knowledge-based approach to developing, testing, and fielding assets.  Short of that, the developmental testing that is done provides the primary  basis for the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation to assess  whether a block of BMDS capability is suitable and effective for the  battlefield.

DOD observed that  MDA uses knowledge points, technology readiness levels, and engineering  and manufacturing readiness levels in assessing the progress of its  technology programs and that it will continue to investigate other methods  of making such assessments.  While we recognize their value, these  methods typically assess progress in the short term and do not provide an  estimate of the remaining cost and time needed to complete a technology  program.  Because MDA must balance its efforts to improve the existing  BMDS while developing new capability, DOD and MDA need to ensure  that only the most beneficial technology programs in terms of  performance, cost, and schedule are pursued.  This will require an  understanding of not only the benefit to be derived from the technology,  but also an understanding of the cost and time needed to bring the  technology to fruition.", "DOD also partially concurred with our last recommendation that MDA and  the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation (DOT&E) agree on criteria  and additional scope for developmental tests that will allow a full  determination of the effectiveness and suitability of a BMDS block for  fielding.  DOD noted that it is MDA\u2019s mission to work with the warfighter,  rather than DOT&E, to determine that the BMDS is ready for fielding, but  that MDA will work closely with DOT&E to strengthen the testing of  BMDS suitability and effectiveness.  We agree that DOT&E is not  responsible for fielding decisions, but its mission is to ensure that weapon  systems are realistically and adequately tested and that accurate  evaluations of operational effectiveness, suitability, and survivability are  available for production decisions. MDA improved the operational realism  of testing in 2007 and for the first time DOT&E considered tests at least  partially adequate to make an assessment of the BMDS.  However, a full  assessment is not yet possible and we continue to recommend that MDA  and DOT&E take steps to make as full a BMDS evaluation as possible.

To implement this system, contractors examine the  totality of the work directed by the contract and break it into executable  work packages. Each work package is assigned a schedule and a budget  that is expected to enable the work\u2019s completion. On a monthly basis, the  contractor examines initiated work packages to determine whether the  work scheduled for the month was performed on time and within budget.  If more work was completed than scheduled and the cost of the work  performed was less than budgeted, the contractor reports a positive  schedule and cost variance. However, if the contractor was unable to  complete all of the work scheduled and needed more funds to complete  the work than budgeted, the contractor reports a negative schedule and  cost variance. Of course, the results can be mixed. That is, the contractor  may have completed more work than scheduled but at a cost that  exceeded the budget. The contractor details its performance to MDA each  month in Contract Performance Reports. These reports also identify the  reasons that negative or positive variances are occurring.

The MKV program also planned 100  percent of Task Order 5 work as LOE.

This effort culminates in hardware\u2014a tangible  end product\u2014that is expected to exhibit certain performance  characteristics during the static hot fire test. The contractor could have  categorized this task order, at least in some part, as discrete work since  the work was expected to deliver a defined product with a schedule that  could slip or vary.

MDA has followed the FAR  requirements that task orders placed under an  indefinite  delivery/indefinite quantity contract must contain, at least, an estimated  cost or fee.", "During Block 2006\u2014January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2007\u2014MDA  authorized 137 unpriced changes and task orders with a value of more  than $6 billion. Consistent with the FAR requirements noted above, of the  total 137 unpriced changes and unpriced task orders, 61 percent of these\u2014 totaling $5.9 billion\u2014were not priced for more than 180 days. Agreement  on the price of several was not reached for more than a year, and  agreement on the price of one was not reached for more than two and a  half years. Table 11 below shows the value of unpriced changes and task  orders issued on behalf of each BMDS element and the number of days  after the contractor was authorized to proceed with the work before MDA  and its contractor agreed to a price, or cost and fee, for the work.", "Realizing that unpriced changes and unpriced task orders may greatly  reduce the government\u2019s negotiation leverage and typically result in higher  cost and fee for the overall effort, MDA, in February 2007, issued new  contract guidance that required tighter limits on the timeframes for  reaching agreement on price, or cost and fee. The agency now applies  some of the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement  guidelines established for undefinitized contract actions to unpriced  changes and unpriced task orders. Undefinitized contract actions are  different from MDA\u2019s unpriced changes or unpriced task orders in that  they are contract actions on which performance is begun before  agreement on all contract terms, including price, or cost and fee, is  reached. A contract modification or change will not be considered an  undefinitized contract action if it is within the scope and under the terms  of the contract. MDA has elected to follow some of the stricter  undefinitized contract action guidelines because the agency believes the  guidelines will lead to better cost results. Similar to the undefinitized  contract action guidelines, the agency\u2019s new guidelines require that MDA\u2019s  unpriced changes and unpriced task orders be definitized within 180 days,  that the contractor be given a dollar value that it cannot exceed until price  agreement is reached, and that approval for the unpriced change or task  order be obtained in advance. MDA\u2019s new policy also, to the maximum  extent practicable, limits the amount of funds that a contractor may be  given approval to spend on the work before agreement is reached on price  to less than 50 percent of the work\u2019s expected price."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Support Contracts", "paragraphs": ["MDA officials maintain that support contracts provide necessary  personnel and are instrumental in developing the BMDS quickly. The  agency contracts with 45 different companies that provide the majority of  the personnel who perform a variety of tasks. Table 12 illustrates the  broad categories of job functions that MDA support contractors carry out.", "Last year we reported that MDA had 8,186 approved personnel positions.  This number has not changed appreciably in the last year. According to  MDA\u2019s manpower database, about 8,748 personnel positions\u2014not  counting prime contractors\u2014currently support the missile defense  program. These positions are filled by government civilian and military  employees, contract support employees, employees of federally funded  research and development centers (FFRDC), researchers in university and  affiliated research centers, as well as a small number of executives on loan  from other organizations. MDA funds around 95 percent of the total 8,748  positions through its research and development appropriation. Of this 95  percent, 2,450, or about 29 percent, of the positions are set aside for  government civilian personnel. Another 60 percent, or 5,005 positions, are  allotted for support contractors. The remaining 11 percent are positions  either being filled, or expected to be filled, by employees of FFRDCs and  university and affiliated research centers that are on contract or under  other types of agreements to perform missile defense tasks. MDA officials  noted that nearly 500 of the 8,748 personnel positions available were  currently vacant. Table 13 shows the staffing levels within the BMDS  elements.", "Support contractors in MDA program and functional offices may perform  tasks that closely support those tasks described in the FAR as inherently  governmental. According to the FAR, tasks such as determining agency  policy and approving requirements for prime contracts should only be  performed by government personnel. Contract personnel that, for  example, develop statements of work, support acquisition planning, or  assist in budget preparation are carrying out tasks that may closely  support tasks meeting this definition. Having support contractors  perform these tasks may create a potential risk that the contractors may  influence the government\u2019s control over and accountability for decisions.  MDA officials told us that when support contractors perform tasks that  closely support those reserved for government employees the agency  mitigates its risk by having knowledgeable government personnel provide  regular oversight or final approval of the work to ensure that the data  being generated is reasonable."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Incremental Funding", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Incremental Versus Full-funding of BMDS Assets", "paragraphs": ["In the tables below we provide more information comparing the cost of  purchasing THAAD and Aegis BMD assets incrementally versus fully- funding the assets.

We  evaluated each element\u2019s progress in fiscal year 2007 toward Block 2006  schedule, testing, performance, and cost goals. In assessing each element  we examined Program Execution Reviews, test plans and reports,  production plans, Contract Performance Reports, and MDA briefing  charts. We developed data collection instruments that were completed by  MDA and each element program office. The instruments gathered detailed  information on completed program activities including tests, prime  contracts, and estimates of element performance. To understand  performance issues, we talked with officials from MDA\u2019s Deputy for  Engineering and Program Director for Targets and Countermeasures, each  element program office, as well as the office of DOD\u2019s Director,  Operational Test and Evaluation. To assess each element\u2019s progress  toward its cost goals, we reviewed Contract Performance Reports and,  when available, the Defense Contract Management Agency\u2019s analyses of  these reports. We applied established earned value management  techniques to data captured in Contract Performance Reports to  determine trends and used established earned value management formulas  to project the likely costs of prime contracts at completion. We also  interviewed MDA officials within the Deputy for Acquisition Management  office to gather detailed information regarding BMDS prime contracts. We  reviewed 10 prime contracts for the 9 BMDS elements and also examined  fiscal year 2007 award fee plans, award fee letters, and gathered data on  the number of and policy for unpriced changes and unpriced task orders.  We became familiar with sections of the Federal Acquisition Regulation  and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement dealing with  contract type, contract award fees, and undefinitized contract actions.

We also considered whether MDA would need to  acquire long lead items for the assets and stated those dollars in the base  year that their purchase would be required.  We then compared the total  cost of incrementally funding the assets, as shown in MDA\u2019s funding plans,  to the fully funded cost that our methodology produced.", "To ensure that MDA-generated data used in our assessment are reliable,  we evaluated the agency\u2019s management control processes. We discussed  these processes with MDA senior management. In addition, we confirmed  the accuracy of MDA-generated data with multiple sources within MDA  and, when possible, with independent experts. To assess the validity and  reliability of prime contractors\u2019 earned value management systems and  reports, we interviewed officials and analyzed audit reports prepared by  the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
