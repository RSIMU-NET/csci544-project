Biometrics are unique personal aspects such as fingerprints and iris images used to identify an unfamiliar person. Federal agencies with national security missions, such as the Departments of Homeland Security (DHS) and State (DOS), need access to certain biometrics data gathered by the Department of Defense (DOD). GAO was asked to determine to what extent (1) DOD has guidance on the biometrics data to be collected to support military activities, and (2) there may be gaps in biometrics information shared between DOD and DHS. This is a public version of a For Official Use Only report, GAO-08-430NI , issued in May 2008. GAO examined DOD's guidance for field collection of biometrics data, biometrics sharing agreements, and information on national level efforts to enhance data sharing."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD has issued guidance on the biometrics data collected from individuals who are detained or allowed access to U.S. bases in Iraq, but has not issued guidance on data to be collected during field activities where U.S. forces encounter hostile or questionable individuals such as in Afghanistan and Iraq. DOD has allowed commanders to determine the type of data to collect, such as fingerprints or iris images, during their operations. GAO's analysis showed that allowing for this flexibility results in the collection of different data that are not necessarily comparable to each other. Some units may collect iris images while others collect fingerprints, which are not comparable data. Broader national security implications can arise, such as military personnel's inability to identify someone who has harmed or attempted to harm U.S. or coalition forces. These newly collected data are not necessarily comparable with data collected by other units or with federal databases that store biometrics data, such as the FBI's fingerprint database, DOD's biometric database, or the DHS biometric database. Having a standard set of data would help ensure consistent identification and confirmation of an individual's identity thus allowing forces to compare data across multiple databases in different commands. A standard set of data also would allow for comparison of new biometrics data collected in the field with existing biometrics data. DOD shares biometrics data that it collects on non-U.S. persons with other federal agencies through a variety of inter-agency agreements, but some gaps in data sharing may remain. Since the events of September 11, 2001, the President and Congress have issued policies that require agencies to share counterterrorism information, and agencies have in turn issued their own policies. National efforts to develop policies about such information sharing are still in development. In January 2007, the Deputy Secretary of Defense issued a memo that stated that DOD would immediately adopt the practice of sharing, when asked, unclassified DOD biometrics data records with other U.S. agencies that have counterterrorism missions--this includes data related to terrorism information but excludes data pertaining to U.S. persons. According to a DHS memorandum, DHS is not regularly receiving updates on certain types of DOD biometrics data that it could use. DHS officials told GAO they could use such data in various ways, such as to prohibit individuals from entering the United States who are determined to be inadmissible based on these data and other relevant information. GAO found that DHS officials are consulting with DOD on how to obtain additional biometrics data from DOD. Until national level policies are developed, opportunities to reduce gaps in national security through comprehensive data sharing may be lost unless remaining needs for biometrics data are identified and filled as appropriate and in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations and international agreements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The events of September 11, 2001, and operations to defeat insurgents in  Afghanistan and Iraq have made it increasingly critical for military units to  identify individuals they encounter in the field and share this information  with other units and certain federal agencies. Biometrics\u2014measurements  of unique personal characteristics, such as fingerprints, irises, and faces,  to identify an unfamiliar person\u2014have become an important tool in these  operations, as well as in the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) business  functions and military activities. For example, DOD uses biometrics to  verify its common credential and to support access controls. In military  activities, DOD uses biometrics to identify and verify individuals  encountered in the field as friend, foe, or neutral; to operate detention  facilities; to protect DOD personnel at expeditionary bases in theater  (force protection); and to recover and identify U.S. personnel in  Afghanistan and Iraq. Army and Marine Corps forces currently collect  biometrics data (fingerprints, iris scans, and facial images) from (1)  persons seeking access to U.S. installations in Iraq and Afghanistan, (2)  detainees, and (3) persons encountered by U.S. forces during military  operations. Latent fingerprints are also recovered in combat zones from  unknown individuals who may be foes or neutral.", "Several DOD organizations are involved in developing guidance on the  collection and use of biometrics data. The Secretary of Defense designated  the Secretary of the Army as the Executive Agent for Defense Biometrics.  Subsequently, the Secretary of the Army designated the Director of the  Army\u2019s Biometrics Task Force as the Executive Manager for Biometrics,  making her responsible for developing guidance for collecting and  processing biometrics data. Additionally, DOD appointed the Director,  Defense Research and Engineering, as the Principal Staff Assistant for  Biometrics. The Director has developed and issued a biometrics directive  identifying organizational roles and authorities for managing biometrics  data.", "Biometrics data, and the sharing of these data among federal agencies, are  important to the United States\u2019 broader national security mission beyond  DOD\u2019s operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Homeland Security Presidential  Directive 6, issued in September 2003, states that it is the policy of the  United States to develop, integrate, and maintain terrorist information, and  to use that terrorist information as appropriate and to the full extent  permitted by law to support certain screening and other processes,  including military, intelligence, law enforcement, immigration, and visa  processes. In accordance with this and other laws and regulations, DOD,  the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS), and the Department of State (DOS) share biometrics  information. The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  created an Information Sharing Environment, defined as an approach that  facilitates the sharing of terrorism and homeland security information,  with a Program Manager responsible for information sharing across the  federal government. Additionally, the National Science and Technology  Council, part of the Executive Office of the President, has created a  subcommittee to address the use of biometrics across the federal  government.", "Within DOD, the Deputy Secretary of Defense, in a January 2007  memorandum, stated that DOD would immediately adopt the practice of  sharing unclassified DOD biometrics data with other U.S. departments and  agencies with counterterrorism missions. According to the memorandum,  this includes data related to terrorism information defined in the  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act regarding terrorists,  detainees, and those individuals or groups posing a threat to the United  States, U.S. persons, or U.S. interests, but excludes data pertaining to U.S.  persons, defined as U.S. citizens and aliens lawfully admitted for  permanent residence. Non-U.S. persons are individuals who are neither  U.S. citizens nor aliens lawfully admitted into the United States for  permanent residence. The memorandum further states that sharing  unclassified biometrics data unrelated to terrorism information will be  determined based upon relevant law and directives but will require, at a  minimum, a written memorandum from a requesting agency stating the  official need for the data, the intended use of the data, the protections and  safeguards that will be afforded the data, and the nature or extent of  possible further distribution of the data to other organizations or agencies.  Further, the memorandum stated that sharing of biometrics data on an  individual must be conducted pursuant to U.S. law and regulations and  international agreements where appropriate.", "The federal government currently does not maintain a comprehensive,  governmentwide, biometrics-based terrorist database or watch list. In the  absence of such a database or watch list and to increase the utility of the  biometrics data it collects, DOD has established relationships\u2014both with  its own components and with interagency and multinational partners\u2014 through which it can share standardized biometrics files, analyses, and  associated information in order to match results and determine whether  there is a link between an individual\u2019s biometrics file and available  associated information. Gaps in DOD\u2019s and other agencies\u2019 biometrics  collection and sharing processes can increase the risk that terrorists will  avoid identification in subsequent encounters with U.S. personnel during  military operations, the visa application process, and U.S. border  crossings. For example, during the visa application process or at a U.S.  entry point, if terrorists are not identified as such, U.S. personnel may  unknowingly grant them access to the United States.", "While a number of biometrics databases exist across the federal  government, there are three major federal biometrics databases that  include, among other data sets, information on known and suspected  terrorists: (1) the FBI\u2019s Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification  System (IAFIS); (2) DOD\u2019s Automated Biometric Identification System  (ABIS), which is collocated with IAFIS; and (3) the DHS Automated  Biometric Identification System (IDENT), which is used by DHS for border  patrol, customs, naturalization, and counterterrorism activities, as well as  by DOS as part of its visa approval process. DOD, the FBI, DHS, and DOS  have established formal and informal arrangements, pursuant to  applicable U.S. laws and regulations and international agreements,  regarding the sharing of information among the IAFIS, ABIS, and IDENT  databases.", "At your request, we reviewed and reported on DOD\u2019s strategic efforts to  manage identity information, including biometrics data, which is used for  a variety of purposes, such as to identify individuals seeking access to  bases. In the course of this work, we identified collection and sharing  issues that we brought to your attention in a version of this report that was  designated For Official Use Only and issued in May 2008. This following  report is the public version of that report, GAO-08-430NI. As our May 2008  report contained information that DOD considered sensitive and  designated For Official Use Only, this version of the report omits  references and information pertaining to detailed collection guidance and  sensitive database information, including an appendix. We have indicated  those changes with footnotes within the report. Our objectives in this  report were to determine to what extent (1) DOD has guidance that  establishes the biometrics data to be collected to support military  activities and (2) there may be gaps in biometrics information shared  between DOD and DHS. To answer the first objective, we examined DOD\u2019s  policies and procedures for the collection of biometrics data during field  operations. We also interviewed DOD officials from Marine Corps  Headquarters, the Army\u2019s Biometrics Task Force, the National Ground  Intelligence Center, U.S. Central Command, and U.S. Special Operations  Command. To determine the extent to which there may be gaps in  biometrics information sharing between DOD and DHS, we reviewed  available interagency biometrics data-sharing agreements and held  discussions with officials from DOD, DOS, the FBI, and DHS\u2019s U.S.-Visitor  and Immigrant Status Indicator Technology (US-VISIT) program office.  We focused our work in this area on DOD, DOS, the FBI, and US-VISIT  because of the biometrics database locations and sharing relationship  among the databases. We included other federal agencies that use DOD- collected biometrics in carrying out their own national security missions.  Because DOD viewed some aspects of the report as sensitive and  designated them For Official Use Only, and because other information was  classified, some details of our evidence could not be discussed in this  report. We conducted this performance audit from May 2007 to May 2008  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. A full description of our scope  and methodology can be found in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As the technologies for collecting, storing, and sharing biometrics data  advance, DOD and other federal agencies that collect, use, store, and share  such data in the conduct of their national security missions have expanded  their biometrics efforts. DOD uses biometrics for various purposes\u2014 including controlling access to DOD facilities, intelligence analysis, and  identifying and verifying non-U.S. persons encountered during field  activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. U.S. forces collect, match, and share  biometrics data, and DOD has developed a number of policies and  procedures to govern these activities. However, guidance for the  collection and use of biometrics data is still evolving."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Governmentwide Policies Regarding Biometrics Data Are Evolving", "paragraphs": ["Historically, the FBI has been the dominant federal government user of  biometrics, with a long-established fingerprint database\u2014IAFIS\u2014as its  primary biometrics data repository. Other federal agencies, like DHS and  DOS, also use biometrics in support of their respective national security  missions, including border patrol, customs, disaster recovery,  naturalization, visa processes, and counterterrorism. DHS\u2019s US-VISIT  program office administers IDENT on behalf of all of DHS. IDENT is the  database DHS has designated as the central point for all of the  department\u2019s biometrics collection, identification, and storage efforts.  DOS has access to IDENT data via its sharing agreement with DHS for use  in its visa screening process. To date, DOD and DHS have not established  a direct link between their two biometrics databases and rely on the FBI\u2019s  IAFIS database as an indirect link between DOD and DHS. This is a result  of specific biometrics sharing agreements and other information sharing  policies and agreements. If biometrics data for non-U.S. persons collected  by DOD are not retained in the FBI\u2019s IAFIS, other agencies, like DHS and  DOS, that send biometrics data for searching to IAFIS, do not have access  to this DOD information when they conduct searches for visa, citizenship,  border control, and other homeland security purposes. While limited  occasional direct sharing of DOD and DHS biometrics has occurred, it is  not regularized.", "Several efforts are under way to develop national policies and procedures  to better coordinate the use of biometrics data and to ensure that concerns  such as privacy are addressed. For example, the National Science and  Technology Council has established the Subcommittee on Biometrics and  Identity Management to address issues such as identity management,  privacy, and biometrics system improvements and to develop policy  foundations for those issues. In addition, the Information Sharing  Environment Program Manager, in consultation with the Information  Sharing Council, is to plan and oversee the implementation of and manage  an Information Sharing Environment, an approach that facilities the  sharing of terrorism and homeland security information. The Program  Manager is also responsible for assisting, monitoring, and assessing the  implementation of the Information Sharing Environment by federal  departments and agencies to ensure adequate progress, technological  consistency, and policy compliance, among other duties.", "While these efforts are under way, many departments, including DOD,  continue to collect biometrics data to meet their individual missions.  However, even within departments, there may not be policies to ensure  that officials in different parts of the organization are aware of or have  access to biometrics data that are collected by others."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Collection, Matching, and Sharing of Biometrics Data", "paragraphs": ["During DOD field activities, such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq, U.S.  forces collect biometrics data for a variety of purposes, such as to control  access to U.S. bases in order to protect personnel and to identify and  verify non-U.S. persons that they encounter. The primary system for  biometrics data collection in U.S. Central Command, including  Afghanistan and Iraq, is the Biometric Automated Toolset. The Biometric  Automated Toolset is a DOD biometrics system that allows U.S. forces to  collect fingerprints, iris scans, facial photographs, and biographical  information of persons of interest and store them in a searchable database.  DOD has also established the Biometric Identification System for Access,  which includes similar types of biometrics data but is limited to use on  installations in Iraq to determine whether non-U.S. persons should have  access to U.S. bases.", "Once U.S. forces have collected the biometrics data, they attempt to  compare and match the data to previously collected data stored in the  Biometric Automated Toolset and the Biometric Identification System for  Access. These data are also sent to ABIS\u2014the DOD-wide database for  non-U.S. persons\u2019 biometrics\u2014to determine if U.S. forces have previously  encountered an individual and entered the individual\u2019s biometrics data  into this database. If there is not a match, the new data are stored in the  Biometric Automated Toolset and ABIS and maintained for future use, as  appropriate. Figure 1 illustrates this process.", "Once biometrics data are in ABIS, they can be shared or sent to another  biometrics database, such as the FBI\u2019s IAFIS, for additional matching  attempts against non-DOD records. DOD has established agreements with  the FBI and DHS that allow it to share its biometrics data with them, both  to assist DOD in identifying the individuals it encounters during its military  activities and to inform other federal agencies of DOD\u2019s interactions with  non-U.S. persons who might be of interest. For example, DOD uses the  Biometric Identification System for Access to collect biometrics from a  non-U.S. person seeking access to a U.S. facility in Iraq and sends that  information back to DOD\u2019s ABIS database to see if the new data match any  biometrics data currently stored in ABIS. While ABIS is being searched,  DOD forwards the biometrics data to the FBI\u2019s IAFIS database to see if  there is a U.S. criminal history for the individual seeking access to U.S.  facilities in Iraq. Once the FBI conducts its search, it sends the results  back to DOD and does not keep noncriminal biometrics data collected  using the Biometric Identification System for Access. In other cases, for  example, when an individual is detained in Iraq or Afghanistan by DOD,  the process is the same until DOD sends the biometrics data to the FBI. In  most of these cases, the FBI stores the biometrics data in IAFIS, a criminal  database, for potential future use.", "During field activities, DOD personnel collecting biometrics data may not  know if the person is a non-U.S. person until the data are collected and  then matched with already existing data. For example, DOD personnel  collecting latent fingerprints during and after combat operations may not  know until the fingerprints are matched with existing data if the person is  a non-U.S. person."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Issued Limited Guidance for Collecting Biometrics Data", "paragraphs": ["The Biometrics Task Force has not issued guidance specifying a standard  set of biometrics data that would allow for comparison of newly collected  biometrics data with existing biometrics data in the field. Having a  standard set of biometrics data would help ensure consistent identification  and confirmation of an individual\u2019s identity thus allowing forces to  compare data across multiple databases in different commands and to  determine whether individuals should be detained. In recognition of the  conditions commanders face in the field, DOD delegated responsibility to  field commanders to determine the type of biometrics data personnel  should collect during their operations. As a result, some units may collect  fingerprints and facial photos, while others may collect only iris images,  even though they are all using devices that can collect the same types of  biometrics. For example, Marine Corps units prefer to collect iris scans  during field identification and verification activities, but Special  Operations Forces and Army units in other parts of Iraq prefer to collect  fingerprints in the field\u2014typically a minimum of two index finger prints  and two thumb prints.", "The lack of comparable data also has implications for broader national  security issues. For example, military personnel may be unable to identify  someone who has harmed or attempted to harm U.S. or coalition forces.  The collection of similar or baseline data by DOD and departments or  agencies involved in national security activities, such as counterterrorism,  could enable them to use the same biometrics data across a wide range of  national security missions. Given the lack of comparability of the new data  collected in the field, such as when a unit collects exclusively iris images,  the data would not match against records in larger federal databases, such  as the FBI\u2019s IAFIS. If these data could be compared to such databases, this  capability would help the unit determine with certainty whether these  individuals had been encountered before and whether they should be  detained. For example, biometrics files that include only iris images  cannot be used to match latent fingerprints collected in combat zones.  Thus, military personnel collecting only iris images may be unable to  identify someone who has harmed or attempted to harm U.S. or coalition  forces.", "DOD and other federal agency officials said that there can be a trade-off  between tactical (warfighter) needs\u2014for example, the necessity when  operating in a hostile environment to perform tasks expeditiously to  reduce the risk of bodily harm\u2014and strategic (national security) needs\u2014 for example, the ability of intelligence analysts to make connections  among individuals, groups, and events, or the use of data for  counterterrorism and border security in the United States. Thus, localized  discretion about what types of biometrics data to collect may enable DOD  personnel to conduct quick and efficient screenings under potentially  hostile conditions, but the data they collect may be of little use to both  military units in the field and other U.S. government entities in support of  future counterterrorism efforts, including border security. Agencies both  within and outside of DOD\u2014the National Ground Intelligence Center, U.S.  Central Command, U.S. Special Operations Command, the Biometrics  Fusion Center, and the FBI\u2014acknowledge that without a baseline national  standard for biometrics collection that maximizes the utility of the data  both for the warfighters in the field and for national security efforts at  home, opportunities to identify persons of interest may be lost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Shares Data on Non-U.S. Persons through Interagency Agreements, but Some Gaps in Data May Remain", "paragraphs": ["DOD shares biometrics data that it collects on non-U.S. persons with other  federal agencies through a variety of interagency agreements, but some  gaps in data sharing may remain.

The memorandum also  specified that the sharing of biometrics data records on an individual must  be conducted in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations and  international agreements. This memorandum was issued pursuant to  Homeland Security Presidential Directive 6, Homeland Security  Presidential Directive 11, an interagency memorandum of understanding  agreeing to support the Terrorism Screening Center, and the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004\u2014all federal policies that  encourage the sharing of terrorism information. Also, the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 directed the President to,  among other things, create an Information Sharing Environment for the  sharing of terrorism information in a manner consistent with national  security and with applicable legal standards relating to privacy and civil  liberties. The act further stated that the President shall ensure that the  Information Sharing Environment provides and facilitates the means for  sharing terrorism information among all appropriate federal, state, local,  and tribal entities and the private sector through the use of policy  guidelines and technologies. To the greatest extent practicable, the  President shall ensure that the Information Sharing Environment, among  other things, connects and builds upon existing systems capabilities in use  across the government, where appropriate; allows users to share  information among agencies, between levels of government, and as  appropriate with the private sector; and facilitates the availability of  information in a form and manner that facilitates its use in analysis,  investigations, and operations.

However, a 2007 DHS memorandum indicates that  the department is not receiving frequent updates on some DOD biometrics  data. DHS officials said that the department could use these data for  national security purposes. According to an April 2007 DHS memorandum,  certain categories of information that DHS is not receiving frequent  updates on include information from DOD\u2019s Biometric Automated Toolset.  According to DHS officials, DHS does not have a sharing agreement with  DOD regarding these data, and such an agreement could allow DHS to  update its database on a routine basis. Because DHS obtained the data  from DOD as a one time event through the FBI, it received only the data  that existed at that 2006 date. Additionally, the DHS memorandum states  that DHS does not have access to DOD\u2019s Biometric Identification System  for Access, a noncriminal database. While DOD sends Biometric  Identification System for Access data to the FBI for potential matches, the  FBI does not retain this noncriminal information. According to FBI  officials, DHS has sharing agreements with the FBI, but in this case, since  the FBI told us that it does not retain the DOD data and DHS does not have  an agreement with DOD, DHS does not receive the data. Lastly, the DHS  memorandum states that DHS receives latent fingerprint images from  various sources under Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring  Freedom as part of the larger set of all latent prints associated with the  FBI\u2019s Unsolved Latent File\u2014latent fingerprints that have not been linked  to an identity.

Moreover, until comprehensive information sharing  agreements are worked out or the National Science and Technology  Council develops and implements a national architecture for biometrics  data collection, in consultation with information sharing environment  efforts, biometrics information collected by U.S. forces from individuals  encountered in the field may not be fully utilized by other federal agencies  for national security activities. For example, the sharing of latent  fingerprints collected by DOD personnel in combat zones could potentially  help enable a DOS consular official to deny a visa to an individual who  attacked U.S. forces in Iraq. Opportunities to reduce gaps in our security  through comprehensive data sharing may be lost unless remaining needs  for biometrics data are appropriately filled. Because potential harm could  come to U.S. interests from those individuals DHS and DOS could have  prevented from entering the United States\u2014if those individuals were  determined to be inadmissible based on these data and other relevant  information\u2014it is important that DOD, the FBI, DHS, and DOS work  together to determine the biometrics data needed and to share these data  in accordance with applicable laws, regulations, and international treaties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense direct the Secretary of the  Army\u2019s Executive Manager for Biometrics to establish guidance specifying  a minimum baseline standard set of biometrics data for collection during  military operations in the field so that biometrics data can be compared  across multiple databases in different commands and across federal  agencies as appropriate and in accordance with U.S. laws and regulations  and international agreements.", "Additionally, we recommend that until a formalized, governmentwide  biometrics data-sharing architecture is implemented, the Secretaries of  Defense and Homeland Security, in consultation with other federal  agencies, such as the FBI and DOS, determine if biometrics information  sharing needs are being met and address, as appropriate, any biometrics  data-sharing gaps that may exist, in accordance with U.S. laws and  regulations and international agreements, as well as information sharing  environment efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a For Official Use Only draft of this report  from the Executive Office of the President\u2019s National Science and  Technology Council; DOD; DOS; DHS; the FBI; the Program Manager,  Information Sharing Environment; and the Office of the Director of  National Intelligence\u2019s National Counterterrorism Center. DOD was the  only agency to provide written comments on the For Official Use Only  version of this report. As such, this public version of the For Official Use  Only report was sent to DOD for comment. DOD partially concurred with  our recommendation to establish guidance specifying a standard set of  biometrics data for collection during military operations in the field. In  comments, DOD stated that if our recommendation to establish this  guidance was directed at DOD personnel in stable environments\u2014not field  environments\u2014then DOD fully agreed with our recommendation and  would take action to implement it. However, DOD commented that if we  were referring to collection in field environments, DOD officials still  wanted to rely on commanders\u2019 judgment as to what to collect. In our  recommendation, we referred to collection of biometrics during military  operations in the field, which we equate to DOD\u2019s screening operations of  suspicious or potentially hostile individuals, which could include  biometrics collection in hostile environments. Our point was that if one  unit collected one type of biometrics, such as an iris scan from an  individual, and another unit later collected fingerprints from the same  individual, no match could be made between the two different encounters  of the individual and potential persons of interest could be released.  Moreover, DOD acknowledges this risk in its comments, stating that DOD  officials want to continue to rely on the commanders\u2019 judgment on the  biometrics to be collected during military operations in the field, including  hostile environments. However, we continue to believe that DOD should  establish guidance for a minimum baseline biometrics collection standard  to mitigate this risk, especially since guidance in place in Afghanistan, a  hostile area of operations, already establishes such a minimum. A DOD  document sets forth the procedures for standardization of mandatory  fields that must be completed during the collection processes for various  biometrics collection systems. Collecting biometrics data above and  beyond such a minimum baseline standard could be left up to the  commander\u2019s discretion; however, we continue to believe that a minimum  biometrics collection requirement for military operations in the field, or  what DOD calls screening operations, should be established, as was done  for Afghanistan operations, to mitigate the risks we identified and DOD  acknowledged in its comments. Based on DOD\u2019s comments on the For  Official Use Only draft report, we revised this recommendation and the  final report to reflect the appropriate office responsible for this guidance  and to clarify that we intend for DOD to establish a minimum standard for  biometrics data collected from individuals encountered during military  operations in the field.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to determine if biometrics  information sharing needs are being met and if there are any gaps in  sharing that may exist. In its comments, DOD stated that it is fully  participating in and fully supportive of interagency forums specifically  chartered to address improved sharing of biometrics data and  interoperability of biometrics systems.", "The Executive Office of the President\u2019s National Science and Technology  Council; DOD; DHS; the Program Manager, Information Sharing  Environment; and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence\u2019s  National Counterterrorism Center provided technical comments on the  For Official Use Only version of this report, which we have incorporated  into this report as appropriate.", "DOD\u2019s written comments are reprinted in appendix II.", "As agreed with your offices, we are sending copies of this report to the  Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on Armed  Services and other interested congressional parties.
