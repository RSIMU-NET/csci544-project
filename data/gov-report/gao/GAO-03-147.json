GAO previously reported on travel card management at the Army. This report focuses on travel card management at the Navy, including the Marine Corps."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of March 31, 2002, over 8,000 Navy cardholders had $6 million in delinquent debt. For the prior 2 years, the Navy's average delinquency rate of 12 percent was nearly identical to that of the Army, which had the highest federal agency delinquency rate. Since November 1998, Bank of America had charged off nearly 14,000 Navy accounts totaling almost $17 million, and placed many more in a salary offset program similar to garnishment. During the period covered under this review, over 250 Navy personnel might have committed bank fraud by writing three or more nonsufficient fund (NSF) checks to Bank of America. In addition, as shown in the table, many cardholders abusively used the card for inappropriate purchases including prostitution and gambling without Navy management being aware of it. Many of these purchases were made when individuals were not on travel. The Navy's overall delinquency and charge-off problems were primarily associated with lower-paid, low-to midlevel enlisted military personnel. A significant relationship also existed between travel card fraud, abuse, and delinquencies and individuals with substantial credit history problems. For example, some cardholders had accounts placed in collections while others had filed bankruptcies prior to receiving the card. The Navy's practice of authorizing issuance of the travel card to virtually anyone who asked for it compounded these problems. We also found inconsistent documented evidence of disciplinary actions against cardholders who wrote NSF checks, or had their accounts charged off or put in salary offset. Further, almost one-half of these cardholders still had, as of August 2002, active secret or top-secret clearances. Other control breakdowns related to the Navy's failure to provide the necessary staffing and training for effective oversight, and infrequent, or nonexistent, monitoring of travel card activities. As a result of these and similar findings in the Army travel card program, the recently enacted fiscal year 2003 Defense Appropriations Act included provisions requiring the Secretary of Defense to establish guidelines and procedures for disciplinary actions and to deny issuance of the travel card to individuals who are not creditworthy."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["On October 8, 2002, we testified before the Subcommittee on Government  Efficiency, Financial Management and Intergovernmental Relations, House  Committee on Government Reform, on the results of our audit of internal  controls over travel activity at the Department of the Navy (including the  United States Marine Corps).  During fiscal year 2001, the Navy had about  395,000 individually billed travel card accounts and $510 million in related  travel card charges.  In contrast to the purchase card program, where  charges are billed directly to the government for payment, the individually  billed travel cardholder is directly responsible for all charges incurred on  his or her travel card account and for remitting payments on the monthly  bill to the card issuer, Bank of America.  The cardholder is expected to use  the government travel card only for valid expenses related to official travel  and to submit a properly documented voucher to get reimbursed for valid  expenses.  The intent of the travel card program was to improve  convenience for the traveler and to reduce the government\u2019s costs of  administering travel (see app. I for additional background information on  the Navy\u2019s travel card program).  While we support the use of a travel card  program to streamline the administration of official government travel, it is  important that agencies have adequate internal controls in place to protect  the government from fraud, waste, and abuse.", "This work was performed in response to your request for a comprehensive  examination of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) and the military  services\u2019 purchase and travel card programs.

To achieve these objectives, we analyzed the  Navy\u2019s account delinquency and charge-off information and compared it to  that of non-Navy DOD components and other federal agencies.  We also  used data mining techniques to review Navy transactions for potential  fraud and abuse.  In addition, we evaluated the effectiveness of selected,  specific internal control policies, procedures, and activities at 3 Navy  installations, representing 3 of the Navy\u2019s 27 major commands.", "We selected the three installations we audited based on the relative amount  of travel card activity at the different Navy commands and of the  installations under these commands, the number and percentage of  delinquent accounts, and the number and percentage of charged-off  accounts.  For these installations, we tested a statistical sample of travel  card transactions and conducted other audit work to evaluate the design  and implementation of key internal control procedures and activities.  Our  statistical sample test results can be projected only to the individual  installations where we performed the testing and cannot be projected to  the command level or to the Navy as a whole.  Through auditing travel card  transactions at the three installations during fiscal year 2001, and data  mining of transactions incurred throughout the Navy during fiscal year  2001 and the first 6 months of fiscal year 2002, we identified numerous  examples of potentially fraudulent and abusive travel card activity.

Available data showed that the  travel cardholder\u2019s rank or grade (and associated pay) is a strong predictor  of delinquency problems.  As shown in figure 2, the Navy\u2019s delinquency and  charge-off problems are primarily associated with low- and midlevel  enlisted military personnel grades E-1 to E-6, with relatively low incomes  and little experience in handling personal finances.", "Available data indicate that military personnel grades E-1 (seaman recruit  in the Navy or private in the Marine Corps) to E-6 (petty officer first class in  the Navy or staff sergeant in the Marine Corps) account for about 78  percent of all Navy military personnel.  These enlisted military personnel  have basic pay levels ranging from $12,000 to $27,000.  These individuals  were responsible for 40 percent of the total outstanding Navy travel card  balances as of September 30, 2001.", "Figure 3 compares the delinquency rates by military rank and civilian  personnel to the Navy\u2019s average delinquency rate as of September 30, 2001.   As shown, the delinquency rates were as high as 34 percent for E-1 to E-3  military personnel and 20 percent for E-4 to E-6 military personnel,  compared to the Navy\u2019s overall delinquency rate of 12 percent.  These rates  were markedly higher than the rates for officers, which ranged from a low  of 1 percent for O-7 to O-10 (admirals in the Navy or generals in the Marine  Corps) to a higher 8 percent for O-1 to O-3 (ensign to lieutenant in the Navy  or second lieutenant to captain in the Marine Corps).  These rates were also  substantially higher than that of Navy civilians, which at 5 percent was  comparable with the federal civilian agencies rate shown in figure 1.", "The delinquency rate of military personnel E-4 to E-6 in particular had an  important negative impact on the Navy\u2019s delinquency rate.  Specifically,  these are petty officers in the Navy and corporals to staff sergeants in the  Marine Corps.  Pay levels for these personnel, excluding supplements such  as housing, ranged from approximately $18,000 to $27,000.  These  individuals also traveled often.  As shown by Bank of America data,  personnel E-4 to E-6 accounted for 36 percent of the total Navy outstanding  balance, which was higher than the outstanding balance of all other  military and civilian personnel.  This combination of high outstanding  balance and high delinquency rate largely explained the high Navy  delinquency rate.", "As shown in figure 4, charged-off amounts for military personnel grades E-1  to E-6 during fiscal year 2001 totaled more than $3.6 million.  This  represented 72 percent of the almost $5 million in total Navy charge-offs  during fiscal year 2001.", "According to Navy representatives, these individuals often had little  experience handling personal resources.  Although their basic pay rates are  supplemented with housing and food allowances, the low salaries may not  permit payment of excessive personal charges on travel cards.  If these  individuals get into financial difficulty, they have fewer resources at their  disposal to pay their travel card balances in full every month.  Also, if  cardholders in these lower grade levels do not receive their travel card  reimbursements promptly because of either delays in filing their vouchers  or voucher processing, they may lack the financial resources to make  timely payments on their travel card accounts.  In addition, as discussed  later in this report, the Navy did not exempt personnel with poor credit  histories from required use of travel cards.  Consequently, these low- and  midlevel enlisted military personnel are often issued travel cards even  though some may already be in serious financial trouble and, therefore,  may not have been appropriate credit risks.

Navy  officials expressed the belief that demographics and logistics were  important contributing factors to these high delinquency rates.  According  to Navy officials, Atlantic and Pacific fleet personnel, as well as Marine  Corps Forces Atlantic and Pacific, travel frequently for training and  preparation for deployment.  Because they are always on the move, these  individuals might not be filing vouchers and making payments in a timely  manner.  In addition, fleet personnel often consist of low- and midlevel  recruits, demographics which, as discussed previously, are a contributing  factor to the high delinquency rate.", "Navy officials attributed the delinquency problems with the reserve forces  to logistics of a different kind.  Reserve forces are spread throughout the  country and report to duty only once a month.  Reservists typically fill out  their vouchers when they return home and then mail them to the  processing centers, sometimes weeks after the training.  According to Navy  officials, the high delinquency rates in the reserve forces could be  attributed partly to the fact that some had not received travel  reimbursement by the time their bills became delinquent.", "In contrast, some commands, such as Naval Sea Systems Command and  Naval Air Systems Command, had large numbers of travel card accounts  and high travel card activity, yet low delinquency rates.  According to Navy  officials, this is because personnel in these commands are typically  civilians, are older and more mature, and therefore are better at managing  their finances.  These demographic factors, coupled with the fact that these  sites typically have full-time APCs and a better control environment, may  explain why their delinquency rates are lower than the Navy average, and  sometimes even lower than the average rate for federal civilian agencies.", "The case study sites we audited followed the pattern described above.  For  example, at Camp Lejeune, a principal training location for Marine air and  ground forces, over one-half of the cardholders are enlisted personnel.   Representative of the Navy\u2019s higher delinquency rate, Camp Lejeune\u2019s  quarterly rates over the 18 months ending March 31, 2002, averaged over 15  percent.

In contrast, at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, where the mission  is to repair and modernize Navy ships, civilian personnel earning more than  $38,000 a year made up 84 percent of total government travel cardholders  and accounted for 86 percent of total fiscal year 2001 travel card  transactions.

These changes have cost  the Navy an estimated $1.5 million in lost rebates on combined individually  and centrally billed accounts in fiscal year 2001 alone and will cost, in  addition, about $1.3 million in automated teller machine (ATM) fees  annually.  Other costs, such as the administrative burden of monitoring  delinquent accounts, are harder to measure, but no less real.

Under the terms of the task order, DOD had three 1-year options to  unilaterally renew the contract.  On September 29, 2000, prior to the  expiration of the initial task order, DOD gave notice to Bank of America  that it intended to exercise its option to extend the task order for an  additional year.

Consequently, in April 2001, the master contract and the related DOD- tailored task order for travel card services were renegotiated.  Specifically,  Bank of America was able to reduce its financial risk by instituting  additional fees, such as higher cash advance and late payment fees;  offsetting credit losses against rebates, as explained later; facilitating the  collection of delinquent and charged-off amounts through salary and  military retirement pay offset; and participating in split disbursements, in  which the government sends part or all of the travel voucher  reimbursements directly to Bank of America."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Effect of Increased Fees", "paragraphs": ["One of the terms of the renegotiated task order between Bank of America  and DOD was that, effective August 10, 2001, the travel card cash advance  fee would be increased from 1.9 percent to 3 percent, with a minimum fee  of $2.  The Navy reimburses all cash advance fees related to authorized  cash withdrawals.  We estimate that this contract modification will result in  approximately $1.3 million of increased costs to the Navy each year.  Our  estimate was made by applying the new fee structure that went into effect  in August 2001 to cash advances made throughout fiscal year 2001 to  ascertain how much more Bank of America would have charged.

The Assistant Secretary  also required all units with delinquency rates higher than 4 percent to take  immediate actions to lower the delinquency rates and to report on these  results within 30 days of receiving the memorandum.", "Further, the DOD Under Secretary of Defense (Comptroller) created a  DOD-wide Charge Card Task Force in March 2002 to address management  issues related to DOD\u2019s purchase and travel card programs.  The task force  issued its final report on June 27, 2002.  We have reviewed the report and  believe that many of the actions proposed by the task force will improve  the controls over the travel card program.  Important task force  recommendations include canceling inactive accounts and expanding the  salary offset program.  However, actions to implement additional front-end  or preventive controls, such as strengthening the critical role of the APCs  and denying cards to individuals with prior credit problems, were not  addressed in the report.

An examination of the  cardholder\u2019s credit history also revealed that, prior to receiving his  government travel card in May 2000, the cardholder had multiple charge- offs, in addition to filing personal and business bankruptcies.

Consequently, when Bank of America posted  the NSF checks, the account appeared to have been paid, which  provided credit to the cardholder to make additional purchases.  Thus,  by writing NSF checks, and submitting NSF payments over the phone,  which Bank of America had to credit to his travel card account, the  petty officer was able to, in effect, increase his credit limit to more than  $20,000\u2014a practice known as \u201cboosting.\u201d  He used each of these  successive increases in his effective credit limit to charge additional  items on his travel card.

The terms of the  administrative counseling specified that the cardholder would face an  administrative discharge in case of continued abuse of the credit card  or any other misconduct.", "Cardholder #5 was a petty officer (E-5) assigned to the Naval Reserve  Forces in San Jose, California.

We arrived at this information by first  identifying that two institutions frequented by Navy cardholders were  legalized brothels in Nevada.  Based on a price list provided by one of the  brothels, we eliminated transactions that were most likely for bar charges  and determined that 50 cardholders used their government travel card to  purchase over $13,000 in prostitution services.  These charges were  processed by the brothels\u2019 merchant bank, and authorized by Bank of  America, in part because a control afforded by the merchant category code  (MCC), which identifies the nature of the transactions and is used by DOD  and other agencies to block improper purchases, was circumvented by the  establishments.  In these cases, the transactions were coded to appear as  restaurant and dining or bar charges.  For example, the merchant James  Fine Dining, which actually operates as a brothel known as Salt Wells Villa,  characterizes its services as restaurant charges, which are allowable and  not blocked by the MCC control.  According to one assistant manager at the  establishment, this is done to protect the confidentiality of its customers.   Additionally, the account balances for 11 of the 50 cardholders purchasing  services from these establishments were later charged off or put into salary  offset.  For example, one sailor, an E-2 seaman apprentice, charged over  $2,200 at this brothel during a 30-day period.  The sailor separated from the  Navy, and his account balance of more than $3,600 was eventually charged  off.", "We also found instances of abusive travel card activity where Navy  cardholders used their cards at establishments such as gentlemen\u2019s clubs,  which provide adult entertainment.  Further, these clubs were used to  convert the travel card to cash by supplying cardholders with actual cash  or \u201cclub cash\u201d for a 10 percent fee.  For example, we found that an E-5  second class petty officer circumvented ATM cash withdrawal limits by  charging, in a single transaction, $2,420 to the government travel card and  receiving $2,200 in cash.  Subsequently, the club received payment from  Bank of America for a $2,420 restaurant charge.  Another cardholder, an E- 7 chief petty officer, obtained more than $7,000 in cash from these  establishments.

The cardholder was deployed to  Europe in August 2000 and his credit limit was increased to $20,000.   Within a month of his deployment, the cardholder had charged $10,700  to the card, including $8,500 in ATM withdrawals.

The unit to which  the cardholder was assigned had a policy of activating the government  travel card only when a cardholder travels.  However, from February  through April 2001, while not on travel, the cardholder purchased over  $6,250 worth of electronic and computer equipment from Best Buy and  various Web sites using the government travel card.  The cardholder did  not pay his balance and thus came to the attention of the APC when his  name appeared in the delinquency report.

In  July 1999, Bank of America began conducting credit checks on DOD travel  card applicants and used the resulting information as a basis for  determining the type of account\u2014restricted or standard\u2014it would provide  to new DOD travel applicants.  While, as mentioned above, DOD FMR  would allow the Navy to exempt individuals with financial irresponsibility  from the use of the government travel card, in practice any applicant who  does not authorize a credit check, has no credit history, or has a history of  credit problems, is issued a restricted travel card with a $2,500 credit limit.   All other applicants are issued standard travel cards with a $10,000 credit  limit.  In January 2002, the Navy further reduced the credit limit on a  restricted travel card to $2,000 and the limit on a standard card to $5,000.   However, DOD and Navy policy also permit APCs to raise the credit and  ATM limits of all cards after they have been issued to meet travel and  mission requirements.", "As discussed previously, many of the Navy travel cardholders that we  audited who wrote numerous NSF checks, were severely delinquent, or had  their accounts charged off had histories of delinquencies and charge-offs  relating to other credit cards, accounts in collection, and numerous  bankruptcies.  Our analysis of credit application scoring models and credit  risk scores used by major credit bureaus confirmed that applicants with  low credit scores due to histories of late payments are poor credit risks.   Credit bureau officials told us that if their credit rating guidelines for  decisions on commercial credit card application approvals were used to  make decisions on travel card applicants, a significant number of low- and  midlevel enlisted Navy cardholders would not even qualify for the  restricted limit cards.  A credit history showing accounts with collection  agency action or charge-offs poses an even higher credit risk.  Any of these  problems can be a reason for denying credit in the private sector.  However,  individuals with no credit history, or little credit history, are generally  issued cards with lower credit limits, as reflected by current DOD policy.", "By authorizing all individuals regardless of past credit history who apply  for cards to get them, the Navy has exposed the government to increased  losses from increased fees and lost rebates associated with these  individuals.  Credit industry research and the results of our work  demonstrate that individuals with previous late payments are much more  likely to have payment problems in the future.", "Further, as a result of our audit findings and an amendment proposed by  Senators Byrd and Grassley, the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense  Appropriations Act requires that the Secretary of Defense evaluate whether  an individual is creditworthy before authorizing the issuance of any  government travel charge card.  An individual found not to be creditworthy  may not be issued a government travel charge card.  Implementing  procedures to assess the creditworthiness of an individual prior to issuing a  credit card, and denying a credit card to anyone found not creditworthy as  required by the fiscal year 2003 Department of Defense Appropriations Act,  should improve delinquency rates and reduce fraud and abuse."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Inadequate Cardholder Training", "paragraphs": ["The DOD FMR requires that APCs provide training to cardholders on the  proper use of the government travel card prior to card issuance.

Additionally, one APC  indicated to us that it was a challenge to keep up with his APC  responsibilities, mainly because he was expected first and foremost to  perform his primary duties.  In contrast, at Patuxent River and Puget Sound  Naval Shipyard, two installations with mainly civilian cardholders, the APC  role is a full-time post and therefore the APCs spend all of their time  carrying out APC responsibilities.", "Most of the APCs at the case study sites focused monitoring efforts on  delinquencies, and rarely conducted detailed review of charge card  transactions.  All APCs have access to account transaction activity reports  and declination reports, which detail activities that were rejected by Bank  of America and thus would be useful in identifying individuals who might  have attempted to misuse the card.  One APC interviewed told us that  detailed transaction reviews were too time-consuming.  If she reviewed  account activities at all, it was in conjunction with, and after she had  identified delinquent accounts.  Failure to systematically and regularly  review transaction activities meant that most APCs were not able to  promptly detect, and therefore take further actions to prevent, abusive  travel card activity.  This is illustrated by the fact that personal use of the  card was estimated to be 27 percent at one site we audited.", "In contrast, the APC at another case study site informed us that she  reviewed delinquency reports several times a month to identify and  promptly notify supervisors about the status of delinquent accounts.  She  also told us that, in addition, she monitored transactions in the Bank of  America database for improper and abusive uses of the card monthly, and  sent out notices to the cardholders and the cardholder supervisors if such  transactions were identified.

By that time, the cardholder  had charged over $6,750 to the vitamin company.

Therefore, the APC did not take  actions to close this individual\u2019s government travel card account.   Consequently, in October 2000, when the old card was about to expire,  Bank of America mailed a new card to the address of record.  When the  card was returned with a forwarding address, the bank remailed the  card and the personal identification number, which is used to activate  the card, to the new address without performing other verification  procedures.  The card was activated in mid-December 2000, and within a  month, 81 fraudulent transactions for hotel, food, and gas totaling about  $3,600 were charged to the card.  In January 2001, in the course of her  monthly travel card monitoring, the APC noticed suspicious charges in  the vicinity of the cardholder\u2019s previous post-of-duty.  The APC took  immediate action to deactivate the card, thus preventing additional  charges from occurring.  Upon finally learning of the cardholder\u2019s death  from the cardholder\u2019s unit, the APC immediately reported the case to a  Bank of America fraud investigator.  Investigations indicated that a  family member of the cardholder might have made these charges.  No  payment was ever made on this account, and the entire amount was  subsequently charged off.

In a number of instances, the  cardholder was able to obtain the government rate\u2014which can be  substantially lower than the commercial rate\u2014for lodging in San Diego,  Philadelphia, and Cincinnati.  Because the Navy does not routinely  monitor cardholder transactions for abusive activity and because this  particular account was always paid in full, abusive activity was not  detected.

However, neither the security office, which took action  against the employee, nor the office where the individual worked  notified the APC to cancel or deactivate the cardholder\u2019s government  travel card account.  Following his suspension, the cardholder used the  government travel card to make numerous cash withdrawals and  purchases totaling almost $4,700.  The APC was not aware of these  abusive charges until the monthly delinquency review identified the  account as delinquent.  The account balance of $1,600 was subsequently  charged off in January 2002.

Consequently, a weak internal control environment in the travel  card program has resulted in a significant level of delinquencies and  charge-offs of bad debts, as well as travel card fraud and abuse.  This has  resulted in millions of dollars of costs to the Navy, including higher fees,  lost rebates, and substantial time pursuing and collecting delinquent travel  card accounts.", "DOD and the Navy have taken positive steps to reduce the delinquencies  and charge-offs, including establishing a system of wage and retirement  payment offset for many employees, encouraging the use of split  disbursements where travel reimbursements are sent directly to the bank  rather than the employee, and making management of the travel program a  priority for the Navy commands.  These actions have resulted in significant  collections of previously charged-off and delinquent accounts.  DOD and  the Navy have also proposed additional steps as reported in the June 27,  2002, DOD Charge Card Task Force report to improve the controls over the  travel card program.

The results of the samples of these control  attributes, as well as the estimate for personal use\u2014or abuse\u2014related to  travel card activity, can be projected to the population of transactions at  the respective test case study site only, not to the population of travel card  transactions for all Navy cardholders.", "We concluded that a control was effective if both the projected point  estimate of the failure rate and the upper bound of a one-sided 95 percent  confidence interval associated with the estimate were no more than 5  percent. We concluded that a control was ineffective if both the point  estimate of the failure rate and the lower bound of a one-sided 95 percent  confidence interval associated with the estimate were greater than 10  percent.  Otherwise, we concluded that the control was partially effective.   Tables 11 through 13 show (1) the results of our tests of key attributes, (2)  the point estimates of the failure rates for the attributes, and (3) the two- sided 95 percent confidence intervals for the failure rates for each  attribute.

We did not independently validate the  accuracy of these reported payment dates.", "We briefed Navy managers, including Assistant Secretary of the Navy  (Financial Management and Comptroller) officials; and unit commanders  and APCs of the details of our audit, including our findings and their  implications.
