In response to the Conference Report accompanying the 2010 DHS Appropriations Act, this report addresses the extent to which, at the time of the fiscal year 2009 shortfall, (1) Secret Service had the necessary internal controls in place to help ensure it could effectively manage and report on funds for presidential candidate protection; and (2) Secret Service and DHS had policies and procedures in place to help ensure that information related to the fiscal year 2009 shortfall was communicated to DHS and Congress.

For example, the agency relied on undocumented manual processes to prepare and review two key reports--the Monthly Execution and Staffing Report and the Presidential Campaign Cost Report--used to monitor obligations, manage its funds by subaccounts, and report to Congress. Documenting the processes to prepare and review these reports could decrease the risk of future reporting errors and be useful to managers in controlling operations. Secret Service also did not have documented procedures for charging costs for certain candidate protection activities that cut across multiple subaccounts. The subaccounts are not discrete, and Secret Service officials stated that they lacked clarity and procedures on which to use to cover costs for certain protection activities. Documenting policies and procedures for charging such costs could be useful in controlling operations and monitoring budget execution. Also, neither DHS nor Secret Service had documented benchmarks to serve as an early warning system when monitoring obligations and expenditures for potential future funding shortfalls. Lastly, DHS' budget guidance did not specify how to develop such benchmarks. Developing and implementing guidance on how to document benchmarks could help ensure that any future potential shortfalls in presidential candidate protection funds are identified in a timely manner. DHS and Secret Service lacked sufficient policies and procedures to ensure that information related to the fiscal year 2009 shortfall was communicated to DHS and Congress. At the time of the shortfall, DHS had written guidance on how to communicate a violation of the Antideficiency Act--which prohibits federal officials from obligating or expending funds in excess of appropriations--and notify Congress of a reprogramming, or shifting funds within an appropriation. However, because they mistakenly determined the guidance did not apply, Secret Service informed DHS of the shortfall and requested assistance in covering it. GAO issued a legal opinion determining that DHS and Secret Service violated reprogramming notification requirements and the Antideficiency Act. Further, DHS had no written guidance on communicating a reprogramming that did not require congressional notification. Since the shortfall, DHS and Secret Service developed a Corrective Action Plan (CAP) to address issues related to the shortfall. DHS implemented two of the four communication-related CAP measures, but has not provided written guidance for implementing the other two, which require that (1) components complete internal funding reviews prior to submitting reprogramming requests and articulate the negative impact of using internal resources to cover shortfalls, and (2) DHS provide timely submission of reprogramming notifications to the Appropriations Committees.Implementing these measures could help ensure better communication among Secret Service, DHS, and Congress in the event of future shortfalls, and help DHS and the committees assess whether DHS effectively provides information about potential shortfalls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS and Secret Service (1) document certain financial management, cost allocation, and benchmark procedures, and (2) provide guidance on remaining communications-related corrective actions.

The kinds of events categorized as NSSEs include  presidential inaugurations, international summits held in the United  States, major sporting events attended by protected persons, and  presidential nominating conventions. For instance, during the 2008  presidential campaign and the 2009 Inauguration, a number of events were  designated as NSSEs, including both the Democratic and Republican  Nominating Conventions, and the concert celebrating the Inauguration on  the National Mall. Designations are at the discretion of the President,  signed by the Secretary of DHS, generally on the basis of the size of the  event, its significance, and importance of anticipated attendees.

Specifically, the Antideficiency Act and  section 503 outline requirements that must be met in the management of,  and reporting on, funds, such as the funds for 2008 presidential candidate  protection. The Antideficiency Act prohibits the making or authorizing of  \u201can expenditure or obligation exceeding an amount available in an  appropriation or fund for the expenditure or obligation.\u201d Section 503  states that \u201cNone of the funds \u2026 shall be available for obligation or  expenditure for programs, projects or activities through a reprogramming  of funds in excess of $5,000,000 or 10 percent, whichever is less \u2026 unless  the Committees on Appropriations \u2026 are notified 15 days in advance of  such reprogramming of funds.\u201d", "Reliable financial systems are critical to meeting the reporting  requirements associated with the Antideficiency Act and section 503.

In fiscal year 2005, the Conference Report accompanying the 2005 DHS  Appropriations Act itemized specific amounts for activities supported by  Secret Service\u2019s Salaries and Expenses appropriation account. The  itemizations were made at Secret Service\u2019s Program, Project, or Activity  (PPA) level. Secret Service uses PPAs as subaccounts used to capture and  track financial data such as funds allotted, obligations, and expenditures.  According to Secret Service, three PPAs were used to fund 2008 campaign- related protection activities:    Presidential Candidate Nominee Protection, which is for the protection  Secret Service provides to major presidential and vice presidential  candidates, and their spouses;    NSSE, which is used for Secret Service planning and implementing  security for designated NSSEs to ensure the physical protection of the  President, the public, and other Secret Service protectees who participate  in NSSEs; and    Protection of Persons and Facilities, which operates to ensure the  personal safety of certain designated individuals, such as the President  and Vice President and former presidents and their spouses, protect the  buildings and grounds where these individuals reside and work, and  protect foreign heads-of-state visiting the United States.", "Table 1 shows the PPAs for Secret Service\u2019s Salaries and Expenses  account and the related fiscal year 2009 itemizations for each PPA.", "The unpredictable and changing nature of protectee activities creates  ongoing challenges for Secret Service.

In January 2009, Secret Service contacted DHS and requested  assistance to cover the shortfall.

Key information to be  included in corrective actions specified in this guidance includes, among  other things, a description of the deficiency in sufficient detail to provide  clarity and facilitate a common understanding of what needs to be done.  DHS has developed and implemented two of the four communications- related CAP measures in accordance with this guidance. For instance,  DHS\u2019 fiscal year 2010 Budget Execution Guidance and DHS CFO\u2019s  Financial Management Policy Manual draft of Section 2.4\u2013Budget  Execution include updated guidance to components on how to implement  two of the CAP measures outlined above, as shown in table 2. However,  DHS did not develop and implement the remaining two of the  communications-related CAP measures in accordance with this guidance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Additional Guidance Could Help Ensure Better Communication in the Event of Future Funding Shortfalls", "paragraphs": ["While DHS has implemented two of the four communication-related  measures from the CAP in accordance with CFOC A-123 guidance, it has  not developed and implemented the remaining two. Specifically, DHS has  not provided written guidance describing what needs to be done to  implement the CAP measures requiring that (1) components complete  internal funding reviews prior to submitting reprogramming requests and  articulate the negative impact of using internal resources to cover the  shortfall\u2014such as delays in hiring or postponement of training activities,  or both\u2014or (2) DHS provide timely submission of reprogramming  notifications to the Senate and House Appropriations Committees.  Implementing these remaining communication-related measures from the  CAP could help ensure that DHS and Secret Service communicate  effectively with each other and Congress in the event of future funding  shortfalls.", "Specifically, receiving guidance on the information DHS would like to  receive from components regarding their internal funding review and the  negative impact of using their internal resources could help improve the  effectiveness with which reprogramming requests are approved by DHS.  For instance, Secret Service submitted a reprogramming request related to  the April 12-13, 2010, Nuclear Security Summit to DHS on February 25,  2010. According to Secret Service officials in the Office of Administration,  DHS denied their initial reprogramming request for the Nuclear Security  Summit in part because it did not sufficiently describe Secret Service\u2019s  internal funding review and the negative impact upon the agency if it used  internal resources. Secret Service subsequently revised and resubmitted  its request to DHS on March 12, 2010. According to Secret Service officials,  if DHS had provided clear guidance on its expectations for what  information the reprogramming request should have included in this area,  DHS could have approved the request more quickly.", "In addition, clearly defining time frames for its timely submission of  reprogramming notifications to the Appropriations Committees, a measure  delineated by DHS in the CAP, could help enable DHS and the committees  to assess whether DHS effectively provides information about potential  funding shortfalls. After receiving the revised Nuclear Security Summit  request from Secret Service, DHS submitted the request to OMB for  approval on April 5, 2010, more than 5 weeks after Secret Service\u2019s initial  submission. OMB approved the request on April 8, 2010\u20143 days after DHS\u2019  submission. DHS then submitted the reprogramming notification to the  Appropriations Committees on April 9, 2010, 6 weeks after Secret Service\u2019s  initial submission. Having the notification submitted 3 days\u2014including  the weekend\u2014before the Nuclear Security Summit created challenges for  Secret Service because, according to Secret Service officials, it was  unaware of what funds would be available to cover the costs of the  summit. Without clarifying what is meant by timeliness with respect to  processing reprogramming requests, DHS is limited in its ability to assess  whether its submission of this notification was completed in a timely  manner and, consequently, to help Secret Service manage potential  funding shortfalls and provide Congress the information it needs when  making budgetary decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Secret Service performs the important mission of protecting presidential  candidates and nominees. Because of the larger crowds and faster pace of  the 2008 presidential campaign compared to prior campaigns, Secret  Service\u2019s spending exceeded the amount budgeted in its fiscal year 2009  Presidential Candidate Nominee Protection PPA. Given the importance of  providing the Appropriations Committees with complete and accurate  financial data concerning presidential candidate protection activities, it is  imperative that Secret Service have the necessary documented internal  control procedures in place, including financial management policies and  procedures, to help ensure it can effectively manage and report on funds  for presidential candidate protection. Relying on an undocumented  manual process to pull together information for key reports on  presidential candidate protection activities increases the risk that  inaccurate information will be reported to Congress and errors could be  made in budget management. Similarly, the lack of documented policies  and procedures for splitting costs for presidential candidate protection  activities across multiple PPAs increases the risk of reporting incomplete,  inaccurate information on these activities. Also, lack of guidance on how  to develop and document appropriate benchmarks for monitoring  presidential candidate protection obligations and expenditures limits the  ability of Secret Service financial management officials to identify any  future funding shortfalls.", "Further, recognizing the communication breakdowns that occurred during  fiscal year 2009, DHS and Secret Service have taken steps to improve  communication, including developing the CAP. However, DHS has not  clarified in its guidance all of the CAP measures, including components\u2019  required documentation of internal funding reviews and the negative  impacts of using internal resources in reprogrammings; and the time  frames associated with its timely submission of reprogramming  notifications to the Appropriations Committees. Providing this guidance  could help DHS ensure it is able to approve components\u2019 reprogramming  requests more quickly, assess whether its submission of the  reprogramming notifications to the Appropriations Committees are timely,  and, ultimately, provide Congress the information it needs when making  budgetary decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To improve financial management controls and communication related to  presidential candidate protection budget execution, we recommend that  the Secretary of DHS take the following five actions:    direct the Director of Secret Service to develop documented procedures  for preparing and reviewing its Monthly Execution and Staffing Reports  and Presidential Campaign Cost Reports;    direct the Director of Secret Service to develop written policies and  procedures for charging costs when protection activities may be funded by  multiple PPAs;    direct the DHS CFO to ensure that DHS\u2019 components, including Secret  Service, have guidance and training on how to develop and document  appropriate benchmarks for monitoring obligations and expenditures;    direct the DHS CFO to develop and provide written guidance clarifying the  elements necessary in a reprogramming request from a component to  document internal funding reviews and the negative impact of using  internal sources; and    direct the DHS CFO to define time frames by which DHS could assess  timeliness of submissions of reprogramming notifications to the  Appropriations Committees."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["On June 23, 2010, DHS provided written comments on a draft of this  report.
