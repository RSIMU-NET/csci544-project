In addition, VA outpatient clinics are expected to handle 25.3 million outpatient visits. The Congressional Budget Resolution, however, would essentially freeze the VA medical care appropriation at the fiscal year 1995 spending level\u2014$16.2 billion\u2014for the next 7 years. Final action on VA\u2019s fiscal year 1996 appropriation is pending.", "The VA health care system consists of (1) a health benefits program and (2) a health care delivery program. The two programs are closely intertwined. For example, VA outpatient clinics are not allowed to use available resources to provide services to many veterans because (1) the services, such as prosthetics, are not covered under the veterans\u2019 health care benefits and (2) the clinics are not permitted under the law to sell such noncovered services to veterans.", "In administering the veterans\u2019 health benefits program, VA\u2019s responsibilities are similar to those of the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) in administering Medicare benefits and to those of private health insurance companies in administering health insurance policies. For example, VA is responsible for determining (1) which benefits veterans are eligible to receive, (2) whether and how much veterans must contribute toward the cost of their care, (3) whether the health care services veterans need are covered under their benefits, and (4) where veterans obtain covered services (that is, whether they must use VA-operated facilities or can obtain needed services from other providers at VA expense). Similarly, VA, like HCFA and private insurers, is responsible for ensuring that the health benefits provided to its \u201cpolicyholders\u201d\u2014veterans\u2014are (1) medically necessary and (2) provided in the most appropriate care setting (such as a hospital, nursing home, or outpatient clinic).", "In operating a health care delivery program, VA\u2019s role is similar to that of the major private sector health care delivery networks, such as those operated by Columbia/Hospital Corporation of America and Humana. For example, VA strives to ensure that its facilities (1) provide care of an acceptable quality, (2) are used to their optimum capacity, (3) are located where they are accessible to its target population, (4) provide good customer service, (5) offer potential patients services and amenities comparable to competing facilities, and (6) operate effective billing and collection systems."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Significant Changes Occurring in the Veteran Population", "paragraphs": ["The veteran population, which totaled about 26.4 million in 1995, is both declining and aging.

By contrast, the number of veterans aged 85 and older will increase more than eight-fold. At that time, veterans aged 85 and older will make up about 6 percent of the veteran population.", "Coinciding with the overall decline in the number of veterans is a decline in the percentage of veterans who served during wartime.

Only veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher (about 465,000 veterans) are in the mandatory category for comprehensive outpatient care.

Similarly, as a health care provider, VA, unlike private sector providers, is severely limited in its ability to both buy health care services from and sell health care services to individuals and other providers.

Only those veterans whose \u201cpolicy\u201d covers all medically necessary care\u2014primarily those veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or more\u2014have clearly defined, uniform benefits. Because coverage of outpatient services for most veterans varies on the basis of their medical conditions, a veteran may be eligible to receive different services at different times. For example, if a veteran with no service-connected disabilities is scheduled for admission to a VA hospital for elective surgery, he or she is eligible to receive any outpatient service needed to prepare for the hospital admission, including a physical examination with X rays and blood tests. However, if the same veteran sought a routine physical examination from a VA outpatient clinic, he or she would not be eligible for an examination, X rays, or blood tests because there is no apparent need for hospital-related care.", "Because of the lack of a well-defined benefit package, veterans are often confused by VA\u2019s complex eligibility provisions. The services they can get from VA depend on such factors as the presence and extent of any service-connected disability, income, period of service, and the seriousness of the condition. To further add to veterans\u2019 confusion about which health care services they are eligible to receive from VA, title 38 of the U.S. Code specifies the types of medical services that cannot be provided on an outpatient basis. For example, VA outpatient clinics cannot provide prosthetic devices, such as wheelchairs, crutches, eyeglasses, and hearing aids, to veterans not eligible for comprehensive outpatient services; dental care to most veterans unless they were examined and had their treatments started while in a VA hospital; and routine prenatal care and delivery services through the VA health care system."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Outpatient Eligibility Requirements Are Difficult to Administer", "paragraphs": ["Veterans are not the only ones confused by VA eligibility provisions.

For example, they must determine whether the disability for which care is being sought is service connected or aggravating a service-connected disability, because different rules apply to service-connected and nonservice-connected care; determine the disability rating for veterans with service-connected disabilities because the outpatient services they are eligible for and their priority for care depend on their rating; and determine the income and assets of veterans with no service-connected disabilities because their eligibility for (and priority for receiving) care depends on a determination of their ability to pay for care."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Availability of Outpatient Care Is Uneven", "paragraphs": ["Under private health insurance, Medicare, and Medicaid, the availability of covered services is guaranteed.

Being in the mandatory care category essentially gives veterans a higher priority for treatment than veterans in the discretionary care category.", "In effect, veterans, rather than the government, assume a significant portion of the financial risk in the VA health care system because there is no guarantee that sufficient funds will be appropriated to enable the government to provide services to all veterans seeking care. Historically, however, sufficient funds have been appropriated to meet the health care needs of all veterans in the mandatory care category and most of those in the discretionary care categories.", "Because the provision of VA outpatient services is conditioned on the availability of space and resources, veterans cannot be assured that health care services are available when they need them. Even veterans in the mandatory care category are theoretically limited to health care services that can be provided with available space and resources. If demand for VA care exceeds the capacity of the system or of an individual facility to provide care, then health care services are rationed.", "The Congress established general priorities for VA to use in rationing outpatient care when resources are not available to care for all veterans. VA delegated rationing decisions to its medical centers; that is, each must independently make choices about when and how to ration care.", "Using a questionnaire, we obtained information from VA\u2019s 158 medical centers on their rationing practices. In fiscal year 1991, 118 centers reported that they rationed outpatient care for nonservice-connected conditions, and 40 reported no rationing. Rationing generally occurred because resources did not always match veterans\u2019 demands for care.", "When the 118 centers rationed care, they also used differing methods. Some rationed care according to economic status, others by medical service, and still others by medical condition. The method used can greatly affect who is turned away. For example, rationing by economic status will help ensure that veterans of similar financial means are served or turned away. On the other hand, rationing by medical service or medical condition helps ensure that veterans with similar medical needs are treated the same way.", "The 118 medical centers\u2019 varying rationing practices resulted in significant inconsistencies in veterans\u2019 access to care both among and within centers. For example, higher-income veterans frequently received care at many medical centers, while lower-income veterans or those who also had service-connected disabilities were turned away at other centers.
