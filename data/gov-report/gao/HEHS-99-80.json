They are frequently dependent on  extensive assistance in basic activities of daily living like dressing,  grooming, feeding, and using the bathroom, and many require skilled  nursing or rehabilitative care.  The vast majority of nursing homes  participate in Medicare and Medicaid and are expected to receive nearly  $39 billion in federal payments from these programs in 1999.  For these  nursing homes, providing adequate care is a federal mandate backed by  about $210 million in federal funding going to state agencies that inspect  and certify nursing homes\u2019 compliance with quality standards through  annual surveys and complaint investigations.  About $42 million of this  goes to fund investigations of complaints that are lodged by various  sources, including residents, their families, and nursing home employees,  and incidents of potential abuse or neglect that nursing homes report to  states.", "In our July 1998 report to you, we found that unacceptable care was a  problem in many California nursing homes, including one in three where  state surveyors identified serious or potentially life-threatening care  problems.  We also reported that federal and state oversight is not  sufficient to guarantee the safety and welfare of nursing home residents.   In a companion report issued last week, we further found that current  federal enforcement efforts cannot ensure sustained compliance with  federal standards for nursing home care.", "Concerned that annual surveys alone are inadequate to meet the federal  goal of ensuring nursing home residents\u2019 health and safety, you asked us to  examine how states implement the federal requirement that states  establish a process for nursing home complaint investigations.  Complaint  investigations offer a unique opportunity to identify and correct potential  care problems because they can provide a more timely alert than annual  inspections, and they target specific areas of potential problems identified  by residents, their families, the concerned public, and even the facility  itself.  Specifically, this report assesses the effectiveness of (1) state  complaint investigation practices as a component of the system to ensure  sustained compliance with federal nursing home quality-of-care standards  and (2) the Health Care Financing Administration\u2019s (HCFA) role in  establishing standards and conducting oversight of states\u2019 complaint  investigation practices and in using information about the results of  complaint investigations to ensure compliance with nursing home  standards. We assessed complaint investigation practices in Maryland,  Michigan, and Washington State; reviewed state auditors\u2019 reports from 11 other states; and examined HCFA\u2019s policies and procedures for  overseeing state complaint investigation activities.  Appendix I provides  more details about our scope and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Nearly all nursing homes accept residents with either Medicare or Medicaid  and are projected to receive nearly $39 billion in federal payments from  these programs in 1999.  The federal government, through HCFA, has  responsibility for establishing requirements that nursing homes must meet  to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs and ensuring that  these standards are met.  HCFA carries out this responsibility by  contracting with states to monitor nursing homes.  As part of these  contracts, the states agree to comply with regulations and other general  instructions that HCFA prescribes.", "The Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 revised the standards for  homes\u2019 participation in these federal programs and defined federal and  state roles for ensuring that nursing homes meet these standards.  In this  regulatory framework, states (1) license nursing homes to do business in  the state, (2) certify to the federal government, by conducting reviews of  nursing homes, that homes are eligible for Medicare and Medicaid  payment, and (3) investigate complaints about care provided in the homes.   As part of their oversight, the states are required to conduct annual surveys  of homes.  While the annual surveys seek to provide a nationally uniform  process to evaluate whether nursing homes meet a comprehensive range of  federal standards, they are often predictable in their timing.  Complaint  investigations can be less predictable than annual surveys and generally  provide a unique opportunity for more frequent state inspections that  assess conditions at the nursing home while focusing on specific concerns  raised by residents, their families, or other observers.  HCFA oversees  states\u2019 performance by monitoring at least 5 percent of states\u2019 surveys and  by requiring states to develop a quality improvement program that  incorporates performance goals and measures in seven required core  performance areas--including complaint investigations--and other optional  state-identified areas.", "In addition to the requirement that states establish a complaint  investigation process, HCFA requires that states investigate the most  serious complaints that allege situations immediately jeopardizing the  health or safety of residents within 2 workdays, but leaves the timing,  scope, duration, and conduct of other complaint investigations to the  discretion of the state survey agency.  Thus, states establish their own  priorities and time frames for investigating complaints that they determine  do not represent immediate jeopardy to resident health and safety.  In  addition, states require nursing homes to report and investigate incidents  such as injuries that might signal neglect or abuse.  The state then  determines whether it will further investigate the incident.", "When states conduct a complaint investigation, they attempt to  substantiate whether the allegations are valid.  If a complaint is  substantiated, the state may cite the nursing home for violating either  federal or state standards.  In such cases, the state agency will require the  home to develop an approved plan of correction.  The state may choose to  take action under the state\u2019s licensing authority, using applicable state  remedies and sanctions.  If the deficiency relates to federal standards,  information regarding the deficiency is also to be reported to HCFA.   Serious deficiencies require that the home attain compliance within a set  time frame or face enforcement sanctions, such as civil monetary penalties,  by HCFA or the state.", "Both federal and state funds finance the costs state agencies incur in  inspecting nursing homes and investigating complaints.  In 1998, the federal  government paid states about $210 million for the nursing home survey and  certification process, including about $42 million (20 percent) for  investigating complaints.  States contributed an additional $17 million for  complaint investigations.  On average, federal funds account for 71 percent  of states\u2019 complaint investigation expenditures.  Table 1 compares these  expenditures for the states visited.  Appendix II includes additional  expenditure information for all states and further discusses the allocation  of federal and state shares. Generally, the federal government finances  states\u2019 complaint investigation costs for nursing homes in the same  proportion that it finances annual and other surveys."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Some States\u2019 Complaint Practices Are Limited in Protecting Nursing Home Residents", "paragraphs": ["Although investigations of complaints filed against nursing homes can  provide a valuable opportunity for determining whether the health and  safety of  residents are threatened, complaint investigation practices do not  consistently achieve this goal.  Some states use procedures that may  discourage the public from filing complaints.  Furthermore, some states fail  to recognize and promptly respond to complaints that may pose immediate  jeopardy to a resident\u2019s health, safety, or life.  Likewise, some states do not  require that other serious complaints, including those that allege harm to  residents, be investigated for months after the complaint\u2019s receipt.   Additionally, many complaints are not investigated within states\u2019 required  time frames for conducting an investigation.  Consequently, we found  several instances in which, after an extended delay, the complaint  investigators substantiated that residents had been harmed and other cases  in which the state was unable to determine whether the allegations were  true partly because so much time had elapsed since the complaint was  received."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Procedures and Practices May Limit the Public\u2019s Filing of Complaints", "paragraphs": ["Because nursing home residents and the public need an effective and  expedient means to seek correction of problems that they perceive  endanger the health and safety of nursing home residents, the process of  filing a complaint should not place an unnecessary burden on the  complainant.  Nevertheless, some states we reviewed have procedures or  practices that may limit the number of complaints.  For example, when a  person calls with a complaint, Maryland and Michigan encourage him or  her to submit the complaint in writing.", "Michigan requires that either complainants write a complaint or the  state will provide assistance in writing the complaint.  About 95 percent  of publicly reported complaints were submitted in writing between July  1997 and June 1998.", "Maryland\u2019s policy is to accept and act on a complaint by phone even  though callers are encouraged to submit a written complaint.  However,  state officials provided us conflicting information as to whether calls  would be consistently documented and investigated when callers agreed  to submit a written complaint but did not do so.  Over 70 percent of Maryland\u2019s publicly reported complaints that the state investigated were identified as written complaints between July 1997 and June 1998.", "In contrast, Washington readily accepts complaints by phone and nearly  all complaints are received by phone.  This contributes to Washington  receiving a considerably higher number of complaints than Michigan or  Maryland.", "See table 2 for a comparison of the total number of nursing home  complaints received in a year by these states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Establish Widely Varying Categories for Prioritizing Complaints", "paragraphs": ["When a complaint is received, the state agency ascertains its potential  seriousness.  HCFA requires that complaints that may involve immediate  jeopardy of a resident\u2019s health, safety, or life be investigated by states  within 2 workdays of receipt.  For other complaints, states are permitted  to establish their own categories and time frames for investigation.  States  have established varying time requirements for complaint responses and  varying criteria for prioritizing these complaints, including criteria for  complaints that may involve a significant risk of actual harm to nursing  home residents.  Some states permit relatively long periods of time to pass  between the receipt of all such complaints and their investigation.  For  example, for complaints that may involve significant risk of actual harm to  residents,", "Michigan\u2019s statute allows 30 days, but in 1998 Michigan\u2019s operating  practice was to allow 45 days;", "Tennessee allows 60 days; and,", "Kansas allows 180 days.", "Some states have established other priority categories with similar time  frame classifications, but their criteria for determining which complaints to  include in these classifications differ substantially.  Maryland and  Washington both have classification schemes that include categories for  complaints to be investigated within 2, 10, or 45 workdays or at the next on- site investigation.  Similarly, Pennsylvania classifies complaints to be  investigated within 2, 5, 10, or 45 workdays or at the next on-site survey.   Criteria for complaints to be included in the 10-day category for  Washington and Pennsylvania are similar. Washington\u2019s 10-day category  includes complaints alleging significant potential harm to a resident\u2019s  physical and/or mental health or safety.  Similarly, Pennsylvania  characterizes 10-day complaints as those in which residents\u2019 needs,  including medical, nursing, and dietary, are not being met.  Maryland\u2019s 10- day time frame states that complaints in this category are those that appear  to be especially significant, sensitive, or could attract broad public  attention; those forwarded from a government or public official; and those  where the provider has a history of poor performance relative to the  allegations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Complaints May Receive an Inappropriately Low Investigation Priority", "paragraphs": ["States sometimes place complaints in an inappropriately low investigation  category, thus postponing a prompt review.  The infrequent use of high- priority levels in some states raises a question as to whether complaints are  being appropriately categorized.  Some states have explicit procedures or  operating practices that result in the downgrading of a complaint\u2019s severity.   We found several instances of complaints that, in our opinion, were  inappropriately placed in a low-priority category.", "As shown in table 3, two of the three states we visited seldom placed  complaints in the immediate jeopardy category for the 1-year period we  analyzed.  Maryland did not identify a single complaint as potentially  representing immediate jeopardy.  Michigan did prioritize some complaints  as immediate jeopardy, but they accounted for only 2 percent of total  complaints received.  The Pennsylvania state auditor also noted that the  number of complaints considered immediate jeopardy in that state had  dropped considerably during the first quarter of 1998 in comparison to  earlier years, raising the auditor\u2019s skepticism and concern.", "Some states also categorized relatively few complaints in other high- priority categories, such as those that should be investigated within 10  days.  For example, Maryland placed most complaints in its lowest-priority  category\u2013to be investigated at the next on-site survey.  This contrasts with  Washington, which categorized nearly 90 percent of its complaints to be  investigated within either 2 or 10 workdays.  Table 4 compares the use of  similar priority time frames among the states visited.", "Several states have explicit procedures or operating practices that place  serious complaints in lower-priority categories.  A Maryland official, for  example, acknowledged reducing the priority of some complaints because  the state recognized that it could not meet shorter time frames because of  insufficient staff.   Similarly, a Michigan official also told us that her office  gives a complaint low priority if the resident is no longer at the nursing  home when the complaint is received--even if the resident died or was  transferred to a hospital or another nursing home.  The state may  investigate these complaints during the home\u2019s next survey or not at all.   Failure to investigate such a complaint in a timely manner may  compromise the health and safety of other residents who may also be  affected by problems cited in the complaint.  We identified several cases in  which a resident had died or been transferred from the nursing home that  were assigned to Michigan\u2019s lower-priority (45-day) category, were  uninvestigated for several months, or had not yet been investigated at the  time of our visit.  For example, a complaint in Michigan alleged in July 1998  that a resident died because the home did not properly manage his insulin  injections or perform blood sugar tests.  Because the resident died, the  state had not investigated the complaint as of January 1999.  We question  why the state agency would not have concerns that this situation might  affect other diabetic residents in the home.", "Michigan also delays investigating certain nonimmediate jeopardy  complaints against nursing homes that are undergoing federal enforcement  action.  Officials told us that they adopted this practice to avoid potential  confusion that may result from having two enforcement actions pending  simultaneously.  We believe this practice could unreasonably delay the  investigation of serious complaints at nursing homes already identified as  violating federal standards.", "In reviewing complaints from the states visited, we identified several  complaints in two states that raise questions about why they were not  considered as potentially immediate jeopardy.  Examples of these  allegations include the following:", "The complaint alleged that a resident was found dead with her head  trapped between the mattress and the side rail of the bed, with her body  lying on the floor.  The state categorized this complaint as one needing  to be investigated within 45 days. The state investigated this complaint  within 13 days and determined that 11 of 24 sampled beds had similar  side rail violations.  Our concern about whether this complaint was  appropriately classified is supported by another HCFA region\u2019s  interpretation of HCFA\u2019s guidance to states.  The Denver region would  have considered this situation to be an immediate jeopardy complaint to  be investigated within 2 workdays, noting that \u201can unexplained resident  death related to a medical device, side rails, or other restraints  exemplifies a possible immediate jeopardy situation requiring an on-site  investigation within two workdays.\u201d", "Another complaint alleged that an alert resident who was placed in a  nursing home for a 20-day rehabilitation stay to recover from hip  surgery was transferred in less than 3 weeks to a hospital because of  what the complainant termed an \u201cunprecedented rapid decline [in the  resident\u2019s condition].\u201d  One of the members of the ambulance crew  transporting the resident to the hospital filed a written report stating  that the resident \u201chad dried . . . blood in his fingernails and on his hands  . . . sores all over his body . . . smelled like feces and  unable to  walk or take care of himself.  Patient is in very poor condition as far as  his hygiene.  I personally feel he was not being properly cared for.\u201d  The  state categorized this complaint as needing an investigation at the next  on-site inspection, took more than 4 months to begin its investigation,  and determined that the nursing home had harmed the resident.", "Another complaint alleged that the home\u2019s staff would not send a  resident with maggots in the sores on his feet to the hospital because the  home\u2019s director of nursing did not want the state agency to be notified  by the hospital and investigate the home.  The state categorized this  complaint, received 105 days before our visit, as needing to be  investigated within 45 days, but it had not yet been investigated.", "In another instance, the police reported suspected abuse and neglect to  the state survey agency after a resident was brought twice to the  hospital emergency room because of falls.  The resident\u2019s first  hospitalization identified a broken elbow, and the second found a  contusion on the resident\u2019s cheek.  The police did not believe the  nursing home staff\u2019s account of how the resident had sustained these  injuries.

Among the  complaints categorized as not requiring an investigation until the earlier  of the home\u2019s next annual survey or within 6 months of receipt was one  alleging that a resident had skin tears, purple lesions, feces and food on  his clothing, broken eyeglasses, and was not being fed regularly.  Another complaint charged that a  nurse\u2019s aide abused several residents.", "Pennsylvania\u2019s auditors identified several complaints as categorized too  low, including one filed by a licensed practical nurse recently employed  by the home.  The nurse alleged that there had been at least 12 deaths at  the home over a 2-week period, including  a resident who choked to  death because she had mistakenly been given solid food; a resident who  was sent to the emergency room because her feeding tube had become  dislodged and was entirely within her stomach; and a resident who had  received 10 times the prescribed dosage of a medication.  This nurse\u2019s  complaint was placed in the lowest category, delaying its investigation  until the home\u2019s next annual survey."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "States Frequently Do Not Investigate Complaints Within Required Time Frames", "paragraphs": ["States often do not conduct investigations of complaints within the time  frames they assign, even though some states frequently place complaints in  lower investigation categories to increase the time available to investigate  them.

Finally, HCFA\u2019s ability to oversee states\u2019  performance in handling complaints is limited because major monitoring  efforts are focused instead on annual surveys; it primarily relies on states  to develop performance measures for complaint investigations; and it has  inadequate reporting systems for capturing the results of complaint  investigations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Previous HCFA Efforts to Strengthen Federal Standards for Nursing Home Complaint Investigations Were Abandoned", "paragraphs": ["Between 1993 and 1995, a HCFA task force worked to develop formal  complaint guidance for states and a complaint investigation manual to help  state investigators.

However,  the formal guidance and the manual were never finalized or released.   HCFA attributes the decision to discontinue this initiative to a shift in  HCFA\u2019s focus toward revising enforcement regulations and its concern that  some states that exceeded the proposed federal standards might weaken  their standards.", "Instead of formal guidance, HCFA sent a portion of the task force\u2019s work to  its 10 regional offices as a set of optional protocols.  These were released as  \u201ctools, not rules\u201d for specific situations an investigator may encounter  while conducting an on-site complaint investigation.  These protocols did  not address the prioritization and timeliness aspects of complaint  investigations.  This optional guidance has not been widely used.  Officials  at several HCFA regional offices did not recall receiving these on-site  investigative protocols.  Another HCFA regional office reported that it did  not release the document to states in its area because the document  appeared to be in draft form.  HCFA does not provide additional guidance  to states on ways to manage complaint workloads efficiently, how to  categorize complaints, or when to expand a review beyond the residents  involved with the original complaint.", "In contrast, the HCFA regional office in Boston established its own task  force to enhance the protocols.  The region adopted its own guidance for  how state agencies should classify complaints.

It is intended for reporting state agencies\u2019 investigation results for  all types of health care facilities--including home health agencies and  clinical laboratories\u2013as well as nursing homes.

Tracking of complaints  is integral to identifying the status of complaint investigations and to  managing complaint workloads to appropriately protect residents\u2019 health.   In particular, a full compliance history is key to several parts of the survey  and certification process, such as HCFA\u2019s enforcement and oversight of  standards, states\u2019 prioritization of complaints, and HCFA\u2019s ability to provide full information to consumers via its Internet page and other sources.  We  found that inadequacies in HCFA\u2019s data system and the linkage between  state and federal systems hinder HCFA\u2019s and states\u2019 ability to adequately  track the status of complaint investigations and for HCFA to maintain a full  nursing home compliance history.  In short, one HCFA official stated that  the complaint system is \u201cnot used as a management tool.\u201d", "HCFA requires states to develop tracking systems and to submit summary  information about all complaint investigations.  For monitoring purposes,  HCFA maintains a database of nursing home complaint investigation  information.  Although HCFA standards require states to report this  information, the process for collecting it results in inaccurate and  incomplete information.  For example, HCFA collects summary  information for on-site complaint investigations with a form that was  created for recording information about a single complaint.  Some states,  including Maryland and Michigan, use the form for multiple complaints.   Therefore, timeliness, prioritization, and other important tracking  information that relates to multiple complaints is reported as though it  applies to one complaint.  In this situation, states typically record the  highest priority level assigned to any of the individual complaints and are  limited to choosing timeliness dates reflective of only one of the  complaints.  As a result, HCFA is unable to effectively monitor states\u2019  performance on prioritization and timeliness.", "In our report on California nursing homes, we determined that the results  of complaint inspections are often cited as state, not federal, deficiencies.   Thus, the results of complaint investigations may not appear in federal  databases.  Furthermore, state officials reported that complaints might  appear to be unsubstantiated in federal databases when the state has  actually substantiated the complaint.  In contrast, Washington and  Michigan report that they record most violations they identify in both  federal and state information systems.  For example, Washington has  developed a crosswalk between its state licensing and federal regulations  to assist providing full information in both federal and state information  systems.", "Overall, there is also a time lag on states reporting data to HCFA.   Washington, for example, estimated that its input into the federal data  system was 3 months behind.

Such delays  do not provide this vulnerable population the protections intended by the  federally mandated complaint investigation process.  Some practices, such  as Washington\u2019s ready acceptance of phone complaints and its relatively  prompt investigation, as well as the HCFA Boston office\u2019s guidance to  states recommending improved prioritization of complaints, merit  replication.  Despite these positive efforts, we identified frequent systemic  weaknesses in HCFA\u2019s and many states\u2019 practices that can leave nursing  home residents in poor care and unsafe conditions for extended periods.   The combination of inadequate state practices and limited HCFA guidance  and oversight have too often resulted in extensive delays in investigating  serious complaints alleging harmful situations, a lack of careful review of  states\u2019 policies and practices, and incomplete reporting on nursing homes\u2019  compliance history and states\u2019 complaint investigation performance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations", "paragraphs": ["To make complaint investigations a more effective tool for protecting  nursing home residents\u2019 health and safety, we recommend that the HCFA  Administrator revise federal guidance and ensure state agency compliance  through the following actions:", "Develop additional standards for the prompt investigation of serious  complaints alleging situations that may harm residents but are  categorized as less than immediate jeopardy.  These standards should  include maximum allowable time frames for investigating serious  complaints and for complaints that may be deferred until the next  scheduled annual survey.

These include a new interim requirement that states should investigate complaints  alleging actual harm to residents within 10 workdays, and a complaint  improvement project with the intention of developing additional  minimum standards for complaint investigations; increased federal oversight of complaints, including allowing HCFA  regional offices to conduct additional monitoring surveys based upon  complaints and new state agency performance measures relating to  complaints; and improved reporting on complaint information, including a review of the  form states use to report complaint information to HCFA, further  direction to states requiring that complaint findings be included in the  federal as well as state database in a timely manner, and a review of  potential long-term improvements in the federal data system.", "Maryland, Michigan, and Washington each highlighted resource limitations  as contributing to the problems we identify.  Specifically, Maryland noted  that in recognition of many of the problems we identify, the state has  recently hired additional staff and plans additional improvements,  including merging its complaint and annual survey investigative staff and  improving the tracking of complaints.  Maryland also commented that the  scope of our work was narrowly focused on complaint investigations and,  as only one component of its broader nursing home oversight efforts,  should not be used to evaluate the state\u2019s entire regulatory process.  While  we concentrated this aspect of our work on complaints, we continue to  believe that, in coordination with annual surveys, complaint investigations  are an essential component of state efforts to protect residents and ensure  that nursing homes provide adequate care.  They afford a unique  opportunity to increase state inspectors\u2019 unexpected presence in homes  and to target specific areas of potential problems identified by residents  and other concerned individuals.", "Michigan\u2019s comments noted that prior to the period we examined the state  had experienced a loss of staff and that it has been hiring and training  additional investigators.  Michigan also reiterated its criteria for including  complaints in its highest priority level.  However, we found several cases  that appear to meet these criteria but were not classified as requiring a 24- hour visit.  Michigan also noted that several state practices we highlight  were developed with guidance from the HCFA regional office, including  investigating complaints concurrently with annual surveys and delaying the  investigation of certain complaints regarding nursing homes nearing the  deadline for enforcement actions.  Michigan disputes that its policy or  practice places egregious complaints in a lower priority level.  However, we  remain concerned that state investigators we interviewed reported that  some complaints where residents died or left the nursing home would not  be investigated until the next on-site inspection.  Furthermore, several  cases we reviewed where a resident had died or had been transferred from  the home were assigned to Michigan\u2019s lower (45-day) category, were  uninvestigated for several months, or had not yet been investigated at the  time of our visit.  Michigan indicated that it plans a more thorough review  of its handling of complaints and intends to make recommendations to  address any concerns it identifies by April 1999.", "Washington concurred with the importance of an effective complaint  system and stressed attributes of its system, including prioritizing most  complaints at a high level and a highly trained professional staff.   Washington acknowledged that, because of the large volume of complaints  categorized as requiring an investigation within 10 days and the need for  increased resources, the timeliness of complaints within this category  depends on investigators\u2019 determinations of which complaints are the most  serious.", "We also provided a copy of the report for review by the American Health  Care Association (AHCA) and the American Association of Homes and  Services for the Aging (AAHSA).
