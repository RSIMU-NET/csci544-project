In February 2011, in response to section 2034, the Corps submitted its initial report to Congress summarizing its implementation of the peer review process. In its report, however, the Corps did not distinguish which studies had been selected for peer review in accordance with section 2034 and therefore, did not provide Congress information that would help decision makers evaluate the requirements of section 2034 at the end of the trial period.", "The 49 peer reviews resulted in both direct and indirect costs. Specifically, these peer reviews resulted in direct costs of over $9 million in contract costs and fees. In addition, Corps staff resources were used to manage the reviews, although these costs are not fully quantifiable. Furthermore, the addition of peer review to the Corps study process has resulted in indirect costs by altering project study schedules to allow for time needed to complete peer reviews. In some cases where a peer review was not planned during the early stages of the study process, significant delays to project studies occurred while funds were sought to pay for the peer review. In contrast, according to some Corps officials, when project managers have built in time and identified funding for peer reviews early, the process has had less of an impact on project study schedules.", "The Corps\u0092 process for determining whether a project study is subject to peer review is more expansive than section 2034 requirements because it uses broader criteria, resulting in peer reviews of studies outside the scope of section 2034. In addition, the process the Corps uses does not include the flexibility provided in section 2034, which allows for the exclusion of certain project studies from peer review. Moreover, some studies are undergoing peer reviews that do not warrant it, according to some Corps officials GAO spoke with.", "The Corps has a process to review general information on contractors\u0092 conflicts of interest and independence when selecting them to establish peer review panels, but it does not have a process for reviewing project-level information on conflicts of interest and independence. As a result, it cannot be assured that contractors do not have conflicts at the project-level. In contrast, the Corps\u0092 contractors do have a process for reviewing information related to conflicts of interest and the independence of experts selected for each peer review panel.", "The Corps has adopted and incorporated into its project study reports most of the peer review recommendations it has received. Doing so has resulted in some technical improvements to study reports but generally has not changed the Corps\u0092 decisions about project alternatives, in part because the peer review process occurs too late in the project study process to affect decision making, according to some Corps officials GAO spoke with. As a result, some recommendations about alternatives may not have been implemented because the decision on the preferred design had already been made."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Department of Defense direct the Corps to, among other actions, better track peer review studies, revise the criteria for determining which studies undergo peer review and the timing of these reviews, and improve its process for ensuring contractor independence.

These  projects aim to provide safe and reliable waterways; reduce risk to  people, homes, and communities from flooding and coastal storms;  restore and protect the environment; and address water resources  challenges. A Corps civil works project generally starts with a study of a  water resources issue and the development of various alternatives to  address it. Such studies can span the full range of Corps civil works  projects, and can include those that are small and low impact and others  that are large and complex, with potentially significant economic and  environmental impacts. Through its civil works program, the Corps  operates 50 centers of expertise and seven research laboratories that  assist its eight divisions and 38 district offices in the planning, design, and  technical review of civil works projects. Six of these centers are focused  on the quality and effectiveness of water resources planning and are  referred to as \u201cplanning centers of expertise.\u201d", "Through its civil works projects, the Corps provides vital public  engineering services in peace and war to strengthen the nation\u2019s security,  energize the economy, and reduce risks from disasters.

Technical errors in past studies of Corps projects, however, had raised  concerns about the effectiveness of the Corps\u2019 internal review processes  and the quality of the studies that the Corps used as a basis for its civil  works projects. For example, in March 2006, we reported that certain  studies completed by the Corps from 1992 through 2002 were fraught  with errors, mistakes, and miscalculations and used invalid assumptions  and outdated data.understated costs, overstated benefits, and did not provide a reasonable  basis for decision making.

Because this sample was a nonprobability  sample, the information derived from these reviews is not generalizable to  all peer reviews, but the reviews serve as illustrative examples that  provide valuable insights into the Corps\u2019 peer review process; we  selected a review from each planning center of expertise and at least one  for each of the three contractors selected to conduct peer reviews. We  conducted semistructured interviews with officials from Corps  headquarters, the planning centers of expertise involved in managing the  peer reviews, all of the Corps\u2019 eight divisions, and from 10 geographically  dispersed districts that had conducted project studies that underwent peer  review.

To determine the extent to which the Corps\u2019 process for  determining if a study is subject to peer review is consistent with section  2034, we analyzed the legal requirements and relevant Corps policy  guidance for determining when to conduct peer reviews, and we reviewed  documentation on Corps decisions. To determine the process the Corps  uses to ensure that the contractors it hires and the experts the contractors  select are independent and free from conflicts of interest, we analyzed  relevant Corps policy guidance and reviewed documentation provided by  the contractors to demonstrate that they and the selected experts meet  the requirements. To determine the extent to which recommendations are  incorporated into project studies, we analyzed relevant policy guidance  and summarized peer review recommendations and Corps responses,  but we did not assess the quality of the peer review recommendations or  the technical sufficiency of the Corps responses to these  recommendations.

The study process is conducted in two phases:  reconnaissance and feasibility. In the reconnaissance phase, the Corps  conducts an initial evaluation of potential solutions to a water resources  problem. If the Corps determines that a project potentially warrants  federal investment, it proceeds to a more detailed feasibility study. The  feasibility phase generally begins with the signing of a feasibility cost- share agreement between the Corps and the local project sponsor.", "Feasibility studies are generally prepared by the Corps\u2019 38 district offices,  with review and oversight provided by the cognizant Corps division office  and by headquarters. During the feasibility phase, the Corps formulates  and evaluates alternative plans for achieving the project\u2019s objectives and  reviews the proposed project to assess whether the benefits of  constructing it outweigh its costs. At the beginning of this phase, a  feasibility scoping meeting is held to bring the Corps, the local sponsor,  and other agencies together to reach agreement on the problems and  solutions to be investigated during the feasibility study and the scope of  the analysis required. The next step includes an alternative formulation  briefing to identify and resolve any legal or policy concerns and to obtain  headquarters approval of the tentatively selected plan and to release the  draft report to the public. Finally, the draft feasibility report\u2014which  presents the study results and findings, including those developed in the  reconnaissance phase\u2014is released to the public. At the conclusion of the  feasibility phase, the Corps selects a recommended plan for proceeding  with the project.", "The feasibility report also includes analysis and documentation to meet  the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA).  Under NEPA, federal agencies are to assess the effects of major federal  actions, such as Corps construction projects, that significantly affect the  environment and prepare a detailed statement on the environmental  impacts of those actions. NEPA has two principal purposes: (1) to ensure  that an agency carefully considers detailed information concerning  significant environmental impacts and (2) to ensure that this information  will be made available to the public. NEPA requires an agency to prepare  a detailed statement on the environmental impacts of any \u201cmajor federal  action\u201d significantly affecting the environment. NEPA implementing  regulations generally require an agency to prepare either an  environmental assessment or an environmental impact statement  (EIS).procedures\u2014such as providing the public with an opportunity to comment  on the draft EIS for at least 45 days.", "NEPA implementing regulations also specify requirements and  Corps project studies have historically been subject to various levels of  internal and external review under a number of authorities as well as the  Chief of Engineers\u2019 responsibility to ensure the quality of Corps studies.  For example, in 1902, Congress created the Board of Engineers for  Rivers and Harbors, which was the result of efforts to address  inconsistent treatment of proposed Corps projects. The board was made  up of Corps staff. Until 1992, when Congress terminated the board, it  reviewed thousands of Corps studies for civil works projects and made  unfavorable recommendations on more than half. At the time the board  was abolished, there was concern that too much duplicative review was  occurring between the board and other internal Corps review processes.  Subsequently, in the Flood Control Act of 1944, Congress established a  mechanism for external review of Corps projects by giving the head of the  Department of the Interior and the governors of affected states an  opportunity to comment on proposed Corps projects before authorization.  Furthermore, starting in 1970, under NEPA, environmental impact  statements for Corps projects were required to be sent to the heads of  other federal agencies and governors of affected states for comment. As  a result of the Flood Control Act of 1970, Congress created the position of  Assistant Secretary of the Army for Civil Works, who coordinates the  review of Corps studies with the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB) before they are submitted to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increasing Interest in Peer Review of Corps Project Studies", "paragraphs": ["Recent congressional interest in establishing an independent external  peer review process for Corps project studies began in the late 1990s,  following a series of damaging reports and events, including allegations  that the Corps had manipulated information to justify projects.  Investigations conducted by NAS and the Army\u2019s Inspector General  identified various problems with the Corps internal review process,  including the manipulation of economic analysis and potential institutional  bias toward large construction projects. Around this time, WRDA 2000  required the Corps to contract with NAS to study and make  recommendations concerning the use of peer review for feasibility  reports, including recommending potential criteria to determine how to  apply peer review. In 2002, NAS released its study concluding that the  Corps\u2019 more complex water resources project planning studies should be  subject to external, independent review. The study also found that not  all Corps project studies necessarily require such review, recommending  instead that external peer review be reserved for studies that are  expensive, will affect a large area, are highly controversial, or involve high  levels of risk. The study estimated that about five Corps projects per year  would likely be subject to this level of review. According to the NAS study,  criteria for selecting the appropriate level of review should balance the  risks and consequences of inadequate review against the resources  required for more complex and stringent levels of review. In addition, the  study identified several criteria that should be considered in determining  the appropriate level of review for Corps studies, primarily that as project  magnitude and risks increase, an increasing degree of independence and  scope of review are warranted (see fig. 1).", "In addition to recommendations related to the appropriate level of review  for project studies, the 2002 NAS study made several other  recommendations about the Corps\u2019 peer review process. It recommended  that peer review results be presented to the Chief of Engineers before a  final decision on a project study is made, that the Chief of Engineers  respond in writing to each key point of the peer review report, and that  peer review be initiated early enough in the Corps\u2019 study process so that  review results can be meaningfully incorporated into project design.", "After NAS published its 2002 study, OMB in December 2004 issued its  Final Information Quality Bulletin for Peer Review citing the Information   as well as its general authorities to oversee the quality of  Quality Act,agency information, analyses, and regulatory actions.

In these  two instances, the cost of planning centers of expertise staff time devoted  to peer review activities amounted to about $12,000 for the peer review of  the Boston Harbor study and about $32,000 for the American River study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Addition of Peer Review Has Affected Project Study Schedules", "paragraphs": ["The addition of peer review to the Corps study process has also had an  indirect cost because it has affected project study schedules. Planning  centers of expertise and district officials estimate that obtaining the  contract and executing the peer review generally take about a year. The  breakdown for the peer review process, according to some of these  officials, is about 3 months to initiate the contract; 3 to 6 months for the  review to be completed; and an additional 3 months to close out the  review, which involves responding to and receiving clarification on panel  comments. Some of these processes occur concurrently with other  aspects of the project study, but some parts of the peer review process,  such as responding to panel comments, may add time to the study  schedule. According to Corps officials, the addition of peer review to the  project schedule adds steps to the review process and takes time away  from other projects. In addition, according to several Corps officials, some  project studies have been delayed because the district did not allocate  funding for the peer review and therefore had to wait until additional  funding was available. In some cases, this delay added significant time to  the schedule. In contrast, according to some Corps division and planning- center-of-expertise officials, when the project manager had built in time  for the peer review and had identified funding for it early, the peer review  process had much less of an impact on the overall project study  schedule.", "Local sponsors are also concerned about the impact that this additional  time is adding to project studies, according to Corps officials and local  sponsors we spoke with. Their concern arises largely because local  sponsors share the cost of the Corps study and depend on its timely  completion. District officials told us that because of the cost-sharing  requirements and the current economic environment demand is greater  from local sponsors for the Corps to finish studies quickly and keep costs  down. Two local sponsors told us that delays negatively affect local  sponsors because they can lose business if a project is not completed in  a timely manner. Similarly, sponsors are accountable to their own local  governments or state legislatures, and additional delays or time required  for peer review can create challenges in getting continued support for a  project. For example, in the case of the Green Bay Dredged Material  Management Plan, Corps officials told us that peer review increased the  cost of the project and caused a 5- to 6-month delay at a time when the  local sponsor was attempting to acquire grant money contingent on  completion of the dredged material management plan."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Corps\u2019 Process for Initiating Peer Review Is More Expansive and Less Flexible Than Section 2034 Requirements", "paragraphs": ["The Corps\u2019 process for determining whether a project study is subject to  peer review is more expansive than section 2034 requirements because it  uses broader criteria; this has resulted in peer reviews of studies that are  outside the scope of section 2034.

Based on our analysis of the characteristics of these  studies, the Corps\u2019 process was applied to all studies and reports  regardless of when they were initiated, whereas section 2034 applies to  project studies initiated from November 2005 through November 2014.  Specifically, section 2034 applies to (1) project studies initiated from  November 2005 through November 2007 and for which the array of  alternatives had not been identified, and (2) project studies initiated from  November 2007 through November 2014. As a result, over half (30 of 49)  of the peer reviews conducted since the enactment of WRDA 2007 were  for project studies that did not fall under the scope of section 2034  because the studies were initiated before November 2005.", "Another reason the Corps\u2019 process for selecting studies for peer review is  more expansive than the scope of section 2034 is that Corps\u2019 guidance  does not clearly define \u201cproject study.\u201d The guidance refers to a wide  range of project studies, decision documents, and work products that may  be subject to peer review, whereas section 2034 defines a project study  subject to peer review as a feasibility or reevaluation study, including the  EIS, or any other study associated with the modification of a water  resources project that includes an EIS. According to our analysis of the  49 studies that underwent peer review, some of these studies did not fit  this definition. Specifically, 34 of the 49 studies that underwent peer  review were feasibility or reevaluation studies which are project studies as  defined by section 2034 requirements, 8 were other kinds of reports that  included an EIS and therefore may have been subject to section 2034  requirements, and 7 were neither feasibility nor reevaluation studies and  did not include an EIS and therefore did not fit the definition of a project  study subject to peer review under section 2034.

EC  209 states that most studies should undergo peer review, and the Corps\u2019  process requires that for any decision document to forgo a peer review,  an exclusion must be requested and approved by headquarters. In  addition, guidance provided to Corps staff on how to implement EC 209  discourages requests for exclusions, noting that time should not be  wasted shopping around for exclusion requests. Furthermore, agency  guidance and Corps headquarters officials, including the Director of Civil  Works, highlight the value and importance of peer review in achieving the  agency\u2019s mission, noting that an extra set of eyes is beneficial. In  addition, Corps headquarters officials told us, and agency guidance  highlights language from the WRDA 2007 conference report, that  \u201cection 2034 permits the Chief of Engineers to exclude a very limited  number of project studies from independent peer review.\u201d We believe,  however, that the Corps has misconstrued this statement and overstated  its significance. This statement is part of the explanation of the exclusion  paragraph (a)(5), and does not apply to the provision as a whole;  therefore, this statement pertains to how many studies for which peer  review is mandatory would be eligible for exclusion.another relevant statement in a House committee report on WRDA 2007  suggests that 26 studies over 7 years, or about 4 studies per year, would  be expected to be subject to peer review. Additionally, the 2002 NAS  study\u2014which is prominently mentioned throughout the subsequent  legislative history of WRDA 2007\u2014states that not all Corps water  resources project planning studies will require external, independent  review, but the Corps should institute external review for studies that are  expensive, that will affect a large area, that are highly controversial, or  that involve high levels of risk.", "In reviewing the exclusion requests that it receives, Corps headquarters  determines whether the studies meet any of the mandatory requirements  in EC 209 for undergoing peer review. Specifically, the Corps reviews  whether the project has a cost estimate of greater than $45 million,  represents a threat to health and safety, is controversial, and has had a  request for peer review from a governor or the head of a federal or state  agency. If studies do not meet any of these criteria, the Corps generally  approves the study for exclusion from peer review. From our review of 50  studies that had requested exclusion from peer review between 2009 and  2011, we found that the Corps had granted an exclusion for 37 studies  because they did not meet any of the criteria in EC 209 for studies that  must undergo peer review except for one study, which did not fit the  definition of a project study in section 2034.", "Under section 2034, however, the Corps also has the flexibility to exclude  studies from peer review that exceed the $45 million threshold if they: do  not have an EIS; are not controversial; are expected to have negligible  adverse impacts on scarce or unique cultural, historic, or tribal resources;  have no substantial impacts on fish and wildlife species or their habitats;  and have no more than negligible impacts on threatened or endangered  species or their critical habitat. Similarly, under section 2034, the Corps  may exclude studies from peer review that involve (1) only the  rehabilitation or replacement of existing hydropower turbines, lock  structures, or flood control gates within the same footprint and for the  same purpose as an existing water resources project; (2) an activity for  which there is ample experience within the Corps and industry to treat the  activity as being routine; and (3) minimal risk to human life and safety.  Nevertheless, according to our analysis of exclusion request documents  and headquarters\u2019 responses to these requests, as of November 2011,  the Corps had not granted an exclusion based on any of the flexibilities  included in section 2034.", "Several Corps officials expressed concerns about the Corps exclusion  process. Specifically, some officials told us that they were concerned  about the cost and time involved and said that the exclusion of projects  that do not meet any of the mandatory criteria should be delegated to the  division offices. In their opinion such delegation would help streamline the  process. Moreover, some of the studies that underwent or are currently  undergoing peer review did not warrant it, according to some Corps  officials we spoke with.

For  example, the Green Bay Dredged Material Management Plan  underwent peer review but is not a project study as defined by section  2034.

This study was for a project that would remove houses from a  floodplain, but officials said it should not require peer review because  there are no structural components and it did not exceed the $45  million threshold. Corps headquarters denied the request for exclusion  and stated that flood studies warrant peer review because of the  nature of the hazard and the need to assess the extent and treatment  of risk. Headquarters officials highlighted the importance of assessing  and addressing such risks in light of Hurricane Katrina and said that  flood studies such as Chacon Creek require peer review because of  the importance of assessing and decreasing risks associated with  flooding.", "The Yuba River General Reevaluation study is undergoing peer  review but does not warrant it according to some Corps officials.

From 2007 to 2009, Battelle managed 15  independent peer reviews for the Corps. The Corps had identified Battelle  as a potential contractor for managing its peer review panels as early as  August 2007, when WRDA 2007 was being considered. To ensure that  Battelle could meet the section 2034 independence requirements,  according to Corps officials, the Director of Civil Works and the Chief of  Planning and Policy held discussions with Battelle, and officials from the  Corps\u2019 Institute for Water Resources met with Battelle to discuss  Battelle\u2019s existing review process and the independent peer review  requirements of WRDA 2007. Battelle informed the Corps that it met all  WRDA 2007 requirements for an eligible organization, and Battelle  identified its existing contract with the Army Research Office as a vehicle  for employing Battelle to establish and manage peer review panels under  section 2034.", "During that time, NAS also conducted one independent peer review for  the Corps on the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Program,  which charged the Corps with developing a full range of flood control,  coastal restoration, and hurricane protection measures for South  Louisiana. According to Corps planning-center-of-expertise officials,  because of the extensive scope and breadth of the project, NAS was  chosen instead of Battelle to conduct that peer review. But Corps  headquarters and planning-center-of-expertise officials told us that, over  the course of NAS\u2019 review, they realized that NAS would not be the  appropriate organization for reviewing individual projects studies because  its process was too time-consuming and expensive. A member of that  NAS peer review panel also told us that while he would recommend NAS  review for larger projects, in his opinion NAS might not be the appropriate  organization for reviewing smaller Corps projects.", "In 2009, the Corps sought additional contractors to establish and manage  peer review panels and began its contractor selection process by putting  out a request for proposals. This solicitation included as contract  requirements the section 2034 criteria that the organizations establishing  and managing peer review panels be independent and free from conflicts  of interest. The Corps received six proposals, including one from Battelle,  and each of these proposals was then evaluated by a three-person  review panel. The panel chairperson told us that the section 2034 criteria  that eligible organizations be independent and free from conflicts of  interest were considered as minimum qualifications for screening and  selection. As a result of this process, the Corps awarded a contract to  Battelle\u2014this contract was in addition to the existing contract Battelle  already had with the Corps through the Army Research Office\u2014and one  to Noblis.

These qualifications  include independence and freedom from conflicts of interest related to the  specific project study being reviewed. In response, the contractors send  the Corps their proposals for conducting the peer review, which generally  include statements that they are independent and free from project- specific conflicts. Nevertheless, we identified a number of weaknesses  in the Corps\u2019 approach for reviewing and corroborating this information,  including the following:", "The Corps\u2019 planning centers of expertise are expected to review the  contractors\u2019 overall proposals, but the Corps does not require the  centers to ensure that contractors\u2019 statements of independence within  the proposals are reviewed and corroborated for each individual  project. Although planning-center-of-expertise officials told us that  they review the overall proposals, some of these officials also stated  that they did not believe that the statements required review because  Corps headquarters had already prescreened the contractors during  the initial contractor screening and selection process. Furthermore,  the Corps has not provided any guidance to the planning centers of  expertise or other Corps offices that specifies how those officials  should review the contractors\u2019 project-specific statements at the  proposal stage and ensure that they are accurate and that the  contractors are in fact independent and free from conflicts of interest.  Absent such guidance, the Corps cannot ensure that its contractors  are independent and free from conflicts of interest at the project level.", "The Corps neither conducts any internal conflicts-of-interest checks  nor asks contractors for documentation about potential conflicts of  interest so that it can determine whether a conflict exists; rather, the  Corps allows the contractors to make that determination on their own.  As a result, if the contractors do not provide this information to the  Corps, the agency does not have a process for otherwise obtaining  this information.", "Unlike the Corps\u2019 review of contractor independence, the Corps\u2019  contractors do solicit and review information on panel members\u2019  independence and conflicts of interest at the project level.

Corps revised portions of its analysis on the basis of these kinds of  recommendations. In none of these cases did the Corps indicate that the  revised analyses would change the study decisions. In one case,  according to Corps documents, the revised analysis served to strengthen  arguments in favor of its recommended plan. In response to a  recommendation concerning an environmental analysis from the peer  review of the Mid-Chesapeake Bay Islands Ecosystem Restoration  project study, the Corps conducted additional analyses to justify its  calculations of environmental benefits. The Corps reported that the  additional analyses led to the determination that the selected plan was  appropriate but that by considering the ecosystem impacts of the project  in a more detailed fashion, justification of the recommended plan was  strengthened.", "Specifically, 34 out of the total 910 peer review recommendations indicated a problem  with the economic analysis, 24 indicated a problem with the engineering analysis, and 19  indicated a problem with the environmental analysis.", "Nevertheless, despite these technical improvements, some Corps officials  have questioned the benefit of peer review, given the significant amount  of time that district staff have to spend managing the process and  responding to recommendations. The process for responding to  recommendations begins with district officials drafting a written response,  which they provide to the panel. The Corps\u2019 response to the peer review  recommendations includes a detailed description of the steps that the  Corps has taken or will take to incorporate the recommendations into the  project study.

These Corps officials were not aware of any project studies for which the  study outcome changed as a result of peer review. Corps headquarters  officials told us that one reason for the lack of impact of peer review on  decision-making is because the Corps\u2019 internal review process is  identifying the same issues as peer review. Another reason cited by  Corps officials for the lack of impact on decision making is the fact that  peer review is occurring at the end of the study process. Peer review  generally occurs concurrently with the public comment period for the draft  study report, which comes after the preferred design has been selected.  As a result, some recommendations about alternatives may not have  been implemented because the decision on the preferred design had  already been made. Selecting a different preferred design at that stage  would require the Corps to revisit an already completed selection analysis  and decision. For example, in the peer review report on the Cedar River- Cedar Rapids Iowa Flood Risk Management project study, the review  panel recommended that the Corps further investigate one of the non- selected design alternatives, because panel members felt that the  alternative might achieve project objectives better than the preferred  design. The Corps, however, had already selected its design and decided  to proceed. The Corps did not adopt this recommendation, stating that it  believed its analysis of alternatives was sound and that there was no  reasonable expectation that a more detailed analysis of the alternative  would result in finding that it had greater net economic benefits than the  preferred design.", "In contrast, when the Corps has conducted a peer review earlier in the  process, opportunities have arisen for positive impacts on a study  decision. For example, the American River Common Features project  study peer review was conducted early in the study process. According to  Corps division and planning-center-of-expertise officials, they conducted  peer review early to obtain external input on defining the problem and to  inform decision-making due to the complexity of the project. As a result,  the peer review began before the alternative formulation briefing, when  the without-project conditions were being identified. By employing this  approach, the Corps received feedback from the review panel before  selecting the preferred design. The panel\u2019s recommendations included  three suggested changes to the Corps\u2019 analyses and model calibrations,  which the Corps had time to incorporate before conducting the alternative  analysis and selection. According to the contractor that managed the peer  review, the panel members involved in the American River Common  Features peer review also found the timing of the review to be beneficial  and suggested that the Corps conduct peer review earlier for other project  studies.", "The timing of peer review was also addressed in the 2002 NAS study on  peer review. NAS recommended that the Corps initiate peer reviews early  enough in the study process so that the review results could be  meaningfully incorporated into the study or project design and stated that  conducting peer review before selecting a recommended plan is essential  if the Corps is to benefit from the review. Corps officials nevertheless told  us that they have generally chosen to conduct peer reviews later in the  process to minimize effects on project study schedules. Corps  headquarters officials noted that, for many studies, peer review occurred  late in the process because the studies were under way at the time the  Corps began requiring peer review. These officials also noted that it  would be challenging to assemble a peer review panel to conduct a  review early in the study process and retain the same panel to complete  this review at the end of the study. Furthermore, Corps headquarters  officials noted that a further challenge is implementing section 2033  WRDA requirements along with section 2034. Section 2033 generally  requires the Corps to complete feasibility studies within 2 years.  According to Corps officials, there is tension between these requirements  and it may be challenging to include peer review throughout the study  process without altering project study schedules."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Section 2034 established a trial to look at the cost and impact of  conducting peer review for controversial and costly projects over a 7-year  period. After the trial period, based on information provided by the Corps,  Congress could reconsider whether to retain or revise section 2034 or  allow it to lapse. Because the Corps generally does not specify the  authority under which peer review was conducted, however, it has not  provided Congress with the information needed to evaluate the merits of  the section 2034 requirements. In addition, the Corps\u2019 implementation of  peer review has not focused on the larger, more complex, and  controversial projects that were contemplated when section 2034 was  enacted and as recommended by NAS a decade ago. As a result, project  studies are being selected to undergo peer review that may not be  warranted and may thereby be increasing project costs and schedules  needlessly. Further, essential to the integrity of the peer review process is  the assurance that the Corps has effective processes not only to ensure  overall contractor independence and freedom from conflicts of interest but  also to ensure project-level independence and freedom from conflicts of  interest. The Corps\u2019 current process, however, has a number of  weaknesses with respect to ensuring no conflicts of interest exist at the  project level. Finally, with peer review generally occurring late in the  Corps\u2019 project study process, peer review serves more to strengthen the  Corps\u2019 presentation of its decisions than to influence its decision making.  This effect runs counter to what NAS recommended in 2002, that  realizing the benefits of peer review requires the results to be used as  inputs in the decision-making process.

As clearly described in  the scope and methodology section of this report, we interviewed officials  who had a corporate-level perspective, as well as those who had a  project-level perspective. Specifically, to obtain a corporate-level view, we  interviewed senior level officials from Corps headquarters, the Institute for  Water Resources, and the planning centers of expertise involved in  managing the peer reviews. In addition, to get a project-level perspective  and to assess the impact of peer review on division and district offices,  we interviewed officials in all of the Corps\u2019 eight divisions, and from 10  geographically dispersed Corps districts that had conducted studies that  underwent peer review. We also interviewed the three contractors and  selected peer review panel members and local sponsors of Corps civil  works projects. We believe that the report provides a balanced  perspective from both the headquarters and field levels.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.

We focused on peer reviews for which reports had been  completed since WRDA 2007 was enacted.", "To address all of these objectives, we reviewed relevant legal  requirements, policy guidance, review plans, and peer review reports for  project studies that were subject to a peer review and for which a peer  review report had been completed since WRDA 2007 was enacted. In  addition, we selected a nongeneralizable sample of six peer reviews to  examine in greater depth to better understand the costs associated with  conducting these reviews, as well as the overall impact of the process on  the timeline of the project study and the study outcome. We chose these  reviews as illustrative examples and selected one from each of the Corps\u2019  planning centers of expertise and at least one for each of the three  contractors the Corps has used to manage peer reviews since enactment  of WRDA 2007. Although the information derived from analysis of these  case studies cannot be generalized, these examples provide valuable  insights into the peer review process. We conducted semistructured  interviews with officials from Corps headquarters, the planning centers of  expertise involved in managing the peer reviews, all of the Corps\u2019 eight  divisions, and from 10 geographically dispersed Corps districts that had  conducted studies that underwent peer review. We also conducted  semistructured interviews with the three contractors, as well as selected  peer review panel members and local sponsors of Corps civil works  projects.", "To determine the number of studies that have undergone peer review in  response to section 2034 of WRDA, we reviewed all completed peer  review reports, plus Corps reports and information on completed peer  reviews. We reviewed information on completed peer reviews obtained  from headquarters, the planning centers of expertise, divisions, and  selected districts. We also reviewed information on completed peer  reviews obtained from the contractors that established the peer review  panels and the entities the Corps used to administer these contracts: the  Institute for Water Resources and the Army Research Office.", "To determine the cost of these reviews, we reviewed contract award  documents and information on contract costs from the contractors.  Generally, we relied on the contract award amounts reported in the  contracts to determine the cost of the contracts awarded for establishing  review panels. For four contract awards, the contract work included  establishing a peer review panel and additional work. For these awards,  we therefore relied on information provided by the contractor on the  portion of the contract cost that was for the peer review. For the contract  award for peer review of a local sponsor-led study, we relied on  information from the local sponsor and the contractor on the cost of the  award. In addition, for the six case study peer reviews, we analyzed  information on costs associated with managing the review process,  including cost data and estimates provided by districts with regard to  district and other staff time involved in peer review. In cases where we  reported cost data including staff time associated with completing peer  review, we asked knowledgeable officials about the data system and the  quality of the data and determined that they were sufficiently reliable for  our purposes. In cases where we reported estimates of these costs, we  asked officials about how these estimates were developed and  determined that they were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To determine the extent to which the Corps\u2019 process for determining if a  study is subject to peer review is consistent with section 2034, we  analyzed the legal requirements and relevant policy guidance for  determining when to conduct peer review. We also reviewed  documentation on decisions to conduct peer review included in review  plans and documents requesting exclusion from peer review. In addition,  we reviewed information on the characteristics of studies that underwent  peer review, including date initiated, whether an environmental impact  statement was included, and the type of study. We identified this  information in review plans, study drafts, signed Chief\u2019s reports, and other  Corps study-related documents; Corps officials from relevant districts or  divisions reviewed this information.", "To determine the process the Corps uses to ensure that the contractors it  hires and the experts the contractors select are independent and free  from conflicts of interest, we reviewed information on contractor selection  obtained from Corps headquarters and the Institute for Water Resources.  We also reviewed documentation from the contractors that outlined  contractor and reviewer qualifications, as well as the National Academy of  Sciences Policy on Committee Composition and Balance and Conflicts of  Interest.", "To determine the extent to which peer review recommendations are  incorporated into project studies, we reviewed information obtained from  headquarters, the planning centers of expertise, divisions, and selected  districts on how the Corps responds to peer review recommendations.  We also reviewed all peer review recommendations contained in  completed peer review reports, as well as all responses to peer review  recommendations contained in the Corps\u2019 published responses to the  completed peer review reports.", "We conducted this performance audit from April 2011 to March 2012 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
