Placed in receivership from 1997 to 2002, the District regained full control of its mental health system in 2002 but has been ordered to implement a courtapproved plan for developing and implementing a community-based mental health system. Additionally, the District must comply with exit criteria, which must be met in order to end the lawsuit. The court expects that it will take the District 3 to 5 years to implement the courtordered plan and begin measuring performance against the exit criteria, with year 1 beginning in July 2001. GAO was asked to report on the current status of the District's efforts to develop and implement (1) a mental health department with the authority to oversee and deliver services, (2) a comprehensive enrollment and billing system that accesses available funds for federal programs such as Medicaid, (3) a consumer-centered approach to services, and (4) methods to measure the District's performance as required by the court's exit criteria."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The District created the Department of Mental Health (DMH) in 2001 to oversee the provision of mental health services. DMH methods of oversight have included establishing certification and making use of licensing standards for participating providers and beginning to monitor provider compliance. DMH also continues to deliver direct services, acting as the primary provider for 55 percent of all consumers enrolled in the mental health system as of October 2003, and operating over 500 beds at St. Elizabeths Hospital, the District-run institution specializing in inpatient care for people with acute, intermediate, and long-term mental health needs. DMH has also implemented a comprehensive enrollment and billing system designed to coordinate clinical, administrative, and financial processes. The system links payment to consumer treatment and increases access to federal funds by providing mental health rehabilitative services through the District's Medicaid program, which reimbursed DMH $17.5 million in federal Medicaid funds in fiscal year 2003. Providers have faced challenges managing cash flow in a fee-for-service system where service demand varies throughout the year. Also, because provider contracts were tied to the feefor- service billing projections, DMH could not pay claims for providers who were exceeding their projections until their contracts were changed, and providers did not always receive timely claims payments in fiscal year 2003. DMH senior officials noted that DMH has a plan in process to prevent this problem from recurring. DMH activities to increase the involvement of consumers in their own treatment and recovery process are evolving. While DMH has established a number of requirements in two key areas--consumer choice and consumer protection--its initial review of providers' records showed gaps in documentation of consumer participation in treatment planning for 41 percent of the records reviewed. Consumer protection policies are also evolving, as DMH instituted a consumer grievance policy that provides a uniform process for ensuring that all consumer grievances are tracked. DMH is developing data collection methods for 17 performance targets aimed at determining the system's performance against the court's exit criteria. Although the court monitor expects DMH to both measure and improve its performance in fiscal years 2004 and 2005, DMH faces major challenges in accurately measuring its performance, including establishing methods to collect electronic data, correcting known data deficiencies, and working with providers to submit accurate data. In its comments on a draft of the report, DMH indicated that the report did not reflect the entire spectrum of progress made since the creation of DMH. While the progress cited by DMH is important, GAO believes that focusing on DMH's status in meeting the exit criteria is an appropriate gauge of its overall compliance with the Dixon Decree."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In 1997, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia found that the  District had failed over the previous 22 years to comply with a 1975 court  determination, known as the Dixon Decree, that District residents with  mental illnesses have a statutory right to community-based treatment  under the least restrictive conditions when that treatment is clinically  appropriate. Consequently, the court placed the District of Columbia  Commission on Mental Health Services in receivership and appointed two  successive receivers, one in 1997 and one in 2000. Both receivers were  charged with implementing the transition from treating consumers in an  institutional setting, specifically in the District-run St. Elizabeths Hospital,  to delivering a broader array of mental health services\u2014including  counseling, supported employment, and housing\u2014in the community. Both  receivers introduced initiatives intended to enhance the District\u2019s  community-based mental health system. In response to congressional  concerns, we previously examined the second receiver\u2019s plan to comply  with the Dixon Decree. In October 2000, we reported that compliance with  the Dixon Decree would require a fundamental shift in the District\u2019s  approach to providing and financing mental health operations, including  (1) assuming the more traditional oversight responsibilities of a mental  health department and (2) increasing access to federal funds for Medicaid,  the joint federal-state program for low-income families and aged, blind,  and disabled people, to expand the scope and number of covered  community-based mental health services. We also reported on challenges  remaining to comply with the Dixon Decree.", "In 2002, the District regained full control of its mental health system from  the second receiver. However, the District remains under court order to  implement a plan and comply with exit criteria for ending the Dixon  lawsuit including meeting specific performance targets. The final plan,  which was completed by the second receiver in 2001, provides an overall  framework for developing and implementing an effective and integrated  community-based system of mental health care for the District of  Columbia. Within this framework, the District is responsible for  establishing certain components, including a new department of mental  health capable of overseeing and delivering mental health services and  developing and implementing a comprehensive enrollment and billing  system for community-based providers. The final plan also highlights the  need for consumers of mental health services to be offered choices from  providers about the services they receive. In December 2003, the court  approved a set of exit criteria, which provides a basis to measure the  District\u2019s performance in a number of areas, such as consumer satisfaction  and system performance. One exit criterion, for example, requires the  District to demonstrate that it is providing continuity of care for  consumers moving from an inpatient to a community-based setting. Until  the exit criteria are fulfilled, the Dixon lawsuit remains open. Overall, the  court expects that it will take the District 3 to 5 years to implement the  court-ordered plan and begin measuring its performance against the exit  criteria, with year 1 beginning in July 2001.", "In keeping with your oversight responsibilities with regard to the District  of Columbia, you asked us to report on the status of the District\u2019s effort to  establish a community-based system of mental health care, particularly the  District\u2019s steps to develop and implement (1) a mental health department  with the authority to oversee\u2014through regulation and monitoring\u2014and  deliver mental health services, (2) a comprehensive enrollment and billing  system that accesses available federal funds, (3) a consumer-centered  approach to services, and (4) methods to measure the District\u2019s  performance as required by the court\u2019s exit criteria.", "To review the District\u2019s actions to implement the final plan, we analyzed  court orders, including the final plan and exit criteria; policies; reports;  and evaluations regarding the District\u2019s implementation of a community- based mental health care system. We interviewed the court monitor, who  was also the second of the two receivers and was charged with monitoring  implementation of the final plan. Additionally, we interviewed District  officials, consumer advocates, and providers. We reviewed available data  on mental health programs and services in operation in the District for  fiscal year 2003, including data on District residents with mental illnesses  who are enrolled consumers of the mental health system. We corroborated  data and information received from the District with available data and  information from the court monitor, providers, and advocates. We  performed our work from July 2003 through March 2004 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In 1974, a class action suit filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of  Columbia on behalf of individuals with mental illnesses alleged that the  practice of treating the District\u2019s mental health patients in an institutional  setting violated the statutory rights of individuals. Specifically, the  plaintiffs asserted that patients at St. Elizabeths Hospital had a statutory  right to appropriate care in alternative care facilities when less restrictive  settings were clinically appropriate. In a ruling known as the Dixon  Decree, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs in 1975, ordered the  District to build a system to facilitate the provision of community-based  treatment for these individuals, and continued oversight of the District\u2019s  progress in developing this system. In 1997, finding that the District was no  closer to complying with the Dixon Decree than it had been 22 years  earlier, the court placed the D.C. Commission on Mental Health Services in  receivership and appointed a receiver to implement the transition to a  community-based mental health system. This receiver introduced  initiatives that sought to change the way the District delivered services,  but implementation was slow and the first receiver made little progress in  implementing these initiatives during his 2-year oversight of the  commission. Thus, a second or \u201ctransitional\u201d receiver was appointed on  April 1, 2000, to facilitate the transition from court receivership to District  control. (App. I summarizes the major court actions related to the Dixon  Decree.)", "The transitional receiver was charged with developing a comprehensive  plan for the District to achieve compliance with the Dixon Decree and  resume full control of its mental health system. The court approved a final  plan in April 2001 and required the District to implement it; however,  before the receivership could be ended, the court required the transitional  receiver to certify that the District had the capacity to implement\u2014and  was implementing\u2014the final plan. Although the court originally  anticipated this certification in late 2001, in December 2001 the  transitional receiver recommended extending the date, characterizing the  implementation delay as largely unavoidable because of (1) additional  time needed for recently hired senior DMH managers to begin major  initiatives, and (2) the unexpected need for crisis services to respond to  September 11, 2001, terrorist events. Following this extension, the  transitional receiver reported to the court that the District had made  sufficient progress and, as a result, the court terminated the receivership  and appointed the former transitional receiver as a court monitor to  oversee the District\u2019s continued implementation of the final plan in May  2002. (See table 1.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "District Mental Health System Prior to the Approval of the Final Plan", "paragraphs": ["When the transitional receiver was responsible for overseeing the  District\u2019s mental health system, the District was the largest provider of  mental health services to its residents, treating approximately 10,000  consumers annually and employing close to 2,000 staff in fiscal year 2000.  The focal point of the mental health system was St. Elizabeths Hospital,  which was the major point of entry for all consumers in the system. St.  Elizabeths Hospital provided a wide range of mental health services in an  acute care setting, including more than 600 beds divided among two types  of inpatient consumers, forensic and civil, for adults and children and  youth. The District also directly provided services through outpatient  facilities in the community, including two community mental health  centers and five mobile community outreach treatment teams.", "In addition to providing inpatient and direct services in the community,  the District contracted with private community providers for housing,  employment, case management, and other community-based services. In  its contracts with private community providers, the District often used a  \u201cslot\u201d system to allocate a defined number of consumers to providers and  paid them a fixed daily rate per consumer. Under this system, providers  did not compete to attract consumers and were paid regardless of  performance, consumer satisfaction, or the actual delivery of service.", "The District and its providers focused primarily on treating the medical  symptoms of the consumer without focusing as much on whether the  individual was participating in his or her recovery from mental illness and  successfully living in the community. Furthermore, the system did not  have many safeguards in place, such as uniform provider standards, to  involve the consumer in key aspects of service delivery, such as choosing  a provider and developing a treatment plan based on the consumer\u2019s goals.  The transitional receiver identified the need for a restructured mental  health system that had the flexibility to meet individual needs and allow  consumers to successfully obtain treatment and live in the community,  maximizing principles of accessibility, recovery, and consumer choice.", "In 2001, the federal share of Medicaid, an entitlement program in which  states and the federal government are obligated to pay for covered  services provided to an eligible individual, accounted for 8 percent of  District mental health system revenue as compared to the national average  of 22 percent. The transitional receiver identified the need to better  utilize Medicaid as a major funding source. The District\u2019s access to  Medicaid funds had been limited because Medicaid did not cover most of  the services provided at St. Elizabeths Hospital, considered under the  Medicaid statute as a larger psychiatric institution. This effect was  exacerbated by the limited capacity in the developing community-based  system to support inpatients ready for discharge. For example, in October  2000, District officials estimated that approximately 60 percent of  individuals in acute care units at St. Elizabeths Hospital could be moved  into the community where outpatient services covered by Medicaid would  be available, if stable alternative housing were available.", "A second limit to the District\u2019s accessing federal funds was that the  District had not taken advantage of optional community-based mental  health services that could be reimbursed through the Medicaid program.  The transitional receiver required the District to implement a strategy  adopted by at least 40 other states to expand the services reimbursable by  Medicaid through an option to cover rehabilitative services, thus  expanding the scope of eligible services and providers beyond that of the  program\u2019s traditional focus on services delivered by physicians and  psychiatrists who work at hospitals, clinics, and other facilities.  Rehabilitative services include crisis and emergency care, medication  treatment, and community-based interventions. The variety of  rehabilitative treatments and services covered by this Medicaid option is  intended to facilitate a consumer\u2019s recovery from mental illness, including  restoring a consumer to his or her best possible functional level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Final Plan and Exit Criteria", "paragraphs": ["The court-approved final plan broadly outlines the mental health system\u2019s  direction, philosophy, major roles, and governance. It represents a major  shift in the District\u2019s mental health system on several fronts, including the  system\u2019s structure and organization, method for enrolling consumers and  paying providers, and involvement of consumers in their plan for recovery.  For example, the final plan  identifies the need to create a new mental health department with the  additional responsibility of oversight along with continuing the District\u2019s  historic role as provider;    envisions a significant change in enrollment and billing systems, such as  linking payment to the delivery of services, and developing new funding  strategies that increase federal reimbursement; and    articulates that the new system have a built-in capacity to measure itself in  key performance areas and to translate any findings into continued system  improvements.", "Underpinning these structural changes is a refocusing of the mission of the  District\u2019s mental health system toward involving the consumer in  treatment decisions and incorporating changes that facilitate the  consumer\u2019s recovery from mental illness and away from focusing primarily  on treating the individual\u2019s medical symptoms.", "The court also approved exit criteria for the Dixon lawsuit, which provide  a basis for measuring the performance of the District\u2019s mental health  system and which must be met in order to end the Dixon case. The criteria  cover four areas:  1.  consumer satisfaction, which assesses consumers\u2019 satisfaction with  mental health services provided;  2.  consumer functioning, which tracks consumers\u2019 clinical, social, and  other conditions upon entry into the mental health system and again  after receiving services for a specified period of time;  3.  consumer service delivery, which assesses the adequacy of the mental  health system\u2019s overall performance for consumers in a range of areas  including treatment planning, coordination of care, and response to  emergent and urgent needs; and  4.  system performance, which demonstrates how well the community- based system of care is serving particular populations.", "The first two areas require DMH to develop and implement methods for  reviewing and measuring consumer satisfaction and consumer functioning  and to use the data to refine the system. To fulfill the remaining criteria,  DMH is required to meet 17 performance targets, many of which measure  activities identified as national best practices in the field of mental health.", "According to the court monitor, implementing the final plan, including  developing the ability to measure DMH\u2019s progress against the exit criteria,  will take 3 to 5 years, with year 1 beginning July 1, 2001. In general,  efforts for years 1 and 2 were expected to center on planning, laying the  basic infrastructure for the system, and beginning to provide community- based services. By the end of year 3, which began October 1, 2003, DMH is  expected to be stabilizing and improving performance within the system,  and in years 4 and 5 DMH is expected to be actively measuring  performance outcomes. (See table 2.) In addition to developing  performance targets for the exit criteria, the court monitor is required to  provide the court with semiannual reports on the District\u2019s progress in  meeting all of the exit criteria. The court monitor\u2019s first two reports,  submitted to the court in January 2003 and July 2003, respectively, focused  primarily on DMH\u2019s status in implementing the final plan and also included  an update on the status of meeting the exit criteria to end the Dixon case."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DMH Has Assumed Oversight Authority and Responsibility for Providing Direct Care", "paragraphs": ["In accord with the transitional receiver\u2019s final plan, the District  restructured its mental health system by creating DMH to oversee the  provision of mental health services, including the authority to set  regulations and monitor compliance\u2014a shift away from the structure of its  predecessor office, which was primarily a provider of services. Under this  structure, DMH also continues the District\u2019s historic role as a provider of  mental health services. In its oversight role, DMH has developed  certification standards and made use of licensing standards to enroll a  network of providers to deliver an array of mental health services, which  DMH continues to expand to ensure adequate capacity for community- based mental health services.

The significant organizational change  accompanying the addition of oversight responsibilities required hiring  new leadership and redeploying and retraining a large portion of existing  staff. For example, of DMH\u2019s 270 administrative and oversight staff  positions, which represent approximately 14 percent of all budgeted staff  for fiscal year 2003, the majority of positions were new and required either  redeployment of existing staff or hiring new staff. Consistent with the final  plan, DMH established a training institute to provide staff training and  development, among other services. As of December 2001, a court report  indicated that key leadership positions had been filled, including that of  the director of DMH, who was hired by the mayor in April 2001.  Subsequently, however, one key leadership position, DMH\u2019s chief financial  officer, experienced turnover, with four individuals serving in the role  since April 2001. DMH has also hired two chief executive officers with  experience in other systems undergoing reform, to run its community- based services agency and St. Elizabeths Hospital, respectively. (See table  3 for a summary of DMH\u2019s functional responsibilities, including oversight,  by office.)", "DMH became the primary entity for overseeing a mental health system  that is focused on community-based systems of care. (See table 4.) DMH\u2019s  regulatory responsibilities include developing standards and certifying  providers of services, such as rehabilitative services and supported  housing at independent living facilities, and licensing community  residential facilities. As of January 2004, DMH had certified 22 mental  health rehabilitative services providers, licensed more than 148  community residential facilities, and was in the process of implementing a  certification program to oversee more than 400 supported independent  living facilities. DMH addressed rehabilitative services standards by  developing and publishing specific provider certification standards that  took effect on November 9, 2001.", "In addition to its regulatory responsibilities, DMH must monitor providers\u2019  compliance with existing and newly developed quality and safety  standards. DMH\u2019s oversight division, the Office of Accountability, has  direct responsibility for monitoring compliance with standards. DMH has  developed a monitoring framework that is in the early stages of  implementation, with DMH beginning to use information from some  monitoring efforts to assess provider compliance and continuing to adjust  other efforts. The following are examples of DMH monitoring efforts:    Safety inspections, which are surveys of the sites where licensed providers  offer services, are used to ensure health and safety standards are met. In  the first 11 months of 2003, DMH conducted at least 150 inspections of 148  eligible facilities. When DMH conducts site inspections, it can issue  notices of infractions for violations of the standards. According to DMH,  from April 2002 through January 2004, it issued 46 notices to 22 providers  and issued more than $29,000 in fines for identified deficiencies, including  items such as insufficient staff on duty, failure to report unusual incidents,  inaccurate personnel records, and exceeding maximum capacity.  Increasing the number of site inspections of facilities that serve DMH  consumers is one of the goals included in the DMH annual \u201cscorecard\u201d  submitted to the District Mayor\u2019s office, which tracks commitments and  deadlines set for DMH.", "Provider audits, which are record reviews of certified rehabilitative  services providers, are used to analyze trends across providers and to  ensure that providers are meeting documentation and service standards. In  January 2003, DMH completed its first round of audits for the 12 providers  certified at that time. As expected by DMH for the first year of applying  standards, the audit found that providers were not in compliance with  certain documentation requirements, such as having the approving  practitioner sign the authorized treatment plan, and, as a result, all 12  providers were to implement corrective action plans. While these initial  audits focused solely on provider documentation compliance, the second  round of audits of all certified providers, which DMH expects to complete  in early 2004, will examine how well specific services (such as medication  treatment) are being provided.", "Routine, biennial recertification reviews for rehabilitative services  providers, which include evaluations of recorded complaints, audits, and  public comment, are used to ensure that individual providers are  complying with certification standards. With the first round of  recertification applications, begun in December 2003, DMH will be able to  use data from these reviews to make decisions regarding providers\u2019  recertifications.  Investigations of unusual incidents, which are conducted by the Office of  Accountability and providers, are used to ensure consumer safety and  reduce the occurrence of future incidents. DMH is expected to  investigate any major unusual incident, such as consumer deaths, adverse  drug reactions, and allegations of abuse or neglect. Providers are expected  to investigate other, less serious incidents, defined as any events that  occur outside the normal routine of care, and they are required to report  to DMH all unusual incidents and action taken to respond to them.  Unusual incidents, which vary widely in severity, were reported 1,259  times in calendar year 2003, including 336 reports of major unusual  incidents. Of the 1,259 unusual incidents reported for 2003, DMH resolved  528 cases, including 161 major unusual incident cases. The remaining 731  cases usually required additional information from providers or other  District agency investigators before DMH could take action.

While neither the final plan nor the exit criteria for  the Dixon Decree specify goals for the reduction in the bed census at St.  Elizabeths Hospital as a condition of ending the Dixon case, the exit  criteria specify that 60 percent of DMH\u2019s annual expenditures must be  directed to community-based services. In DMH\u2019s 2004 proposed budget, 41  percent of funds, approximately $80 million, are allocated for community- based providers and 42 percent, approximately $81 million, are allocated  for St. Elizabeths Hospital.

In July 2003, the court monitor  reported that the current model of continued reliance on St. Elizabeths  Hospital was not financially viable, did not promote the concept of  community-integrated care, and was not in compliance with the court- ordered plan. However, DMH stated that the hospital\u2019s budget cannot be  reduced without an additional decrease in the number of occupied beds.  The chief executive officer of St. Elizabeths Hospital said that the census  would not decrease until the community can support patients upon  discharge, including providing access to affordable housing.

When enrolling in the system,  the consumer chooses a CSA as a clinical home based on a number of  preferences such as location and treatment specialties. (See fig. 1.) After  choosing the CSA, a consumer meets with a clinical manager to develop a  treatment plan, which includes objectives and a plan of services, called an  individualized recovery plan for adults and an individualized plan of care  for children and youth. Once a clinical manager and a consumer develop a  treatment plan, it is submitted by the CSA to DMH for authorization.

(See table 5.) Approval of the  option increased both the number and scope of mental health services  reimbursable by Medicaid. Under the option, DMH certifies and contracts  with community providers to deliver covered services. DMH pays  providers for any DMH-authorized service and, on behalf of contracted  providers, files claims with the District Medicaid office for reimbursement  of the federal share of the cost of Medicaid-covered services. Thus, there is  no relationship between the District Medicaid office and the local  providers for these services, nor is payment to providers contingent upon  reimbursement by Medicaid. Other District community-based service  providers that do not contract with DMH bill the District Medicaid office  directly for their services.", "DMH built mechanisms into the enrollment and billing processes to help  providers and DMH work together to obtain Medicaid reimbursement.  Access Helpline counselors work with providers to identify consumers  who are eligible and enrolled in the Medicaid program using eligibility data  from the District Medicaid office. Before transmitting Medicaid- reimbursable claims to the District\u2019s Medicaid office, DMH checks each  claim to ensure that the consumer is currently enrolled in Medicaid, that  the provider is eligible, and that the covered service has been paid by  DMH. Upon submittal for reimbursement to the District\u2019s Medicaid office,  DMH tracks the status of claims, receiving reports that detail the claims  paid, waiting to be paid, and denied payment. The report also provides  reasons that claims were denied.", "DMH is improving its overall enrollment and billing system to decrease the  time providers spend on administration and to increase the time they  spend serving consumers. For example, in October 2003, DMH changed a  component of the billing system that delayed providers from offering  services. The system had required providers to electronically update  treatment plans every 90 days. To reinforce this requirement, the  information system prevented the provider from entering any other  consumer data, such as claims data for a service provided, until the plan  was updated. DMH realized that requiring providers to do this was  burdensome and prevented them from serving consumers. As a result,  DMH removed the requirement to update the treatment plan from the  electronic billing system and is monitoring compliance with the 90-day  requirement through an alternative mechanism.", "DMH projects that as the enrollment and billing system improves and the  provision of community-based services continues to expand, mental health  rehabilitative services will eventually generate approximately $36 million  to $38 million annually in federal Medicaid funds. As of November 2003,  the District\u2019s Medicaid office had reimbursed DMH $17.5 million for fiscal  year 2003\u2014over 50 percent of the amount DMH paid to providers for  rehabilitative services. As one condition of ending the Dixon case, federal  Medicaid funds must cover at least 49 percent of all mental health  rehabilitative services provided.

In addition, consultants funded by DMH can  work with providers on developing sound business practices, including  cash flow analysis, budgeting in an FFS environment, staff assignments  and productivity, record keeping, and billing.", "Even with assistance, providers experienced challenges since beginning to  bill DMH on an FFS basis. Two providers reported that there are  considerable investments of time and money necessary to be certified as a  CSA. According to one provider, the new system requires more \u201cbusiness  savvy\u201d and planning by providers for revenue peaks and valleys because  providers are no longer guaranteed revenue regardless of the level of  services provided. Thus, as stated by the same provider, they must plan  ahead to ensure they can meet payroll in months like December and  February, when fewer consumers seek services because of holidays and  winter weather.", "Problems managing cash flow were exacerbated because provider  contracts with DMH were tied to the billing projections, which meant that  DMH could not pay claims for providers who exceeded their projections  until their contracts were changed. The Mental Health Coalition, whose  members are primarily DMH-certified providers, wrote to DMH several  times in fiscal year 2003 listing a number of concerns with the billing  process, and its primary concern was the lack of timely payment on a  consistent basis. By August 2003, DMH made the necessary contract  changes to allow providers to be paid for the remainder of the fiscal year  and, according to senior officials, had a plan in process for fiscal year 2004  to prevent this problem from recurring. DMH provided data showing that  in fiscal year 2003 it adjudicated\u2014that is, made a decision to pay or  deny\u201479 percent of submitted claims within 30 days; however, after  adjudication, the District of Columbia Treasury must then pay the  approved claims, which, according to DMH, took an average of 15  additional days.

With regard to consumer choice, DMH  has requirements in place to ensure that consumers participate in the  selection and receipt of services. However, DMH\u2019s initial review of  rehabilitative services provider records showed gaps in documentation of  consumer participation, such as a lack of documentation of the  consumers\u2019 participation in\u2014and agreement with\u2014their treatment plans  for 41 percent of the records reviewed. DMH is addressing these gaps with  providers to ensure that their practices comply with these requirements  and adequately involve consumers in their treatment.

As part of the  enrollment process, both the CSA and the Access Helpline are required to  present consumers with the option to select any DMH-certified CSA to  serve as the clinical home, a choice typically made based on their  preferences, such as location and treatment specialties provided. Every  CSA that serves as a consumer\u2019s clinical home is required by DMH\u2019s  certification standards to have a policy in place to inform consumers  about these and other choices available to them. For example, each CSA\u2019s  consumer choice policy must also inform consumers about the availability  of peer and family support services\u2014such as transportation, education,  nutrition services, and recreation activities\u2014as well as how to access the  services. DMH\u2019s certification standards also require CSAs to coordinate  the treatment planning process for their consumers and to document  consumer participation. For example, CSAs are required to develop a  diagnostic assessment and treatment plan for each consumer that follows  the consumer throughout the service delivery and reimbursement systems.  Each CSA acting as a clinical home is required to obtain a consumer\u2019s  written consent to treatment as well as provide all consumers with a  statement outlining their rights and responsibilities during the enrollment  and treatment process.", "To assist consumers in obtaining mental health services, the Director of  DMH\u2019s Office of Consumer and Family Affairs (OCFA) told us that DMH  employs 15 to 20 mental health consumers as enrollment specialists who  are available to other consumers as a resource in making these choices.  DMH also offers training, some of which is conducted by other mental  health consumers, that is available to consumers and their families on  selecting providers and planning treatment. In addition, DMH\u2019s enrollment  handbook for new consumers summarizes aspects relating to the  enrollment process, such as the types of mental health services available,  range of consumer choices, and activities a consumer can expect during  enrollment. Intended for use in the second quarter of 2004, DMH is  developing a provider report card that contains specific information about  each rehabilitative services provider to better facilitate consumer choice.  For example, the provider report card will give providers a numerical  score in areas, such as consumer access, billing and claims, and consumer  complaints, that would enhance the consumers\u2019 basis for selecting a  provider. Finally, OCFA is also responsible for overseeing the  development and implementation of the consumer satisfaction review  required in the Dixon exit criteria, an initiative that DMH envisions as  expanding the role of consumers in measuring the quality of services they  receive in the District\u2019s mental health system.", "The court monitor and District mental health advocates have highlighted  areas relating to consumer choice that need attention and that are  consistent with DMH\u2019s plans for additional development. In a January 2003  report to the court, the court monitor recommended that DMH develop a  system for tracking consumer choice to help determine whether choices  truly are available. The Director of OCFA told us that DMH would begin  addressing this issue by identifying concerns relating to choice through  consumer focus groups planned for each CSA in 2004. In addition,  University Legal Services, the designated protection and advocacy  program for the District, told us that consumers do not have enough  information about how to access providers in the mental health system,  and therefore it has published its own consumer rights manual. For  example, an official with this organization told us that District consumers  often do not have a choice among the full range of providers because  many CSAs have limited capacity and have had to develop waiting lists.  University Legal Services also cited a delay for consumers in receiving  community-based services who are discharged from St. Elizabeths  Hospital. While DMH is not required to report current baseline data  regarding the receipt of community-based services for consumers  following a hospital discharge, one condition for ending the Dixon case  will be to demonstrate that 80 percent of known discharged inpatients  receive services in a non-emergency, community-based setting within 7  days of a hospital discharge.", "DMH\u2019s initial audits of documentation practices of each of its certified  rehabilitative services providers showed gaps in documentation of  consumer participation in development of their treatment plans. Of the 740  unique consumer records DMH reviewed in its audit completed in January  2003, 38 percent did not have a consumer\u2019s signature on the treatment plan  and 41 percent did not document the consumer\u2019s participation in and  agreement with the treatment plan. Each of the 12 providers reviewed by  DMH was asked to develop a self-audit program and implement staff  training to address areas of deficiency in the audits, which, according to  DMH, were to be expected in the first year of applying provider standards.  Concerns raised by other stakeholders were consistent with the results of  DMH\u2019s audits of provider documentation practices. For example, in a July  2003 letter to DMH, University Legal Services noted systemic problems  with treatment plans relating to consumer participation and accuracy,  such as being unsigned, lacking consumer preferences, and failing to  reflect consumer medical needs.

For example, the DMH policy published  in October 2003 required providers to review, investigate, and respond  within 5 business days to grievances alleging abuse or neglect or denial of  a service. While consumers can continue to file grievances with CSAs or  DMH, the new policy also specifically outlines the conditions under which  consumers can request an external review of a grievance that can result in  a fact-finding hearing or mediation process. The new policy also requires  DMH to facilitate and fund peer advocacy programs that are independent  of providers to assist consumers throughout the grievance process.

The qualitative requirements address two of the exit criteria  measures\u2014consumer functioning and consumer satisfaction. For these  two measures, DMH is required to develop and implement consumer  satisfaction and functioning review methods and begin using the data  obtained by these methods to make refinements to service delivery. DMH  has contracted with a consumer organization to build a consumer  satisfaction initiative patterned after model programs around the country.

In  addition, DMH officials told us that they are testing the effectiveness of a  tool for assessing consumer functioning. According to the court monitor,  DMH will provide a progress report in early 2004 on the status of these two  reviews, but is not likely to submit the methodologies to the court  monitor\u2014which is required to comply with the exit criteria\u2014for several  more months.", "The court also approved 17 exit criteria measures, each with a specific  performance target.

Once DMH meets these targets for the specified time  frame, the court monitor ends active monitoring of the measure. However,  according to the court order, DMH is required to continue to submit data  to the court monitor for all exit criteria measures regardless of their  monitoring status, giving the court the ability to require that DMH meet the  performance targets for any exit criteria measure showing a substantial  drop in performance.

Although  DMH began to collect data in July 2003 for some of the exit criteria  measures based on the earlier methodologies approved by the court in  May 2002, DMH officials told us in November 2003 that this data collection  was preliminary and that they would not begin to develop a specific plan  for meeting these three requirements until the court approved the final  performance targets, which occurred in December 2003.", "Satisfying the court regarding DMH\u2019s demonstration of specific methods  for collecting and verifying the accuracy of the performance data is likely  to be challenging because of impediments to data collection as well as the  fact that collected data may be incomplete or inaccurate. DMH and its  providers face three major obstacles in collecting accurate data used to  meet the actual performance targets: (1) establishing methods to collect  electronic data, (2) correcting known data deficiencies, and (3) ensuring  the accuracy of information collected and reported by providers.

For example, mental health rehabilitative services providers  submit nonelectronic monthly reports to DMH on services provided to  homeless consumers who are diagnosed with a serious mental illness.  However, because the court approved revisions to some of the exit criteria  measures in December 2003, providers will have to refine some of the  information that they collect and report to DMH.

Beyond this,  a related issue will be developing the capacity to appropriately factor in  other data currently collected by DMH in a way that is not duplicative of  the monthly data submitted by mental health rehabilitative services  providers. For example, officials told us that DMH\u2019s school-based services  program collects information that could be used as part of the calculation  to meet the performance target requiring 75 percent of children and youth  with serious emotional disturbances to receive services in a natural setting  such as the home or school.

The court monitor\u2019s  semiannual reports to the court have similarly highlighted these findings  as areas requiring action. First, the review showed that many of the  children and youth placed in residential treatment centers (RTC) do not  have a clinical home at a CSA as intended and thus are not receiving DMH  services. In addition to raising concerns about the coordination between  DMH and RTCs, the lack of services for these individuals could also affect  the accuracy of the data collected by DMH to meet a performance target  that requires DMH to demonstrate that 85 percent of children and youth  with serious emotional disturbances served by the system are living in  their own or surrogate homes. Second, according to the court monitor,  the consumer services review also revealed a significant gap between the  number of children and youth enrolled in DMH\u2019s system and the number  who are actually receiving services. The court monitor\u2019s report  acknowledged that the source of this gap, while unknown, could reflect  flaws in DMH\u2019s data management system, its disenrollment policy, or  clinical standards, such as required follow-up with consumers who have  missed an appointment. Since the four penetration rate performance  targets are calculated using the number of enrolled consumers who  received at least one service in the past quarter, DMH will need to  determine the cause of this gap to ensure that its performance data are  accurate.

However, as of  November 2003, neither the mental health rehabilitative services providers  nor the local hospitals were required to track this information, and DMH  did not have processes in place for verifying the accuracy of these data.  DMH\u2019s Director told us in December 2003 that DMH is planning to  incorporate reporting requirements as part of the recertification process  for mental health rehabilitative services providers. As of January 2004,  DMH was planning to collect quarterly discharge data from local hospitals  but was still working out the details. Until these reporting processes are  put in place, DMH will continue to collect discharge data from a  combination of St. Elizabeths Hospital (for adults) and mental health  rehabilitative services providers (for children and youth). Even after  hospital reporting processes are implemented, the court monitor and DMH  expect some difficulties in collecting comprehensive discharge data. For  example, a DMH consumer may seek care in a local hospital that does not  typically serve DMH consumers and thus does not provide quarterly data  to DMH. Recognizing potential challenges in collecting data from local  hospitals, the court monitor proposed\u2014and the court approved\u2014as one of  the 17 performance targets, a continuity of care performance target that  allows DMH to limit its measurement against this exit criteria measure to  \u201cknown\u201d inpatient hospital discharges.

The potential lack of accurate data\u2014for example,  from local hospitals\u2014may mean that some discharged individuals are not  factored into the data used to measure performance. In addition, the lack  of consumer-specific data collected by DMH to meet the performance  targets will also be a challenge. For example, because mental health  rehabilitative services providers do not submit the names of each  homeless consumer served, just the total number of these individuals  served, information submitted is not consumer-specific and thus may be  duplicative, compromising the accuracy of the measurement.

In addition, the court ordered  that the case would be dismissed when (1) the court monitor affirms that the District has complied with all of the  performance targets and qualitative requirements and the court accepts that finding; or (2) the District moves for dismissal  and demonstrates \u201csubstantial\u201d compliance with the performance targets and qualitative requirements and the court  determines the case should be dismissed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix II: Comments from the District of Columbia Department of Mental Health and GAO\u2019s Response", "paragraphs": ["The following is our response to DMH\u2019s letter dated March 18, 2004."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Response to DMH\u2019s Comments", "paragraphs": ["Our responses below correspond to the comments numbered in the  margin of DMH\u2019s letter.  1.  DMH commented that the draft report references only a portion of the  requirements of the Mental Health Reform Act and the court-ordered  plan and does not discuss the development of \u201csystems of care,\u201d which  it characterizes as cornerstones of the court-ordered plan and the  legislation creating DMH. We believe that the report adequately  characterized the immensity of the tasks faced by DMH. The scope of  this report encompassed the actions taken by DMH since its creation  to comply with the Dixon Decree. As such, we reported on the status  of the District\u2019s effort to establish a community-based system of  mental health care, with a focus on four key areas of reform that were  confirmed by the court monitor to be central to compliance with the  Dixon Decree. Because many of the services and initiatives under way  were still evolving and had incomplete data at the time of our work, we  did not believe that a comprehensive assessment of DMH\u2019s progress on  all activities was appropriate. As a result, we focused on the data  collection methods for the 17 performance targets relating to the  District\u2019s compliance with the court\u2019s exit criteria.  2.  We modified the report where appropriate to address information  about the additional consumer protections, the number of supportive  housing arrangements, the relocation of acute care beds, the hiring of  senior managers, the status of leadership positions at DMH, the  increases in service provision at the public CSA, the difficulty of  adding new psychiatric services in local hospitals, and the results of  provider audits.  3.  DMH stated that the draft report did not accurately portray payments  made to providers in fiscal year 2003 and that our findings on slow  payments to providers could not be substantiated. We modified the  report to reflect the updated data on billings for fiscal year 2003.  However, we disagree that payment problems could not be  substantiated. Provider contracts with DMH were tied to the billing  projections, which meant that DMH could not pay claims for providers  who exceeded their projections until their contracts were changed.  The court monitor\u2019s 2003 reports also indicate that claims payment has  been an area of concern. Our draft report acknowledged that DMH had  made the necessary contract changes to allow providers to be paid for  the remainder of fiscal year 2003. Additionally, we cited DMH\u2019s plan  for fiscal year 2004, which aimed to prevent similar billing problems  from occurring.  4.  With regard to our assessment of DMH\u2019s status in meeting court  expectations, DMH commented that it believes table 2 reflects our  assumption that DMH has not begun work on meeting the 15 system  performance targets or begun using consumer functioning and  consumer satisfaction data. DMH stated that it has not reported on  these steps but has initiatives under way to meet each one and  therefore the table should reflect that the \u201cstep has been started.\u201d As of  March 2004, the court monitor had not received evidence that these  steps were in process, but confirmed that DMH had conducted  preliminary work that had not been captured in court documents.  Thus, we modified the report to reflect that these steps were \u201cin  planning.\u201d In addition, the report refers to the work under way to meet  the exit criteria, such as the consumer telephone survey conducted in  2003 to help DMH develop its consumer satisfaction review and data  collection efforts from providers for some of the exit criteria  measures.  5.  DMH commented that the draft report did not indicate that there were  no standards for provider audits, that provider audits had never been  conducted, and that DMH expected that providers would not be in  compliance. The draft report stated that DMH\u2019s new responsibilities  for regulating and monitoring providers, including conducting audits,  were a shift away from the structure of its predecessor office and that  the monitoring framework was in the early stages of implementation.  We revised the report to reflect DMH\u2019s expectation that providers  would not be in compliance with the new standards.  6.  With regard to the draft report\u2019s discussion of unusual incidents, DMH  noted that the District\u2019s mental health system had never experienced a  review of unusual incidents and stated that unusual incidents ranged in  severity from consumers returning late for dinner to injury and abuse.  DMH also stated that it is faced with thousands of unusual incidents  and said that it sorts through incidents quickly and is beginning to  identify trends. We modified the report to reflect the range of severity  of unusual incidents.  7.  DMH commented that the report\u2019s subheading, \u201cEnrollment and Billing  System Is Designed to Coordinate Clinical, Administrative, and  Financial Processes\u201d represents a significant misapprehension. DMH  stated that the enrollment and billing systems are not the major  functions in the design of the clinical, administrative, and financial  processes. DMH characterized the billing system as an administrative  function that helped with the transition from a grants-based system of  delivering services to a performance-focused fee-for-service (FFS)  system. We believe that the enrollment and billing system is an  important design component. For example, the final court-ordered  plan outlines that a comprehensive enrollment and billing system that  links payment to treatment is necessary to access federal Medicaid  revenue through the mental health rehabilitation services option,  which was identified in our October 2000 report and in the final plan as  a key component for reforming the District\u2019s mental health system.  Further, DMH\u2019s enrollment and billing information system is used to  enroll consumers, reimburse providers, and, according to DMH  officials, may eventually be the primary mechanism for collecting the  performance data required to meet the Dixon exit criteria.  8.  Regarding our findings on consumer choice and community follow-up  after a consumer\u2019s discharge from the hospital, DMH stated that  comments from the court monitor and the local Protection and  Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness (PAIMI) agency  (University Legal Services), were not quantified and that the report  provides no other basis upon which to assess their reliability. As of  January 2004, DMH was in the process of developing methods to track  consumer choice and had not reported data to the court on community  follow-up after discharge from the hospital. Absent that data, we relied  on the court monitor\u2019s judgments regarding DMH\u2019s progress in  implementing the court-approved plan. Additionally, the District  mental health advocates with whom we spoke are part of the federally- mandated protection and advocacy system.  9.  DMH commented that our findings on DMH\u2019s capability to measure  performance against the exit criteria (1) presented an incomplete  account of events leading to the development of the performance  targets and (2) missed critical factors for why baseline data were not  included in the exit criteria requirements, specifically, that having a  baseline would be impossible because services did not exist before  DMH became a department and there was no basis for comparison  with other jurisdictions. In response to DMH\u2019s first concern, we  revised the report to clarify that the court monitor did not act alone to  develop the targets for measuring performance against the exit  criteria. Regarding the second concern, the draft report stated that  baseline data were omitted because historical data are generally  incomplete and many of the performance targets require the collection  of new information from DMH and its providers. We modified the  report to reflect that DMH was unable to identify comparable baselines  from other jurisdictions.  10.  With regard to our findings on data collection and integrity, DMH  commented that the draft report did not take into account the  developmental stage of the data collection process. DMH noted that  some of the performance criteria do not lend themselves to electronic  data collection, gaps in service utilization data for children and youth  placed in residential treatment centers must be viewed in the context  that five city departments carry out placements, and the draft report\u2019s  statement that there is a gap between the number of children and  youth enrolled and the number receiving services lacks quantitative  support. We modified the draft to reflect that the two performance  measures related to homeless consumers do not lend themselves to  electronic data collection, which was confirmed by the court monitor,  and that addressing the gap in service utilization data requires  coordination with other District agencies that typically have their own  tracking systems. The draft report stated that according to the court  monitor, the first consumer services review for children and youth  revealed a gap between the number of children and youth enrolled and  the number receiving services. DMH did not provide us with the  number of children and youth enrolled and receiving services. In the  absence of that data, we relied on the court monitor\u2019s report, which  cited the gap identified by the consumer services review."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["Major contributors included Susan Barnidge, Laura Sutton Elsberg, Kevin  Milne, and Elizabeth T.
