Factors such as over-harvesting, construction and operation of dams, degradation of spawning habitat, increased human population, and unfavorable weather and ocean conditions have contributed to the long-term decline. The population decline has resulted in the listing of 12 salmon and steelhead populations in the basin as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act.

Eleven federal agencies are involved with salmon and steelhead recovery efforts in the Columbia River Basin. The National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), as the lead agency, is responsible for preparing a recovery plan and consulting with the other federal agencies on their planned actions. The 11 federal agencies estimate expenditures of $1.8 billion from fiscal year 1982 through fiscal year 1996 and $1.5 billion from fiscal year 1997 through fiscal year 2001 on efforts specifically designed to recover Columbia River Basin salmon and steelhead. In addition to the $1.5 billion, the 11 federal agencies estimated that they expended $302 million in the last five fiscal years on modifications to mission-related projects that benefited, but were not specifically directed at, salmon and steelhead, such as erosion control to improve crop productivity and wildlife habitat, which also improves stream flows and reduces sedimentation in spawning habitat. Although federal agencies have undertaken many types of recovery actions, there is little conclusive evidence to quantify the extent of their efforts on returning fish populations. Recovery actions taken include projects, such as constructing fish passage facilities at dams; research studies, such as determining the presence or absence of toxic substances that cause diseases in fish; monitoring actions, such as surveying spawning grounds; and other activities, such as consultations required by the act."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Columbia River Basin salmon and steelhead populations were once the  world\u2019s largest.

Various factors have contributed to the long-term  decline including over-harvesting, the construction and operation of dams,  the degradation of spawning habitat, increased human population, and  unfavorable weather and ocean conditions.  The population decline has  resulted in the listing of 12 salmon and steelhead populations in the basin  as threatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act (ESA).

The recovery of a species entails the development and implementation of a  plan for the species\u2019 conservation and survival.  The ESA also requires  other federal agencies to consult with NMFS before they take any action  that may jeopardize the continued existence of listed salmon or steelhead  populations in the Columbia River Basin.", "You asked us to (1) identify the roles and responsibilities of the federal  agencies involved with the recovery of Columbia River Basin salmon and  steelhead, (2) determine how much they have spent collectively on  recovery efforts, and (3) determine what recovery actions they have  undertaken and what they have accomplished.  In conducting our work,  agency officials and others brought to our attention two issues that may  affect the recovery effort: the development of a strategic recovery plan to  direct overall recovery efforts along with annual performance plans to  implement the strategic plan, and the development of a system to track  ESA consultations to ensure that recovery projects are not unnecessarily  delayed by the consultation process.   A discussion of these issues is  presented in appendix I.  Appendix II provides details on the scope and  methodology we employed in this review."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Columbia River Basin is North America\u2019s fourth largest, draining about  258,000 square miles and extending predominantly through the states of  Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana and into Canada. (See fig. 1.)  It  contains over 250 reservoirs and about 150 hydroelectric projects,  including 18 dams on the Columbia River and its primary tributary, the  Snake River.  The Columbia River Basin provides habitat for many species  including steelhead and four species of salmon:  Chinook, Chum, Coho, and  Sockeye.", "One of the most prominent features of the Columbia River Basin is its  population of anadromous fish, such as salmon and steelhead, which are  born in freshwater streams, live there for 1 to 2 years, migrate to the ocean  to mature for 2 to 5 years, and then return to the freshwater streams to  spawn.  (See fig. 2.)", "Salmon and steelhead face numerous obstacles in their efforts to complete  their life cycle.  For example, to migrate past dams, juvenile fish must  either go through the dams\u2019 turbines, go over the dams\u2019 spillways, use the  installed juvenile bypass systems, or be transported around the dams in  trucks and barges.  Each passage alternative has associated risks and  contributes to the mortality of juvenile fish.  Figure 3 shows one of the  trucks used to transport juvenile fish around the dams.", "To return upstream to spawn, adults must locate and use the fish ladders  provided at the dams.  Once adults make it past the dams, they often have  to spawn in habitat adversely affected by farming, mining, cattle grazing,  logging, road construction, and industrial pollution.  Figure 4 shows a  bypass system for juvenile fish migrating downstream and a fish ladder for  adult fish returning upstream.", "Reservoirs formed behind the dams cause problems for both juvenile and  adult passage because they slow water flows, alter river temperatures, and  provide habitat for predators, all of which may result in increased  mortality.  Other impacts, such as ocean conditions and snow pack levels,  also affect both juvenile and adult mortality.  For example, an abundant  snow pack aids juvenile passage to the ocean by increasing water flows as  it melts.", "Given the geographic range and historical importance of salmon and  steelhead in the Columbia River Basin, local governments, industries, and  private citizens are concerned about the species\u2019 recovery.  For example,  some Indian tribes living in the basin consider salmon to be part of their  spiritual and cultural identity, and fishing is still the preferred livelihood of  many tribal members.  Treaties between individual tribes and the federal  government acknowledge the importance of salmon and steelhead to the  tribes and guarantee tribes certain fishing rights.", "Efforts to increase salmon and steelhead stocks in the Columbia River  Basin began as early as 1877 with the construction of the first fish hatchery.", "Now, states, tribes, and the federal government operate a series of fish  hatcheries located in the Columbia River Basin.  Historically, hatcheries  were operated to mitigate the impacts of hydropower and other  development and had a primary goal of producing fish for commercial,  recreational, and tribal harvest.  However, hatcheries are now adjusting  their operations to ensure that they support recovery or at least do not  impede the recovery of listed species.", "As dams were built in the 1900s, attempts were made to minimize their  impacts by installing fish ladders and bypass systems to help salmon and  steelhead migrate up and down the rivers.  In the 1980s, several other  actions were taken to increase salmon and steelhead populations,  including:  (1) a treaty between the United States and Canada limiting the  ocean harvesting of salmon; (2) the passage of the Pacific Northwest  Electric Power Planning and Conservation Act (P.L. 96-501), which called  for the creation of an interstate compact to develop a program to protect,  and enhance fish and wildlife affected by hydropower development in the  Columbia River Basin and mitigate the effects of development; and (3) the  beginning of major state, local, and tribal efforts to address habitat  restoration through watershed plans.  None of these efforts proved to be  enough, however, and in the 1990s, 12 salmon and steelhead populations  were listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA, resulting in the  advent of intensified recovery actions.   The 12 listed populations are   Snake River Fall-run Chinook salmon,   Snake River Spring/Summer-run Chinook salmon,   Lower Columbia River Chinook salmon,   Upper Willamette River Chinook salmon,   Upper Columbia River Spring-run Chinook salmon,   Snake River Sockeye salmon,   Middle Columbia River steelhead,   Upper Willamette River steelhead;   Upper Columbia River steelhead   Lower Columbia River steelhead, and   Columbia River Chum salmon."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Multiple Agencies Participate in Salmon and Steelhead Recovery Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Eleven federal agencies are involved in the recovery of salmon and  steelhead in the Columbia River Basin.

Its mission is to sustain the health, diversity, and  productivity of the public lands for the use and enjoyment of present  and future generations.  BLM manages a wide variety of resources,  including energy and minerals, timber and forage, wild horse and burro  populations, fish and wildlife habitat, wilderness areas, and  archaeological and other natural heritage values.  While conducting its  activities, BLM is required by the ESA to avoid actions that would  jeopardize the continued existence of listed salmon and steelhead or  adversely modify or destroy critical habitat.  Consequently, projects are  designed and operated to comply with the ESA.  An example is planting  trees and vegetation to reduce erosion and to provide shade to cool  streams.", "FWS works with other entities to conserve, protect, and enhance fish,  wildlife, and plants.  It is chiefly responsible for implementing the ESA  for terrestrial species, migratory birds, certain marine mammals, and  certain fish.  FWS operates or funds 37 hatchery facilities in the basin  which, along with other purposes, assist in the recovery of listed  populations of salmon and steelhead.  It also operates three fish health  centers and one fish technology center in the basin, which provide the  hatcheries with technical support and health screenings of fish.  Other  conservation efforts include habitat protection and restoration, harvest  management, and recommending hydropower operations that will  benefit salmon and steelhead.", "The Forest Service manages 191 million acres of national forests and  grasslands nationwide under the principles of multiple use and  sustained yield, ensuring that lands will be available for future  generations.  The multiple uses include outdoor recreation, rangeland,  timber, watershed, and fish and wildlife.

For example, the Northwest  Power Act requires the protection, mitigation, and enhancement of fish and  wildlife while ensuring an adequate, efficient, economical, and reliable  power supply for the Pacific Northwest.  During the drought of 2001,  Bonneville found it difficult to meet its responsibilities under both the ESA  and the Northwest Power Act.  As a result, Bonneville, in consultation with  other federal agencies, determined that in order to maintain an adequate  and reliable power supply during the declared power emergencies,  available water had to be sent through the turbines to generate electricity  and as such could not be spilled (released) over the dams to aid juvenile  fish passage.  Significantly reducing the amount of water spilled over the  dams may affect the survival rates of some juvenile populations, which may  in turn ultimately affect the number of adult salmon and steelhead  returning to spawn in the future.

For example, in the past 5 years, the Forest Service improved  over 2,000 miles of stream banks and 9,000 acres of riparian area using  various methods, such as plantings to reduce erosion and placing logs in  streams to provide deeper pools.   FWS, in conjunction with the  Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation and the Oregon  Department of Fish and Wildlife, transferred 350,000 salmon from a  hatchery to the Umatilla River to increase local returns.

For example, over the past 25 years, annual adult returns for  all ESA listed and unlisted salmon and steelhead counted at Bonneville  Dam, the first dam on the Columbia River, averaged 660,000, but counts for  individual years varied widely.  As shown in figure 7, the number of  returning adults went from 638,000 in 1991, down to 411,000 in 1995, and up  to 1,877,000 in 2001.", "During the same time period, total ESA listed and unlisted adult salmon  and steelhead returns counted at Lower Granite Dam, the last dam that  adult fish encounter on the Snake River before entering Idaho, averaged  about 116,000.  But like counts at Bonneville, the counts at Lower Granite  for all salmon and steelhead fluctuated widely, as shown in figure 8.", "Similar fluctuations occurred for individual ESA\u2014listed salmon and  steelhead populations.

Figure 9 shows the counts of returning adult Snake River Sockeye  salmon at Lower Granite Dam.", "The 25-year averages for Bonneville, Lower Granite, and Snake River  Sockeye were greatly influenced by the relatively higher numbers of adults  returning to the basin in 2000 and 2001.  For example, adult returns in 2000  and 2001 represented 17 percent of all returning adults counted at  Bonneville Dam over the past 25 years and 21 percent of returning adults  counted at Lower Granite Dam in the same time period.  Similarly, adult  returns in 2000 and 2001 represented 18 percent of returning adult Snake  River Sockeye.

Additionally, they believe the  above\u2013average snow pack in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999, may have  contributed to higher juvenile survival rates in the freshwater during those  years because the runoff increased water flows in tributaries and the  mainstem Columbia and Snake rivers.  Depending on the species, many of  these juveniles would have returned as adults in 2000 and 2001.", "Cyclical changes in ocean temperatures also affect salmon and steelhead  survival.  For example, cooler ocean temperatures off the West Coast from  1999 through 2001 increased the number of small fish that salmon feed  upon and have likely increased salmon and steelhead survival and  contributed to higher returns.  The length of the ocean temperature cycle  and its relationship to salmon and steelhead survival, however, is not clear.", "Finally, salmon and steelhead generally have a 3- to 5-year spawning,  rearing, and maturation cycle, so it takes years before the benefits of some  actions materialize.  For example, improving bypass facilities at the dams  reduces juvenile salmon and steelhead mortality, but their ultimate ability  to return to spawn depends on many other factors, such as the availability  of food in the ocean to allow them to mature; the avoidance of predators  such as birds, marine mammals, other fish, fishermen; and favorable  passage conditions when they return upriver to spawn.", "However, actions that increase reproduction, improve passage and habitat  conditions, reduce erosion and pollution, use hatcheries for recovery,  ensure careful harvest management, and educate the public all improve  salmon and steelhead survival rates.  While they cannot quantify or isolate  the benefits of individual actions, agencies\u2019 officials are confident that the  composite recovery actions taken to date are having positive effects,  generally improving the conditions for freshwater survival and ultimately  resulting in higher numbers of returning adult salmon and steelhead than  would have occurred otherwise.  For example, NMFS estimates that  juvenile survival rates for Snake River spring/summer Chinook salmon  increased from 10 to 13 percent during the 1970s to 31 to 59 percent after  fish passage improvements were made at the dams during the 1990s. These  are estimates, however, with no quantification of the actual number of  returning adult salmon and steelhead.  The number of returning adults is  important because other studies have shown that even after successfully  passing the dams, using bypass facilities increases fish mortality  downstream."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and GAO\u2019s Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided the Department of Agriculture (Forest Service and NRCS), the  Department of Commerce (NMFS), the Department of Defense (Corps), the  Department of the Interior (BIA, BOR, BLM, FWS, and USGS), Bonneville,  and EPA with a draft of this report for review and comment.

These agencies also provided  clarifications on several technical points that have been included in the  report as appropriate.", "Bonneville took issue with three points regarding our report.  First,  Bonneville commented that the report does not fully reflect its role in  funding salmon and steelhead recovery efforts. For example, Bonneville  stated that the report does not explain that it reimburses the U.S. Treasury  for most of the expenditures for capital improvements at the Corps\u2019 and  BOR\u2019s hydroelectric projects as well as operation and maintenance costs at  these projects and at FWS\u2019s Lower Snake River Compensation Plan  hatcheries. We agree that Bonneville is a major supplier of salmon and  steelhead recovery moneys and clarifications were made in the report to  reflect its role. However, we were not asked to provide information on the  source of funds for salmon and steelhead recovery efforts but rather how  much the agencies expended on such efforts.  Therefore, the report reflects  the funds Bonneville is referring to as expenditures by other federal  agencies, such as, the Corps, BOR, and FWS.", "Second, Bonneville commented that the report does not fully describe that  the funds it provides other agencies with are from ratepayer receipts and,  as a result, much of the salmon and steelhead recovery expenditures  shown in the report are paid for by those that buy the electric power the  dams generate.  While the report notes that ratepayer receipts fund these  expenditures, we have added additional details on the source of the funds  that Bonneville uses to cover agencies\u2019 expenditures and how Bonneville  reimburses the U.S. Treasury for agencies\u2019 expenditures for capital and  operation and maintenance costs.", "Finally, Bonneville expressed concern that we did not include the cost of  replacement power and lost power revenues in our expenditure totals.   We  did not include these costs because these costs do not reflect expenditures  for actual recovery actions and determining these costs is difficult to  derive, since replacement power and lost revenues could result from other  management decisions that are not related to salmon and steelhead  recovery.", "We conducted our work from July 2001 through June 2002 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Although we have  not conducted detailed work on these issues, they are summarized as  follows."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Basinwide Strategic Recovery Plan and Annual Performance Plans", "paragraphs": ["A basinwide strategic recovery plan that identifies overall recovery goals,  estimated total costs, and specific agencies\u2019 actions and an annual  performance plan that identifies annual funds available and projects to be  completed would help the agencies to focus their actions and provide a  means to assess overall recovery efforts.  The ESA requires that the  National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) develop and implement a  recovery plan for each listed salmon and steelhead species.  The ESA  requires that this plan include (1) site-specific management actions; (2)  objective and measurable criteria that, when met, will result in the species\u2019  delisting; and (3) estimates of the time and cost required to implement the  measures and achieve the goal of delisting the species.", "Because NMFS has not yet developed a recovery plan, the agencies use a  variety of plans, strategies, and guidance to direct their recovery efforts.   Among others, the guidance that each agency uses includes its own mission  plans, NMFS\u2019s biological opinion for its actions that may adversely affect or  jeopardize listed species, and the Federal Caucus\u2019 All-H (hydropower,  hatcheries, harvest, and habitat) recovery strategy.  However, two recent  publications, one prepared by a scientific team and the other by a private  organization, have raised concerns about the potential success of recovery  efforts that follow these plans and strategies, whether they are used  individually or combined.  The agencies\u2019 officials have also stated that a  recovery plan that all entities recognize is needed to help direct their  efforts toward those watersheds and actions that can do the most for  recovery.", "NMFS is in the process of developing a basinwide recovery plan for ESA- listed salmon and steelhead, but that plan is several years away from  completion.  According to NMFS officials, the plan is being developed in  phases.  The first phase is to identify, among other things, target  populations and delisting criteria.  The second phase is to identify the  actions needed to meet the target populations and delisting criteria.  In  2004, NMFS expects a plan of action to be in place for the ESA-listed  salmon and steelhead on the lower Columbia River.  The plans for the  middle and upper Columbia River salmon and steelhead populations are to  be completed after 2004, but no specific completion dates have been set.", "Once a basinwide recovery plan is completed, annual performance plans  will be needed to implement it.  The Government Performance Results Act  of 1993 (GPRA) requires agencies to prepare and monitor annual  performance plans to successfully implement their long-range strategic  plans.  Under GPRA, the annual performance plan serves as the basis for  setting annual program goals and for measuring program performance in  achieving those goals.  The annual performance plan provides a direct link  between long-term goals and day-to-day operations.  The annual  performance plan should contain, among other things, annual goals that  can be used to gauge progress toward achieving strategic long-term goals,  standards that will be used to assess progress, and information on the  funds available to implement the annual performance plan.  The Federal  Caucus and the President\u2019s Council on Environmental Quality recently  started identifying federal appropriations and Bonneville\u2019s power receipts  that are available annually for salmon and steelhead recovery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ESA Consultation- Tracking System", "paragraphs": ["Under the consultation requirements of the ESA, federal agencies must  consult with NMFS to determine whether a proposed action that is  federally authorized, carried out, or funded is likely to jeopardize the  continued existence of any threatened or endangered salmon or steelhead  species, or adversely modify or destroy its critical habitat.  Unless a longer  time period is mutually agreed to by both NMFS and the consulting agency,  NMFS has 135 days to make this determination and issue a biological  opinion that summarizes its findings.", "Officials of several other federal agencies have said that the ESA  consultation process with NMFS sometimes takes too long and that  projects designed to benefit fish, including salmon and steelhead, are  delayed or prevented from being completed.  For example, Forest Service  officials reported that, because of the lengthy ESA consultation process,  funding had to be turned back for two road culvert projects.  In each case,  Forest Service officials concluded that replacing the culverts would open  up miles of blocked habitat to fish.  After submitting the project  consultation packages to NMFS, however, Forest Service officials stated  that they waited over a year for a response.  Because these projects were to  be funded with \u201cone year\u201d money, the long delay resulted in the return of  the money without the completion of the projects.  BOR officials reported  similar problems, stating that a delay in completing consultation risks not  only the loss of funds, but can delay projects designed to save fish by at  least a year.", "NMFS officials in the Pacific Northwest stated they were aware of the  agencies\u2019 concerns about untimely ESA consultations and provided several  reasons why delays may occur, including the recent hiring of a number of  NMFS staff who were inexperienced with the consultation process and an  increase in the number of consultations.  According to NMFS officials, over  the past 5 years, in its Habitat Conservation Division, where many  consultations occur, the number of staff has increased from 6 to 120.  As  the new staff acquire experience, officials said the timeliness of  consultation should improve.  Furthermore, NMFS officials stated that the  number of formal consultations involving salmon and steelhead in the  basin has almost doubled from 46 in 1997 to 88 in 2001.", "NMFS officials also said that the agencies\u2019 concerns might be somewhat  overstated because agencies often mistakenly assume that the time spent  on informal consultation is part of the formal consultation process.   Informal consultations, which ranged from 203 in 1997, to 359 in 1999, to  232 in 2001 in the Pacific Northwest, are discussions that take place while  NMFS reviews the biological assessment package submitted by an agency  for completeness\u2014i.e., inclusion of all the information needed to issue a  biological opinion.", "Because NMFS does not track ESA consultations, we could not verify the  magnitude, frequency, and/or causes of any such delays.  However, NMFS  recognizes the need to track the number, status, and timeliness of  consultations and plans to implement a consultation-tracking system in  2002.  NMFS officials said they and other agency officials need to know  how well the consultation process is working and whether the process is  taking so long that federal projects, even those beneficial to salmon and  steelhead, are being delayed."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["We were asked to (1) identify the roles and responsibilities of the federal  agencies involved with the recovery of Columbia River Basin salmon and  steelhead, (2) determine how much they have spent collectively on  recovery efforts, and (3) determine what actions they have undertaken and  what they have accomplished.  In conducting our work, agency officials  and others brought to our attention two issues that may affect the recovery  effort: the development of a strategic recovery plan to direct overall  recovery efforts along with annual performance plans to implement the  strategic plan, and the development of a system to track Endangered  Species Act consultations to ensure that recovery projects are not  unnecessarily delayed by the consultation process.", "To identify the roles and responsibilities of the federal agencies involved in  salmon and steelhead recovery, we identified 11 federal agencies with  significant responsibility for salmon and steelhead recovery in the Pacific  Northwest.

We requested that the agencies  provide expenditure data in two main categories: (1) expenditures made  specifically to benefit salmon and steelhead (specific expenditures) and  (2) those that were made for another purpose but also benefited salmon  and steelhead (nonspecific expenditures).  Within each of these categories,  we requested that further detail be provided on how the money was spent.   For example, we asked the agencies to identify expenditures by type\u2014 projects, research, monitoring, consultation/coordination, litigation or  administration.  Because the 11 agencies provided us with a combined  dollar estimate of expenditures for fiscal year 1982 through fiscal 1996, we  did not adjust these estimates to account for inflation.

Bonneville commented that the report does not fully reflect its role in  funding salmon- and steelhead-recovery efforts. For example,  Bonneville stated that the report does not explain that it reimburses the  U.S. Treasury for most of the expenditures for capital improvements at  the Corps\u2019 and BOR\u2019s hydroelectric projects as well as operation and  maintenance costs at these projects and at FWS\u2019s Lower Snake River  Compensation Plan hatcheries. We agree that Bonneville is a major  supplier of salmon- and steelhead-recovery moneys, and clarifications  were made in the report to reflect its role. However, we were not asked  to provide information on the source of funds for salmon- and  steelhead-recovery efforts but rather how much the agencies expended  on such efforts. Therefore, the report reflects the funds Bonneville is  referring to as expenditures by other federal agencies, such as the  Corps, BOR, and FWS. 2. Bonneville also commented that the report does not fully describe that  the funds it provides other agencies with are from ratepayer receipts  and, as a result, much of the salmon- and steelhead-recovery  expenditures shown in the report are paid for by those that buy the  electric power the dams generate.  While the report notes that  ratepayer receipts fund these expenditures, we have added additional  details on the source of the funds Bonneville uses to cover agencies  expenditures and how Bonneville reimburses the U.S. Treasury for  agencies expenditures for capital and operation and maintenance costs. 3. Bonneville expressed concern that we did not include the cost of  replacement power and lost power revenues in our expenditure totals.    We did not include these costs because they do not reflect expenditures  for actual recovery actions and determining these costs is difficult to  derive, since replacement power and lost revenues could result from  other management decisions that are not related to salmon and  steelhead recovery."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Comments from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency", "paragraphs": ["The following are GAO\u2019s comments on the letter dated July 2, 2002, from  the Department of Commerce\u2019s National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA).

We agree that there are many studies and documents that discuss  various recovery actions and their effect on the survival rates of salmon  and steelhead.

For example, the Williams, Smith and Muir article,  cited in NOAA\u2019s comments, estimates the effect of engineering efforts  on the survival rate of juvenile salmon and steelhead moving past the  dams but does not quantify how many of these juveniles return as  adults.  The number of returning adults is important because other  studies have shown that using bypass facilities increases salmon and  steelhead mortality downstream.  Hence, our point that there is little  evidence to quantify the effects of recovery efforts on the number of  returning salmon and steelhead is valid.  We did, however, revise the  report to include information on the estimated increased survival rates  of salmon and steelhead passage at the dams. 2.
