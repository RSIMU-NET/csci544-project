For example, mobile carriers and application developers use location data to provide social networking services that are linked to consumers' locations. In-car navigation services use location data to provide services such as turn-by-turn directions or roadside assistance. Location data can also be used and shared to enhance the functionality of other services, such as search engines, to make search results more relevant by, for example, returning results of nearby businesses.", "While consumers can benefit from location-based services, their privacy may be at risk when companies collect and share location data. For example, in both reports, GAO found that when consumers are unaware their location data are shared and for what purpose data might be shared, they may be unable to judge whether location data are shared with trustworthy third parties. Furthermore, when location data are amassed over time, they can create a detailed profile of individual behavior, including habits, preferences, and routes traveled\u2014private information that could be exploited. Additionally, consumers could be at higher risk of identity theft or threats to personal safety when companies retain location data for long periods or in a way that links the data to individual consumers. Companies can anonymize location data that they use or share, in part, by removing personally identifying information; however, in its 2013 report, GAO found that in-car navigation providers that GAO examined use different de-identification methods that may lead to varying levels of protection for consumers.", "Companies GAO examined in both reports have not consistently implemented practices to protect consumers' location privacy. The companies have taken some steps that align with recommended practices for better protecting consumers' privacy. For example, all of the companies examined in both reports used privacy policies or other disclosures to inform consumers about the collection of location data and other information. However, companies did not consistently or clearly disclose to consumers what the companies do with these data or the third parties with which they might share the data, leaving consumers unable to effectively judge whether such uses of their location data might violate their privacy. In its 2012 report, GAO found that federal agencies have taken steps to address location data privacy through educational outreach events, reports with recommendations to protect consumer privacy, and guidance for industry. For example, the Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) brought stakeholders together to develop codes of conduct for industry, but GAO found this effort lacked specific goals, milestones, and performance measures, making it unclear whether the effort would address location privacy. Additionally, in response to a recommendation in GAO's 2012 report, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) issued guidance in 2013 to inform companies of the Commission's views on the appropriate actions mobile industry companies should take to disclose their privacy practices and obtain consumers' consent."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO made recommendations to enhance consumer protections in its 2012 report.

In offering such services, companies can collect and  retain precise data about consumers\u2019 locations. Privacy advocacy groups  and policy makers have questioned whether location data that are  collected and used by these companies pose privacy risks. Specifically,  they have noted that location data can be used for purposes other than to  provide services to the consumer, such as selling the data to others for  marketing. They have also said that location data can be used to track  consumers, which can in turn be used to steal their identity, stalk them, or  monitor them without their knowledge. In addition, they have said that  location data can be used to infer other sensitive information about  individuals such as their religious affiliation or political activities.", "My statement today highlights our work on: (1) companies\u2019 use and  sharing of consumers\u2019 location data, (2) consumers\u2019 location privacy risks,  and (3) actions taken by selected companies and federal agencies to  protect consumers\u2019 location privacy. For this statement, we drew primarily  from our reports on mobile device location data and in-car location-based  services issued in September 2012 and December 2013, respectively.  For those reports, we examined privacy policies and other documentation  and interviewed representatives of selected mobile industry companies  and in-car navigation service companies. We analyzed whether the  selected companies\u2019 privacy policies and reported practices aligned with  recommended privacy practices we identified based on our analysis of  information from industry associations and privacy advocacy groups. We  also reviewed documents and interviewed officials from federal agencies.  Additionally, in December 2012 and May 2013, we followed up on agency  actions to respond to recommendations we made in the 2012 report. Our  September 2012 and December 2013 reports contain more detailed  explanations of the methods used to conduct our work.

Four types of companies are  primarily responsible for smartphone products and services in the United  States: mobile carriers, such as AT&T and Verizon; developers of  operating systems, such as Apple\u2019s iPhone iOS and Google\u2019s Android;  manufacturers, such as HTC and Samsung; and developers of  applications such as games like Angry Birds, social networking  applications like Facebook, or navigation tools like Google Maps. We  refer to these companies as mobile industry companies. In-car location- based services are delivered by in-car communications systems known  as \u201ctelematics\u201d systems, portable navigation devices, and map and  navigation applications for mobile devices.", "Companies can obtain location data in various ways. Mobile devices and  in-car navigation devices determine location information through methods  such as cell tower signal-based technologies, Wi-Fi Internet access point  technology, crowd-sourced positioning, and GPS technology. Assisted- GPS (A-GPS), a hybrid technology that uses more than one data  collection methodology, is also widely used. For example, companies  such as Google and Apple use customer data to compile large databases  of cell tower and Wi-Fi access points. Non-carriers use these crowd- sourced location maps to determine location by analyzing which cell  tower and Wi-Fi signals are received by a device. Consumers\u2019 location  data are transmitted over the cellular network or Wi-Fi access points to  companies providing the services. These location data may then be  shared with third parties for various uses. For example, companies may  choose to partner with third parties to provide a specific location-based  service, such as real-time traffic information.", "Several agencies have responsibility to address consumers\u2019 privacy and  create related guidance. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has  authority to enforce action against unfair or deceptive acts or practices of  companies; the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has  regulatory and enforcement authority over mobile carriers; and the  Department of Commerce\u2019s (Commerce) National Telecommunications  and Information Administration (NTIA) advises the President on  telecommunications and information policy issues. Additionally, the  Department of Justice disseminates guidance on how law enforcement  might request electronic evidence, such as a person\u2019s current or historical  location data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies Primarily Collect and Share Location Data to Provide and Improve Consumer Services", "paragraphs": ["Representatives from mobile industry companies we spoke to for the  September 2012 report and in-car navigation service companies we  spoke to for the December 2013 report told us they primarily collect and  share location data to provide location services and to improve those  services. Mobile carriers and application developers offer a diverse array  of services that use location information, such as services providing  navigation and social networking services that are linked to consumers\u2019  locations. To provide these services, carriers and developers need to  quickly and accurately determine location. Location data can also be used  to enhance the functionality of other services that do not need to know the  consumer\u2019s location to operate. Search engines, for example, can use  location data as a frame of reference to return results that might be more  relevant. For instance, if a consumer were to search for a pizza restaurant  using a location-aware search engine, the top result may be a map of  nearby pizza restaurants instead of the homepage of a national chain. In- car location services use location data to provide services such as turn- by-turn directions or roadside assistance. Representatives from both  mobile industry companies and in-car navigation services companies told  us they also use location data to improve the accuracy of their services.  Representatives from some in-car navigation service companies said they  share aggregated location data associated with traffic flows with third  parties to augment and improve the accuracy of real-time traffic services  provided to consumers.", "Additionally, as we reported in 2012, mobile industry companies can use  and sell location data to target the advertising that consumers receive  through mobile devices. Doing so may make an advertisement more  relevant to a consumer than a non-targeted advertisement, boosting  advertising revenue. Advertising is particularly important to application  developers, as many developers give their products away and rely on  advertising to consumers through free applications for revenue.  Companies may also aggregate and store individual consumer data to  create consumer profiles. Profiles can be used to tailor marketing or  service performance to an individual\u2019s preferences.", "Mobile industry companies and providers of in-car location services must  also share consumer location data if a court finds that the information is  warranted for law enforcement purposes. Because consumers generally  carry their mobile devices with them, law enforcement can use device  location data to determine the consumer\u2019s location. Because of this  correlation, location data are valuable to law enforcement for tracking the  movements of criminal suspects. Mobile carriers must comply with court  orders directing the disclosure of historical location data (i.e., where the  device was in the past) and in certain circumstances, real-time location  data (i.e., where the device is now)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Companies\u2019 Collection and Sharing of Location Data May Put Consumers\u2019 Privacy at Risk", "paragraphs": ["Although consumers can benefit from location-based services designed  to make their lives easier, consumers also expose themselves to privacy  risks when they allow companies to access their location data. In some  cases, consumers of location-based services may be unaware that  companies share their location data for purposes other than providing  those services. As we stated in our September 2012 and December 2013  reports, these privacy risks include, but are not limited to the following:  Disclosure to Unknown Third Parties for Unspecified Uses:  According to privacy advocates, when a consumer agrees to use a  service that accesses location data, the consumer is unlikely to know how  his or her location data may be used in ways beyond enabling the service  itself. For example, location data may be shared with third parties  unknown to the consumer. Because consumers do not know who these  entities are or how they are using consumers\u2019 data, consumers may be  unable to judge whether they are disclosing their data to trustworthy  entities. Third parties that receive shared location information may vary in  the levels of security protection they provide. If any of these entities has  weak system protections, there is an increased likelihood that the  information may be compromised.", "Tracking Consumer Behavior: When location data are collected and  shared, these data could be used in ways consumers did not intend, such  as to track their travel patterns or to target consumers for unwanted  marketing solicitations. Since consumers often carry their mobile devices  with them and can use them for various purposes, location data along  with data collected on the device may be used to form a comprehensive  record upon which an individual\u2019s activities may be inferred. Amassing  such data over time allows companies to create a richly detailed profile of  individual behavior, including habits, preferences, and routines\u2014private  information that could be exploited. Consumers may believe that using  these personal profiles for purposes other than providing a location-based  service constitutes an invasion of privacy, particularly if the data are used  contrary to consumers\u2019 expectations and results in unwanted solicitations  or other nuisances.", "Identity Theft: Criminals can use location data to steal identities when  location data are disclosed, particularly when they are combined with  other personal information. The risk of identity theft grows whenever  entities begin to collect data profiles, especially if the information is not  maintained securely. By illicitly gaining access to these profiles, criminals  acquire information such as a consumer\u2019s name, address, interests, and  friends\u2019 and co-workers\u2019 names. In addition, a combination of data  elements\u2014even elements that do not by themselves identify anyone,  such as individual points of location data\u2014could potentially be used in  aggregate to identify or infer a consumer\u2019s behavior or patterns. Such  information could be used to discern the identity of an individual.  Furthermore, keeping data long-term, particularly if it is in an identifiable  profile, increases the likelihood of identity theft.", "Personal Security: Location data may be used to form a comprehensive  record of an individual\u2019s movements and activities. If disclosed or posted,  location data may be used by criminals to identify an individual\u2019s present  or probable future location, particularly if the data also contain other  personally identifiable information. This knowledge may then be used to  harm the individual or his property through, for instance, stalking or theft.  Access to location information also raises child safety concerns as more  children access mobile devices and location-based services. According to  the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), location updates that  consumers provide through social media have been linked to robberies,  and GPS technology has been involved in stalking cases.", "Surveillance: Law enforcement agencies can obtain location data  through various methods, such as a court order, and such data can be  used as evidence. However, according to a report by the ACLU, law  enforcement agents could potentially track innocent people, such as  those who happened to be in the vicinity of a crime or disturbance.  Consumers generally do not know when law enforcement agencies  access their location data. In addition to information related to a crime,  the location data collected by law enforcement may reveal potentially  sensitive destinations, such as medical clinics, religious institutions,  courts, political rallies, or union meetings."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Selected Companies Have Not Consistently Implemented Practices to Protect Consumers\u2019 Location Privacy; Federal Agencies Have Taken Actions but Federal Privacy Law Is Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Private Sector Entities Have Implemented Some Recommended Practices to Protect Consumers\u2019 Location Privacy, but Not Consistently", "paragraphs": ["Industry and privacy advocacy groups have recommended practices for  companies to follow in order to better protect consumers\u2019 privacy while  using their personal information. These recommended practices include:  (1) providing disclosures to consumers about data collection, use, and  sharing; (2) obtaining consent and providing controls over location data;  (3) having data retention practices and safeguards; and (4) providing  accountability for protecting consumers\u2019 data. For the September 2012  report, we examined 14 mobile industry companies, and the for  December 2013 report, we examined 10 in-car navigation services  companies. These companies have taken steps that are consistent with  some, but not all, of the recommended practices:  Disclosures: All of the companies we examined for both reports have  privacy policies, terms-of-service agreements, or other practices\u2014such  as on-screen notifications\u2014to notify consumers that they collect location  data and other personal information. However, some companies have not  consistently or clearly disclosed to consumers what they are doing with  these data or which third parties they may share them with. For example,  most of the in-car navigation service companies we examined for the  2013 report provide broadly worded reasons for collecting location data  that potentially allow for unlimited data collection and use. One of those  company\u2019s terms of service states that the provided reasons for location  data collection were not exhaustive. Furthermore, about half of the in-car  navigation service companies\u2019 disclosures allow for sharing for location  data when they are de-identified, but most of these companies\u2019  disclosures did not describe the purposes for sharing such data.", "Consent and Controls: All of the companies we examined for both  reports indicated they obtain consumer consent to collect location data  and obtain this consent in various ways, some of which are more explicit  than others. Companies also reported providing methods for consumers  to control collection and use of location data, but the methods and  amount of control varied. For example, most of the 14 mobile industry  companies we examined for the 2012 report indicated that consumers  could control smartphones\u2019 use of their location data from the phone;  however, the ability to control this varied by operating system, with some  providing more options. For example, the iPhone iOS operating system  displays a pop-up window the first time a consumer activates a new  application that includes location-based services. The pop-up states that  the application seeks to use the consumer\u2019s location and allows the  consumer to accept or decline at that time. Similarly, Android  smartphones notify consumers that an application will use location data at  the time a consumer downloads a new application and seeks consumer  consent through this process. Some in-car navigation systems we  examined for the 2013 report use similar methods to notify consumers  that they will collect location data to provide services. In contrast, other in- car navigation services obtain consent when a consumer purchases a  vehicle. According to one privacy group we met with, if consent is  obtained in this manner, consumers may not be as likely to review a  company\u2019s stated privacy practices because they may be a part of a  larger set of documentation about the vehicle. Additionally, none of the 10  in-car navigation service companies we examined allow consumers to  delete the location data that are, or have been, collected.", "Retention and Safeguards: Officials from most of the companies we  interviewed for the 2012 and 2013 reports said they kept location data  only as long as needed for a specific purpose; however, in some cases,  this could mean keeping location data indefinitely. Most of the privacy  policies of the 14 mobile services companies we examined did not state  how long companies keep location data, and there was wide variation in  how long in-car navigation services companies retain vehicle-specific or  personally identifiable location data when a customer requests services,  ranging from not at all to up to 7 years. All the mobile industry companies  we examined reported ways they safeguard consumers\u2019 personal  information. However, in some cases, it was not clear whether these  protections covered location data, since some privacy policies did not  state whether location was considered a form of personal information.  Thus it was unclear whether stated safeguards for personal information  applied to location data.", "As we reported in 2013, companies may safeguard location data that they  use or share, in part, by de-identifying them, but companies we examined  used different de-identification methods. De-identified data are stripped of  personally identifiable information. The de-identification method a  company uses affects the extent to which consumers may be re-identified  and exposed to privacy risks. Location data that are collected along with a  consumer\u2019s name or other identifying information are, by definition,  personally identifiable data and present the greatest privacy risks to  consumers because a consumer\u2019s identity is known. Privacy risks  decrease when companies de-identify location data, but the level of risk  falls on a spectrum depending on how easy it is to re-identify consumers.  For example, de-identifying location data with unique identification  numbers prevents the direct association of location data with a specific  vehicle or individual. However, if the same identification number is re- used for the same consumer on multiple trips, then the consumer\u2019s  history or patterns can potentially be discerned. Conversely, consumers  face little to no privacy risks when location data are stripped of any  identification numbers and aggregated with other consumers\u2019 data  because the data are anonymous, meaning that the data cannot be linked  to an individual at all (see fig. 1). All of the in-car navigation service  companies we examined stated in their disclosures, or in interviews with  us, that they use or share de-identified location data.", "Accountability: We reported in 2012 and 2013 that companies\u2019  accountability practices varied. For example, all 10 of the in-car  navigation services companies we examined for the 2013 report stated in  their disclosures or in interviews with us that they take steps to protect  location data that they share with third parties. Additionally, some mobile  carriers we examined for the 2012 report said they use their contracts  with third parties they share consumers\u2019 personal data with to require  those third parties to adhere to industry recommended practices for  location data. In the 2013 report, we found that while not disclosed to  consumers, representatives of in-car navigation services companies said  their employees must follow the companies\u2019 internal polices to protect  data, including location data, and some of the representatives further  explained that employees who violate such policies are subject to  disciplinary action and possibly termination. Separately, representatives  from one of the in-car navigation service companies told us that it had  conducted an independent audit of its practices to provide reasonable  assurance that it was in line with company privacy policies. Additionally,  three of the mobile industry companies we examined for the 2012 report  had their privacy practices certified by TRUSTe, a company that helps  companies address privacy issues by certifying businesses\u2019 privacy  programs.", "Lacking clear information about how companies use and share  consumers\u2019 location data, consumers deciding whether to allow  companies to collect, use, and share data on their location would be  unable to effectively judge whether their privacy might be violated."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Agencies Have Taken Actions to Protect Consumer Privacy", "paragraphs": ["In our September 2012 report on mobile device location data, we reported  that federal agencies that have responsibility for consumer data privacy  protection have taken steps to promote awareness of privacy issues,  such as providing educational outreach and recommending actions aimed  at improving consumer privacy. For example, in February 2012, NTIA  prepared a report for the White House on protecting privacy and  promoting innovation in the global digital economy. The report offered a  framework and expectations for companies that use personal data. The  framework includes a consumer privacy bill of rights, a multistakeholder  process to specify how the principles in the bill of rights apply in particular  business contexts, and effective enforcement. In February 2012, FTC  issued a report on privacy disclosures for mobile applications aimed at  children. This report highlighted the lack of information available to  parents prior to downloading mobile applications for their children and  called on the mobile industry to provide greater transparency about their  data practices. FTC also issued a consumer privacy report in March 2012  with recommendations for companies that collect and use consumer data,  including location data. Finally, the Department of Justice has  developed guidance on how law enforcement may obtain mobile location  data.", "In our 2012 report, we concluded that NTIA and FTC could take additional  actions to further protect consumers. For example, we found that NTIA  had not defined specific goals, milestones, or performance measures for  its proposed multistakeholder process, which consists of different groups  involved with consumer privacy coming together to discuss relevant  issues with the goal of developing codes of conduct for consumer privacy.  Therefore, it was unclear whether the process would address location  privacy. Consequently, we recommended that NTIA, in consultation with  stakeholders in the multistakeholder process, develop specific goals, time  frames, and performance measures for the multistakeholder process to  create industry codes of conduct. In a December 2012 response to our  report, the Department of Commerce (NTIA is an agency of Commerce)  said it disagreed with this recommendation, stating that it is the role of the  stakeholders, not the agency, to develop goals, time frames, and  performance measures for the multistakeholder process. Additionally, the  letter stated that stakeholders had made progress to develop their own  goals, time frames, and performance measures for their efforts to create a  code of conduct for mobile application transparency. We will continue to  monitor NTIA\u2019s efforts in this area.", "Additionally, we found that FTC had not issued comprehensive guidance  to mobile industry companies with regard to actions companies should  take to protect mobile location data privacy. Doing so could inform  companies of FTC\u2019s views on the appropriate actions companies should  take to protect consumers\u2019 mobile location privacy. We recommended  that FTC consider issuing industry guidance establishing FTC\u2019s views of  the appropriate actions mobile industry companies could take to protect  mobile location data privacy. In February 2013, FTC issued a staff report  on mobile privacy disclosures; the report provided guidance for mobile  industry companies to consider when disclosing their information  collection and use practices. In particular, the report suggested best  practices for operating systems, application developers, advertising  networks and other third parties, and trade associations and other experts  and researchers. For example, FTC said that operating systems should  provide disclosures at the point in time when consumers access location- based services and obtain their affirmative express consent before  allowing applications to access sensitive content like location data."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Law Addressing Location Data Privacy Is Not Comprehensive", "paragraphs": ["Currently, no comprehensive federal privacy law governs the collection,  use, and sale of personal information by private-sector companies; rather,  various federal laws pertain to the privacy of consumers\u2019 data:", "The Federal Trade Commission Act prohibits unfair or deceptive acts  or practices in or affecting commerce and authorizes FTC  enforcement action. This authority allows FTC to take remedial  action against a company that engages in a practice that FTC has  found is unfair or deceives customers.

ECPA also  prohibits providers of electronic communications from voluntarily  disclosing customer records to government entities, with certain  exceptions, but companies may disclose such records to a person  other than government entities. The act does not specifically address  whether location data are considered content or part of consumers\u2019  records. Some privacy groups have stated that ECPA should  specifically address the protection of location data.

Carriers must  also comply with FCC rules implementing the E911 requirements of  the Wireless Communications and Public Safety Act of 1999,  including providing location information to emergency responders  when mobile phone consumers dial 911.", "We have previously concluded that the current privacy framework  warrants reconsideration in relation to a number of issues. In our 2013  report on consumer data collected and shared by information resellers,  we found that changes in technology and the marketplace have vastly  increased the amount and nature of personal information, including  location data that are collected, used, and shared. We reported that while  some stakeholders\u2019 views differed, the current statutory framework does  not fully address these changes. Moreover, we reported that while current  laws protect privacy interests in specific sectors and for specific uses,  consumers have little control over how their information is collected, used,  and shared with third parties. This includes consumers\u2019 ability to access,  correct, and control their personal information used for marketing, such as  location data, and privacy controls related to the use of new technologies  and applications, such as mobile and in-car navigation devices. In 2012,  FTC and NTIA called on Congress to pass data privacy legislation that  would provide a minimum level of protection for consumer data, including  location data.
