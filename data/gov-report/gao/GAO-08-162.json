To address these facilities, OBO has obligated about $140 million per year for its Compound Security Upgrade Program (CSUP). GAO was asked to (1) describe the process that OBO follows to prioritize and plan CSUP projects, including stakeholder involvement; (2) determine the extent to which CSUP projects met contracted cost and time frames and whether OBO has procedures to ensure security upgrades are installed; and (3) assess whether State's CSUP efforts have enhanced posts' abilities to comply with State's physical security standards. To address these objectives, GAO reviewed pertinent State documents, met with State officials in Washington, D.C., and overseas, and traveled to 11 posts in Latin America, Europe, and the Middle East.

DS is developing a prioritization process that will factor in the number of personnel, threat levels, and vulnerabilities at each facility, including those off compound. OBO has improved its planning processes by conducting a comprehensive survey of posts' physical security needs, including off-compound facilities. GAO found that 96 percent of 47 projects undertaken since fiscal year 2004 were completed within 30 days of their contractual completion date. However, OBO modified 81 percent of the contracts to extend their completion dates. GAO also found that while OBO paid the contractors the amount specified in the contracts, contract modifications resulted in cost adjustments to all but two contracts, which GAO found in prior work is not uncommon in government renovation projects. OBO cited factors outside the contractors' control as the cause of most delays and cost increases, such as lengthy local permitting issues. To help ensure security upgrades contracted for are completed, OBO assigns a project manager who is responsible for the project's completion and relies on regional and post officials to provide additional monitoring. CSUP projects have enhanced posts' compliance with physical security standards by constructing compound access control facilities, safe areas for post personnel, and compound walls and barriers. However, at the 11 posts GAO visited, site conditions prevented them from adhering fully with standards. For example, more than one post's urban location prevented it from achieving a 100-foot setback from the street, a key security standard.

As of the end  of fiscal year 2007, State had obligated more than $5.9 billion for this  program, awarded contracts for the construction of 78 new embassy and  consulate compounds, and completed more than 50 new facilities. State  currently plans to contract for 80 more new facilities through 2014.", "To complement its efforts to move overseas U.S. government employees  into more secure facilities, State initiated efforts to enhance physical  security at existing facilities. After the 1998 embassy bombings, State  initiated a new physical security upgrades program called the World-Wide  Security Upgrade Program, which focused on enhancing perimeter  security measures. In response to the September 11 terrorist attacks, State  focused on ensuring that embassies and consulates had adequate safe  areas for staff in case of an attack on the facilities. Since 2004, State has  taken a more comprehensive approach to physical security upgrades by  reviewing the entire range of physical security needs at posts through  CSUP. State has identified the following four goals for CSUP:  to provide physical security protection to the extent practical for existing  facilities; to provide physical security upgrades to meet current security standards  for those facilities that will not be replaced by a NEC in the near-term; to initiate physical security upgrades at facilities that are not part of the  chancery compound, including annexes, public diplomacy facilities, and  warehouses; and to provide security upgrades to nongovernmental facilities (\u201csoft targets\u201d)  frequented by U.S. citizens.", "From fiscal year 1999 through 2007, State had obligated more than $1.2  billion for security upgrades. Since fiscal year 2004 and the initiation of  CSUP, OBO has undertaken approximately 55 major projects costing over  $1 million that enhance physical security at posts that are not going to be  replaced with a new facility in the near future, if at all. OBO\u2019s Long-Range  Overseas Buildings Plan calls for it to undertake an average of 13 major  CSUP projects per year through 2012. CSUP provides several categories of  security upgrades to help posts meet physical security standards, such as  perimeter security measures (including anti-climb walls, fences,  compound access control facilities, bollards, cameras, and security  lighting); forced entry/ballistic resistant doors and windows; safe areas for  U.S. personnel in case of emergency; and stand-alone mail screening  facilities. In addition, OBO has obligated approximately $58 million per  year of CSUP funds for minor post-managed security upgrade projects,  such as minor residential security upgrades, maintenance, repair, and  replacement of existing forced entry/ballistic resistant doors and windows,  and modular mail screening facilities.", "The Overseas Security Policy Board, which includes representatives from  more than 20 U.S. intelligence, foreign affairs, and other agencies, is  responsible for considering, developing, and promoting security policies  and standards that affect U.S. government agencies under the authority of  the Chief of Mission at a post. This responsibility includes reviewing and  issuing uniform guidance on physical security standards for embassies,  consulates, and other overseas office space. State incorporates the board\u2019s  physical security standards in its \u201cForeign Affairs Handbook\u201d and \u201cForeign  Affairs Manual.\u201d With respect to existing office buildings, the standards  apply to the maximum extent feasible or practicable.", "State has identified five key Overseas Security Policy Board standards to  protect overseas diplomatic office facilities against terrorism and other  dangers (see fig. 1).", "First, the Secure Embassy Construction and Counterterrorism Act of 1999  requires that office facilities be at least 100 feet from uncontrolled areas,  such as a street where vehicles can pass without being checked by  security officials. This distance is meant to help protect the buildings and  occupants against threats such as bomb blasts. Second, State requires high  perimeter walls or fences that are difficult to climb, thereby deterring  those who might attack the compound on foot. Third, State requires anti- ram barriers to ensure that vehicles cannot breach the facility perimeter to  get close to the building and detonate a bomb. The fourth standard  requires blast-resistant construction techniques and materials. These  materials include reinforced concrete and steel construction and blast- resistant windows. Coupled with a 100-foot setback, blast-resistant  construction provides the best possible protection against vehicle bomb  attack, according to DS officials. State\u2019s fifth security standard is  controlled access of pedestrians and vehicles at the perimeter of a  compound. Compound access control facilities allow guards to screen  personnel and visitors before they enter the compound to verify that they  have legitimate business at the embassy or consulate and that they bring  nothing onto the compound that could be potentially harmful or used to  surreptitiously gather intelligence. Similarly, the facilities allow guards to  search vehicles before they are permitted to enter the compound."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CSUP Planning Process Balances Security Needs of Posts and Includes Input from Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["OBO has a threat- and vulnerability-based planning process for its CSUP  projects that includes input from DS\u2019s analysis of security threats and  vulnerabilities and from post officials.

OBO then modifies the list to balance various factors.  First, OBO removes facilities that cannot be further upgraded, such as  many leased facilities. Second, OBO adds facilities that may have been  removed, such as vulnerable off-compound facilities at posts where NEC  projects are planned. Third, OBO has security engineers conduct a  thorough assessment of each post\u2019s needs. Fourth, OBO alters the list to  account for external factors, such as difficulty getting a host government\u2019s  approval on a project, which would move a project down the list.

One year prior to a project\u2019s start date,  OBO then develops an initial planning survey in which OBO seeks  agreement between its engineers and the post\u2019s Regional Security Officer.  The initial planning survey is then sent in draft form for approval by OBO  and post officials, including the Regional Security Officer, administrative  officer, and facilities manager. Once this process is completed, OBO works  with its contract design firm to develop conceptual design plans. State\u2019s  contracting offices use these plans to advertise for bids to complete the  design and construct the improvements using a design-build contract.  After a firm has been awarded the contract, it will develop and submit  interim and then final plans for OBO\u2019s review.

For example, we  found that one post compound, following the conclusion of its CSUP  project, met most security standards, but a nearby off-compound office  facility did not have setback, blast\u2013resistant walls and windows, a  controlled access facility for pedestrians and vehicles, a safe area, and  other security features.", "OBO and DS are currently working to better address the needs of all  facilities, including the hundreds of annexes located off compound, and  improve CSUP project prioritization. OBO officials commented that newer  projects take into account the needs of all facilities at a post, whether they  are on compound or not. For example, at one post we visited, we saw a  CSUP project for an off-compound office facility. Moreover, DS is  developing a new risk-based process to prioritize CSUP projects that will  rate the vulnerabilities of each overseas building with office space,  including annexes, and factor in the number of personnel and threat levels  to better set priorities.

According to OBO,  CSUP initially focused on perimeter security, but as new standards have  been put in place and perimeter projects completed, the program has  broadened its focus to ensure that posts meet all physical security  standards to the extent feasible. For example, in 2004, terrorists rushed on  foot past the barriers blocking a car being inspected at the vehicular gate  of the consulate in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. In response, State began to  install additional fencing and a secondary gate, called a man trap, at  vehicle entry points at posts to prevent attackers on foot from accessing  the compounds. Moreover, the Overseas Security Policy Board is currently  considering the addition of a new security standard requiring man traps.

In reviewing schedule performance data, we found  that 96 percent of projects were completed within 30 days of their  contractual completion date (see fig. 2). However, we found that OBO  modified the contracts to extend their completion dates for 81 percent of  the projects. On average, OBO extended the contracts by 4 months\u2014an  average increase of 26 percent. Many of these extensions did not result in  increased costs to the government.", "For each of the 47 projects, OBO paid the contractor the amount specified  in the fixed-price contracts\u2014an average project cost of $2.6 million. In  reviewing cost data, we found that OBO increased the contract cost for 34  projects, at an average increase of 17 percent, and decreased the contract  cost for 11 projects, at an average decrease of 5 percent (see fig. 2). The  net change in the cost of the 47 projects was an increase of $10 million.  Cost increases were generally due to changes in the scope of the projects,  while cost decreases were generally due to a reduction in expected local  tax costs. Our past assessments of domestic government renovation  projects found that work on existing facilities presented a number of  difficulties and challenges, making renovations especially susceptible to  cost increases stemming from unexpected conditions. We found that, for  such projects, government agencies generally budget 5 to 15 percent of  project cost for unexpected changes.", "OBO cited factors outside the contractor\u2019s control as the cause of most of  the delays and cost increases, such as unusually lengthy local permitting  processes, previously unidentified underground utilities that needed to be  moved, design changes that OBO made during construction work, and  project changes requested by the post. For example, OBO extended the  deadline 10 months for completion of perimeter fencing upgrades and a  new CAC facility at a U.S. consulate in Asia because of delays in receiving  approval from local authorities to proceed with the work. In addition, in  response to a request from officials at a U.S. embassy in Europe, OBO  added to the scope of the planned CSUP project, including a new CAC  facility, and modified the contract to pay the contractor an additional  $874,000 for the added work. However, in cases where OBO found that  contractor error was the cause of a delay or cost increase, OBO held the  contractor accountable. For example, at a U.S. mission in Europe, OBO  found instances where the contractor\u2019s work did not conform to contract  specifications and required the contractor to redo the work. OBO did not  compensate the contractor for the additional costs associated with  replacing the substandard work. Similarly, at a U.S. consulate in Europe,  the contractor was more than 6 months late in completing the security  upgrades; OBO, therefore, assessed the contractor a penalty of almost  $60,000.", "OBO has project management procedures to help ensure the security  upgrades it contracted for are completed and have enhanced posts\u2019  compliance with physical security standards. For each CSUP project, OBO  assigns a project manager who is responsible for the effective completion  of the project. However, because CSUP projects are generally small and  OBO has limited resources, project managers are not usually able to be on  site full time during the project. Project managers visit posts to ensure the  work contracted for is being done and, in many cases, rely on post  officials, including the Regional Security Officers and facility managers, to  provide additional monitoring of the work. In our visits to 11 posts, we  found that, in most cases, the work called for in the projects had been  done or was under way. However, at one location, we found that one  component of the project\u2014strengthening the room where the post\u2019s  emergency generator is located\u2014was removed from the scope of the  project because, according to post officials, it would have unexpectedly  required creating new office space to relocate people during the work,  adding costs that could not be covered by the CSUP budget.

We found that none of the posts we visited adhered fully with  current security standards because of conditions that were outside the  scope of CSUP projects. For example, most of the posts we visited were  located in dense urban areas that prevented them from achieving a 100- foot setback from the street, one of the key security standards (see fig. 5  for an example). OBO and DS officials acknowledged that, at many  locations, it is not feasible to increase the setback by acquiring land and  closing off nearby streets. In other cases, officials stated the buildings  themselves were not structurally capable of handling heavy forced  entry/ballistic-resistant windows or other upgrades. And in other cases,  officials commented that host nations or cities would not allow certain  upgrades to be implemented, such as removing trees to create a clear zone  around the embassy or changing the facade of historic buildings. Finally,  current plans for the NEC program do not include the replacement of 61 of  262 embassies and consulates. Several of these facilities were built after  physical security standards were strengthened in response to terrorist  attacks against U.S. facilities in Beirut, Lebanon, in the 1980s.
