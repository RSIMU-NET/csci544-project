The reservoir created by the dam flooded over 100,000 acres of the Cheyenne River Reservation. In 1954, the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe requested about $23.5 million for damages (losses resulting from the government\u2019s taking of the Indians\u2019 land) and general rehabilitation (funds for improving the Indians\u2019 standard of living). Later that year, the Congress authorized the payment of about $10.6 million to the tribe for damages, rehabilitation, and administrative expenses related to the settlement. In March 1993, the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Council unanimously passed a resolution stating that the tribe had not received adequate compensation for the damages resulting from the flood control project. The tribe hired a consultant to prepare a new economic analysis of the damages, which was published in July 1994.", "Other tribes also lost land to flood control projects on the Missouri River and received compensation for damages from the federal government, primarily during the 1950s. In the 1980s, these tribes requested additional compensation on the grounds that the amounts they originally received were not adequate. The tribes at two reservations\u2014Fort Berthold and Standing Rock\u2014hired consultants to prepare economic analyses supporting their requests for additional compensation. We assessed the adequacy of these analyses in response to a congressional request and, in May 1991, reported that the analyses overstated the tribes\u2019 losses because they were based on assumptions that could not be supported by historical evidence. As an alternative, we suggested that the Congress consider using the tribes\u2019 requests for compensation at the time of the taking as a starting point for calculating additional compensation. Specifically, we suggested that the Congress consider a range of additional compensation based on the present value of the difference between the amount requested for each reservation and the amount received. We did not consider whether additional compensation should be provided or evaluate the adequacy of the compensation originally appropriated by the Congress. We did, however, note that the tribes may not have been willing sellers of their land at the amount of compensation authorized by the Congress.", "In 1992, the Congress enacted legislation acknowledging, first, that the U.S. government did not justly compensate the tribes at Fort Berthold and Standing Rock when it acquired their lands and, second, that the tribes were entitled to additional financial compensation. Accordingly, the legislation provided development trust funds for these two reservations. A 1996 act provided a development fund for another reservation, Crow Creek, and a 1997 Senate bill proposed such a fund for a fourth reservation, Lower Brule. Anticipating the introduction of legislation proposing additional compensation for the Cheyenne River Sioux, you asked us to assess the new economic analysis prepared by the consultant for the tribe.", "The consultant used two approaches to estimate the amount of additional compensation due to the Cheyenne River Sioux: The primary approach recalculates the value of the tribe\u2019s losses, while the secondary approach generally mirrors the alternative approach that we proposed in our 1991 report. Our assessment of the two approaches follows, together with our suggestions for developing ranges of values under the second approach and for separating the values for damages from the values for rehabilitation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In implementing the Flood Control Act of 1944, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) constructed a number of dams on the Missouri River in North Dakota and South Dakota.

At the maximum water level of 205 feet, the reservoir behind the dam stretches 231 miles from just northwest of Pierre, South Dakota, to just south of Bismarck, North Dakota. See figure 1 for a picture of the dam and appendix I for a map of the dam and reservoir.", "The Cheyenne River Sioux lost 104,420 acres to flooding when the Oahe reservoir was created. The Corps; the Department of the Interior, through the Missouri River Basin Investigations Unit (MRBI); and the tribe each developed estimates of the damages caused by this project. The Corps\u2019 estimate provided only for direct damages; that is, it included values primarily for the land and improvements in the taking area. MRBI\u2019s and the tribe\u2019s estimates provided for both direct and indirect damages. The indirect damages included values for the loss of such things as timber, wildlife, and wild products (fruits, berries, and herbs) in the taking area.

The 1952 proposal sought specific dollar amounts for direct damages, indirect damages, and rehabilitation, as well as unspecified amounts for the relocation and reestablishment of tribal members in the taking area and for tribal administrative expenses related to the settlement, among other things. The 1954 proposal requested $10,930,871 for direct and indirect damages and $12,599,432 for rehabilitation. Later that year, the Congress authorized a total payment of $10,644,014 to the Cheyenne River Sioux, including (1) $5,384,014 for the land, improvements, and all other claims related to the project (direct and indirect damages); (2) $5,160,000 for the rehabilitation of tribal members residing on the reservation and for the relocation and reestablishment of tribal members living in the taking area; and (3) $100,000 for tribal administrative expenses related to the settlement.", "Tribes at four other reservations affected by flood control projects along the Missouri River incurred losses ranging from about 16,000 acres to over 150,000 acres. Primarily during the 1950s, these tribes received some compensation for their losses. However, starting in the 1980s they began requesting additional amounts ranging from $27.5 million to $342.9 million. The Congress responded to their requests by authorizing or proposing the establishment of development trust funds for them. Specifically, in 1992, it authorized a $149.2 million fund for the Fort Berthold Reservation and a $90.6 million fund for the Standing Rock Reservation. In 1996, it authorized a $27.5 million fund for the Crow Creek Reservation. A legislative proposal would establish a $39.3 million fund for the Lower Brule Reservation.

He estimated that the total value of the losses, as of January 1, 1955, was $19.4 million. After subtracting the $5.4 million authorized as damage compensation for the tribe in 1954, the consultant applied the annual prime rate to adjust the unpaid damages of $14.0 million to 1996 values, arriving at a total claim for additional damage compensation of $300.7 million. In calculating this estimate, the consultant made a number of questionable assumptions. Among the more important of these are the (1) choice of a discount rate for valuing the tribe\u2019s future losses, (2) estimate of timber harvest levels, (3) estimate of wildlife resource values, and (4) estimate of the tribe\u2019s consumer surplus\u2014that is, the value to the tribe, above and beyond the market value, of the resources that were lost in the taking."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Consultant Used a Questionable Discount Rate", "paragraphs": ["Historical information available on the damage estimates prepared in the 1950s raises questions about the discount rate used by the consultant. To value the future annual income lost to the tribe because of the taking, he selected the 1955 prime interest rate of 2.79 percent (net of inflation) as the discount rate. The discount rate is used to determine the present value of a stream of annual income. A key question in evaluating the consultant\u2019s selection of a discount rate is whether it accurately reflects the discount rate that the tribe would have used in the 1950s. Historical documents indicate that the tribe and MRBI used a 4-percent discount rate. Moreover, the tribe requested that its settlement draw interest at 5 percent. This information suggests that the tribe\u2019s discount rate was higher than the prime rate assumed by the consultant.", "As the discount rate increases, the value of future earnings decreases. For example, the consultant estimated the value of the tribe\u2019s lost annual agricultural production as of January 1955 at $193,194. Assuming that this annual loss would continue in perpetuity, the consultant used a 2.79-percent discount rate to calculate a present value of $6,924,516 for the tribe\u2019s total agricultural production losses. If the consultant had used a 4-percent discount rate, the same annual loss of $193,194 would have had a present value of $4,829,850\u2014a reduction of $2,094,666, or about 30 percent. Similarly, if the consultant had applied the 4-percent discount rate to his entire analysis (losses for timber, wildlife, wild products, and agricultural production), he would have arrived at a total damage estimate of $13.5 million in 1955\u2014a figure that is about 30 percent lower than his total damage estimate of $19.4 million."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Consultant Used Questionable Timber Harvest Levels", "paragraphs": ["The consultant did not adequately justify the harvest levels for timber that he used in his damage calculations. His total damage estimate for timber exceeded both the tribe\u2019s and MRBI\u2019s estimates. Specifically, for different timber resources (e.g., logs, poles, posts, and cordwood), he used harvest levels that exceeded, by 12 to 199 percent, the sustainable levels calculated by MRBI.", "The tribe developed two timber estimates\u2014one in 1952 for $900,000 and the other in 1954 for $2,444,125. Because we were unable to find any detailed calculations showing how the tribe arrived at these estimates, we cannot compare the tribe\u2019s methodology with MRBI\u2019s or the consultant\u2019s.", "MRBI based its timber damage estimate on sustainable harvest levels\u2014that is, on the harvest levels that could be maintained in perpetuity, taking into account the growth rate for new trees. MRBI used sustainable levels rather than actual levels\u2014which, on average, had significantly exceeded sustainable levels from 1942 through 1951\u2014because it assumed that the same losses would occur every year in perpetuity. The Cheyenne River Reservation\u2019s timber resources could not have supported the use of higher harvest levels in perpetuity; if harvesting had continued at recent levels, the reservation would quickly have run out of trees. MRBI\u2019s total damage estimate for timber was $689,625.", "In developing his damage estimate for timber, the consultant did not use MRBI\u2019s sustainable harvest levels. For example, in calculating the damage estimate for cordwood, he assumed that 400 households would each need 11.3 cords of wood annually, or a total of 4,520 cords per year, for heating and cooking. Since the tribe lost 90 percent of its timber as a result of the taking, he calculated an annual loss for cordwood of 4,068 cords. However, he did not present any evidence that the timber supply in the taking area could sustain this level of harvesting in perpetuity. Table 1 compares MRBI\u2019s sustainable harvest levels with the consultant\u2019s harvest levels.

Nor can we separate the tribe\u2019s values for wildlife and wild products, as MRBI and the consultant separated theirs. \u201cThe value of game to the Indian people undoubtedly is less than the amount sportsmen spend for hunting game. Reservation Indians probably are more skilled hunters than the average sportsmen, use less costly equipment, and no hotel bills or long distance travel are incident to their hunting activities. Sportsmen\u2019s expenditures therefor are not considered a sound basis for arriving at the value of game to Indians. The loss to Indians from the destruction of wildlife is taken to be the value to them of the annual wildlife harvest which they obtain. This value may be measured by the additional amounts which the Indians will have to pay for food to replace that previously supplied by the destroyed wildlife resources.\u201d", "MRBI\u2019s values were about 50 percent lower than the FWS report\u2019s values for big game (deer) and about 70 percent lower for upland game (e.g., pheasants, rabbits, and squirrels).

A key question in evaluating the consultant\u2019s adjustment for consumer surplus is whether it accurately reflects the tribe\u2019s consumer surplus in the 1950s. In his report, the consultant acknowledges that information is not available to determine the tribe\u2019s true consumer surplus in the 1950s. Therefore, to approximate it, he used information from a 1985 report on the consumer surplus associated with sportsmen\u2019s hunting and fishing trips in North Dakota.However, the consultant presented no evidence that this estimate reasonably approximates the tribe\u2019s consumer surplus associated with timber, wildlife, and wild products in 1954."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Secondary Approach Relies on Tribe\u2019s 1954 Request", "paragraphs": ["The consultant\u2019s secondary approach, which relies on the tribe\u2019s 1954 request for compensation, is generally consistent with the alternative approach we proposed in our 1991 report except that it provides a single figure rather than a range for additional compensation.

Instead, it was provided more generally to raise the tribe\u2019s standard of living\u2014that is, to establish the Indians economically on an equal footing with their non-Indian neighbors. For example, rehabilitation funds were used to provide business loans, educational loans, and welfare payments.", "The additional payment ranges shown in table 2 reflect the present value, under alternative investment options, of the additional payment that the tribe might have received in 1954. The inflation rate, which produced the lower value, indicates how much the tribe would need today to equal the purchasing power of a payment received in 1954.

Section 1 of the settlement act (P.L. 83-776) stipulated that to become effective, the agreements contained in the law had to be ratified by at least three-quarters of the adult members of the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe. The voting was not limited to male tribal members. According to the voting results certified by the tribe and the Bureau of Indian Affairs, as of February 4, 1955, over three-quarters of the adult tribal members (1,847 out of 2,375, or 77.8 percent) had voted to approve the settlement act. Only 152 members voted to disapprove the settlement, and the remaining 376 ballots were incomplete or were not returned. 2. In response to this comment on our 1991 report by the consultant for Fort Berthold, we stated the following. \u201c. . . concerning the use of a zero or negative rate of discount by tribes on the Wind River and Flathead reservations, we note that, in deriving an estimate of the value of their land, the Fort Berthold tribes used a 4-percent capitalization rate. Thus, the possibility that the tribes would have used a capitalization rate of zero or less is questionable.\u201d", "3. The earliest instance we found of the tribe\u2019s using a 4-percent discount rate was in November 1952, when the tribe used that rate in calculating the damage estimate used in the settlement contract it proposed at the final negotiation conference in Washington, D.C. The tribe\u2019s entire seven-member negotiating committee was present, as was the tribe\u2019s attorney, Mr. Case. According to the tribe\u2019s minutes of the conference, after presenting a breakdown of the tribe\u2019s damage estimate, the Chairman for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe requested that Mr. Case discuss how the damage estimate was calculated. After Mr. Case had finished, the Chairman also explained how the tribal negotiators had arrived at their damage estimate. The earliest instance we found of MRBI\u2019s use of a 4-percent discount rate was in April 1954, when MRBI calculated damages for the Cheyenne River Reservation, almost a year and a half after the tribe used this rate. 4. We recognize that the tribe was under duress to reach a final settlement, but in developing its damage estimates, the tribe appears to have been free to ask for as much money as it believed it was entitled to. The tribe increased its damage estimate between 1952 and 1954. 5. Using the inflation rate to calculate the low end of the additional payment range does provide the Congress with meaningful information to consider in determining possible payments for the tribe. How dollar values are adjusted from 1954 to 1996 depends on what assumption is made about how the tribe would have used the additional funds if it had received them in 1954. The low-end calculation, using the inflation rate, is based on the assumption that the tribe would have spent the money instead of investing it. Therefore, information on the payment that the tribe would need today to maintain its 1954 purchasing power is relevant.", "According to MRBI, the tribe spent nearly all of its original $10.5 million payment in less than 5 years. MRBI reported that as of June 30, 1960, the tribe had $1.06 million of its settlement funds remaining on deposit in the U.S. Treasury. The settlement funds were not appropriated until late 1955, and through June 30, 1960, they had earned $859,062 in interest. 6. We believe that taking into account the tribe\u2019s consumer surplus can be an important component of this type of economic analysis. However, as we point out and as the consultant acknowledged in his report, the lack of historical information makes it impossible to determine the tribe\u2019s consumer surplus for timber products, wildlife, and wild products in the 1950s. Therefore, assigning a value for these losses using contemporary information is arbitrary. Because of the difficulties in trying to recalculate the tribe\u2019s losses after more than 40 years, we believe that the estimates prepared in the 1950s provide a better basis for addressing the issue of additional compensation than contemporary estimates based on insupportable assumptions. 7. MRBI Report No. 117, dated June 1951, did report the results of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) report issued in January 1951. However, MRBI Report No. 117 did not \u201cutilize\u201d that information to establish values for the wildlife losses at Cheyenne River. The report that contained MRBI\u2019s complete evaluation of the damages to the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe was MRBI Report No. 138, dated April 1954. MRBI Report No. 138 also contained the results of the FWS report, as did MRBI Report No. 117. MRBI Report No. 138 used the FWS report in evaluating the wildlife losses the tribe would sustain. In doing so, MRBI concluded that FWS\u2019 method of valuing wildlife losses, based on sportsmen\u2019s expenditures for hunting, was not appropriate for determining the tribe\u2019s wildlife losses.", "MRBI Report No. 138 found that the sportsmen\u2019s expenditure values used by FWS overstated the tribe\u2019s losses because the Indian people were more efficient hunters and therefore gathered wildlife at less cost than sportsmen. Moreover, the MRBI report concluded that since the wildlife were primarily used as food, determining the replacement cost for the lost food supply would be an appropriate method for valuing the tribe\u2019s wildlife losses. These assumptions are reasonable in our view. 8. The consultant did not offer any evidence that the timber harvest levels used in his analysis could be sustained in perpetuity. Although he reiterated his concerns about how the volume of timber in the taking area was determined, he did not provide any information on how the overall timber volume should be adjusted. Instead, he set aside the government\u2019s sustainable yield levels, thereby assuming, in effect, that the tribe had an infinite supply of timber that it could consume at recent harvest levels in perpetuity. We believe that this assumption is questionable and that the damage estimate for timber products should be based on sustainable yield levels."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["In response to Senator Daschle\u2019s request we assessed the consultant\u2019s two approaches for calculating additional compensation for the Cheyenne River Sioux tribe for damages caused by the taking of 104,420 acres of their reservation for the Oahe reservoir. As agreed, we did not address the question of whether additional compensation should be provided or evaluate the adequacy of the original compensation amount appropriated by the Congress.", "We conducted audit work primarily at the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and College Park, Maryland.
