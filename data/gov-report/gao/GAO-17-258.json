While CMS provided these states with assistance, documented CMS transition guidance was not finalized until after the two states had completed their transition. The two states incurred costs of approximately $84.3 million, collectively, to transition to the federal platform. The two states' transition efforts included making changes to their Medicaid systems, with these states mainly relying on Medicaid matching funds from CMS to do this. While the selected states successfully transitioned, they encountered challenges during their transitions, due to accelerated transition time frames, difficulties reassigning marketplace responsibilities, delays in receiving approvals from CMS, and trouble accessing historical consumer data in previous vendor-developed marketplace IT systems.", "CMS took steps to assist Hawaii and Oregon, as well as two states that GAO selected for review that operated state-based marketplaces, Minnesota and New York, in developing plans for marketplace IT system sustainability. CMS assisted these four states by consulting with the states' officials and providing oversight of their sustainability plans, financial audit reports, and risk assessments. However, CMS did not fully ensure the states provided complete sustainability plans and financial audit reports. Further, CMS did not base its risk assessments on fully defined processes. These weaknesses limit CMS's oversight and assurance that it can be informed of the state marketplaces' sustainability efforts.", "Although CMS established a process to monitor the performance of state-based marketplaces, CMS did not consistently follow its processes. For example, CMS did not ensure that the two selected states, Minnesota and New York, had developed, updated, and followed their performance measurement plans. Also, CMS did not conduct reviews to analyze the operational performance of these states' marketplace IT systems against an established set of parameters. Further, while CMS collected IT performance metrics from the two states, such as the number of electronic enrollments and website traffic volume, it did not link state metrics to goals or establish targets for performance. These weaknesses limit CMS's ability to determine if states' marketplace systems are performing efficiently, effectively, and to provide early warnings of potential problems (see table)."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that CMS take six actions: ensure that states provide complete sustainability plans; complete financial audit reports; fully define its risk assessment process; complete updated performance measurement plans; align metrics with goals; and conduct operational analysis reviews.

The act required the establishment of health  insurance exchanges, now commonly referred to as \u201cmarketplaces,\u201d in  each state by January 1, 2014. Marketplaces are required to allow  consumers and small employers to compare, select, and purchase health  insurance plans offered by participating private issuers of qualified health  plans. The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers  for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) is responsible for overseeing  the establishment and operation of these marketplaces, including a  federally facilitated marketplace in states that do not choose to operate  their own. For their part, states are responsible for undertaking various  efforts, including information technology (IT) projects needed to support  the establishment and operation of their marketplaces or connections to  the federal marketplace.", "PPACA places certain requirements on the design and function of the  marketplaces. For example, regardless of the type of marketplace  established, the marketplace must be able to determine individuals\u2019  eligibility and enroll them in health insurance plans, ensure qualified  health plans are certified, conduct consumer assistance and outreach,  and have the necessary IT infrastructure in place. In addition, the  marketplaces must be able to determine eligibility for other health  coverage programs, such as Medicaid or the State Children\u2019s Health  Insurance Program (CHIP).", "These marketplaces began facilitating enrollment on October 1, 2013, as  required by a regulation implementing PPACA. In addition, the  marketplaces were to be self-sustaining beginning January 1, 2015.  However, we found that in the first few enrollment periods, all states faced  difficulties with the rollout and operation of their marketplace IT, and a  number of states that struggled with the implementation of their  marketplaces are now using the federal platform.", "Recognizing states\u2019 marketplace efforts, you requested that we review  CMS\u2019s and states\u2019 actions related to implementing the marketplaces. Our  objectives for this review were to: (1) describe what actions CMS has  taken, if any, to assist states that have chosen to transition to a  marketplace IT platform different from the one they originally used and  identify the costs and challenges for states in making this transition; (2)  assess what actions CMS has taken to assist selected states\u2019 plans to  ensure that the development and operations of marketplace IT systems  can be financially self-sustained; and (3) assess the steps that CMS has  taken to monitor the performance of the states\u2019 marketplace IT systems.", "To address the objectives, we reviewed marketplace activities conducted  by a selection of the 17 states that operated their own marketplaces as of  March 2016. To make the state selections, we considered four factors for  the plan year 2016 enrollment period: total enrollment, total federal  marketplace grant dollars, a previous GAO review, and whether or not the  state transitioned its marketplace to the federal platform. State  enrollment numbers were sorted from highest to lowest for each of the 17  states and then used to divide states into four groups. Within each  group, we selected the states with the highest total federal marketplace  grant dollars awarded. We excluded states that had been included in a  recent GAO review of state health insurance marketplace IT. We also  ensured the selection included states that transitioned to the federal  platform. The selection resulted in two states using state-based  marketplaces (Minnesota and New York) and two states that had  transitioned from state-based marketplaces to using the federal platform  (Hawaii and Oregon). The four selected states were based on a  nongeneralizable sample and, thus, findings from our assessments of  these states cannot be used to make inferences about the full population  of all state marketplaces.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed CMS\u2019s transition  guidance that was distributed to all states. We also reviewed the actions  CMS and states performed, such as communications and transition planning for the two selected states\u2014Hawaii and Oregon\u2014that  transitioned from state-based to federal marketplace IT systems. Further,  to determine associated transition costs for the states, we reviewed  CMS\u2019s and the selected states\u2019 relevant budget and grant documentation.  We interviewed marketplace officials within the two selected states to  further identify reported transition costs and challenges faced during their  transitions. In addition, we interviewed CMS officials regarding identified  challenges and their actions to assist the two states in addressing them.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed CMS\u2019s guidance and  assistance to states regarding financial self-sustainability. Specifically, we  reviewed CMS\u2019s procedures for financial audit and sustainability plan  collection, risk assessments, and sustainability consults. We also  reviewed the four selected states\u2019 development plans, plans for  sustainability, financials audits, and grant documentation. We then  compared the states\u2019 actions to applicable laws, regulation, leading  practices, and CMS guidance. We analyzed CMS\u2019s sustainability  guidance provided to all states, as well as the four selected states\u2019  sustainability plans. To understand how CMS monitors the four selected  states\u2019 efforts in sustaining the marketplaces, we observed CMS\u2019s and  these states\u2019 web-based management tools for reporting and tracking  marketplace self-sustainability.", "For the third objective, we analyzed CMS guidance provided to state- based marketplaces which called for the monitoring and tracking of the  performance of their marketplace IT systems. We also analyzed the  selected states\u2019 system performance measurement plans and reports,  where available. In this regard, our evaluation included Minnesota and  New York, which operated state-based marketplace IT systems, but did  not include Hawaii and Oregon, which relied on the federal marketplace  IT platform operated by CMS and, thus, did not independently collect  system performance metrics.

These marketplaces were intended to provide a seamless, single  point of access for individuals to enroll in private health plans and apply  for income-based financial assistance established under the law. CMS  reported that around 12.7 million individuals applied to enroll in healthcare  coverage for plan year 2016.", "PPACA and HHS regulations and guidance required each marketplace to  be able to carry out four key functions, among others:  1.  Eligibility and enrollment. Assess and determine an individual\u2019s  enrollment eligibility, enroll eligible individuals in coverage, and certify  private health insurance plans for participation in the marketplace.  2.  Plan management. Provide services for activities such as submitting,  monitoring, and renewing qualified health plans.  3.  Financial management. Facilitate payments to health insurance  issuers as well as provide services such as payment calculation for  risk-adjustment analysis and cost-sharing reductions for individual  enrollments.  4.  Consumer assistance. Provide assistance to consumers in  completing an application, obtaining eligibility determinations,  comparing coverage options, and enrolling in coverage.", "To provide these capabilities, PPACA further required the states  establishing marketplaces, as well as CMS, to design, develop,  implement, and operate health insurance marketplace IT systems.", "States have some flexibility as to the marketplace types, such as:", "State-based marketplaces.

These  states initially elected to develop their own state marketplace systems,  but due to IT, financial, or other challenges, subsequently decided to  use the federal platform to perform certain eligibility and enrollment  functionalities. Issuers of health insurance in these states offer plans  through the federal platform and are charged a user fee by CMS for  the services and benefits they provide. These states also have the  authority to collect user fees beyond those collected by CMS. Federal  responsibilities, carried out by CMS, include managing the federal IT  platform, call center infrastructure, and eligibility determinations. The  states must maintain websites that provide information to consumers  and direct them to HealthCare.gov to apply for and enroll in  coverage. In addition, these states must coordinate with CMS on  outreach strategies to reach existing and new consumers; maintain  data and timely reporting for all coverage years prior to the transition;  and work with issuers to ensure they are prepared to transition to the  federal platform and exchange enrollment data with CMS.", "Federally facilitated marketplaces. These states elected not to  develop their own platform and use the federally facilitated  marketplace\u2014the federal IT platform, including the website,  HealthCare.gov.", "Federally facilitated partnerships. These states are a variation of  the federally facilitated marketplaces, whereby CMS establishes and  generally operates the marketplaces and the states assist CMS with  operating various functions, such as plan management and consumer  assistance. In these cases, states rely to varying degrees on the  systems developed by CMS to support the federally facilitated  marketplaces and the federal government keeps the user fees paid by  the insurers.", "For plan year 2016, utilizing state and CMS documentation, we  categorized 27 states as having federally facilitated marketplaces, 7 as  having federally facilitated partnerships, 13 as having state-based  marketplaces, and 4 as having state-based marketplaces using the  federal platform.

Grantees draw down funds from preauthorized grant  accounts monitored by CMS, and report financial and performance  information to the agency. States are allowed to request a no-cost  grant extension in order to use remaining approved federal funds to  complete project goals and objectives. CMS reviews each no-cost  extension request to ensure that expenses are allowable, correctly  allocated, and reasonable based on PPACA and CMS grant rules and  policies.

Because states\u2019 Medicaid systems had to be replaced or  modernized to meet PPACA requirements, CMS expanded the availability  of the 90/10 funding for states to make changes to improve Medicaid  eligibility IT systems, including the connection to the federal  marketplace. In addition, a state could receive funding in the form of a  75 percent federal matching rate for the maintenance and any ongoing  costs of operating its upgraded Medicaid eligibility and enrollment system.  The funding is generally available when the upgraded system becomes  operational. States were also allowed to use Medicaid funds when they  transitioned to a different marketplace type since the transition costs were  related to updating state Medicaid eligibility systems to be compatible with  the federal platform.", "Revenue through user fees: PPACA authorized state-based  marketplaces to charge assessments, or user fees, such as a percentage  or a flat monthly rate to participating insurance issuers. For the selected  states to sustain their marketplaces, Hawaii charged a user fee of 3.5  percent per insurance plan, Minnesota charged a 3.5 percent user fee,  and Oregon charged a user fee of $9.66 per member per month.

For example, the oversight and monitoring plan did not include  metrics that New York IT officials said they use to monitor the  performance of marketplace IT systems, such as metrics related to  defect creation and remediation, the number of batch jobs, electronic  data interface files that were rejected, and notices and related  backlogs. These metrics were not documented or tied to performance  goals or targets in a plan.", "In addition, according to New York marketplace officials, the goal of  the IT service-level agreement metrics for its contractor is to ensure  that consumers can readily and easily access the health insurance  application and systems needed to enroll in coverage.

The officials said that  Minnesota had not updated its performance measurement plan as  requested and that it falls upon the state to ensure that service level  agreement metrics are met, and if not met, that corrective actions will be  taken.", "In addition, the officials stated that, instead of a performance  measurement plan, the agency reviewed New York\u2019s IT contractor service  level agreements, which represented the state\u2019s operational metrics.  However, CMS did not ensure that these metrics were tied to  performance goals in a plan in accordance with leading practices.  Further, according to CMS officials, the Enterprise Life Cycle required  project measurement plans in the planning and design phase, but not in  the operations and maintenance phase, and operational states were not  required to submit updated performance measurement plans. However,  while CMS\u2019s Enterprise Life Cycle guidance did not explicitly require  states to update performance measurement plans during operations and  maintenance, leading practices stress that it is important to have updated  performance measurement plans to properly assess effectiveness in  meeting stated operational goals.", "Because CMS had not ensured that states documented, updated, and  followed performance measurement plans for their state marketplace  systems, the agency did not have the assurance that states had taken a  holistic approach to developing performance metrics to assess actual  results as compared to intended goals.

Instead of conducting operational analysis  reviews, the agency developed OTS reports in November 2015 regarding  selected states\u2019 systems to prepare for the 2016 open enrollment period.  The reports included discussions of these states\u2019 system performance.  For example, the OTS report for Minnesota included a summary of the  state\u2019s system functionality and performance. Specifically, the report  noted that Minnesota discovered quality issues with the software used for  eligibility determinations and put a plan in place to remedy quality issues.  In addition, the report noted that Minnesota was using scenarios to test  site performance and assessing whether the system had sufficient  capacity to meet business needs.", "For New York, the OTS report included a summary of the state\u2019s system  functionality, system performance, and stability of application bandwidth  to handle peak volumes. It discussed business value, such as the number  of eligibility determinations (2.7 million eligibility determinations, and over  78.9 percent enrolled in a health care plan).

HHS stated that it will continue to provide  technical assistance to state marketplaces regarding independent  financial audits. The department also stated that it will refine its  marketplace self-sustainability risk assessment processes to provide  greater insight into the state marketplace sustainability efforts and to  identify areas where states may need assistance. Taking steps to provide  technical assistance to the states is important and CMS\u2019s efforts to refine  the risk assessment processes can provide greater insight into the state  marketplace sustainability efforts and areas of needed assistance.", "HHS partially concurred with our fourth recommendation that CMS ensure  that states develop, update, and follow performance measurement plans  that allow the states to continuously identify and assess the most  important IT metrics for their state marketplaces. While HHS did not  specifically identify which aspects of our recommendation it concurred  with and which it did not concur with, the department stated that, as part  of its Enterprise Life Cycle framework, state marketplaces were required  to submit performance measurement plans during the planning and  design phases. The department also stated that it will continue to monitor  the state marketplaces\u2019 IT metrics in the implementation phase. For the  state marketplaces that are in the operations and maintenance phase, it  stated that each marketplace is accountable for managing and reporting  its own IT metrics in accordance with federal and state law.", "The department also emphasized its consideration of states\u2019 variations in  marketplace systems and reporting capabilities and the associated  burden of reporting IT metrics. However, as we noted in our report, CMS  and certain states were not always able to provide evidence of  performance measurement plans that were in accordance with the  agency\u2019s policy, nor was evidence always provided that these states  updated and followed their performance measurement plans according to  best practices. While CMS required submission of performance  measurement plans in the planning and design phases, best practices  state that performance measurement plans should be continuously  updated and followed. Without ensuring that the states documented,  updated, and followed performance measurement plans, CMS may not  have reasonable assurance that the states established IT metrics to  assess their results compared to their intended goals for their  marketplace systems.", "HHS also partially concurred with our sixth recommendation that CMS  ensure that metrics collected from the states to monitor marketplaces\u2019  operational performance link to performance goals and include baselines  and targets to monitor progress. HHS did not specifically identify which  aspects of our recommendation it concurred with and did not concur with;  however, the department stated that, while it requests performance  measures from the state marketplaces, once the marketplaces are  operational, states are responsible for monitoring their own performance  measures. HHS also stated that it will continue to review IT metrics of  state marketplaces in the implementation phase of their systems, but  emphasized the burden on states and variations in state system reporting  capabilities. However, as we noted in our report, CMS did not ensure that  the metrics it is collecting from the states are linked to performance goals  as suggested by best practices. Without this linkage, the agency may  continue to be limited in its ability to monitor whether the state systems  are performing efficiently and effectively. Additionally, CMS may miss the  opportunity to refine its current IT metrics collection to better balance its  need for visibility into states\u2019 performance without unnecessarily  burdening states.", "HHS did not concur with our first recommendation that CMS ensure that  state-based marketplace annual sustainability plans, to the extent  possible, have complete 5-year budget forecasts. The department stated  that it has updated its requirements, and is now requesting 2-year budget  forecasts instead of 5-year budget forecasts. It also stated that this is part  of a new streamlined and simplified process to collect timely, accurate,  and relevant data while taking into consideration the burden on states and  the variations in state budget cycles. However, CMS did not provide  documented evidence of this process or justification for stating that a 5- year budget is not a reasonable time frame for sustainability planning.  This also contradicts previous CMS blueprint guidance for state  marketplace approval. While asking states for a 2-year budget instead of  a 5-year budget may streamline the process and be less of a burden on  states to provide complete budgets, the shorter time frame may not fully  inform CMS oversight of the long-term financial sustainability and  associated risks for marketplaces, which are new systems that face  multiple uncertainties.", "Further, if CMS does not take steps to ensure that states provide  sustainability plans with complete 5-year budget forecasts, per its 2016  sustainability guidance, then it may not be fully informed of the state- based marketplaces\u2019 sustainability factors. Incomplete sustainability plans  may also limit the agency\u2019s ability to assess and respond to state  marketplace sustainability risks. Thus, we continue to believe that CMS  should ensure that state-based marketplace sustainability plans have, to  the extent possible, complete 5-year budget forecasts.", "Lastly, HHS did not concur with our fifth recommendation that CMS  conduct operational analysis reviews and systematically monitor the  performance of states\u2019 marketplace IT systems using key performance  indicators. The department stated that it conducts Open Enrollment  Readiness Reviews to assess marketplace key performance indicators,  which, according to CMS officials, are similar to operational analysis  reviews. However, as we noted in our report, Open Enrollment Readiness  Reviews did not systematically report the key performance indicators or  include discussions of other elements of operational analysis reviews,  such as how objectives could be better met or costs could be saved. In  not ensuring that these reviews include clearly identified key performance  indicators, CMS may miss an opportunity to perform strategic analysis of  the states\u2019 utilization of their marketplace systems and it may continue to  have limited assurance that these states\u2019 systems are performing in an  effective and efficient manner. Therefore, we continue to believe that  CMS should conduct operational analysis reviews, as required by its  guidance, to systematically monitor the performance of states\u2019  marketplace IT systems using key performance indicators.", "HHS also provided technical comments, which we incorporated in the  report as appropriate.", "We also provided relevant excerpts of this product to each of the four  states included in our review\u2014Hawaii, Minnesota, New York, and  Oregon\u2014and received responses, via e-mail or in writing, from all four  states.", "In written comments, the State of Hawaii\u2019s Department of Labor and  Industrial Relations noted that the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s IT  provider would be turning over consumer data to the state by the end  of June 2017. The department also indicated that the sustainability  budget discussed in our findings was prepared by the Hawaii Health  Connector and not the state. The department further commented that  the state submitted a sustainability budget in April 2016 that included  complete forecasts through 2019, and that this budget was updated in  May 2016. Further, it said that the updated budget only reflected 2016  as Hawaii planned to operate as a federally facilitated marketplace  and no longer needed to plan for financial sustainability.", "We noted in our report that the Hawaii Health Connector\u2019s IT provider  plans to turn over consumer data to the state by the end of June  2017. We also recognize that the April 2016 sustainability budget had  the required budget forecast. However, our discussion of the Hawaii  sustainability budget referred to the more recent and updated  sustainability budget that the state prepared in May 2016. With regard  to Hawaii\u2019s April 2016 budget, the budget was based on revenue  assumptions, such as state funding from the legislature that had not  been approved at the time of its submission and, thus, required  revision once those uncertainties were resolved in May 2016.", "With regard to the applicability of our findings for the May 2016  budget, Hawaii did not officially begin the transition to a federally  facilitated marketplace until June 2016, and was still operating as a  state-based marketplace at the time the May 2016 budget was  revised. In addition, as indicated by CMS\u2019s 5-year budget template  and sustainability guidance, the sustainability budget should include  forecasted years. According to CMS officials, they use this data to  inform its sustainability risk assessments. By not showing the total  effect of certain assumptions or outcomes across all forecasted years,  such as the decision of the state legislature to not fund marketplace  operations, the marketplace missed an opportunity to demonstrate the  total negative impact on the marketplace sustainably and associated  budget numbers. In that way, a fully forecasted budget could have  served as evidence of Hawaii\u2019s justification for transitioning to a  federally facilitated marketplace. The State of Hawaii Department of  Labor and Industrial Relations\u2019 comments are reprinted in appendix  III.", "In written comments, the state of Minnesota\u2019s MNsure marketplace  noted that the organization continues to focus on making  improvements related to accountability and transparency, including in  areas such as federal and state audit reporting for the marketplace.  Minnesota provided additional comments in which the marketplace  noted that its 3-year budget sustainability plans show that the  marketplace is and will be sustainable. While Minnesota\u2019s  marketplace may have policies that do not align with CMS\u2019s  requirements for projected budget time frames, it is nonetheless  important that the states submit information as required to the agency  so that CMS officials can perform oversight of states\u2019 marketplace  sustainability in a consistent manner. Further, the shorter time frame  may not fully inform CMS oversight, including risk assessments and  responses, of the long-term financial sustainability for marketplaces.", "MNsure also disagreed with our characterization of Minnesota\u2019s  independent financial audit as not specific to the state\u2019s marketplace.  The marketplace provided details, including statements of the  sufficiency of its state financial audit report because it is in adherence  with Minnesota\u2019s state statutes and financial policies. Additionally,  MNsure officials stated that alternate audits may detail relevant audit  information. However, CMS\u2019s guidance specifically requires states to  develop an annual financial audit report specific to the marketplace as  one of the primary sources for evaluating a state marketplace\u2019s  financial sustainability. As we stated in our report, if MNsure does not  provide complete financial audits specific to the marketplace, CMS  may not have the necessary transparency into marketplace IT-related  financial activities such as receipts, expenditures, internal controls,  and financial policies and procedures. MNsure\u2019s comments are  reprinted in appendix IV. In addition, technical comments provided by  marketplace officials were incorporated into our final report as  appropriate.", "In e-mail comments, the Executive Director of the New York State of  Health marketplace disagreed with our conclusion that the New York  marketplace did not have a performance measurement plan that  directly tied to goals. The Executive Director stated that the state\u2019s  overall goals were to enroll New Yorkers in coverage and reduce the  rate of uninsured persons in the state. However, these stated goals  were not documented nor were they tied to any specific metrics, as  noted in our report. Until New York\u2019s marketplace has documented  these goals in a performance measurement plan with clear ties to its  metrics, CMS may not have visibility into New York\u2019s marketplace  performance metrics which state officials said guide their decision  making and operations, or be able to ascertain that the state  continuously assessed and adjusted performance metrics and targets  as appropriate.", "The Executive Director also noted that the New York marketplace  could not reconcile the amounts provided by CMS for their state.

We selected these 4 states from the 17 states that operated their  own marketplaces as of March 2016. To make the state selections, we  considered four selection factors for the plan year 2016 enrollment period:  total enrollment, total federal marketplace grant dollars, a previous GAO  review, and whether or not the state transitioned its marketplace to the  federal platform.", "Specifically, we first sorted states operating marketplaces by enrollment  levels, from highest to lowest, based on plan year 2016 numbers reported  by the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). We then  divided the states into four groups. Within each group, we sorted the  states from highest to lowest by the total amount of federal marketplace  grant funds awarded and selected the state with the highest amount of  awarded grant funding. In two cases, we selected the state with the  second highest federal marketplace grant award in the group because the  states with the highest award levels had been included in a recent GAO  review of state health insurance marketplace IT security and privacy. We  also reviewed selected states to verify that the states used different  systems integrator contractors. The selection resulted in two states that  transitioned to using the federal platform (Hawaii and Oregon) and two  that remained the same (Minnesota and New York). The four selected  states were based on a nongeneralized sample and, thus, findings from  our assessments of these states cannot be used to make inferences  about to the full population of all state marketplaces.", "To assess the reliability of CMS\u2019s data on state marketplace enrollment  figures, we reviewed the agency\u2019s data and interviewed state marketplace  officials for the four selected states and asked how the state-reported  enrollment figures were utilized in their sustainability plans. We  determined that the data were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.", "To assess the reliability of CMS\u2019s data on grant funds awarded and state- reported IT spending to establish, support, and connect to marketplaces,  we assessed the reliability of the systems used to collect the information.  We asked officials responsible for entering and reviewing the grants  information in these systems a series of questions about the accuracy  and reliability of the data.", "Among the sources of data used for our study, we reviewed a  spreadsheet compiled by CMS\u2019s Center for Consumer Information and  Insurance Oversight (CCIIO) officials that contained state-reported grant  funding data and marketplace IT project status information drawn from  two separate information systems: CMS\u2019s Grant Solutions and the  Payment Management System. The spreadsheet was a consistent  source of information that reflected the same cost factors for all states as  of October 2016. Specifically, the spreadsheet tracked, among other  things, the type and total amount of grant funding provided and available  to each state, deobligated grant funding, as well as the time period for  expending those funds. We also reviewed the data to determine if there  were any outliers and other obvious errors in the data. For any anomalies  in the data, we followed up with CMS officials to either understand or  correct those anomalies. We determined that the data were sufficiently  reliable for our purposes and noted any limitations in our report. While our  report discusses state-reported IT spending based on CMS data, we did  not verify the accuracy of the data states reported to CMS.", "To address the first objective, we obtained and analyzed CMS\u2019s transition  guidance that was distributed to assist all states. We also reviewed the  actions CMS and states performed, such as communications and  transition planning for the two selected states\u2014Hawaii and Oregon\u2014that  transitioned from state-based to federal marketplace IT systems. To  identify transition guidance and transition costs for the states, we also  observed CMS\u2019s and the selected state\u2019s management tools, such as the  Collaborative Application Lifecycle Tool, State-based Marketplace Annual  Reporting Tool (SMART), Payment Management System, and Grant  Solutions, for reporting and tracking of grant funding. In addition, we  reviewed relevant CMS and state budget and grant documentation to  determine associated transition costs. We also interviewed state  marketplace officials within the two selected states to further identify  transition costs and challenges faced during their transitions. We also  interviewed CMS officials regarding identified challenges and their actions  to assist the states in addressing them.", "To address the second objective, we reviewed the four selected states\u2019  sustainability plans and CMS sustainability guidance provided to the  states. To identify states\u2019 plans for self-sustainability we reviewed  development plans, financials audits, and grant documentation. To  identify CMS sustainability guidance we reviewed the agency\u2019s  procedures for financial audit and sustainability plan collection, risk  assessments, and sustainability consults. We compared CMS financial  audit collection against applicable laws, regulation, and agency  guidance. We also compared sustainability plan collection and risk  assessments against leading practices. To understand how CMS  monitors state sustainability, we observed its and the four selected states\u2019  web-based management tools, such as SMART, Payment Management System, and Grant Solutions, for reporting and tracking of state  marketplace self-sustainability. To determine the reliability of state  sustainability plans, we reviewed the plans and relevant source data for  anomalies and outliers, as well as related documentation including state  audits and budgets. We also interviewed CMS and selected state officials  regarding collection and processing of the data. We determined that the  data in the sustainability plans were sufficiently reliable except where  noted in our report.", "For the third objective, we reviewed CMS guidance provided to the state- based marketplaces which called for the monitoring and tracking of the  performance of states marketplace IT systems. We identified steps CMS  established for monitoring the performance of states\u2019 IT systems. We  compared the steps established by CMS to leading practices identified in  our prior work and by the Office of Management and Budget. In  addition, where available, we reviewed the two selected states\u2019 system  performance measurement plans and reports. This included Minnesota  and New York\u2014which operated state-based marketplace IT systems\u2014 and did not include Hawaii and Oregon\u2014which relied on the federal  marketplace IT platform operated by CMS and did not collect system  performance metrics. We reviewed the use of tools such as CMS\u2019s  Collaborative Application Lifecycle Tool and Open Enrollment Weekly  Indicators reports to facilitate the monitoring of state marketplace  operations and performance. We analyzed whether CMS ensured that  states followed leading practices for IT performance measurement  guidance by assessing evidence of CMS and the two selected states\u2019  marketplace performance measurement plans and reporting.", "To determine the reliability of state performance metrics reports, we  reviewed the selected states\u2019 reports for anomalies or missing data and  conducted interviews with CMS and selected state officials regarding the  collection and processing of the data. We determined that the data in the  performance metrics reports were sufficiently reliable.
