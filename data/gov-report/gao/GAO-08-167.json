Pursuant to the Accountability of Tax Dollars Act of 2002, SEC is required to prepare and submit to Congress and the Office of Management and Budget audited financial statements. GAO agreed, under its audit authority, to perform the audit of SEC's financial statements. GAO's audit was done to determine whether, in all material respects, (1) SEC's fiscal year 2007 financial statements were reliable and (2) SEC's management maintained effective internal control over financial reporting and compliance with laws and regulations. GAO also tested SEC's compliance with certain laws and regulations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["In GAO's opinion, SEC's fiscal year 2007 and 2006 financial statements were fairly presented in all material respects. However, because of a material weakness in internal control over SEC's financial reporting process, in GAO's opinion, SEC did not have effective internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2007. Recommendations for corrective action will be included in a separate report. Although certain compliance controls should be improved, SEC did maintain in all material respects effective internal control over compliance with laws and regulations material in relation to the financial statements as of September 30, 2007. In addition, GAO did not find reportable instances of noncompliance with the laws and regulations it tested. In its 2006 report, GAO reported on weaknesses in the areas of SEC's (1) recording and reporting of disgorgements and penalties, (2) information systems controls, and (3) property and equipment controls. During fiscal year 2007, SEC improved its controls over the accuracy, timeliness, and completeness of the disgorgement and penalty data and used a much improved database for the initial recording and tracking of these data. However, the processing of these data for financial reporting purposes is still done through a manual process that is prone to error. GAO found that the internal controls that compensated for the manual processing of the related accounts receivable balances in fiscal year 2006 were not effective in fiscal year 2007. This issue is included in the material weakness in SEC's financial reporting process for fiscal year 2007. Other control deficiencies included in this material weakness concern SEC's period-end closing process, accounting for transaction fee revenue, and preparation of financial statement disclosures. GAO also identified three significant deficiencies in internal control during fiscal year 2007. Although SEC has taken steps to strengthen its information security, some of the weaknesses identified in GAO's previous audit persisted and GAO found new weaknesses during this year's audit. Therefore, GAO is reporting information security as a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. In addition, GAO continued to identify the same weaknesses in controls over property and equipment and therefore considers this area a significant deficiency as of September 30, 2007. GAO also identified a new significant deficiency concerning SEC's accounting for budgetary transactions. In commenting on a draft of this report, SEC's Chairman emphasized SEC's commitment to enhance its controls in all operational areas and to ensure reliability of financial reporting, soundness of operations, and public confidence in SEC's mission."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["This report presents our opinion on whether the financial statements of  the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for the fiscal years ended  September 30, 2007, and 2006 are presented fairly, in all material respects,  in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

Circular No. A-127 further  states that financial systems must have common data elements, common  transaction processing, consistent internal controls, and efficient  transaction entry, and that reports produced by the systems shall provide  financial data that can be traced directly to the general ledger accounts.", "SEC\u2019s period-end financial reporting process for recording transactions,  maintaining account balances, and preparing financial statements and  disclosures are supported to varying degrees by a collection of automated  systems that are not integrated or compatible with its general ledger  system. These automated systems\u2019 lack of integration and compatibility  require that extensive compensating manual and labor-intensive  accounting procedures, involving large spreadsheets and numerous  posting and routine correcting journal entries, dominate SEC\u2019s period-end  financial reporting process. Some of SEC\u2019s subsidiary systems, such as  that for property and equipment and for disgorgements and penalties, do  not share common data elements and common transaction processing  with the general ledger system. Therefore, intermediary information  processing steps, including extensive use of spreadsheets, manipulation of  data, and manual journal entries, are needed to process the information in  SEC\u2019s general ledger. This processing complicates review of the  transactions and greatly increases the risk that the transactions are not  recorded completely, properly, or consistently, ultimately affecting the  reliability of the data presented in the financial statements. Our  identification this year of errors in SEC\u2019s calculation of disgorgement and  penalty accounts receivable, discussed below, illustrates this risk.", "The risk to data reliability is further increased because basic controls over  electronic data, such as worksheet and password protection, change  history, and controls over data verification, such as control totals and  record counts, were not consistently used during the data processing  between the source systems and the general ledger. In addition, currently,  SEC\u2019s general ledger has several unconventional posting models and other  limitations that prevent proper recording of certain transactions. As a  result, SEC\u2019s year-end reporting process requires extensive routine  correcting journal entries to correct errors created by incorrectly posted  transactions in its general ledger. We also noted that SEC\u2019s documentation  used to crosswalk individual accounts to the financial statement line items  contained an incorrect routing to a line item on SEC\u2019s Statement of  Budgetary Resources for SEC\u2019s year-end financial statement preparation  process, which caused a material error in SEC\u2019s draft financial statements.  Also, SEC did not have detailed written documentation of its  methodologies and processes for preparing financial statements and  disclosures, increasing the risk of inconsistent and improper reporting and  the risk that disruptions and error may arise when staff turnover occurs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Disgorgements and Penalties Accounts Receivable:", "paragraphs": ["As part of its enforcement responsibilities, SEC issues orders and  administers judgments ordering, among other things, disgorgements, civil  monetary penalties, and interest against violators of federal securities  laws. SEC recognizes a receivable when SEC is designated in an order or  a final judgment to collect the assessed disgorgements, penalties, and  interest. At September 30, 2007, the gross amount of disgorgements and  penalties accounts receivable was $330 million, with a corresponding  allowance of $266 million resulting in a net receivable of $64 million.", "In our reviews of the interim June 30, 2007, and year-end September 30,  2007, balances of accounts receivable for disgorgements and penalties, we  found errors in SEC\u2019s spreadsheet formulas resulting in overstatements of  these receivable balances for both periods. These errors consisted of  incorrectly changed spreadsheet formulas that affected the final calculated  balances. SEC subsequently detected and corrected the June 30 errors, but  then made different spreadsheet calculation errors in the year-end  balances as of September 30, 2007, which we detected as part of our audit.  SEC made adjustments to correct the errors, which were not material.  However, SEC\u2019s process for calculating its accounts receivable for  disgorgements and penalties presents a high risk that significant errors  could occur and not be detected. The main cause of these errors is the  breakdown this year in the manual controls that were intended to  compensate for the lack of an integrated accounting system for  disgorgements and penalties, as discussed above. Specifically, although  the journal entries posting the amounts to the general ledger were  reviewed, this review did not extend to the preparation of the spreadsheet  SEC used to document the accounts receivable calculation at June 30 and  September 30, 2007, and therefore, was not sufficient to detect significant  spreadsheet formula errors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Transaction Fee Revenue:", "paragraphs": ["As one of its sources of revenue, SEC collects securities transaction fees  paid by self-regulatory organizations (SRO) to SEC for stock transactions.  SRO transaction fees are payable to the SEC twice a year \u2013in March for the  previous months September through December, and in September for the  previous months January through August. Since the SROs are not required  to report the actual volume of transactions until 10 business days after  each month end, SEC estimates and records an amount receivable for fees  payable by the SROs to SEC for activity during the month of September. At  September 30, 2007, SEC estimated this receivable amount at $100.6  million. Based on information SEC received in mid-October concerning  the actual volume of transactions, the amount of claims receivable at  September 30, 2007, should have been $74.4 million.  In previous years,  SEC made adjustments to reflect the actual volume of transactions;  however, SEC does not have written procedures to help ensure that this  adjustment is made as a routine part of its year-end financial reporting  process.  We proposed, and SEC posted, the necessary audit adjustment to  correct the amount of transaction fee revenue for fiscal year 2007.", "Statement on Auditing Standards No.1, Codification of Auditing  Standards and Procedures, which explains the accounting requirements  for subsequent events, requires that events or transactions that existed at  the date of the balance sheet and affect the estimates inherent in the  process of preparing financial statements should be considered for  adjustment to or disclosure in the financial statements through the date  that the financial statements are issued.

For example, in its  disclosure for Custodial Revenues and Liabilities, SEC improperly  excluded approximately $320 million in collections. In another example,  for its disclosure on Fund Balance with Treasury, SEC misclassified  approximately $90 million into incorrect line items. Also, in its disclosure  for Fiduciary Assets and Liabilities, SEC\u2019s beginning balances for Fund  Balance with Treasury and for Liability for Fiduciary Activity were each  misstated by $8.9 million due to errors in carrying forward ending  balances from September 30, 2006. SEC revised the financial statement  disclosures to correct the errors that we noted. We believe the cause of  these and numerous other errors in the disclosures is due mainly to the  lack of a documented timeline and process for completing the fiscal year  2007 financial statements and disclosures, including review of the  disclosures.

To  provide reasonable assurance that financial information and financial  assets are adequately safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse,  fraudulent use, improper disclosure, or destruction, effective information  security controls are essential. These controls include security  management, access controls, configuration management, physical  security, and contingency planning. Weaknesses in these controls can  impair the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of information used by  management and increase the potential for undetected material  misstatements in the agency\u2019s financial statements.", "During fiscal year 2007, SEC made important progress in mitigating certain  control weaknesses that were previously reported as unresolved at the  time of our prior review. For example, SEC developed a comprehensive  program for monitoring access activities to its computer network  environment, tested and evaluated the effectiveness of controls for the  general ledger system, and documented authorizations for software  modifications. SEC also took corrective action to restrict access to  sensitive files on its servers, change default database accounts that had  known or weak passwords, and apply strong encryption key management  practices for managing secure connections.", "Despite this progress, SEC has not consistently implemented certain key  information security controls to effectively safeguard the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of its financial and sensitive information and  information systems. During this year\u2019s audit, we identified continuing and  new information security weaknesses that increase the risk that (1)  computer resources (programs and data) will not be adequately protected  from unauthorized disclosure, modification, and destruction; (2) access to  facilities by unauthorized individuals will not be adequately controlled;  and (3) computer resources will not be adequately protected and  controlled to ensure the continuity of data processing operations when  unexpected interruptions occur. For example, SEC had not yet mitigated  weaknesses related to malicious code attacks on SEC\u2019s workstations, had  not yet adequately documented access privileges for a major application,  and had not yet implemented an effective intrusion detection system. New  control weaknesses in authorization, boundary protection, configuration  management, and audit and monitoring that we identified this year include  for example, the use of a single, shared user account for posting journal  vouchers in a financial application, inadequate patching of enterprise  databases, and inadequate auditing and monitoring capabilities on its  database servers. Lapses in physical security enabled unauthorized  network access from a publicly accessible location within SEC  Headquarters. In addition, SEC did not have contingency plans for key  desktops that support manual processes such as the preparation of  spreadsheets. These weaknesses existed, in part, because SEC has not yet  fully implemented its information security program.", "Collectively, these problems represent a significant deficiency in SEC\u2019s  internal control over information systems and data. Specifically, the  continuing and newly identified weaknesses decreased assurances  regarding the reliability of the data processed by the systems and  increased the risk that unauthorized individuals could gain access to  critical hardware and software and intentionally or inadvertently access,  alter, or delete sensitive data or computer programs. Until SEC  consistently implements all key elements of its information security  program, the information that is processed, stored, and transmitted on its  systems will remain vulnerable, and management will not have sufficient  assurance that financial information and financial assets are adequately  safeguarded from inadvertent or deliberate misuse, fraudulent use,  improper disclosure, or destruction. We will be issuing a separate report  on issues we identified regarding information security concerns at SEC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Property and Equipment", "paragraphs": ["SEC\u2019s property and equipment consists of general-purpose equipment  used by the agency; capital improvements made to buildings leased by  SEC for office space; and internal-use software development costs for  projects in development and production. SEC acquired approximately $27  million dollars in property and equipment during fiscal year 2007.", "Similar to our last year\u2019s audit, during the course of testing fiscal year 2007  additions, we noted numerous instances of inaccuracies in recorded  acquisition costs and dates for property and equipment purchases, as well  as unrecorded property and equipment purchases, and errors in amounts  capitalized and amortized for internal-use software projects. In addition,  errors were carried forward from the previous year. These systemic errors  did not materially affect the balances reported for property and equipment  or the corresponding depreciation/amortization expense amounts in SEC\u2019s  financial statements for fiscal year 2007; however, these conditions  evidence a significant deficiency in control over the recording of property  and equipment that affects the reliability of its recorded balances for  property and equipment. Specifically, SEC lacks a process that integrates  controls over capitalizing and recording property and equipment  purchases. For example, SEC does not have a formalized, documented  process for comparing quantity and type of item received against the  corresponding order for property purchases. In addition, SEC does not  have sufficient oversight of the recording of acquisition dates and values  of the capitalized property. Further, SEC\u2019s lack of an integrated financial  management system for accounting for property and equipment, as  discussed above, requires compensating procedures, which were not  effective, to ensure that manual calculations, such as those for  depreciation and amortization, are accurate. Until it has a systemic  process that incorporates effective controls over receiving, recording,  capitalizing, and amortizing property and equipment purchases, SEC will  not have sufficient assurance over the accuracy and completeness of its  reported balances for property and equipment."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Accounting for Budgetary Resources", "paragraphs": ["For fiscal year 2007, SEC incurred $877 million in obligations, which  represents legal liabilities against funds available to SEC to pay for goods  and services ordered. At September 30, 2007, SEC reported that the  amount of budgetary resources obligated for undelivered orders was $255  million, which reflects obligations for goods or services that had not been  delivered or received as of that date. In our testing of undelivered order  transactions for this year\u2019s audit, we identified several concerns over  SEC\u2019s accounting for obligations and undelivered orders. Specifically, we  found numerous instances in which SEC (1) recorded obligations prior to  having documentary evidence of a binding agreement for the goods or  services, (2) recorded invalid undelivered order transactions due to an  incorrect posting configuration in SEC\u2019s general ledger, and (3) made  errors in recording new obligations and deobligations due to the use of  incorrect accounts and by posting incorrect amounts in the general ledger.", "The majority of exceptions related to these issues, amounting to  approximately $76 million, were corrected by SEC through adjusting  journal entries. While the remaining uncorrected amounts did not  materially affect the balances on the Statement of Budgetary Resources at  September 30, 2007, ineffective processes that caused these errors  constitute a significant deficiency in SEC\u2019s internal control over recording  and reporting of obligations, and puts SEC at risk that the amounts  recorded in the general ledger and reported on SEC\u2019s Statement of  Budgetary Resources are misstated. Specifically, SEC\u2019s general ledger is  not configured to properly post related entries, thereby resulting in the  need to routinely correct entries. Extensive reviews of the budgetary  transactions, along with significant adjusting journal entries, are needed to  compensate for the system limitations. The errors in recording new  obligations and deobligations that we found in our audit indicate a lack of  effective review over those transactions. Further, SEC does not have  policies or internal controls to prevent recording of obligations that are  not valid. Recording obligations prior to having documentary evidence of a  binding agreement for the goods and services is a violation of the  recording statute, and may result in funds being reserved unnecessarily  and therefore made unavailable for other uses should the agreement not  materialize.
