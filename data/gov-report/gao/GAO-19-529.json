For  example, in 2014, DIA added the diversity of a college\u2019s student  population as one of the criteria it used to select grant proposals.  Colleges with a minority-serving designation or with a student population  that is more than 75 percent ethnically and culturally diverse are given an  excellent rating, while colleges with a student population that is less than  25 percent diverse are given a poor rating.

These two diversity criteria have been given more  weight than all other criteria since 2017, while previous announcements  gave greater weight to the development of national security curricula. This  change in approach may align with the program\u2019s overall mission to  increase diversity in the IC, but DIA has not outlined an overall strategy  that explains how such changes to the grant selection criteria would  achieve a results-oriented goal like increasing the number of minority  applicants to the IC.", "Two interconnected sound planning practices are to establish results- oriented goals and strategies to achieve those goals.

However, DIA has not fully evaluated the challenges colleges  may encounter if they are not able to secure continuous funding for the IC  CAE program. When DIA awards grants, colleges are awarded a base  year of funding and renewable up to 4 additional option years.

Colleges then need to apply  for another grant in order to continue to receive federal funding following  expiration of any additional option years.", "Since 2011, colleges have been required to demonstrate a plan to sustain  their programs after the initial grant period ends. However, according to  some IC CAE college officials, it is nonetheless difficult to continue the  program and secure external funding once the grant is over.

For example, one college has  sustained an IC CAE program since 2005 even though the college did  not receive grant funding from 2008 through 2012. According to  college officials, loss of grant funding resulted in the college  suspending professional development activities. The program  received additional IC CAE grants in 2012 and in 2017 and college  officials stated they hold professional development workshops and  one-on-one mentoring sessions between students and  representatives from IC elements.", "Without grant funding, consortium colleges may not have funding for  student travel to IC CAE events. Consortium colleges face a specific  challenge since many of the IC CAE events are hosted by the lead IC  CAE college. We spoke with faculty at two consortium colleges who  said that grant funding from the program helps reduce the cost of their  students\u2019 travel to off-campus IC CAE events, such as annual  colloquiums at the lead college that are attended by subject matter  experts from IC elements. The distance students may need to travel  can be especially challenging for colleges that are not located near  the lead college, including one community college that is 400 miles  away from the lead consortium college according to an IC CAE  college official.", "DIA identifies some programs as legacy colleges, but some colleges  have not updated their IC CAE program websites.

While  DIA acknowledges this problem, it does not have a process to  systematically evaluate this issue or consider alternative approaches for  colleges that may need additional support to maintain relevant curricula or  professional development activities. For example, DIA has not evaluated  whether some colleges\u2019 difficulty with sustaining their IC CAE program  may invalidate underlying assumptions about how the program is  structured, including whether awarding grants to colleges to develop and  maintain an intelligence-focused curriculum is the most effective means of  establishing long-term relationships with those colleges and fostering a  diverse talent pool for the IC.", "A key practice of sound planning is to fully evaluate key factors external  to the organization that are beyond its control.

As ODNI takes over the  program, it needs to address these sound planning practices in order to  determine whether the program is being implemented successfully and to  help ensure the IC has a trusted, diverse workforce with the right  expertise. Further, without sufficient planning and oversight, decision  makers will also be unable to determine the return on investment in this  long-standing program.", "In addition, ODNI also needs to improve IC element participation in the  program. The IC CAE program is a collaborative effort that encourages  participation among all IC elements. However, DIA has not established a  process to monitor and assess IC element participation in the program or  clearly defined IC elements roles and responsibilities for the IC CAE  program. A process for monitoring and assessing IC element participation  and addressing IC elements\u2019 reasons for not participating in the program  will increase understanding of the factors that inhibit participation and  inform ODNI\u2019s approach to mitigating these factors and achieving its goal  for the program. Further, without clearly defined roles for IC element  participation in the program, IC CAE colleges may not be most effectively  executing their IC CAE programs and the program overall may not be  able to meet its goals."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following seven recommendations to the Director of  National Intelligence as the IC CAE program transitions to ODNI:  The Director of National Intelligence should establish and document  results-oriented goals that include specific targets or milestones for the IC  CAE program.

Internal documents and  grant announcements from that period state that the program\u2019s mission  was to increase the pool of eligible applicants in core skills areas,  specifically targeting women, racial and ethnic minorities and individuals  with varied cultural backgrounds, regional expertise, and language  proficiency. ODNI outlined four goals in its 2008 guidance for the  program, including a focus on developing relationships with colleges,  providing resources and grants to competitively selected colleges,  providing technical assistance in the design and implementation of  colleges\u2019 IC CAE programs, and documenting results to improve the  efficacy of the IC CAE program. Each of these goals included supporting  objectives. For example, the goal of providing support, resources, and  grants to competitively selected colleges included four supporting  objectives, such as instituting long-term practices to increase  relationships with minority-serving institutions and providing access to IC  internships, co-ops, and graduate fellowships. These goals and objectives  were aligned with the program\u2019s overall mission, but they were not  defined in measurable terms that would allow future assessments of  whether they were being achieved. For example, ODNI did not establish  targets for the goals or supporting objectives listed above that would have  allowed it to determine how successful it had been at supporting long- term programs at minority-serving institutions or providing access to IC  employment opportunities.", "In addition, ODNI defined a strategy to support its program goals, and the  strategy included the following four elements: outreach to high schools;  operations at colleges, including curriculum development; infrastructure at  the colleges to support these operations such as faculty and  administrators; and relationships between IC CAE programs and IC  elements. These elements of ODNI\u2019s strategy described specific  operational requirements for the program. For example, IC CAE grant  announcements in 2006, 2009, and 2011 supported a wide range of  academic activities that prioritized the development of curricula in national  security studies, science and technology programs, study abroad  programs, courses in critical languages, and pre-collegiate outreach  through activities like summer camps to raise awareness and interest in  IC careers.", "ODNI also defined assessment and evaluation as an overarching part of  the program\u2019s strategy, as shown in figure 5. ODNI worked with a  contractor to conduct annual performance evaluations through 2012. The  contractor developed an evaluation methodology and reviewed colleges\u2019  interim reports, collected and verified performance data, and developed  findings and recommendations. For example, the contractor  recommended that IC CAE colleges broaden their critical language  offerings and increase the number of IC CAE Scholars enrolled in foreign  languages courses in each of the annual reports from 2007 to 2010.", "ODNI defined performance measures and reported data on activities,  including the number of IC CAE courses and events, demographic  information, and employment outcomes. Specifically, IC CAE colleges  were required to report these data quarterly, and the contractor compiled  the data annually into its program reviews.
