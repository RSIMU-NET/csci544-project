GAO's analysis of the 1998 plan data for the Fortune 1,000 firms showed that 550 of those companies held employer securities in their defined benefit plans or defined contribution plans, covering 13 million participants. Investment in employer securities through employer-sponsored retirement plans can present significant risks for employees. If the employees' retirement savings is largely in employer securities in these plans, employees risk losing not only their jobs should the company go out of business, but also a significant portion of their savings. Even if employers do not declare bankruptcy, employees are still subject to the dual risk of loss of job and loss of retirement savings because corporate losses and stock price declines can result in companies significantly reducing their operations. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act and the Securities Acts, the Department of Labor and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are responsible for ensuring that certain disclosures are made to plan participants regarding their investments. Although employees in plans where they control their investments receive disclosures under the act regarding their investments, such regulations do not require companies to disclose the importance of diversification or warn employees about the potential risks of owning employer securities. SEC requires companies with defined contribution plans that offer employees an opportunity to invest in employer stock to register and disclose to SEC specific information about those plans.

Over 70 million U.S. workers participate in pension and savings plans, and such plans in 1998 represented about $4 trillion in retirement savings.

Because of the financial losses suffered by Enron plan participants and the potential for losses to be incurred by participants in retirement and savings plans that are highly concentrated in employer securities, you asked us to: (1) determine the number, types, and dollar amounts of private pension plans that invest in employer securities; (2) describe why investing in employer securities through employer-sponsored plans can pose risks to plan participants; and (3) describe the regulatory provisions for disclosures to participants owning employer securities through their employer-sponsored plans.

We analyzed data for the Fortune 1,000 companies for plan year 1998, which was the most recent year for which complete plan-specific data were available for our review. To calculate the percentage of pension plan assets held as employer securities, we first subtracted certain assets that cannot be specifically identified as employer securities from total plan assets to arrive at \u201cknown assets.\u201d To describe the risks of investing in employer securities through employer-sponsored plans, we focused on six companies whose private pension plans according to industry data were heavily invested in employer securities. We used these companies as examples to illustrate the risks that employees face when their employer-sponsored plans have high concentrations of employer securities or real property. For four of the companies we used publicly available information. We obtained information directly from the other two companies, but we agreed not to disclose their names. In addition, as part of our review of regulatory provisions, we interviewed officials from the Department of Labor (DOL), SEC, and industry associations about the laws governing employer securities purchases by retirement plans and the investment information that employers provide to plan participants.", "We conducted our work between February and August 2002 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

The federal government encourages employers to sponsor and maintain private pension plans for their employees and provides tax incentives offered under the Internal Revenue Code to those who do. Although there is a wide range of specific plan designs that are permissible under current law, private sector pension plans are classified either as defined benefit or defined contribution plans. Defined benefit plans promise to provide, generally, a level of monthly retirement income that is based on salary, years of service, and age at retirement. The benefits from defined contribution plans are based on the contributions to and investment returns on individual accounts. Most private sector pension plans are defined contribution plans and this has been true for a number of years. Since the late 1980s, the number of defined benefit plans has decreased, and most new pension plans have been defined contribution plans. Many employers, particularly those with more than 1,000 employees, sponsor both defined benefit and defined contribution plans. More workers are covered by defined contribution plans than defined benefit plans, and the assets held by defined contribution plans now exceeds those held by defined benefit plans.", "According to DOL, employers sponsored over 673,000 defined contribution plans as of 1998 compared with about 56,400 defined benefit plans. Defined contribution plans had about 58 million participants while defined benefit plans had about 42 million participants.", "Defined contribution plans are central to the debate about employee stock ownership through employer-sponsored plans. Defined contribution plans include thrift savings plans, profit-sharing plans, and ESOPs. The most dominant and fastest growing defined contribution plans are 401(k) type plans, which are plans that allow employees to choose to contribute a portion of their pre-tax compensation to the plan under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Most 401(k) plans are participant-directed, meaning that participants make investment decisions about their own retirement plan contributions within a set of investment choices selected by the plan sponsor. Employees are usually able to choose from a menu of diversified fund options when investing their own contributions. Over the last 20 years, employers have gradually expanded the investment choices of participants such that most plans are offering over 10 investment choices for participants, including investing in employer stock. Employees generally have less flexibility over the investments of the employer contributions to these plans, which frequently take the form of company stock.", "Many employers combine defined contribution plans with a 401(k) feature and ESOPs or profit-sharing/thrift savings plans with a 401(k) feature.High concentrations of employer securities are likely to be found when ESOPs and 401(k) type plans are linked or when 401(k) plans and profit- sharing plans are linked. This is especially true when plans are combined with ESOPs, which by definition seek to provide for employee ownership. Moreover, under current law, ESOPs may require participants not to divest their employer stock holdings until they reach the age of 55 or 10 years of service, essentially restricting participant\u2019s rights to diversify employer stock holdings.", "ERISA has a rule that places a 10 percent limitation on acquiring and holding employer securities and employer real property for defined benefit plans.  The 10 percent limitation states that a plan may not acquire any qualified employer securities or real property if immediately after the acquisition the aggregate fair market value of such assets exceeds 10 percent of the fair market value of the plan\u2019s total assets.  Employer securities and real property that appreciate in value after acquisition to 10 percent or more of total plan assets do not have to be sold.  Defined contribution plans other than 401(k) type plans that are not ESOPs are generally exempt from the 10 percent limitation.", "Under ERISA, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and DOL\u2019s PWBA are primarily responsible for enforcing laws related to private pension plans. PWBA enforces ERISA\u2019s reporting and disclosure provisions and fiduciary standards, which concern how plans should operate in the best interest of participants. The IRS enforces requirements concerning how employees become eligible to participate in benefit plans and earn rights to benefits. The IRS also enforces funding requirements designed to ensure that plans subject to such requirements have sufficient assets to pay promised benefits.", "In addition to the types of plans employers provide, some employer- sponsored plans have complex designs, such as floor-offset arrangements. Such arrangements consist of separate, but associated defined benefit and defined contribution plans. The benefits accrued under one plan offset the benefit payable from the other. In 1987, Congress limited the use of such plans significantly invested in employer securities. However, plans in existence when the provision was enacted were grandfathered.", "Because plan participants are investing in employer securities, securities law investor protection and disclosure requirements are also important. Congress enacted the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in response to fraud in the securities markets and because of a perceived lack of public information in the stock markets. The 1940 Investment Company Act, combined with the 1933 act, is the basis for SEC regulation of investment companies. Companies meeting this description must register under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and offer their shares under the Securities Act of 1933. These laws seek to ensure vigorous market competition by mandating full and fair disclosure and prohibiting fraud. Under these acts, a primary mission of the SEC is to protect investors and maintain the integrity of the securities market through extensive disclosure, enforcement, and education, but the securities laws also presume individual responsibility for investment decisions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "More Than Half of the Fortune 1,000 Companies Hold Employer Securities in Their Defined Contribution and Defined Benefit Plans", "paragraphs": ["About 550 of the Fortune 1,000 firms in 1998 held employer securities in their defined contribution or defined benefit plans.

ESOPs, including ESOPs combined with other defined contribution plans, held over three-fifths of their known assets in employer securities, while 401(k) type plans held a little over a quarter of their known assets in employer securities. Given the requirements that plans must meet to be designated as an ESOP, it is not surprising that ESOPs and ESOPs with other plan features hold the highest percentages of employer securities holdings. For example, ESOPs must be primarily invested in qualifying employer securities in order for the plan to receive the legal designation of an ESOP. In addition, in order to ensure that a company\u2019s employees continue to hold that minimum threshold of company stock, many ESOPs restrict employees\u2019 ability to sell their company stock.", "About 220 firms in the Fortune 1,000 sponsored plans that were ESOPs or ESOPs combined with other defined contribution plans.  Those plans held a total of $143 billion in employer securities. Fifty-eight percent of ESOP total plan assets were in employer securities. However, certain types of ESOPs reported higher concentrations than others. For example, stand- alone ESOPs\u2014ESOPs that are not combined with other defined contribution plans\u2014had over 98 percent of plan assets in employer securities.

Given that twice as many companies sponsored a 401(k) type plan as those offering an ESOP, the high dollar amounts in the 401(k) plans are not unusual. 401(k) type plans also held significant percentages of plan assets in employer securities, although not as high as ESOPs. For example, about 324 companies reported sponsoring 401(k) plans that were combined with profit-sharing/thrift savings plans, which was by far the most prevalent type of 401(k) plan offered by the Fortune 1,000 and covered more than half of the participants participating in 401(k) plans.

For example, plans that combine ESOPs with a 401(k) type plan are becoming more prevalent among large, publicly traded companies. Because these plans hold the most employer securities, many more workers are likely to have a significant amount of their retirement savings invested in the securities of their employers. Retirement savings, therefore, may increasingly become more dependent on employer stock ownership.", "Defined benefit plans have smaller percentages of employer securities than ESOPs or 401(k) type plans. Seventy-five companies of the Fortune 1,000 sponsored defined benefit plans holding employer securities. Such plans covered 2.3 million participants and held about $120 billion of plan assets.

As shown in figure 2, master trust assets held the highest percentage of pension plan assets.", "The amount of employer securities plans held within master trust agreements cannot be determined from the 1998 Form 5500. For reporting purposes, assets of a master trust are considered to be held in one or more investment accounts that may consist of a pool of assets or a single asset. In addition, only the account total of the master trust account is required to be reported on the Form 5500. For example, 29 percent of the ESOPs sponsored by the Fortune 1,000 reported not holding employer securities. However, because ESOPs are required by law to hold employer securities, if such holdings are not reported under the ESOP account they are likely to be in the master trust agreement accounts. Consequently, our reported dollar amounts of employer securities are likely to understate the amount of plan assets held in employer securities.  However, DOL officials said that few Fortune 1,000 companies are likely to hold a significant percentage of employer securities in master trust agreements.", "Recognizing the difficulty of identifying plan assets held in master trusts, DOL revised the Form 5500 for the 1999 plan filing year. Beginning with the 1999 filing year, master trusts will file a form 5500 report along with schedules itemizing the types of assets they hold. According to DOL officials, this will help ensure adequate reporting on the plan assets held in master trust investment accounts.", "In addition to employer securities holdings in master trust agreements, we also found basic filing errors in the data. While examples we found may understate or overstate our concentrations, we were not able to determine the extent to which such filings errors occurred. For example, we found filing errors such as the misreporting of employer securities as corporate debt instruments or stock (other than employer\u2019s own common stock). In one case, we identified an ESOP that was reported to hold no securities. A DOL official reviewed this plan and, by examining an accountant\u2019s report that accompanied the Form 5500, discovered that the plan actually held employer securities and had made a mistake in filling out the Form 5500\u2014 a mistake that, according to DOL officials, occurs frequently. Furthermore, data reported on the Form 5500 combines all employer securities into a single line item. Employer securities held by pension plans may include employer stock, a marketable obligation such as a bond or note, or an interest in a publicly traded partnership.

Such holdings directly expose the employee to the losses of the company they work for much more so than if they worked in another company. In addition, holding significant proportions of employer securities is directly at odds with modern financial theory, which says that diversifying a portfolio offers the benefits of reducing risks at very limited cost.", "Companies prefer to provide company contributions in employer stock for a number of reasons. Contributions in employer stock puts more company shares in the hands of employees who some officials believe are less likely to sell their shares if the company\u2019s profits are less than expected or in the event of a threatened takeover. Companies also point out that contributing employer stock promotes a sense of employee ownership, linking the interest of employees with the company and other shareholders. In addition, employer stock contributions provide several tax benefits for companies.", "When employees choose to allocate a large portion of their total assets to their employer\u2019s securities, they are assuming significant risk in order to achieve a particular expected rate of return. Studies have shown that employees feel a great deal of loyalty to their company. Because they work at the company and interact with the company\u2019s managers, they believe they know the company and feel more comfortable investing in it. In addition, some employees enjoy being an owner-employee and some believe their employer\u2019s stock will outperform the overall market over some particular time horizon. As a result, some employees consider investments in employer stock through their employer-sponsored plans a safe investment.

For example,   Enron employees lost their jobs and a significant amount of their retirement savings as the company became insolvent.

Enron\u2019s stock price went from a high of $80 per share in January 2001, to less than $1 per share in January 2002. About 62 percent of the assets held in the company\u2019s 401(k) consisted of shares of Enron stock.

With a defined benefit plan, the employer, as plan sponsor, is responsible for funding the promised benefits, investing and managing the plan assets, and bearing the investment risk. If the defined benefit plans terminate with insufficient assets to pay promised benefits, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC) provides plan termination insurance to pay participant\u2019s pension benefits up to a certain limit. For example, according to PBGC, Enron sponsored at least five defined benefit plans insured by PBGC. The largest of these plans covered about 20,000 participants.

The other company allowed 100 percent diversification of employee 401(k) contributions, the company match, and the profit sharing contributions at all times.  Several other companies have publicly announced easing restrictions on when employees can diversify employer contributions in their accounts.

The Securities Act of 1933 requires companies with defined contribution plans that offer employer stock to employees to register and disclose to SEC specific information about those plans. Under the current disclosure requirements of DOL, there is no requirement that companies disclose to plan participants the risks involved in investing in employer stock or the benefits of diversification. Industry representatives we spoke with said that companies provide employees with investment education and plan information and in some cases go beyond the minimum requirements.

In determining that the interest in the plan did not meet the commonly understood definition of an investment contract, the Court focused on the factors set out in the Howey test. First, the Court found that an employee who participates in a noncontributory, compulsory pension plan makes no payment into the pension plan, and the employer\u2019s payments into the plan do not relate to the individual benefit received by employees. Therefore, the investment portion of the Howey test is not satisfied in the case of a defined benefit plan. In addition, the Court found that because a major part of the retirement benefits were to be derived from the employer\u2019s contributions, rather than from the efforts of the plan\u2019s managers in investing the income, the plan did not have sufficient profit aspects to fall within the test for an investment contract in Howey.", "The Court also pointed out that the fact that ERISA comprehensively governs the use and terms of employee pension plans severely undercuts all arguments for extending the securities laws to noncontributory, compulsory pension plans.

In SEC\u2019s view, the burden of preparing a registration statement in connection with a pension plan could result in many employers not sponsoring pension plans. However, a registration requirement is justified if employer stock can be purchased, because the employer has a direct financial interest in the solicitation of employees\u2019 contributions. This conclusion was based on the view that where employer stock is among the investment options, \u201cit is not unfair to make the employer assume the same burdens which corporations typically assume when they go to the public for financing.\u201d According to the Supreme Court\u2019s opinion in the Daniel case, after 1941, SEC made no further efforts to register plan securities other than voluntary, contributory plans where the employees\u2019 contributions were invested in the employer\u2019s securities.", "Subsequent to the Daniel decision, the SEC issued two major interpretive releases, the first of which set forth views on when a participation interest in a pension plan is an investment contract and thus a security. Release No. 6188, dated February 1, 1980, reiterated the SEC\u2019s view that, while employee interests in pension plans generally are securities, employee interests should be registered only when the plan is both voluntary and contributory and may invest in stock of the employer an amount greater than that paid into the plan by the employer. The release defines a \u201cvoluntary\u201d plan as one in which employees may elect whether or not to participate, and a \u201ccontributory\u201d plan as one in which employees make direct payments, usually in the form of cash or payroll deductions.", "This administrative practice is based on the SEC\u2019s opinion that (1) registration serves no purpose where a plan is involuntary, since in that situation the participant is not permitted to make an investment decision, and (2) the costs of registration are a significant burden to an employer and should be imposed only where the employer has a direct financial interest in soliciting voluntary employee contributions.", "The 1980 release found that voluntary, contributory plans where an employee is permitted to invest in employer securities met the four parts of the Howey test defining an investment contract. First, the payment of cash or its equivalent by an employee satisfies the \u201cinvestment\u201d requirement. Second, the \u201ccommon enterprise\u201d requirement is met where the interests of employees in the plan are \u201cseparable\u201d and possess \u201csubstantially the characteristics of a security.\u201d In both defined contribution and defined benefit plans, there is a separate account maintained for each participant to the extent of each person\u2019s contribution to the plan. Third, the \u201cexpectation of profits\u201d requirement is met when the employee voluntarily contributes his or her own funds to the plan and can expect that the funds will generate profits through the efforts of the plan managers. In the Daniel case, the Court suggested that unless a defined benefit plan has a substantial dependence on earnings, as well as vesting requirements that are not excessively difficult to satisfy, there might be no expectation of profits. The 1980 release stated, however, that a voluntary, contributory defined benefit plan could meet the expectation of profits test because it may depend on earnings to pay promised benefits and because the vesting requirements under ERISA are much less strict than the requirement that was present in the Daniel case. Finally, the 1980 release stated that the \u201cfrom the efforts of others\u201d test was easily satisfied because the earnings generated by a plan would result from the efforts of the plan managers.", "SEC\u2019s analysis concluded that the interests of employees in voluntary, contributory pension plans are securities within the meaning of the 1933 act.

The release also discussed the amendments to the section 3(a)(2) exemptions made by the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980. The 1980 amendments broadened the scope of the exemption by including certain insurance contracts and governmental plans within its coverage.

The staff determined that these arrangements are not contributory on the part of employees because they did not involve out-of-pocket investments by employees of their own funds in employer stock. Instead, the plans are funded by employer contribution.", "However, subsequent to the 1981 release, the Treasury Department issued rules under section 401(k) that allowed plans to provide for pre-tax employee contributions through salary reduction. In a salary reduction plan, the employee elects to reduce his compensation and have the amount contributed to a plan. This type of salary reduction is considered to be an out-of-pocket contribution into the plan. Because such a plan is voluntary and contributory, plan interests would be securities.

Congress exempted these pooled investment vehicles, in part, because they were subject to oversight by bank and insurance regulators. The interests issued by the pooled investment vehicles in question were still subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the 1933 act, notwithstanding the amendments.

In general, the guidelines obligate the plan sponsor to provide or make available to plan participants sufficient information so that they may make informed investment decisions.  While the disclosures required by the 404(c) rules generally make more information available to plan participants by encouraging plan sponsors to provide or make available more information about the underlying investment options offered by the plan, the view of the Division of Investment Management is that plan participants have a continuing need for information in order to evaluate their investments, and decide whether to maintain or reallocate those investments.
