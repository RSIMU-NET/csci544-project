Over time, these issues involve amounts near or exceeding $1 trillion.", "Over the past decade, GAO has highlighted the issue of improper payments\u2014defined by statute as payments that should not have been made or that were made in an incorrect amount (including overpayments and underpayments). GAO has reported for several years that the federal government is unable to determine the full extent to which improper payments occur and reasonably assure that actions are taken to reduce them.", "The tax gap is the difference between taxes owed and those paid on time, as a result of taxpayers underreporting their tax liability, underpaying taxes, or not filing tax returns.

The improper payment estimate, attributable to 124 programs across 22 agencies in fiscal year 2014, was $124.7 billion, up from $105.8 billion in fiscal year 2013. The almost $19 billion increase was primarily due to the Medicare, Medicaid, and Earned Income Tax Credit programs, which account for over 75 percent of the government-wide improper payment estimate. Federal spending in Medicare and Medicaid is expected to significantly increase, so it is critical that actions are taken to reduce improper payments in these programs. Moreover, for fiscal year 2014, federal entities reported estimated error rates for 10 risk-susceptible programs that exceeded 10 percent. Recent laws and guidance have focused attention on improper payments, but incomplete or understated estimates and noncompliance with criteria listed in federal law hinder the government's ability to assess the full extent of improper payments and implement strategies to reduce them. For example, for fiscal year 2014, 2 federal agencies did not report improper payment estimates for 4 risk-susceptible programs, and 5 programs with improper payment estimates greater than $1 billion were noncompliant with federal requirements for 3 consecutive years. Identifying root causes of improper payments can help agencies target corrective actions, and GAO has made numerous recommendations that could help reduce improper payments. For example, strengthening verification of Medicare providers and suppliers could help reduce improper payments. GAO has stated that continued agency attention is needed to (1) identify susceptible programs, (2) develop reliable estimation methodologies, (3) report as required, and (4) implement effective corrective actions based on root cause analysis. Absent such continued efforts, the federal government cannot be assured that taxpayer funds are adequately safeguarded.", "Addressing the estimated $385 billion net tax gap will require strategies on multiple fronts. Key factors that contribute to the tax gap include limited third-party reporting, resource trade-offs, and tax code complexity. For example, the extent to which individual taxpayers accurately report their income is correlated to the extent to which the income is reported to them and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) by third parties. Where there is little or no information reporting, such as with business income, taxpayers tend to significantly misreport their income. GAO has many open recommendations to reduce the tax gap. For example, GAO recommended in 2012 that IRS use return on investment data to reallocate its enforcement resources and potentially increase revenues. Since 2011, GAO also recommended improvements to telephone and online services to help IRS deliver high-quality services to taxpayers who wish to comply with tax laws but do not understand their obligations. Other strategies GAO has suggested would require legislative actions, such as accelerating W-2 filing deadlines. Additionally, requiring partnerships and corporations to electronically file tax returns could help IRS reduce return processing costs and focus its examinations more on noncompliant taxpayers. Further, a broader opportunity to address the tax gap involves simplifying the Internal Revenue Code, as complexity can cause taxpayer confusion and provide opportunities to hide willful noncompliance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Many difficult, major fiscal policy decisions are required to both determine  the government\u2019s short-term financing and address fundamental  structural issues that are currently putting our nation on a long-term,  unsustainable fiscal path.

Medicare  spending generally has grown faster than the economy, and in the  coming years, continued growth in the number of Medicare beneficiaries  and in program spending will create increased challenges for the federal  government. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  which administers Medicare, has demonstrated a strong commitment to  reducing improper payments, particularly through its dedicated Center for  Program Integrity. For example, CMS centralized the development and  implementation of automated edits for national coverage policies\u2014 prepayment controls used to deny Medicare claims that should not be  paid\u2014to help ensure greater consistency in paying only those claims that  align with national policies. In response to our recommendations, CMS  has also taken steps to reduce differences among postpayment review  contractor requirements when possible and has improved automated  edits that assess all services provided to the same beneficiary by the  same provider on the same day, so providers cannot avoid claim denials  by billing for services on multiple claim lines or multiple claims.  Additionally, in March 2014, CMS awarded a contract to a Federal Bureau  of Investigation-approved contractor that will enable the agency to  conduct fingerprint-based criminal history checks of high-risk providers  and suppliers.", "Nevertheless, in our February 2015 update to our high-risk series, we  reported that while CMS has demonstrated efforts to reduce improper  payments in the Medicare program, estimated improper payment rates  have remained unacceptably high. For fiscal year 2014, the Department  of Health and Human Services (HHS) reported an estimated error rate of  12.7 percent for Medicare Fee-for-Service. Some components of this  estimate\u2014such as durable medical equipment and home health claims\u2014 have estimated error rates in excess of 50 percent, meaning that most  payments for these items and services were estimated to be improper.  Fully exercising its authority related to strengthening its provider and  supplier enrollment provisions and addressing our other open  recommendations related to prepayment and postpayment claims review  activities would help CMS achieve reductions in Medicare improper  payments. The following are examples of actions that could help reduce  Medicare improper payments.", "Improving use of automated edits. To help ensure that payments  are made properly, CMS uses controls called edits that are  programmed into claims processing systems to compare claims data  with Medicare requirements in order to approve or deny claims or flag  them for further review. In November 2012, we reported that use of  prepayment edits saved Medicare at least $1.76 billion in fiscal year  2010, but savings could have been greater if prepayment edits had  been more widely used. To promote greater use of effective  prepayment edits and better ensure that payments are made properly,  we recommended that CMS (1) improve the data collected about local  prepayment edits to enable CMS to identify the most effective edits  and the local coverage policies on which they are based and (2)  require Medicare administrative contractors to share information about  the underlying policies and savings related to their most effective  edits. CMS concurred with both recommendations and has begun to  take steps to implement them.", "Monitoring postpayment claims reviews. CMS uses four types of  contractors to conduct postpayment claims reviews to identify  improper payments. In July 2013, we found that although  postpayment claims reviews involved the same general process  regardless of which type of contractor conducted them, CMS had  different requirements for many aspects of the process across the four  contractor types. Some of these differences might impede efficiency  and effectiveness of claims reviews by increasing administrative  burden for providers. Furthermore, in July 2014, we reported that  CMS did not have reliable data or provide sufficient oversight and  guidance to measure and fully prevent inappropriate duplication of  reviews. We recommended that CMS monitor the database used to  track recovery audit activities to ensure that all data were submitted,  accurate, and complete. CMS concurred with the recommendation  and said it would seek contract modifications to add quality assurance  performance metrics related to the completeness and timeliness of  data.", "Removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards. The  identification number on Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 cards includes as one  component the Social Security number of the beneficiary (or other  eligible person\u2019s, such as a spouse). This introduces risks that  beneficiaries\u2019 personal information could be obtained and used to  commit identity theft. In September 2013, we reported that CMS had  not taken steps to select and implement a technical solution for  removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards. To better  position the agency to efficiently and cost-effectively identify, design,  develop, and implement a solution to address this issue, we  recommended that CMS direct the initiation of an information  technology project for identifying, developing, and implementing  changes that would have to be made to CMS\u2019s affected systems.", "Consistent with our recommendation, when the Medicare Access and  CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 was enacted into law in April 2015,  it included a provision requiring and providing funding for the  Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the  Commissioner of Social Security, to establish cost-effective  procedures to ensure that a Social Security account number (or  derivative thereof) is not displayed, coded, or embedded on Medicare  beneficiary cards and that any identifier displayed on such cards is not  identifiable as a Social Security account number (or derivative  thereof). As of July 2015, CMS had started the Social Security  Number Removal Initiative in response to the law and was in the  process of establishing a program management organization to  continue the planning and execution of the initiative.", "Implementing actions authorized by the Patient Protection and  Affordable Care Act (PPACA). In addition to provisions to expand  health insurance coverage, PPACA provides CMS with certain  authorities to combat fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare. We  reported in our February 2015 update to our high-risk series that CMS  should fully exercise its PPACA authority related to strengthening its  provider and supplier enrollment provisions. For example, CMS  should require surety bonds\u2014a three-party agreement in which a  company, known as a surety, agrees to compensate the bondholder if  the bond purchaser fails to keep a specified promise\u2014for certain at- risk providers and suppliers.", "Strengthening verification of providers and suppliers. As we  reported in June 2015, we estimated that about 22 percent of  Medicare providers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 practice location addresses were  potentially ineligible. For example, we identified 46 instances out of  a generalizable sample of 496 addresses in which practice location  addresses were inside a mailing store similar to a UPS Store. We also  identified other locations that were potentially ineligible, including  vacant addresses and unrelated establishments. In addition, we found  147 out of about 1.3 million physicians listed as eligible to bill  Medicare who, as of March 2013, had received a final adverse action  from a state medical board for crimes against persons, financial  crimes, and other types of felonies but were either not revoked from  the Medicare program until months after the adverse action or never  removed. We recommended that CMS modify the software integrated  into the provider enrollment database to include specific flags to help  identify potentially questionable practice location addresses, revise  guidance for verifying practice locations, and collect additional license  information.

CMS has an important role in overseeing and  supporting state efforts to reduce and recover improper payments and  has demonstrated some leadership commitment in this area. For  example, CMS issued guidance to improve corrective actions taken by  states. CMS also established the Medicaid Integrity Institute, which  provides training and technical assistance to states on approaches to  prevent improper payments and guidance on program integrity issues.", "In our February 2015 high-risk update, we reported that while CMS had  taken these positive steps in recent years, in several areas, CMS had still  to address issues and recommendations that had not been fully  implemented. These issues include implementing effective program  integrity processes for managed care, ensuring clear reporting of  overpayment recoveries, and refocusing program integrity efforts on  approaches that are cost-effective. The following are actions that we  recommended CMS take to help reduce Medicaid improper payments  and improve program integrity.", "Improving third-party liability efforts. Congress generally  established Medicaid as the health care payer of last resort, meaning  that if enrollees have another source of health care coverage\u2014such  as private insurance\u2014that source should pay, to the extent of its  liability, before Medicaid does. This is referred to as third-party  liability. However, there are known challenges to ensuring that  Medicaid is the payer of last resort. For example, states have reported  challenges obtaining out-of-state coverage data from private insurers.  Without such data, it is difficult for states to reliably identify or recover  payments from liable private insurers not licensed in the state. While  CMS has issued guidance to states, in January 2015 we  recommended additional actions that could help to improve cost- saving efforts in this area, such as (1) monitoring and sharing  information on third-party liability efforts and challenges across all  states and (2) providing guidance to states on oversight of third-party  liability efforts related to Medicaid managed care plans. HHS agreed  with our recommendations and in May 2015 reported that CMS has  begun developing a work plan to implement the recommendations.", "Increasing oversight of managed care. Most Medicaid beneficiaries  receive services through a managed care system, and Medicaid  managed care expenditures have been growing at a faster rate than  fee-for-service expenditures. In May 2014, we reported that most  state and federal program integrity officials we interviewed told us that  they did not closely examine managed care payments, focusing on  fee-for-service claims instead. HHS agreed with our  recommendation to update Medicaid managed care guidance on  program integrity practices and effective handling of managed care  organization recoveries. On June 1, 2015, the agency issued a  proposed rule to revise program integrity policies, including policy  measures that we have recommended. Among other measures, the  rule, if finalized, would require states to conduct audits of managed  care organizations\u2019 service utilization and financial data every 3 years  and standardize the treatment of recovered overpayments by plans.", "Strengthening program integrity. In November 2012, we reported  that CMS could do more to eliminate duplication and improve  efficiency of its Medicaid integrity efforts. Since then, CMS has  taken positive steps to oversee program integrity efforts in Medicaid,  including reconfiguring its approach in 2013 to reduce duplicate  reviewing and auditing of states\u2019 claims and improve efficiencies in its  audits, redesigning its comprehensive reviews of states\u2019 program  integrity activities toward a more targeted risk assessment approach,  and increasing its efforts to hold states accountable for reliably  reporting program integrity recoveries. However, CMS has not  strengthened its efforts to calculate return on investment (ROI) for its  program integrity efforts, as we recommended in November 2012. In  January 2015, CMS officials confirmed that the agency is developing  a methodology for measuring and calculating a single ROI that  reflects the Center for Program Integrity\u2019s initiatives for both Medicare  and Medicaid, and they expect to have their methodology finalized  later this year.

As we have reported, a root  cause of EITC noncompliance is that eligibility is determined by taxpayers  themselves or their tax return preparers and that IRS\u2019s ability to verify  eligibility before issuing refunds is limited.", "The Department of the Treasury (Treasury) divides EITC improper  payments into two categories: authentication and verification.  Authentication errors include errors associated with IRS\u2019s inability to  validate qualifying child requirements, taxpayers\u2019 filing status, and EITC  claims associated with complex or nontraditional living situations.  Verification errors relate to IRS\u2019s inability to identify individuals improperly  reporting income to claim EITC amounts to which they are not entitled.  Verification errors include underreporting and overreporting of income by  wage earners as well as taxpayers who report that they are self- employed.

IRS has  reported that tax returns with EITC claims were twice as likely to be  audited as other tax returns. However, we found that the effectiveness of  these audits may be limited because since 2011 there have been regular  backlogs in the audits, which have resulted in delays in responding to  taxpayer responses and inquiries. We also found that unclear  correspondence generated additional work for IRS, such as telephone  calls to IRS examiners. These issues have imposed burdens on  taxpayers and costs for IRS.

In contrast,  employers report most wages and salaries to employees and IRS  through Forms W-2 (Wage and Tax Statement). As shown below,  nearly 99 percent of these types of income were accurately reported  on individual tax returns.

Since fiscal year 2010, IRS\u2019s annual  appropriations have declined by $1.2 billion, and since fiscal year  2009, staffing has fallen by about 11,000 full-time equivalent  employees. At the same time, the agency\u2019s workload has increased  because of a surge in identity-related refund fraud and the  implementation of key provisions of PPACA, among other reasons. As  a result of this imbalance, for example, IRS decreased its individual  examination (or audit) coverage rate by 20 percent from fiscal years  2013 to 2015. Reducing examinations can reduce revenues collected  through such enforcement action and may indirectly reduce voluntary  compliance.", "Tax code complexity. The federal tax system contains complex rules  that may be necessary to appropriately target tax policy goals, such  as providing benefits to specific groups of taxpayers. However, this  complexity imposes a wide range of recordkeeping, planning,  computing, and filing requirements upon taxpayers. For example,  taxpayers who receive income from rents, self-employment, and other  sources may be required to make complicated calculations and keep  detailed records.

We previously recommended that  IRS revise Form 1098-T (Tuition Statement) on which educational  institutions are required to report to IRS information on qualified tuition  and related expenses for higher education. Taxpayers can also use  this information to determine the amount of educational tax benefits  they can claim on their tax return. IRS allows institutions to report  either the amount paid or the amount billed for qualified expenses.  IRS officials stated that most institutions report the amount billed and  do not report the actual amount paid. The amount billed may be  different than from the amount that can be claimed as a credit. For  example, the amount billed may not account for all scholarships or  grants the student received. In such cases, the Form 1098-T may  overstate the amount that can be claimed as a credit, confusing  taxpayers. Conversely, if institutions are not providing information on  other eligible items, such as books or equipment, taxpayers might be  understating their claims. In order to reduce taxpayer confusion and  enhance compliance with the requirements, we recommended that  IRS revise the form. The administration has sought legislative  authority to require reporting of amounts paid. Legislation enacted in  June 2015 only allows a taxpayer to claim a credit or deduction for  education expenses if he or she received a Form 1098-T from an  educational institution. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates  that this requirement will raise approximately $576 million through  2025 by reducing erroneous claims by taxpayers without valid Forms  1098-T. However, without a requirement for institutions to report  amounts paid, taxpayers may remain confused by the information  reported to them, and IRS may miss an opportunity to make use of a  low-cost, less intrusive tool that could help ensure compliance.", "Automated matching.

Matching such information could provide another tool for  detecting noncompliance by these types of entities. In 2014, we  recommended that IRS test the feasibility of such matching. IRS  reported that it understands the objective of this recommendation and,  at such time that resources are available to enhance capabilities, it  would consider the proposed methodology of advanced testing.

Accelerating W-2 filing deadlines  could help IRS reduce improper EITC payments and help close the  tax gap. Specifically, IRS has reported that a common EITC error is  misreporting income; however, the timing of deadlines for filing Forms  W-2 poses a challenge for enforcement. Rather than holding refunds  until all compliance checks can be completed, IRS issues most  refunds months before receiving and matching information returns,  such as the W-2 to tax returns. As a result, IRS\u2019s \u201cpay and chase\u201d  compliance model tries to recover bad refunds and unpaid taxes after  matching information and pursuing discrepancies.

Moreover, earlier matching could help IRS  prevent issuing billions of dollars of potentially fraudulent refunds  because of identity theft.", "Treasury recently proposed to Congress that the due date for filing  information returns with IRS, including the Form W-2, be moved to  January 31 to facilitate the use of earnings information in the detection  of noncompliance. Because any change to filing deadlines could  impose burdens on employers and taxpayers as well as create  additional costs to IRS for systems and process changes, Congress  and other stakeholders would need information on this impact to fully  assess any potential changes. For example, the deadline change  could involve upgrades to IRS\u2019s information technology systems;  logistical challenges coordinating with other agencies, such as the  Social Security Administration; and regulatory and policy changes,  such as delaying refunds and the start of the filing season.", "In August 2014, we recommended that IRS estimate the costs and  benefits of accelerating W-2 deadlines and options to implement pre- refund matching using W-2 data as a method to combat the billions of  dollars lost to identity refund fraud, allowing the agency more  opportunity to match employers\u2019 and taxpayers\u2019 information. In  November 2014, IRS reported that it had convened a working group  of internal stakeholders and subject matter experts to identify the  costs and benefits of accelerating Form W-2 deadlines.

Therefore, we recommended that IRS  conduct a cost-benefit analysis across different enforcement  programs and cases within programs to determine whether to  reallocate its enforcement resources each year. We demonstrated  how a relatively small hypothetical shift in resources could potentially  increase direct revenue by $1 billion annually (as long as the average  ratio of direct revenue to cost for each category of returns did not  change), without significant negative effects on voluntary compliance.  Resource reallocation can also affect tax collections indirectly by  influencing the voluntary compliance of nonexamined taxpayers.", "Similarly, in a 2009 report, we found that IRS was able to examine  only about 1 percent of estimated noncompliant sole proprietors in  2008 even though it had invested nearly a quarter of all revenue agent  time toward this purpose. We found that not only are these  examinations burdensome for businesses, they are also costly for IRS  and yield less revenue than examinations of other categories of  taxpayers, in part because most sole proprietorships have low receipt  amounts.", "IRS officials reported they have developed a methodology for  estimating marginal direct revenue and costs for selected workload  categories within their correspondence examination program. They  are working to apply this methodology to other categories within that  program and to other forms of examinations; however, they expect  that effort will be much more complex and time-consuming. As of July  2015, officials do not yet have a timeline for full implementation.", "Strategic planning. In June 2014, we reported that IRS\u2019s strategic  plan did not address budget uncertainty, although there are reasons  to believe that funding will be constrained for the foreseeable future.  We recommended that IRS reexamine programs, related processes,  and organizational structures to determine whether they are  effectively and efficiently achieving the IRS mission, and streamline or  consolidate management or operational processes and functions to  make them more cost-effective. IRS agreed with our recommendation  and is taking steps to implement it; for example, according to IRS  officials, a new process was developed for building the fiscal year  2017 budget request, which included determining IRS-wide priorities.", "Reassessing the level of resources devoted to enforcement.", "Additional resources for enforcement would enable IRS to contact  millions of potentially noncompliant taxpayers it identifies but cannot  contact because of budget constraints. Since fiscal year 2010, IRS\u2019s  enforcement resources have declined by more than 10 percent, from  $5.5 billion to $4.9 billion in fiscal year 2015. To determine the  appropriate level of enforcement resources, we have previously  reported that policymakers would need to consider how to balance  taxpayer service and enforcement activities and how effectively and  efficiently IRS currently uses its resources.", "Modernizing information technology. IRS relies on information  systems in many aspects of its operations from taxpayer service to  compliance and enforcement. Therefore, investing resources to  modernize IRS\u2019s information systems is an important step toward  improving taxpayer compliance. For example, in fiscal year 2009, IRS  began funding the Information Reporting and Document Matching  (IRDM) program in part to implement two new information reporting  requirements focused on merchant card payments and securities  basis reporting. IRDM also established a new matching program to  identify underreported business income and expanded IRS\u2019s ability to  use information returns to improve voluntary compliance and accurate  reporting of income. Under IRDM, IRS built or enhanced several  information systems to sort, match, identify, and manage returns that  are likely sources of revenue that IRS could not have easily identified  using its existing matching system. IRS has other modernization  efforts underway, such as its Customer Account Data Engine 2  investment, which enables daily tax processing and is intended to  provide faster refunds to taxpayers, more timely account updates, and  faster issuance of taxpayer notices. We have ongoing work to  determine the progress of such modernization efforts, and plan to  issue a report associated with this work in the spring of 2016."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Collecting More Data on Noncompliance", "paragraphs": ["A critical step toward reducing the tax gap is to understand the sources  and nature of taxpayer noncompliance. We have long encouraged  regularly measuring tax noncompliance as well as estimating the tax gap,  in part because analyzing the data used to determine the estimate can  help identify ways to improve IRS\u2019s efforts and increase compliance. IRS  continues to measure the extent of taxpayer noncompliance. However,  our work has found that IRS does not adequately measure the effect of  some specific components of its compliance programs, such as the  following:", "Correspondence examinations. IRS does not have information to  determine how its program of examining individual tax returns via  correspondence affects the agency\u2019s broader strategic goals for  compliance, taxpayer burden, and cost. Thus, it is not possible to tell  whether the program is performing better or worse from one year to  the next. In 2014, we made several recommendations related to  monitoring program performance. IRS officials said they will review  current documentation and ensure that they establish correspondence  audit program objectives and measures and clearly link them to the  overall IRS goals and objectives. Officials also said they will update  official guidance as warranted and plan to implement this  recommendation by March 2016.", "Partnerships and S-corporations. In 2014, we found that the full  extent of partnership and S-corporation income misreporting is  unknown, and that IRS examinations and automated document  matching have not been effective at finding most of the estimated  misreported income. Further, IRS does not know how income  misreporting by partnerships affects taxes paid by partners. We  recommended, among other things, that IRS (1) develop a strategy to  improve its information on the extent and nature of partnership  misreporting and (2) use the information to potentially improve how it  selects partnership returns to examine. IRS has developed a strategy,  which would involve a multi-year examination effort to collect audit  data from a representative, statistical sample of partnerships. In  September 2015, IRS officials stated that they were beginning a  discussion about implementing the proposed strategy, and therefore  do not yet have a timeline for implementation. Without this  information, IRS is unable to make fully informed, data-based  decisions on examination selection.", "Compliance Assurance Process (CAP). IRS does not fully assess  the savings it achieves from its CAP\u2014through which large corporate  taxpayers and IRS agree on how to report tax issues before tax  returns are filed. In 2013, we recommended that IRS track savings  from CAP and develop a plan for reinvesting any savings to help  ensure the program is meeting its goals. In response to our  recommendation, IRS has taken steps to track savings by analyzing  and comparing the workload inventory of account coordinators who  handle CAP cases against team coordinators who handle non-CAP  cases. However, as of September 2015, IRS has not shown how such  a workload comparison demonstrated savings from CAP or developed  a plan for reinvesting any savings. Without a plan for tracking savings  and using the savings to increase examination coverage, IRS cannot  be assured that the savings are effectively invested in either CAP or  non-CAP taxpayers with high compliance risk.", "Tax gap estimates. IRS issued its last detailed study of the tax gap in  January 2012, which used tax year 2006 data. According to IRS  officials, the next tax gap update is scheduled to be released in  December 2015, at the earliest. Without more compliance information,  IRS does not have reliable data about its compliance results to fully  inform decisions about allocating examination resources across  different types of businesses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ensuring High-Quality Services to Taxpayers", "paragraphs": ["IRS provides taxpayers an array of services by telephone, by  correspondence, and online. Ensuring high-quality services is a  necessary foundation for voluntary compliance, as it can help taxpayers  who wish to comply with tax laws but do not understand their obligations.  However, in recent years IRS has struggled to maintain or improve  services in the following areas.", "Telephone services. In fiscal year 2014, taxpayers had to wait an  average of about 20 minutes to speak with someone at IRS, more  than twice as long as they did in fiscal year 2009, when the average  wait time was about 9 minutes. Wait times have increased in part  because IRS devoted fewer full-time equivalent employees to  answering telephones and because the average time assisting  taxpayers with their questions has increased. In December 2014, we  recommended that IRS benchmark its telephone service measures to  the best in the business. IRS disagreed with this recommendation,  noting in February 2015 that it is difficult to identify comparable  organizations with a size or scope similar to that of IRS. We disagree  that IRS\u2019s telephone operations cannot be compared to others. IRS  previously benchmarked its telephone level of service measure to  both private and public sector organizations, which allowed it to  identify options for modifying that measure. IRS uses more than one  measure (i.e., level of service) to fully evaluate its telephone  performance, and benchmarking all of these measures alongside  each other to the best in the business could help inform Congress  about resources needed to improve the level of service provided to  taxpayers in a budget constrained environment. Accordingly, we  believe this recommendation remains valid and should be  implemented.", "Online services. Taxpayers benefit from online services because  they can research large amounts of tax guidance, the services are  available 24 hours a day, and there is no waiting to speak to a  telephone representative. While IRS\u2019s website provides some basic  tools to request personalized information, such as the status of  refunds, the website does not give taxpayers interactive personal  account access. The National Taxpayer Advocate, the Electronic Tax  Administration Advisory Committee, and others have all  recommended that IRS provide taxpayers with online access to their  accounts, including ways to resolve compliance problems. In  December 2011 and April 2013, we recommended that IRS develop a  long-term strategy to improve web services.", "As of July 2015, IRS reported that it is integrating online services as a  key component of its new Service on Demand (SOD) strategy, which  aims to deliver service improvements across different taxpayer  interactions, such as individual account assistance, refunds, identity  theft, and billings and payments. However, the SOD strategy does not  include specific goals, performance metrics, or implementation time  frames. A comprehensive long-term strategy for online services that  includes these characteristics\u2014whether or not it is incorporated into a  broader strategy such as SOD\u2014would help ensure that IRS is  maximizing the benefit to taxpayers from this investment and reduce  costs in other areas, such as IRS\u2019s telephone operations. Further, it  could address procedures to better protect online accessible data,  which are especially important after the data breach discovered in  May 2015 in which individuals used IRS\u2019s online services to gain  access to information from over 330,000 taxpayers. Thus, we believe  this recommendation remains valid and should be implemented."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Leveraging Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Another way IRS may be able to reduce the tax gap is by leveraging  stakeholders.

Over half of all taxpayers rely on the  expertise of a paid preparer to provide advice and help them meet  their tax obligations. IRS regards paid preparers as a critical link  between taxpayers and the government. Consequently, paid  preparers are in a position to have a significant impact on the federal  government\u2019s ability to collect revenue and minimize the tax gap. We  have previously reported that for IRS to improve its enforcement of tax  laws, it must continue to seek ways to leverage paid preparers to  improve tax compliance.", "Foreign governments. Information from foreign governments is also  important to help improve tax compliance. Increasingly, tax authorities  around the world are exchanging information with other countries to  administer and enforce the tax laws of their respective countries.  Under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, for example, U.S.  financial institutions and other entities are required to withhold a  portion of certain payments made to foreign financial institutions, if  those institutions have not entered into an agreement with IRS to  report U.S. account holders\u2019 details to IRS. We have previously  reported that it is particularly important that the United States  continues to develop and maintain cooperative relationships with  other countries to help ensure that U.S. taxpayers comply with U.S.  tax laws.", "Whistleblowers. Whistleblowers provide IRS information on  suspected noncompliance. They have the potential to help IRS collect  billions in tax revenue that may otherwise go uncollected. Since IRS  expanded its whistleblower program in 2007, it has collected over $1  billion because of whistleblower claims. We have ongoing work for  this committee that focuses on improving IRS\u2019s communication with  whistleblowers and the timeliness of claims processing, among other  things, which could help IRS recover more unpaid tax revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Considering Legislative Action", "paragraphs": ["Given that the tax gap has been a persistent issue, we have previously  reported that reducing it will require targeted legislative actions, including  the following:", "Additional third-party information reporting. As noted earlier,  taxpayers are much more likely to report their income accurately when  the income is also reported to IRS by a third party. In 2008 and 2009,  we suggested Congress consider expanding third-party information  reporting to include payments for services to rental real estate owners  and payments for services provided by corporations, respectively.  In 2010, the Joint Committee on Taxation estimated potential revenue  increases for a 10-year period to be $2.5 billion for third-party  information reporting of rental real estate service payments and $3.4  billion for third-party information reporting of service payments to  corporations. Congress enacted a more expansive regime in 2010,  covering reporting of payments for goods as well as services, and  subsequently repealed these provisions. A more narrow extension of  reporting requirements of payments for services provided by  corporations and for services provided to rental real estate owners  remains an important option for improving compliance.", "Enhanced electronic filing. Requiring additional taxpayers to  electronically file tax and information returns could help IRS improve  compliance in a resource-efficient way. For example, partnerships  with more than 100 partners and corporations with assets of $10  million or more that file at least 250 returns during the calendar year  must electronically file their returns. In 2014, we suggested that  Congress consider expanding the mandate for partnerships and  corporations to electronically file their tax returns, as this could help  IRS reduce return processing costs, select the most productive tax  returns to examine, and examine fewer compliant taxpayers.", "Math error authority. IRS has the authority to correct calculation  errors and check for other obvious noncompliance such as claims  above income and credit limits. Treasury has proposed expanding  IRS\u2019s \u201cmath error\u201d authority to \u201ccorrectible error\u201d authority to permit it  to correct errors in cases where information provided by the taxpayer  does not match information in government databases, among other  things. Expanding such authority\u2014which we have suggested  Congress consider with appropriate safeguards\u2014could help IRS  correct additional errors and avoid burdensome audits and taxpayer  penalties. In March 2015, the Joint Committee on Taxation  estimated that more flexible correctible error authority could raise  $133 million through 2025.", "Paid preparer regulation. Establishing requirements for paid tax  return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax returns they  prepare. Oregon began regulating preparers in the 1970s and  requires testing among other requirements. In August 2008, we found  that the odds that a return filed by an Oregon paid preparer was  accurate were 72 percent higher than the odds for a comparable  return filed by a paid preparer in the rest of the country. In August  2014, IRS reported that 68 percent of all tax returns claiming the EITC  in tax years 2006 and 2007 were prepared by paid tax preparers\u2014 most of whom were not subject to any IRS regulation\u2014and that from  43 to 50 percent of the returns overclaimed the credit. Similarly, in  our undercover visits in 2014 to randomly selected tax preparers, a  sample that cannot be generalized, we found errors in EITC claims  and non-Form W-2 income reporting (for example, cash tips) resulting  in significant overstatement of refunds. Establishing requirements  for paid tax return preparers could improve the accuracy of the tax  returns they prepare, not just returns claiming EITC. In 2014, we  suggested Congress consider granting IRS the authority to regulate  paid tax preparers, if it agrees that significant paid preparer errors  exist. In September 2015, the Senate Committee on Finance  scheduled a committee markup of a bill to introduce legislation that  would regulate all paid tax return preparers, which the Joint  Committee on Taxation estimated would raise $135 million in revenue  through fiscal year 2025.", "Tax reform and simplification. A broader opportunity to address the  tax gap involves simplifying the Internal Revenue Code, as complexity  can cause taxpayer confusion and provide opportunities to hide willful  noncompliance. Fundamental tax reform could result in a smaller tax  gap if the new system has fewer tax preferences or complex tax code  provisions; such reform could reduce IRS\u2019s enforcement challenges  and increase public confidence in the tax system. Short of  fundamental reform, targeted simplification opportunities also exist.  Amending the tax code to make definitions more consistent across tax  provisions could help taxpayers more easily understand and comply  with their obligations and get the maximum tax benefit for their  situations. For example, there are several provisions in the tax code  benefiting taxpayers\u2019 educational expenses, but the definition of what  qualifies as a higher-education expense varies between these tax  expenditures.", "There are no easy solutions to addressing the tax gap. Reducing the tax  gap will require multiple strategies and long-term changes in IRS\u2019s  operations and systems.
