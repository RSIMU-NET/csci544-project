As mentioned above, under EISA, FERC is  responsible for adopting cybersecurity and other standards that it  deems necessary to ensure smart grid functionality and  interoperability. However, FERC had not developed an approach  coordinated with other regulators to monitor, at a high level, the extent  to which industry will follow the voluntary smart grid standards it  adopts. There had been initial efforts by regulators to share views,  through, for example, a collaborative dialogue between FERC and the  National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC),  which had discussed the standards-setting process in general terms.  Nevertheless, according to officials from FERC and NARUC, FERC  and the state public utility commissions had not established a joint  approach for monitoring how widely voluntary smart grid standards  are followed in the electricity industry or developed strategies for  addressing any gaps. Moreover, FERC had not coordinated in such a  way with groups representing public power or cooperative utilities,  which are not routinely subject to FERC\u2019s or the states\u2019 regulatory  jurisdiction for rate setting.

For example, experts stated that while  the industry has an information-sharing center, it had not fully  addressed these information needs. According to these experts,  information regarding incidents such as both successful and  unsuccessful attacks must be able to be shared in a safe and secure  way; this is crucial to avoid publicly revealing the reported  organization and penalizing entities actively engaged in corrective  action.

We further recommended that FERC,  working with NERC as appropriate, assess whether commission efforts  should address any of the cybersecurity challenges identified in our  report.

In  particular, it will be important for federal regulators and other stakeholders  to work closely with the private sector to address key cybersecurity  challenges posed by the transition to smart grid technology.
