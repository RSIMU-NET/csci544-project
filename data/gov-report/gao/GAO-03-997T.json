As required by the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002, GAO reported on the Army's efforts to assess the health status of its early-deploying reservists (Defense Health Care: Army Needs to Assess the Health Status of All Early-Deploying Reservists ( GAO-03-437 , Apr. 15, 2003)). GAO was asked to testify on its findings on the Army's health status assessments efforts and the implications of those assessments for the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Specifically, GAO was asked to determine if the Army is collecting and maintaining information on reservists' health and review the value and advisability of providing examinations. For its report, GAO reviewed medical records at seven Army early-deploying reserve units to determine the number of required examinations that have been conducted and obtained expert opinion on the value of periodic examinations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army has not consistently carried out the statutory requirements for monitoring the health and dental status of its early-deploying reservists. As a result, the Army does not have sufficient information to know how many reservists can perform their assigned duties and are ready for deployment. At reserve units GAO visited, approximately 66 percent of the medical records were available for review. At those locations, GAO found that about 13 percent of the 5-year physical examinations had not been performed, about 49 percent of early-deploying reservists lacked current dental examinations, and none of the annual medical certificates required of reservists were completed by them and reviewed by the units. Medical experts recommend periodic physical and dental examinations as an effective means of assessing health. Army early-deploying reservists need to be healthy to meet the specific demands of their occupations; examinations and other health screenings can be used to identify those who cannot perform their assigned duties. Without adequate examinations, the Army may train, support, and mobilize reservists who are unfit for duty. DOD concurred with GAO's recommendations to comply with statutory requirements to conduct medical and dental examinations and provide dental treatment.

Both the Department of Defense  (DOD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) need this information  to perform their missions. DOD needs health status information to help  ensure the deployment of healthy forces and the continued fitness of those  forces. VA\u2019s Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA) uses health  information to adjudicate veterans\u2019 claims for disability compensation  related to service-connected injuries or illnesses. In addition, the Veterans  Health Administration (VHA) needs this information to fulfill its mission to  provide health care services to veterans. In this context, you asked us to  discuss our recent report on the Department of the Army\u2019s (Army)  assessment of the health status of its reserve forces.  The Army is  increasingly relying on its 560,000 reservists to supplement the capabilities  of our nation\u2019s active duty forces for peacetime support operations as well  as for war.", "When reservists were mobilized during the 1990-91 Persian Gulf War, the  Army discovered that due to medical reasons or poor dental status a  significant number of them could not be deployed or had their deployment  delayed.  In an effort to help ensure that Army reservists meet the  military\u2019s health standards and are ready to perform their assigned duties,  the Congress augmented health assessment requirements that had been in  place prior to the Persian Gulf War.  Specifically, the Congress required  the Army to monitor the health status of those designated as early- deploying reservists by providing annual medical screenings, annual  dental screenings, selected dental treatment, and for those over age 40,  physical examinations every 2 years.  All reservists, including early  deployers, are also required to disclose annually to the Army the status of  their physical and dental condition, and those under age 40 are required to  undergo a physical examination once every 5 years.", "My testimony today is based on our April 2003 report on the Army\u2019s efforts  to assess the health status of the approximately 90,000 reservists who are  specifically designated as early-deploying reservists.  We examined  medical records to determine whether the Army is collecting and  maintaining information on the health status of its early-deploying  reservists. We also assessed the value of periodic physical and dental  examinations and determined the advisability of the statutory  requirements for the Army\u2019s early-deploying reservists.", "To do our work, we visited seven early-deploying U.S. Army Reserve units  in the states of Georgia, Maryland, and Texas and reviewed all available  medical and dental records of reservists assigned to those units. Our  analysis of the information gathered at these units is not projectable. We  reviewed U.S. Army Reserve medical policies and regulations pertaining to  early-deploying reservists. We also reviewed Army National Guard policies  and procedures governing reservists\u2019 health care but did not review  medical or dental records at Army National Guard units. Additionally, we  analyzed Army data showing the cost to perform periodic physical and  dental examinations and to provide dental treatment. We also reviewed  studies and information on the effectiveness of periodic physical and  dental examinations published by DOD, the Department of Health and  Human Services (HHS), the National Institutes of Health, the American  Medical Association, the Academy of General Dentistry, and others. We  interviewed DOD officials in the offices of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Reserve Affairs and the Assistant Secretary for Health Affairs,  and officials in the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army Forces  Command and the Office of the Surgeon General, U.S. Army Reserve  Command to obtain information on the health care provided to Army  early-deploying reservists. We conducted our work from May 2002 through  April 2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "In summary, the Army has not consistently carried out the statutory  requirements for monitoring the health and dental status of Army early- deploying reservists.  As a result, the Army does not have sufficient  information to know how many reservists can perform their assigned  duties and are ready for deployment.  At the seven units we visited,  approximately 66 percent of the medical records were available for our  review.  Based on our review of available records, we found that about 13  percent of the 5-year physical examinations had not been performed, and  none of the annual medical certificates had been completed by reservists  and reviewed by the units.  Furthermore, 49 percent of early-deploying  reservists lacked a current dental examination and 68 percent of those  over the age of 40 lacked a current biennial physical examination.  In  addition, the Army does not have an automated system for maintaining  accurate and complete medical information on early-deploying reservists.   Periodic physical and dental examinations for early-deploying reservists  are valuable for the Army because such examinations provide a means of  determining reservists\u2019 health status and ensuring the medical readiness of  reserve forces.  Without adequate examinations, the Army runs the risk of  mobilizing early-deploying reservists who cannot be deployed because of  their health. In the case of early-deploying reservists who cannot be  deployed, the Army loses not only the amount it invested in salaries and  training but also the particular skill or occupation it was relying on to fill a  specific military need.  In addition, for reservists who may become eligible  for VA benefits, inadequate health information can make it more difficult  to adjudicate claims for service-connected disabilities in an accurate and  timely manner and to provide quality medical care.", "We made recommendations that the Army comply with existing statutory  requirements to help ensure that early-deploying reservists are healthy to  carry out their duties. DOD agreed with our recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In recent years, reservists have regularly been called on to augment the  capabilities of the active-duty forces. The Army is increasingly relying on  its reserve forces to provide assistance with military conflicts and  peacekeeping missions. As of April 2003, approximately 148,000 reservists  from the Army National Guard and the U.S. Army Reserve were mobilized  to active duty positions. In addition, other reservists are serving  throughout the world in peacekeeping missions. The involvement of  reservists in military operations of all sizes, from small humanitarian  missions to major theater wars, will likely continue under the military\u2019s  current war-fighting strategy and its peacetime support operations.", "The Army has designated some Army National Guard and U.S. Army  Reserve units and individuals as early-deploying reservists to ensure that  forces are available to respond rapidly to an unexpected event or for any  other need. Usually, those designated as early-deploying reservists would  be the first troops mobilized if two major ground wars were underway  concurrently. The units and individual reservists designated as early- deploying reservists change as the missions or war plans change. The  Army estimates that of its 560,000 reservists, approximately 90,000 are  reservists who have been individually categorized as early-deploying  reservists or are reservists who are assigned to Army National Guard and  U.S. Army Reserve units that have been designated as early-deploying  units.", "The Army must comply with the following six statutory requirements that  are designed to help ensure the medical and dental readiness of its early- deploying reservists.", "All reservists including early-deployers are required to    have a 5-year physical examination, and    complete an annual certificate of physical condition.", "All early-deploying reservists are also required to have    a biennial physical examination if over age 40,    an annual medical screening,    an annual dental screening, and    dental treatment.", "Army regulations state that the 5- and 2-year physical examinations are  designed to provide the information needed to identify health risks,  suggest lifestyle modifications, and initiate treatment of illnesses. While  the two examinations are similar, the biennial examination for early- deploying reservists over age 40 contains additional age-specific  screenings such as a prostate examination, a prostate-specific antigen test,  and a fasting lipid profile that includes testing for total cholesterol, low- density lipoproteins, and high-density lipoproteins. The Army pays for  these examinations.", "The examinations are also used to assign early-deploying reservists a  physical profile rating, ranging from P1 to P4, in six assessment areas: (a)  Physical capacity, (b) Upper extremities, (c) Lower extremities, (d)  Hearing-ears, (e) Vision-eyes, and (f) Psychiatric. (See app. I for the  Army\u2019s Physical Profile Rating Guide.) According to the Army, P1  represents a non-duty-limiting condition, meaning that the individual is fit  for duty and possesses no physical or psychiatric impairments. P2 means a  condition may exist; however, it is not duty-limiting. P3 or P4 means that  the individual has a duty-limiting condition in one of the six assessment  areas. P4 means the individual functions below the P3 level. A rating of  either P3 or P4 puts the reservist in a nondeployable status or may result  in the changing of the reservist\u2019s job classification.", "Army regulations that implement the statutory certification requirement  provide that all reservists\u2014including early-deploying reservists\u2014certify  their physical condition annually on a two-page certification form. Army  early-deploying reservists must report doctor or dentist visits since their  last examination, describe current medical or dental problems, and  disclose any medications they are currently taking. In addition, the Army is  required to conduct an annual medical screening for all early-deploying  reservists. According to Army regulations, the Army is to meet the annual  medical screening requirement by reviewing the medical certificate  required of each early-deploying reservist.", "Further, Army early-deploying reservists are required to undergo, at the  Army\u2019s expense, an annual dental examination. The Army is also required  to provide and pay for the dental treatment needed to bring an early- deploying reservist\u2019s dental status up to deployment standards\u2014either  dental class 1 or 2.

In 1996, the task force reported that while visits with primary  care clinicians are important, performing the same interventions annually  on all patients is not the most clinically effective approach to disease  prevention.  Consistent with its finding, the task force recommended that  the frequency and content of periodic health examinations should be  based on the unique health risks of individual patients.  Today, many  health associations and organizations are recommending periodic health  examinations that incorporate age-specific screenings, such as cholesterol  screenings for men (beginning at age 35) and women (beginning at age 45)  every 5 years, and clinical breast examinations every 3 to 5 years for  women between the ages of 19 and 39.  Further, oral health care experts  emphasize the importance of regular 6- to 12-month dental examinations.", "Both the private and public sectors have established a fixed schedule of  physical examinations for certain occupations to help ensure that workers  are healthy enough to meet the specific demands of their jobs.  For  example, the Federal Aviation Administration requires commercial pilots  to undergo a physical examination once every 6 months.  U.S. National  Park Service personnel who perform physically demanding duties have a  physical examination once every other year for those under age 40, and on  an annual basis for those over age 40.  Additionally, guidelines published  by the National Fire Protection Association recommend that firefighters  have an annual physical examination regardless of age.", "In the case of Army early-deploying reservists, the goal of the physical and  dental examinations is to help ensure that the reservists are fit enough to  be deployed rapidly and perform their assigned jobs.  Furthermore, the  Army recognizes that some jobs are more demanding than others and  require more frequent examinations.  For example, the Army requires that  aviators undergo a physical examination once a year, while marine divers  and parachutists have physical examinations once every 3 years.", "While governing statutes and regulations require physical examinations at  specific intervals, the Army has raised concerns about the appropriate  frequency for them.  In a 1999 report to the Congress, the Offices of the  Assistant Secretaries of Defense for Health Affairs and Reserve Affairs  stated that while there were no data to support the benefits of conducting  periodic physical examinations, DOD was reluctant to recommend a  change to the statutory requirements.  The report stated that additional  research needs to be undertaken to identify and develop a more cost- effective, focused health assessment tool for use in conducting physical  exams for reservists\u2014in order to ensure the medical readiness of reserve  forces.

The Army could not provide us with information on the  cost to provide these services at military hospitals or clinics primarily  because it does not have a cost accounting system that records or  generates cost data for each patient.  However, the Army was able to  provide us with information on the amount it pays civilian providers for  these examinations under the Federal Strategic Health Care Alliance  program (FEDS_HEAL )\u2014an alliance of private physicians and dentists  and other physicians and dentists who work for VA and HHS\u2019s Division of  Federal Occupational Health. FEDS_HEAL is a program that allows Army  early-deploying reservists to obtain required physical and dental  examinations and dental treatment from local providers.", "Using FEDS_HEAL contract cost information, we estimate the average  cost of the examinations to be about $140 per early-deploying reservist per  year.  We developed the estimate over one 5- year period by calculating the  annual cost for those early-deploying reservists requiring a physical  examination once every 5 years, calculating the cost for those requiring a  physical examination once every 2 years, and calculating the cost for those  requiring an initial dental examination and subsequent yearly dental  examinations.  The FEDS_HEAL cost for each physical examination for  those under 40 is about $291, and for those over 40 is about $370.  The  Army estimates that the cost of annual dental examinations under the  program to be about $80 for new patients and $40 for returning patients.   The Army estimates that it would cost from $400 to $900 per reservist to  bring those who need treatment from dental class 3 to dental class 2."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Conducting Periodic Examinations For the Army", "paragraphs": ["For the Army, there is likely value in conducting periodic examinations  because the average cost to provide physical and dental examinations per  early-deploying reservist\u2014about $140 annually over a 5-year period\u2014is  relatively low compared to the potential benefits associated with such  examinations.  These examinations could help protect the Army\u2019s  investment in its early-deploying reservists by increasing the likelihood  that more reservists will be deployable.  This likelihood is increased when  the Army uses examinations to identify early-deploying reservists who do  not meet the Army\u2019s health standards and are thus not fit for duty.  The  Army can then intervene by treating, reassigning, or dismissing these  reservists with duty-limiting conditions\u2014before their mobilization and  before the Army needs to rely on the reservists\u2019 skills or occupations.", "Furthermore, by identifying duty-limiting conditions or the risks for  developing them, periodic examinations give early-deploying reservists the  opportunity to seek medical care for their conditions\u2014prior to  mobilization.", "Periodic examinations may provide another benefit to the Army.  If the  Army does not know the health condition of its early-deploying reservists,  and if it expects some of them to be unfit and incapable of performing  their duties, the Army may be required to maintain a larger number of  reservists than it would otherwise need in order to fulfill its military and  humanitarian missions.  While data are not available to estimate these  benefits, the benefit associated with reducing the number of reservists the  Army needs to maintain for any given objective could be large enough to  more than offset the cost of the examinations and treatments.  The  proportion of reservists whom the Army maintains but who cannot be  deployed because of their health may be significant.  For instance,  according to a 1998 U.S. Army Medical Command study, a \u201csignificant  number\u201d of Army reservists could not be deployed for medical reasons  during mobilization for the Persian Gulf War (1990-1991).  Further,  according to a study by the Tri-Service Center for Oral Health Studies at  the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, an estimated 25  percent of Army reservists who were mobilized in response to the events  of September 11, 2001, were in dental class 3 and were thus  undeployable.  In fact, our analysis of the available current dental  examinations at the seven early-deploying units showed a similar  percentage of reservists\u201422 percent\u2014who were in dental class 3.  With  each undeployable reservist, the Army loses, at least temporarily, a  significant investment that is large compared to the cost of examining and  treating these reservists.  The annual salary for an Army early-deploying  reservist in fiscal year 2001 ranged from $2,200 to $19,000.  The Army  spends additional amounts to train and equip each reservist and, in some  cases, provides allowances for subsistence and housing.  Additionally, for  each reservist it mobilizes, the Army spends about $800.  If it does not  examine all of its early-deploying reservists, the Army risks losing its  investment because it will train, support, and mobilize reservists who  might not be deployed because of their health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Benefits of Health Assessments for VA", "paragraphs": ["Both VBA and VHA need health assessment data obtained by the Army to  adjudicate disability claims and provide medial care.
