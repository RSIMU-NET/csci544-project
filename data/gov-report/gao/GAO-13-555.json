To conduct this work, GAO reviewed relevant federal laws and regulations; surveyed selected offices within Labor using two questionnaires--one for directly- funded green jobs efforts and one for other efforts; interviewed Labor officials and 11 out of 103 green jobs training grantees; and analyzed relevant Labor documents and data."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Of the $595 million identified by Labor as having been appropriated or allocated specifically for green jobs activities since 2009, approximately $501 million went toward efforts with training and support services as their primary objective, with much of that funding provided by the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Because the Recovery Act directed federal agencies to spend funds quickly and prudently, Labor implemented a number of high-investment green jobs efforts simultaneously. As a result, in some cases, Recovery Act training programs were initiated prior to a full assessment of the demand for green jobs, which presented challenges for grantees. While Labor's internal agencies initially communicated with each other and with other federal agencies after the Recovery Act was passed, most Recovery Act grants have ended or are winding down.", "Labor created its green jobs definitional framework to provide local flexibility, and grantees we interviewed broadly interpreted Labor's framework to include any job that could be linked, directly or indirectly, to a beneficial environmental outcome. Labor's training data show most participants were trained in construction or manufacturing. While the findings of our site visits are not generalizable, all grantees we interviewed said they had worked closely with local employers to align their training program with the green skills needs of local employers. Most grantees we interviewed also told us they had incorporated green elements into existing training programs aimed at traditional skills, such as teaching weatherization as part of a carpentry training program.", "The outcomes of Labor's green jobs training programs remain uncertain, in part because data on final outcomes were not yet available for about 40 percent of grantees, as of the end of 2012. Analysis of grantees with final outcome data shows they collectively reported training slightly more individuals than they had projected, but job placements were at 55 percent of the target. Training-related job placement rates remain unknown because Labor's Office of Inspector General (OIG) found these data unreliable. Grantees we interviewed were generally positive about Labor's green job training programs, but most said they had faced challenges during implementation, including: (1) a lack of reliable green jobs labor market information, (2) insufficient time to meet grant requirements, (3) knowledge gaps surrounding green skills and changing energy policies, and (4) difficulty placing participants into green jobs, primarily due to the overall poor economy.", "Labor has provided technical assistance and taken steps to monitor green jobs training grantees through on-site monitoring visits and quarterly reviews. During these visits and reviews, Labor officials assessed grantee performance, such as by comparing reported program outcomes, including job placements, to targeted performance levels. However, Labor provided only limited guidance on how to document reported job placements. Labor officials required grantees with lower than projected performance levels to implement corrective action plans. In addition, Labor officials told us they have taken steps to improve the quality of grantee reported data, such as by forming an internal workgroup to identify ways to improve the technical assistance they provide to grantees on reporting performance outcomes."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Labor identify lessons learned from the green jobs training programs to enhance its ability to implement such programs in emerging industries.

While Labor created its framework to provide local flexibility, the wide  variation in the types of green jobs obtained by program participants  illustrates just how broadly Labor\u2019s definition can be interpreted and  raises questions about what constitutes a green job\u2014especially in cases  where the job essentially takes the form of a more traditional job (see  table 2). In general, grantees we interviewed considered jobs green if  they could link the job to (1) a green industry, (2) the production or  installation of goods that benefit the environment, (3) the performance of  services that potentially lead to environmental benefits, or (4)  environmentally beneficial work processes. For example, in some cases,  grantees we interviewed considered jobs green because they were linked  to the renewable energy industry, such as solar panel installation or  sales. Grantees considered other jobs green because the goods being  produced benefited the environment, such as the pouring of concrete for  a wind turbine or the installation of energy efficient appliances. In some  cases the green job was service-based, such as an energy auditor or  energy surveyor. Finally, other grantees considered jobs green because  of the environmentally beneficial processes being used, such as applying  paint in an efficient manner or using advanced manufacturing techniques  that reduce waste. Even for jobs where parts of the work have a link to  environmentally beneficial outcomes, workers may only use green skills  or practices for a portion of the time they work.

Grantees in Labor\u2019s newer GJIF program focused even more heavily on  construction\u2014approximately 94 percent of participants were trained in  construction and around 3 percent in manufacturing.", "Most grantees (9) we spoke to had infused green elements into existing  training curricula for more traditional skills. However, the extent to which  the training focused on green versus traditional skills varied across  programs and often depended upon the skill level of targeted participants.  Most (7) of the programs we visited generally targeted relatively low- skilled individuals with limited work experience and were designed to  teach participants the foundational skills they would need to pursue a  career in a skilled trade in which green skills and materials can be used.  For example, those programs typically used their green job grant funds to  incorporate green skills into existing construction, carpentry, heating/air- conditioning, plumbing, or electricity programs. The programs generally  involved a mixture of classroom and hands-on training and taught  traditional skills, such as how to read blueprints, use tools, install and  service appliances, and frame buildings. In teaching these skills,  however, instructors also showed students the way the processes or  products used in performing these tasks could lead to environmentally  beneficial outcomes. For example, participants were taught various ways  to weatherize a building to conserve energy, to efficiently operate heavy  machines to save fuel, or to install solar panels as part of a green  construction project.", "In contrast, two programs we visited focused more exclusively on short- term green skills training to supplement the existing traditional skills of  relatively higher-skilled unemployed workers. For example, one green  awareness program taught participants to identify ways to perform their  work, such as manufacturing, in a more environmentally beneficial  manner, often by identifying and reducing waste. Another program added  a component to their comprehensive electrical training program to train  unemployed registered electricians how to install and maintain advanced  energy efficient lighting systems.

Specifically, Labor officials  said that while there is not a formal process to study the UI data, program  staff routinely examine these data to identify lessons learned and best  practices that could be applied to future grant programs. Labor officials  said the data could be used to compare the green jobs training programs  against other training programs across the agency, such as those under  WIA, if resources permit. While Labor officials consider the UI data to be  more definitive than the grantee-reported job placement data to measure  overall program outcomes once the grant period ends, they stressed the  importance of having real-time data to monitor grantee performance  during implementation.", "While the UI wage record data provide an alternative source of  information on job placement outcomes, due to a 9-month lag time, these  data are of limited usefulness regarding program management.  Specifically, because of the time lag, grantees could not use these data to  monitor their progress toward meeting program goals in real-time.  Further, Labor could not use the data to hold grantees accountable for  meeting grant goals, as all grant periods will have ended before the data  are complete. Consequently, ensuring the reliability of grantee reported  outcome data remains vitally important, particularly for grant programs  whose primary objective is to prepare workers for attaining employment in  a targeted emerging industry."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Grantees Highlighted Green Jobs Training Benefits and Challenges", "paragraphs": ["The grantees we interviewed were generally positive about Labor\u2019s green  jobs training programs, with most speaking optimistically about the  potential value of the green skills obtained by the program participants.  Most grantees we met with said that they believe there to be a continued  national movement towards lowering energy usage\u2014whether due to  economic, policy, or cultural changes\u2014and all projected that the  demand for workers with green skills credentials will continue to rise. All  (11 of 11) were of the opinion that possessing green skills in addition to  more traditional skills provides workers with an advantage as they seek a  new job or move along a career pathway, and most (10) cited the need  for training programs that provide nationally or industry-recognized green  credentials. Two noted that having multiple credentials was particularly  valuable. Lastly, some (5) grantees mentioned that the benefits of the  green jobs training, like most job training, may not become apparent  immediately, but may often be realized later during the worker\u2019s career,  especially as demand for green skills grows.", "However, all grantees noted there have been challenges associated with  developing and implementing Labor\u2019s green jobs training programs. For  example, most (8) of the grantees we interviewed said that the lack of  credible green jobs labor market information had limited their ability to  identify or predict the level of available green jobs or the demand for  green skills in their local area. Although state workforce agencies  received funding to conduct green jobs labor market information studies  under the State Labor Market Information Improvement grants, most  resulting data were issued after many Recovery Act training programs  had already begun. In addition, the BLS surveys were released from  March 2012 through March 2013, after GJIF grantees had submitted their  applications outlining their training programs to Labor. Having access to  the final results of the state labor market information studies could have  provided Recovery Act grantees with additional insights into their state\u2019s  economic activity in the energy efficiency and renewable energy  industries, as well as jobs within those industries when they were  developing their training programs. Similarly, BLS survey results could  have provided GJIF grantees with a national snapshot of establishments  that produce green goods and services and the jobs of workers involved  in green activities, among other information, and may have provided  grantees with additional context for the development and implementation  of their green jobs training programs. Labor officials said the rapidly  evolving nature of the green industries has resulted in multiple changes to  employer green job demand information over the course of the grant  periods, further complicating their attempts to provide labor market  information for this sector.", "In addition, most (9) grantees we met with said Labor\u2019s green jobs  training grants did not afford them enough time to both develop local  partnerships and recruit, train, and place program participants. All  grantees said developing partnerships can be especially time-consuming  if such partnerships had not existed prior to the grant award.noted that given how important local partnerships are to developing  successful training programs, training programs that require such  partnerships should have longer grant periods than those afforded by the  Recovery Act and GJIF programs.", "Most (9)", "Furthermore, most (8) grantees mentioned how developing and  implementing a relatively new type of training, like green skills, can  require additional time in order to fill knowledge gaps among employers.  This may be especially true in light of changing state and local energy  policies. For example, according to the Department of Energy, as of  March 2013, 29 states have established standards aimed at generating a  certain percentage of the state\u2019s energy using renewable sources by a  specified year. Furthermore, many municipalities throughout the country  are requiring that local construction projects adhere to environmentally  friendly requirements. However, most (9) grantees we spoke with said  some employers may not recognize how changing policies will affect their  businesses. In fact, they believe this lack of understanding may be  limiting demand for workers trained in green skills. To address this  problem, one of the grantees we interviewed had developed a 1-day  training program for local business managers to educate them about how  they could benefit from the green skills that participants were obtaining  through the organization\u2019s training program. Most (6) grantees said at  times during the implementation of their green jobs training program, they  were, in effect, attempting to simultaneously drive both supply and  demand for workers with green skills, which took considerable time and  effort.", "In addition, although all grantees we interviewed had engaged with  employers who had committed their support for the training curriculum,  they also said this did not always translate into green jobs for program  participants. Above all, most (9) pointed to the slow economic recovery as  the reason their predictions\u2014and those made by employers\u2014regarding  green job growth were not fully realized. For example, one grantee  explained how the local housing market had not recovered as quickly as  anticipated, and as a result, demand for workers with green skills\u2014such  as green construction techniques, weatherization practices, and the  installation of energy efficient appliances\u2014has been sluggish. In addition,  most (10) grantees explained that because green skills are often  intertwined with traditional skills training and the skilled labor industries,  their programs\u2019 participants were negatively affected by the overall poor  economy. For example, most grantees (9) noted how their program  participants, despite their additional layer of green skills training, found  themselves competing with a high number of unemployed workers who  were also seeking to regain employment in more traditional jobs such as  carpentry or electrical work. Most (9) grantees also noted that renewable  energy sectors, such as solar power, have not grown in their regions as  was predicted several years ago. Lastly, most (7) grantees we  interviewed said it is difficult to accurately measure the value of green  skills training in terms of green job placement. In general, they said this is  partly because, unlike jobs in other growing industries, like health care,  there are few distinctly green jobs. One grantee we met with said she  believes the term \u201cgreen job\u201d is misleading, and complicates program  implementation. This grant official said that funding should be directed  toward supplementing traditional skills training with green skills that can  be used on any job rather than on preparing workers for specific jobs  identified as green.", "Based on our interviews with grantees of Labor\u2019s green jobs training  programs, and the descriptions of their experiences implementing those  programs, we identified several lessons learned that may warrant  consideration when implementing similar targeted grant programs for  other emerging industries (see table 3)."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Labor Has Assisted and Monitored Grantees, but Has Provided Limited Guidance on Outcome Documentation Requirements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Labor Has Provided Various Forms of Technical Assistance to Support Green Jobs Grantees", "paragraphs": ["Labor has provided all green jobs grantees with technical assistance to  help them implement their grant programs and comply with relevant  federal laws and regulations.

Labor also maintains a website for each  green jobs training grant program and a green jobs community of practice  on its online platform, Workforce3One. In addition, Labor has published  bimonthly digests for Recovery Act grantees since January 2011 that  highlight new technical assistance materials and other grant-related  information. Finally, Labor has compiled and periodically updated a  technical assistance guide that briefly describes and provides hyperlinks  for its technical assistance resources, including webinar recordings and  promising practices. Several grantees we interviewed (4 of 11) reported  participating in webinars and referring to technical assistance materials  posted to Workforce3One.", "In addition, ETA has funded three separate studies to assess the  implementation of selected green jobs programs funded by the Recovery  Act. Specifically, Labor funded a 2-year implementation evaluation that  examined the implementation of the three Recovery Act-funded green  jobs training programs and issued both interim and final reports. ,   Labor also funded an evaluation of the State Labor Market Information  Improvement grants and issued a final report and additional related  products in 2013.

In conjunction with Labor officials, the TA  Partnership has facilitated monthly conference calls for each grant  program so grantees can learn from their peers and receive program- specific technical assistance. The TA Partnership has also compiled and  updated reports that highlight promising practices grantees have  implemented. Finally, the TA Partnership and Labor officials have held  annual grantee conferences, which have covered various topics including  strategies to retain and place program participants and the importance of  nationally recognized credentials. Several (4 of 11) grantees we  interviewed mentioned participating in the monthly conference calls and  annual conferences and said that generally they had been helpful.", "While Labor provided guidance and technical assistance on how to  document eligibility for the green jobs training programs, it provided little  guidance on what documentation grantees were expected to maintain  regarding program outcomes, particularly with respect to job placement.", "Specifically, while Labor provided guidance on how to report required  performance data into its Recovery Act Database, this guidance does not  specify what documentation, if any, grantees were to maintain for  reported job placements, including those considered training-related. Our  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government provides that  internal control and all transactions and other significant events should be  clearly documented and readily available for examination. However, in  its last green jobs report, the OIG found that nearly a quarter of reported  outcomes were not supported by adequate documentation. One regional  official noted that sub-grantees may not have known what documentation  was required and staff in another office said that in some cases primary  grantees may not have done enough to ensure that the sub-grantees they  were responsible for overseeing understood documentation requirements.", "While Labor officials have not issued additional guidance to GJIF  grantees regarding how to document job placement and retention  outcomes, they said they have taken other steps that address the OIG\u2019s  recommendation to improve the quality of grantee reported performance  data and utilize lessons learned from Recovery Act-funded green jobs  training programs for other discretionary grant programs. First, ETA  officials noted that they have formed an internal workgroup focused on  improving the technical assistance provided to ETA\u2019s discretionary  grantees about how to report program outcomes. This group hopes to  issue recommendations in September 2013, and ETA officials believe  these recommendations will help improve grant application instructions,  and help ETA refine their reporting systems, among other things. Second,  ETA officials told us that they had initiated a grant re-engineering project  in August 2012 to identify common grant management challenges and  develop strategies for addressing such challenges. For instance, the  group has discussed ways to improve ETA\u2019s grant solicitation process,  such as by including clearer expectations and benchmarks for  performance in its solicitations for grant applications and by taking steps  to ensure greater comparability of goals across grantees.

Specifically,  according to officials from all six of ETA\u2019s regional offices, ETA\u2019s federal  project officers monitor grantees as part of their ongoing duties, which  include calling grantees to offer technical assistance. In addition, ETA\u2019s  federal project officers perform quarterly desk reviews, during which they  review financial reports and quarterly performance reports that grantees  are required to submit. For the green jobs training grants, these reports  include information such as the total amount of grant funds spent, the  number of participants who began or completed training, a timeline for  grant activities and deliverables, grantee accomplishments, and technical  assistance needs. During these quarterly reviews, federal project officers  compare grantees\u2019 reported performance outcomes and spending rates to  those goals set by grantees in their grant proposals. Based upon their  review of each grantee\u2019s reported information, federal project officers  enter information about each grantee into Labor\u2019s Grant Electronic  Management System (GEMS), which assesses risk and generates a risk  level for each grantee.", "The GEMS assessment of each grantee\u2019s risk level is then used by Labor  to develop its risk-based monitoring strategy, which involves prioritizing  site visits based on grantees\u2019 assessed risk-levels and availability of  resources, among other factors. According to regional officials from all six offices, nearly all green jobs training grantees received at least one  on-site monitoring visit, typically about halfway through the period of  performance. During these site visits, federal project officers assessed  grantees\u2019 management and performance and documented any  noncompliance findings and requirements for corrective action, as  necessary. For example, Labor\u2019s site visit guide includes questions for  federal project officers to consider about financial and performance data  reporting systems and performance outcomes.", "As a result of its on-site monitoring activities, Labor officials identified and  required certain grantees to correct a variety of issues concerning the  management of their grants. Many monitoring reports for the Recovery  Act-funded green jobs training grants indicated that grantees were not on  track to meet their performance outcomes. In such cases Labor required  grantees to submit written corrective action plans that described what  strategies they would undertake to increase project outcomes and how  they would ensure that remaining funds would be used in a timely way to  accomplish project objectives.", "Labor officials said that grantees have made significant progress toward  attaining their goals for beginning and completing training as a result of  both the grantees\u2019 own efforts and ETA\u2019s technical assistance and  monitoring efforts. These officials also stressed that while ETA holds  grantees accountable to adhering to their grant statements of work,  grantees are not contractually obligated to meet performance outcomes.Unlike contracts or WIA-funded programs, which can impose sanctions  for failing to meet projected targets, the accountability mechanisms for  these green jobs grant programs were more limited. For example, ETA  officials said that if a grantee does not achieve its placement outcomes,  this can affect whether the grantee receives a period of performance  extension for the current grant or, potentially, a future grant from ETA.  Officials said that they had not withdrawn funding from any grantees for  failing to meet performance targets for any of the four green jobs training  programs. However, in some cases ETA officials decided not to grant  extension requests for grantees reporting poor performance. As a result,  some grant funds remained unexpended and will be returned to the  Treasury, as required.", "In addition to insufficient progress toward targeted outcomes, the  monitoring reports of the Recovery Act-funded green jobs training  grantees identified other noncompliance findings, including insufficient  monitoring of sub-grantees. For example, a number of monitoring reports  indicated that primary grantees had not sufficiently monitored their sub- grantees. These findings are notable given that such a large percentage  of grantees implemented their programs through a network of sub- grantees. Both GAO and the Department of Justice\u2019s OIG have stressed  the importance of sufficient sub-recipient monitoring to the grant oversight  process. Other noncompliance findings included grantees lacking  adequate documentation to show program participants were eligible for  services or grantees having failed to follow acceptable procurement  processes.

Most of these programs have already ended or are  currently winding down, although a few of Labor\u2019s continuing programs,  such as YouthBuild, have incorporated many green elements since 2009,  and the Green Job Innovation Fund program is scheduled to remain  active through June of 2014. Despite the sizeable investment in green  jobs, the green jobs training programs have faced a number of  implementation challenges and final outcomes remain uncertain,  particularly regarding placement into green jobs. A number of these  challenges have stemmed from the need to implement the grants quickly  and simultaneously before green jobs had been defined and more had  been learned about the demand for green skills. Others, such as  problems with the reliability of outcome data, can be traced to  management issues that have compromised Labor\u2019s ability to measure  the program\u2019s success, particularly regarding placing participants into  training-related employment. Specifically, because Labor did not establish  clear and timely guidelines for how to document green job placement  outcomes, Labor is not able to assess the extent to which the targeted  green jobs training programs placed participants in employment related to  the training they received.", "The challenges for an emerging industry such as energy efficiency and  renewable energy are substantial. Uncertainty and debate still surround  the question of what constitutes a green job. Under Labor\u2019s current  framework, almost any job can be considered green if a link between the  employee\u2019s tasks and environmental benefits can be made. Indeed, most  grantee officials we interviewed said that most green jobs they have  trained participants for are primarily traditional skilled-trades jobs, such as  carpentry or electrical work. Many have been termed \u201cgreen\u201d because the  worker has been trained to be mindful of energy use and reduce waste, or  has been placed where the worker\u2019s tasks resulted in a product or service  that benefited the environment, such as a light-rail construction site.", "Such an approach provides certain benefits within the context of an  emerging industry, in that many of the skills workers obtain can be  transferred to traditional jobs in cases where local demand for green jobs  falls below expectations. It also may serve to raise general worker  awareness about energy efficiency and waste reduction, to the benefit of  the employer or nation. Nonetheless, this emphasis on training that often  takes the form of traditional skills training with an added layer of green  may not fully align with the intent of the targeted training funds.", "By funding several evaluations of green jobs training and labor market  information programs, Labor has positioned itself to build upon lessons  learned through implementing these individual programs. A fundamental  consideration is whether it is prudent to implement job training programs  for an emerging industry before more is known about the demand for  skills and workers. Another consideration is whether it would be more or  less effective for federally-funded training programs to focus on providing  valuable green skills and credentials applicable on a wide variety of jobs,  rather than to devote considerable attention to what is defined as a green  job.", "Even though Labor is scaling back its own green jobs efforts, energy  efficiency and renewable energy will likely remain a national priority.  Labor has established a green jobs community of practice on its online  platform, Workforce3One, which, if maintained and used, can continue to  facilitate information-sharing among grantees and workforce  professionals regarding what green skills and credentials employers in  their communities value most. In addition, the substantial investment in  energy efficiency and renewable energy made through these grant  programs also provides Labor an opportunity to identify broader lessons  learned about the challenges and benefits associated with offering  targeted training in an emerging industry, which could help inform the  development of training for other emerging industries in the future.
