As an organization committed to having a high-performing, diverse workforce, GAO places great importance on attracting, hiring, training, and retaining employees with the skills needed to support GAO's mission to serve Congress and the American public. GAO has a multi-disciplinary workforce, with most staff having backgrounds in public policy, public administration, law, business, computer science, accounting, social sciences, or economics. While our current and future hiring will be shaped by today's constrained budget environment, over the past 5 years, on average, GAO has hired about 300 employees each year. The majority of these hires were for analyst and analyst-related positions at the entry level. GAO also has a robust paid student intern program each year. Many of these interns return as entry-level analysts. Having a strong campus recruitment program has played a key role in attracting highly qualified candidates for our permanent and intern positions and building our workforce. In response to congressional request, the remarks will focus on (1) the strong partnerships developed through our campus recruitment program, (2) recent actions GAO has taken to enhance the program and the positive outcomes GAO has experienced, and (3) the programs and policies we have in place to support new staff."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Through our campus recruitment program, we have established ongoing relationships with many colleges and universities across the country. While we advertise all of our new positions publicly, currently we have relationships with about 70 colleges and universities, including private and public colleges and universities, Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions, and other minority-serving institutions. These targeted schools have academic programs relevant to our skill needs (e.g., public policy, accounting, business or computer science) and that prepare students well for success at GAO. Our relationship-building over the years has been based primarily on visiting many of these schools to participate in on-campus events. As part of overall efforts to focus more attention on our strategic human capital management, we have taken proactive steps to improve our recruitment program. Specifically, we (1) established stronger linkages between our recruitment efforts and organizational workforce needs, (2) increased diversity of and enhanced supports for our staff serving as recruiters, and (3) instituted stronger program management and accountability processes. We have seen positive outcomes from these efforts. Along with attracting and hiring high-quality, diverse staff, we have implemented programs and policies to support new staff once they arrive at GAO. The support for our entry-level staff comes predominantly through their participation in our highly regarded, 2-year, Professional Development Program (PDP). This program provides new employees with the foundations to be successful because it teaches them about our core values, how we do our work, and the standards by which we assess our performance. All entry-level analyst or analyst-related new hires are assigned advisers to assist in their development and provide support, although staff are also strongly encouraged to take an active role in their own career development by crafting Individual Development Plans and assessing their own strengths and growth areas. Staff receive multiple assignments while in the program so they can gain firsthand experience with the wide range of our work. They also receive a rigorous regimen of classroom and on-the-job training to learn about our work processes and requirements. Staff in the PDP program also receive formal feedback every 3 months and twice-yearly performance appraisals that can result in salary increases. In addition, actions of our senior leaders as well as several policies and other programs help our new hires make a successful adjustment to GAO. The Comptroller General and others meet with new employees during their first few months to answer any questions about GAO or our relationship with Congress. Other senior managers, including Managing Directors and directors in each GAO team, are encouraged not only to meet with new staff but take an active role in their development and day-to-day work environment. We also have policies in place to foster an inclusive and supportive work environment and help all staff balance work and life. We also have a student loan repayment program to help eligible staff defray educational costs. PDP staff, as all staff at GAO, can take advantage of a mentoring program to assist staff in becoming effective leaders, managing their work environments, and developing their careers. These programs and policies have helped make GAO a great place to work."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to discuss GAO\u2019s campus  recruitment program.

The key elements of this program are (1) ongoing  relationships with many colleges and universities and (2) the use of senior  executives and other staff to develop and maintain those relationships. We  supplement this program through additional activities designed to help  others learn about GAO.", "We have established ongoing relationships with many colleges and  universities across the country. While we advertise all of our new  positions publicly, currently we have relationships with about 70 colleges  and universities, including private and public colleges and universities,  Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic-serving institutions,  and other minority-serving institutions.

Our relationship-building over the years has been  based primarily on visiting many of these schools to participate in on- campus events.", "We use senior executives and other staff from across the agency to  develop and maintain these relationships. Serving as \u201crecruiters,\u201d these   executives and staff help faculty, career placement officials, and students  at the colleges and universities we visit understand the work we do and  the skills required for that work. Senior executives, who serve as Campus  Executives, have specific schools for which they are responsible. Other  staff\u2014often alumni of those schools\u2014support the executives by setting up  and participating in campus events, such as information sessions, class  presentations, or career fairs. Our staff often seek opportunities to  communicate about our mission and their experiences at GAO to  interested parties, as they view recruitment opportunities as part of their  institutional stewardship responsibility.", "In addition to our targeted campus outreach, we conduct a variety of  activities to help potential candidates and officials from colleges and  universities learn about GAO or the type of work we do. For example, our  analyst staff often works with students enrolled in masters\u2019 programs in  public policy or administration on projects in which GAO acts as a \u201cclient.\u201d  Groups of students are assigned an issue or evaluation topic, then advised  by our staff as they proceed with their research, which culminates in a  report to us as the client. These projects provide students \u201creal world\u201d  experience in conducting public policy analysis. We also address classes  or groups of students and host visits from groups to hear about our work  and GAO\u2019s impact. Since 2001, we have held a yearly Educators\u2019 Advisory  Panel, which includes deans and professors from schools we visit as well  as selected others. Through this panel, we have obtained advice and  provided feedback about ways schools can refine and strengthen their  curricula to make their graduates more successful.", "Finally, we conduct outreach to professional organizations and groups. We  attend and/or make presentations at various conferences or invite  representatives of these groups to address GAO staff. The groups we have  networked with in the past include those whose members have relevant  backgrounds (e.g., the American Economic Association), as well as other  groups with members that traditionally have been underrepresented in the  federal workforce, including the American Association of Hispanic CPAs,  the National Association of Black Accountants, or the Federal Asian  Pacific American Council.", "Our approach has been extremely effective in developing strong  partnerships with many colleges and universities and professional  organizations. Our brand recognition has grown tremendously on  campuses and in the public policy arena. This, among other reasons, has  contributed to our receiving thousands of high-quality applicants each year  for our advertised positions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "We Have Taken Actions to Enhance Our Campus Recruitment Program", "paragraphs": ["As part of overall efforts to focus more attention on our strategic human  capital management, we have taken proactive steps to improve our  recruitment program.

To  accomplish this, we adopted a recruiting framework that has allowed us to  better address our skill gaps and enhance the diversity of our workforce,  such as hiring more Hispanics, individuals with disabilities, and veterans.  This framework was particularly critical this year, as we needed to identify  how to address our needs despite significant fiscal constraints. Using this  framework, we made decisions to discontinue certain efforts or initiate new  ones to meet our needs and better allocate our resources. For example, we  customized our interactions with campuses so that we could devote the  appropriate level and type of resources needed to meet our needs. While we  continue to believe that developing and maintaining strong relationships  with college and university campuses is critical, on-site visits are less  necessary given workforce and technological changes. As a result, based on  an analysis of our workforce needs, school characteristics (e.g., student  demographics, academic programs, and proximity of the campus to GAO  offices), and our history with the campuses (e.g., number of applicants,  applicant experience, and hires), our efforts now include a range of both on- site and virtual activities. The benefit of this approach is that we can adjust  it at any time based on our needs.", "We also made critical decisions about how to best supplement our campus  outreach efforts to support our workforce needs in the most cost-effective  manner. We considered our costs to participate in various events, results  from past participation, and the anticipated future benefits in order to set  our future priorities about what organizations and events we would   centrally support. For example, we supported participation in the Careers  and the disABLED Expo and the Association of Latinos in Public Finance  and Accounting Conference to help enhance the diversity of our  workforce as well as to attract candidates with needed skills. We also  partnered with the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities, as  well as the Public Policy and International Affairs Fellowship Program, to  hire 10 qualified student interns. We also determined how we could cost-  efficiently use other approaches to meet our needs. As a result, we have  advertised in those journals targeting individuals with disabilities, African-  Americans, or critical skill areas (e.g., economists) to expand our  outreach. We also utilized low-cost mechanisms such as electronically  notifying hundreds of colleges and universities and relevant organizations  about vacancies, revamping our external careers web site, and updating  our recruitment materials to provide better information about GAO\u2019s  worklife, programs, and values.  These efforts are important ways to  inform any interested candidate about GAO and available opportunities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Increased Diversity of and Enhanced Supports for Recruiters", "paragraphs": ["Given the important role our recruiters serve in our campus recruitment  program, we have taken steps to have a recruitment cadre that is diverse  and well-trained. We solicited recruiters from throughout GAO and asked  representatives from our numerous employee groups to serve as  recruiters. Our recruitment cadre is diverse\u2014representing staff from  various GAO offices, teams, locations, job levels and positions. We also  required that each employee interested in becoming a recruiter obtain  senior management approval and attend our training workshop to learn  about GAO-wide workforce needs and improve his or her ability to provide  accurate, consistent, and timely information about our operations,  programs, worklife, and values. This training has helped to ensure that all  recruiters understand their responsibilities.", "We also have developed additional support for our recruiters to ensure  consistent and timely dissemination of information. This support has  included a slide presentation that describes GAO\u2019s core values, business  operations, and impact; a tip sheet that helps recruiters understand how to  work with prospective applicants who may need to be accommodated; and  a listing of specific types of activities recruiters can undertake at targeted  campuses. While we have not identified a single \u201cbest practice,\u201d some of  our efforts that that have proven successful include:    sending recruitment brochures/supplies to campus contacts;  researching and contacting appropriate campus-based groups that have a  diverse membership, as well as professional associations and relevant  academic programs;    establishing strong relationships with career placement staff;    conducting information sessions with appropriate audiences;    participating in career fairs, when appropriate;    making class presentations that illustrate the nature of our work;    getting our work incorporated into program curricula; and    serving on advisory boards or as adjunct faculty with colleges and  universities.", "To further assist our recruiters, we have provided real-time information  and suggestions to help them better leverage their time. Specifically, we  have kept recruiters apprised of the status of hiring announcements and  shared data on the number of individuals hired for different positions\u2014 including the names of individuals hired from their specific schools\u2014so  recruiters could see the results of their efforts. Given additional budget  constraints, we have suggested ways for our recruiters to more cost- effectively maintain strong campus relationships such as    asking various academic programs within the same college or university to  schedule joint presentations or visits by GAO;    asking recent interns/hires to serve as informal ambassadors; and    using local GAO staff to attend events at various campuses."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Instituted Stronger Program Management and Accountability Processes", "paragraphs": ["In order to be able to better manage our campus recruitment program and  assess program outcomes, we instituted a number of structural and  administrative changes over the last several years. We placed overall  program responsibility in our Human Capital Office and created three  senior-level advisory boards to provide insight on our program operations  and results. To obtain more robust information on recruiter activity, as  well as create more program accountability, we have developed a  standardized template to document recruiters\u2019 strategies for working with  individual schools and organizations. Through this template, recruiters  must provide information on the members of the recruitment team,  planned activities at the school or organization, and estimated costs. This  strategy document must be completed by the recruiters, submitted to, and  approved by Human Capital Office staff before funding is authorized and  activities can begin. When an event is completed, recruiters report what  occurred and assess the outcome. This information is summarized and  subsequently shared with our recruiters in the form of best practices or  lessons learned. The template also serves as the basis for data collection  on agency-wide recruitment activity, including number of campuses and  organizations visited, number and type of events conducted, costs  associated with each event, and recruiters\u2019 views on the effectiveness of  various events.", "We also have instituted more rigorous data collection and analysis of  applicant and hire information. For example, for fiscal year 2010  vacancies, we analyzed information on the background and diversity of  our applicants and hires (e.g., degree level obtained, school attended,  years of work experience, ethnicity, race, gender) and the information  applicants provided on why they applied for the job. Through analysis of  these data, we were able to gain insight on how our program activities  related to our hiring outcomes. For example, we identified the percentage  of applicants and hires that came from the colleges and universities we  targeted, or that applied because of an interaction with GAO. While not  perfect, this analysis has helped us to learn what is working, or what  changes we need to make to enhance our recruitment approach.", "While we have made great strides in using data to inform and assess our  campus recruitment program operations, we continue to explore how to  judge the effectiveness of our recruitment efforts. For example, it is  challenging to define a specific benchmark when assessing whether the  number of applicants and hires from the schools or organizations we  target is sufficient given our expenditures. Additionally, it is difficult to  specifically identify those factors beyond our outreach\u2014such as our  mission, recognition as one of the best places to work, or informal  communications\u2014that affect an individual\u2019s decision to apply to GAO. To  that end, we plan to gather more detailed information from our applicants  about the role of factors beyond our outreach efforts that have influenced  their decisions to apply to GAO. This information can inform our future  recruitment efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieved Positive Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Our efforts have led to positive outcomes.

We  continue to be an employer of choice and we received thousands of  applications for our open positions in fiscal year 2010. As an example, we  received about 20 applications for each of our GAO Graduate Analyst  Intern positions filled in fiscal year 2010.
