Specifically, it addressees (1) the extent to which the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has assessed the risks facing the U.S. passenger rail system and developed a strategy based on risk assessments for securing all modes of transportation, including passenger rail, and (2) the actions that federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of the U.S. passenger rail system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The DHS Office of Grants and Training (OGT) and TSA have begun to assess the risks facing the U.S. passenger rail system. However, GAO reported in September 2005 that TSA had not completed a comprehensive risk assessment of passenger rail. GAO found that, until TSA does so, it may be limited in its ability to prioritize passenger rail assets and help guide security investments. GAO also reported that DHS had begun, but not yet completed, a framework to help agencies and the private sector develop a consistent approach for analyzing and comparing risks among and across critical sectors. Since that time, TSA has reported taking additional steps to assess the risks to the passenger rail system. However, as of March 2, 2007, TSA has not issued the required Transportation Sector Specific Plan and supporting plans for passenger rail and other surface transportation modes, based on risk assessments. Until TSA does so, it lacks a clearly communicated strategy with goals and objectives for securing the transportation sector, including passenger rail. After September 11, DOT initiated efforts to strengthen passenger rail security. TSA has also taken actions to strengthen rail security, including issuing security directives, testing security technologies, and issuing a proposed rule for passenger and freight rail security, among other efforts. However, federal and rail industry stakeholders have questioned the extent to which TSA's directives were based on industry best practices. OGT has also acted to help improve passenger rail security by, for example, providing funding for security enhancements to rail transit agencies and Amtrak through various grant programs. DHS and DOT have taken steps to better coordinate their respective rail security roles and responsibilities.

Since its creation following the events of September 11, 2001, the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has focused much of its  efforts and resources on meeting legislative mandates to strengthen  commercial aviation security. However, TSA has recently placed  additional focus on securing surface modes of transportation, particularly  in the area of passenger rail. Passenger rail systems, which include rail  transit (commuter, heavy, and light rail) and intercity passenger rail, are  inherently open and difficult to secure. One of the critical challenges  facing federal agencies and the rail system operators they oversee or  support is finding ways to protect these systems from potential terrorist  attacks without compromising the accessibility and efficiency of rail  travel. The four attacks in Europe and Asia since 2004, including the most  recent in India, highlight the vulnerabilities of passenger rail systems and  make clear that even when security precautions are put in place, these  systems remain vulnerable to attack. Securing rail and surface  transportation systems is a daunting task, requiring that the federal  government develop a clearly communicated strategy, including goals and  objectives, for strengthening the security of these systems. As part of that  strategy, it is also critical to assess the risks facing these systems so that  limited resources and security efforts can be prioritized to the areas of  greatest need. Furthermore, because the responsibility for securing rail is  shared between federal, state, and local governments and the private  sector, it is critical that the federal government develop partnerships and  coordinate its security efforts with transportation industry stakeholders.", "As we have reported previously, the sheer number of stakeholders  involved in securing passenger rail can sometimes lead to communication  challenges, duplication of effort, and confusion about roles and  responsibilities. Key Department of Homeland Security (DHS)  stakeholders with critical roles include TSA, which is responsible for the  security of all modes of transportation. In addition, the DHS Office of  Grants and Training (OGT) provides grant funds to rail operators and  conducts risk assessments for passenger rail agencies. Within the  Department of Transportation (DOT), the Federal Transit Administration  (FTA) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) have responsibilities for  passenger rail safety and security. In addition, public and private  passenger rail operators are responsible for securing their rail systems.", "At the federal level, another challenge related to securing passenger rail  systems involves allocating limited resources on the basis of risk. Within  and among all modes of transportation, there is competition for resources,  as federal, state, and local agencies and transportation operators seek to  identify and invest in appropriate security measures to safeguard these  systems while also investing in other capital and operational  improvements. Moreover, given competing priorities and limited homeland  security resources, difficult policy decisions have to be made by Congress  and the executive branch to prioritize security efforts and direct resources  to the areas of greatest risk within and among transportation modes and  across other nationally critical sectors.", "In this regard, to help federal decision makers determine how to best  allocate limited resources, we have advocated, the National Commission  on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (the 9/11 Commission) has  recommended, and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  of 2004 provides that a risk management approach be employed to guide  decision-making related to homeland security resources. A risk  management approach entails a continuous process of managing risks  through a series of actions, including setting strategic goals and objectives,  assessing and quantifying three key elements of risk\u2014threat, vulnerability,  and criticality or consequence\u2014evaluating alternative security measures,  selecting which measures to undertake, and implementing and monitoring  those measures.", "My testimony today focuses on the actions federal agencies have taken in  developing and implementing security strategies and setting security  priorities. In particular, my testimony highlights two key areas: (1) the  extent to which DHS has assessed the risks facing the U.S. passenger rail  system and developed a strategy based on risk assessments for securing  all modes of transportation, including passenger rail and (2) the actions  that federal agencies have taken to enhance the security of the U.S.  passenger rail system. My comments today are primarily based on our  September 2005 report addressing the security of the U.S. passenger rail  system. This report was based on work conducted at DHS, DOT, and  Amtrak, as well as 32 passenger rail operators in the United States, and 13  passenger rail operators in seven European and Asian countries. In  addition, we recently obtained selected updates from DHS on its efforts to  secure passenger rail systems.

Commuter rail systems typically operate on railroad tracks and provide  regional service between a central city and adjacent suburbs. Commuter  rail systems are traditionally associated with older industrial cities, such  as Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and Chicago. Heavy rail systems\u2014 subway systems like New York City\u2019s transit system and Washington,  D.C.\u2019s Metro\u2014typically operate on fixed rail lines within a metropolitan  area and have the capacity for a heavy volume of traffic. Amtrak operates  the nation\u2019s primary intercity passenger rail service over a 22,000-mile  network, primarily over freight railroad tracks.

By design, passenger rail systems are open, have multiple access  points, are hubs serving multiple carriers, and, in some cases, have no  barriers so that they can move large numbers of people quickly. In  contrast, the U.S. commercial aviation system is housed in closed and  controlled locations with few entry points. The openness of passenger rail  systems can leave them vulnerable because operator personnel cannot  completely monitor or control who enters or leaves the systems. In  addition, other characteristics of some passenger rail systems\u2014high  ridership, expensive infrastructure, economic importance, and location  (large metropolitan areas or tourist destinations)\u2014also make them  attractive targets for terrorists because of the potential for mass casualties  and economic damage and disruption. Moreover, some of these same  characteristics make passenger rail systems difficult to secure. For  example, the numbers of riders that pass through a subway system\u2014 especially during peak hours\u2014may make the sustained use of some  security measures, such as metal detectors, difficult because they could  result in long lines that disrupt scheduled service. In addition, multiple  access points along extended routes could make the cost of securing each  location prohibitive.

Since the September 11 attacks, the role of federal agencies in  securing the nation\u2019s transportation systems, including passenger rail,  have continued to evolve. Prior to September 11, FTA and FRA, within  DOT, were the primary federal entities involved in passenger rail security  matters. In response to the attacks of September 11, Congress passed the  Aviation and Transportation Security Act (ATSA), which created TSA  within DOT and defined its primary responsibility as ensuring the security  of all modes of transportation. Although its provisions focus primarily on  aviation security, the act gives TSA regulatory authority for security over  all transportation modes. With the passage of the Homeland Security Act  of 2002, TSA was transferred, along with over 20 other agencies, to DHS.  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 requires the  Secretary of Homeland Security, working jointly with the Secretary of  Transportation, to develop a National Strategy for Transportation Security  and transportation modal security plans. TSA issued the National Strategy  for Transportation Security in 2005. In addition, the DHS National  Infrastructure Protection Plan (NIPP) required the development of a  Transportation Sector Specific Plan (TSSP). In accordance with the NIPP,  a December 2006 executive order required the Secretary of Homeland  Security to develop a TSSP by December 31, 2006, and supporting plans  for each mode of surface transportation not later than 90 days after  completion of the TSSP. According to the NIPP, sector specific plans  should, among other things, define the goals and objectives to secure the  sector, assess the risks facing the sector, identify the critical assets and  infrastructure and develop programs to protect them, and develop security  partnerships with industry stakeholders within the sector. As of March 2,  2007, TSA had not yet issued the TSSP or the supporting plans for each  surface transportation mode.", "Within DHS, OGT, formerly the Office for Domestic Preparedness (ODP),  has become the federal source for security funding of passenger rail  systems.  OGT is the principal component of DHS responsible for  preparing the United States against acts of terrorism and has primary  responsibility within the executive branch for assisting and supporting  DHS, in coordination with other directorates and entities outside of the  department, in conducting risk analysis and risk management activities of  state and local governments. In carrying out its mission, OGT provides  training, funds for the purchase of equipment, support for the planning and  execution of exercises, technical assistance, and other support to assist  states, local jurisdictions, and the private sector to prevent, prepare for,  and respond to acts of terrorism.", "While TSA is the lead federal agency for ensuring the security of all  transportation modes, FTA conducts safety and security activities,  including training, research, technical assistance, and demonstration  projects. In addition, FTA promotes safety and security through its grant- making authority. FRA has regulatory authority for rail safety over  commuter rail operators and Amtrak, and employs over 400 rail inspectors  that periodically monitor the implementation of safety and security plans  at these systems."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Assessing and Managing Risks to Rail Infrastructure Using a Risk Management Approach", "paragraphs": ["Risk management is a tool for informing policy makers\u2019 decisions about  assessing risks, allocating resources, and taking actions under conditions  of uncertainty. In recent years, the President, through Homeland Security  Presidential Directives (HSPD), and Congress, through the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, provided for federal  agencies with homeland security responsibilities to apply risk-based  principles to inform their decision making regarding allocating limited  resources and prioritizing security activities. The 9/11 Commission  recommended that the U.S. government should identify and evaluate the  transportation assets that need to be protected, set risk-based priorities  for defending them, select the most practical and cost-effective ways of  doing so, and then develop a plan, budget, and funding to implement the  effort. Further, the Secretary of DHS has made risk-based decision  making a cornerstone of departmental policy. We have previously reported  that a risk management approach can help to prioritize and focus the  programs designed to combat terrorism. Risk management, as applied in  the homeland security context, can help federal decision makers  determine where and how to invest limited resources within and among  the various modes of transportation.", "The Homeland Security Act of 2002 also directed the department\u2019s  Directorate of Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection to use  risk management principles in coordinating the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure protection efforts. This includes integrating relevant  information, analysis, and vulnerability assessments to identify priorities  for protective and support measures by the department, other federal  agencies, state and local government agencies and authorities, the private  sector, and other entities. Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 and  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 further  define and establish critical infrastructure protection responsibilities for  DHS and those federal agencies given responsibility for particular industry  sectors, such as transportation. In June 2006, DHS issued the NIPP, which  named TSA as the primary federal agency responsible for coordinating  critical infrastructure protection efforts within the transportation sector.  In fulfilling its responsibilities under the NIPP, TSA must conduct and  facilitate risk assessments in order to identify, prioritize, and coordinate  the protection of critical transportation systems infrastructure, as well as  develop risk-based priorities for the transportation sector.", "To provide guidance to agency decision makers, we have created a risk  management framework, which is intended to be a starting point for  applying risk-based principles. Our risk management framework entails a  continuous process of managing risk through a series of actions, including  setting strategic goals and objectives, assessing risk, evaluating  alternatives, selecting initiatives to undertake, and implementing and  monitoring those initiatives. DHS\u2019s NIPP describes a risk management  process that closely mirrors our risk management framework.", "Setting strategic goals, objectives, and constraints is a key first step in  applying risk management principles and helps to ensure that management  decisions are focused on achieving a purpose. These decisions should take  place in the context of an agency\u2019s strategic plan that includes goals and  objectives that are clear and concise. These goals and objectives should  identify resource issues and external factors to achieving the goals.  Further, the goals and objectives of an agency should link to a  department\u2019s overall strategic plan. The ability to achieve strategic goals  depends, in part, on how well an agency manages risk. The agency\u2019s  strategic plan should address risk-related issues that are central to the  agency\u2019s overall mission.", "Risk assessment, an important element of a risk-based approach, helps  decision makers identify and evaluate potential risks so that  countermeasures can be designed and implemented to prevent or mitigate  the effects of the risks. Risk assessment is a qualitative and/or quantitative  determination of the likelihood of an adverse event occurring and the  severity, or impact, of its consequences. Risk assessment in a homeland  security application often involves assessing three key elements\u2014threat,  vulnerability, and criticality or consequence. A threat assessment identifies  and evaluates potential threats on the basis of factors such as capabilities,  intentions, and past activities. A vulnerability assessment identifies  weaknesses that may be exploited by identified threats and suggests  options to address those weaknesses. A criticality or consequence  assessment evaluates and prioritizes assets and functions in terms of  specific criteria, such as their importance to public safety and the  economy, as a basis for identifying which structures or processes are  relatively more important to protect from attack. Information from these  three assessments contributes to an overall risk assessment that  characterizes risks on a scale such as high, medium, or low and provides  input for evaluating alternatives and management prioritization of security  initiatives. The risk assessment element in the overall risk management  cycle may be the largest change from standard management steps and can  be important to informing the remaining steps of the cycle."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DHS Has Taken Steps to Assess Risk to Passenger Rail Systems, but Has Not Issued a Strategy for Securing the Transportation Sector", "paragraphs": ["DHS has made progress in assessing the risks facing the U.S. passenger  rail system, but has not issued a plan based on those risk assessments for  securing the entire transportation sector and supporting plans for each  mode of transportation, including passenger rail. The DHS OGT developed  and implemented a risk assessment tool to help passenger rail operators  better respond to terrorist attacks and prioritize security measures.  Passenger rail operators must have completed a risk assessment to be  eligible for financial assistance through the fiscal year 2007 OGT Transit  Security Grant Program, which includes funding for passenger rail. To  receive grant funding, rail operators are also required to have a security  and emergency preparedness plan that identifies how the operator intends  to respond to security gaps identified by risk assessments. As of February  2007, OGT had completed or planned to conduct risk assessments of most  passenger rail operators. According to rail operators, OGT\u2019s risk  assessment process enabled them to prioritize investments on the basis of  risk and allowed them to target and allocate resources towards security  measures that will have the greatest impact on reducing risk across their  rail systems.", "Further, we reported in September 2005 that TSA had not completed a  comprehensive risk assessment of the entire passenger rail system. TSA  had begun to assess risks to the passenger rail system, including  completing an overall threat assessment for both mass transit and  passenger and freight rail modes. TSA also conducted criticality  assessments of nearly 700 passenger rail stations and had begun  conducting assessments for other passenger rail assets such as bridges  and tunnels. TSA reported that it planned to rely on asset criticality  rankings to prioritize which assets it would focus on in conducting  vulnerability assessments to determine which passenger rail assets are  vulnerable to attack. For assets that are deemed to be less critical, TSA  has developed a software tool that it has made available to passenger rail  and other transportation operators for them to use on a voluntary basis to  assess the vulnerability of their assets. We reported that, until all three  assessments of passenger rail systems\u2014threat, criticality, and  vulnerability\u2014have been completed, and until TSA determined how to use  the results of these assessments to analyze and characterize the level of  risk (high, medium, or low), it will be difficult to prioritize passenger rail  assets and guide investment decisions about protecting them.", "More recently, in January 2007, TSA reported taking additional actions to  assess the risks facing the U.S. passenger rail system. For example, TSA  reported that its surface transportation security inspectors are working  with rail transit agencies to update risk assessments that FTA and FRA  conducted after September 11, and is also conducting additional security  assessments of rail transit agencies. TSA also expected that the 50 largest  rail transit agencies would complete security self assessments in early  2007. According to TSA, the agency is using the results of these  assessments to set priorities and identify baseline security standards for  the passenger rail industry. For example, in January 2007 the agency  reported that it has identified underground and underwater rail  infrastructure and high-density passenger rail stations as the critical assets  most at risk. According to TSA, the agency prioritized a list of the  underwater rail tunnels deemed to be at highest risk, and plans to conduct  assessments of high-risk rail tunnels.", "We also reported in September 2005 that DHS was developing, but had not  yet completed, a framework intended to help TSA, OGT, and other federal  agencies work with their stakeholders to assess risk. This framework is  intended to help the private sector and state and local governments  develop a consistent approach to analyzing risk and vulnerability across  infrastructure types and across entire economic sectors, develop  consistent terminology, and foster consistent results. The framework is  also intended to enable a federal-level assessment of risk in general, and  comparisons among risks, for purposes of resource allocation and  response planning. DHS reported that this framework will provide  overarching guidance to sector-specific agencies on how various risk  assessment methodologies may be used to analyze, normalize, and  prioritize risk within and among sectors.

However, TSA has not issued the required TSSP and  supporting plans for securing each mode of transportation. According to  TSA, the TSSP and supporting modal plans are in draft, but must be  reviewed by DHS and the White House Homeland Security Council before  they can be finalized.

Since we completed  our work on passenger rail security, TSA has reported taking additional  actions to strengthen the security of the passenger rail system. For  example, TSA tested rail security technologies, developed training tools  for rail workers, and issued a proposed rule in December 2006 regarding  passenger and freight rail security, among other efforts. OGT has also  acted to help improve passenger rail security by, for example, providing  funding for security enhancements to rail transit agencies and Amtrak  through various grant programs.

Specifically, FTA launched a transit security initiative in 2002  that included security readiness assessments, technical assistance, grants  for emergency response drills, and training. FTA also instituted the Transit  Watch campaign in 2003\u2014a nationwide safety and security awareness  program designed to encourage the participation of transit passengers and  employees in maintaining a safe transit environment. The program  provides information and instructions to transit passengers and employees  so that they know what to do and whom to contact in the event of an  emergency in a transit setting. FTA plans to continue this initiative, in  partnership with TSA and OGT, and offer additional security awareness  materials that address unattended bags and emergency evacuation  procedures for transit agencies. In addition, in November 2003, FTA issued  its Top 20 Security Program Action Items for Transit Agencies, which  recommended measures for passenger rail operators to include in their  security programs to improve both security and emergency preparedness.  FTA has also used research and development funds to develop guidance  for security design strategies to reduce the vulnerability of transit systems  to acts of terrorism.

According to TSA, this initiative has identified  29 critical underwater rail transit tunnels.", "DHS and TSA have also sought to enhance passenger rail security by  conducting research on technologies related to screening passengers and  checked baggage in the passenger rail environment. For example, TSA  conducted a Transit and Rail Inspection Pilot, a $1.5 million effort to test  the feasibility of using existing and emerging technologies to screen  passengers, carry-on items, checked baggage, cargo, and parcels for  explosives. According to TSA, the agency completed this pilot in July 2004.  TSA officials told us that based upon preliminary analyses, the screening  technologies and processes tested would be very difficult to implement on  heavily used passenger rail systems because these systems carry high  volumes of passengers and have multiple points of entry. However, TSA  officials added that the screening processes used in the pilot may be useful  on certain long-distance intercity train routes, which make fewer stops.  Further, TSA officials stated that screening could be used either randomly  or for all passengers during certain high-risk events or in areas where a  particular terrorist threat is known to exist. For example, screening  technology similar to that used in the pilot was used by TSA to screen  certain passengers and belongings in Boston and New York rail stations  during the 2004 Democratic and Republican national conventions.  According to TSA, the agency is also researching and developing other  passenger rail security technologies, including closed circuit television  systems that can detect suspicious behavior, mobile passenger screening  checkpoints to be used at rail stations, bomb resistant trash cans, and  explosive detection equipment for use in the rail environment.

Through the Urban Area Security Initiative (UASI) grant program, OGT  has provided grants to urban areas to help enhance their overall security  and preparedness level to prevent, respond to, and recover from acts of  terrorism. In 2003 and 2004, $65 million and $50 million, respectively, were  provided to rail transit agencies through the UASI program. In addition,  the DHS Appropriations Act 2005 appropriated $150 million for rail transit,  intercity passenger rail, freight rail, and transit security grants. OGT used  this funding to build on the work under way through the UASI program  and create and administer new programs focused specifically on  transportation security, including the Transit Security Grant Program and  the Intercity Passenger Rail Security Grant Program. These programs  provided financial assistance to address security preparedness and  enhancements for passenger rail and transit systems. During fiscal year  2006, OGT provided $110 million to passenger rail transit agencies through  the Transit Security Grant Program and about $7 million to Amtrak  through the Intercity Passenger Rail Security Grant Program. During fiscal  year 2007, OGT plans to distribute $156 million for rail and bus security  grants and $8 million to Amtrak.", "In January 2007, OGT reported that the Intercity Passenger Rail Security  Program had been incorporated into the Transit Security Grant Program.  The President\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget request includes $175 million for  the Transit Security Grant Program. According to budget documents,  grants will be awarded to rail transit agencies and Amtrak for  preparedness activities related to terrorism and other incidents on the  basis of risk and effectiveness.", "Although OGT has distributed hundreds of millions of dollars in grants to  improve passenger rail security, issues have surfaced about the grant  process.", "Changes to grant requirements: As DHS works to refine its risk  assessment methodologies, develop better means of assessing  proposed investments using grant funds, and align grant guidance with  the implementation of broader emergency preparedness goals, such as  implementation of the National Preparedness Goal, it has annually  made changes to the guidance for the various grants it administers.  These changes include changes in the eligibility for grants. As a result  of these annual changes, awardees and potential grant recipients must  annually review and understand new information on the requirements  for grant applications including justification of their proposed use of  grant funds.", "Allowable uses of grants: Funds awarded through the Transit  Security Grant Program can be used to supplement funds received  from other grant programs. However, allowable uses are not clearly  defined. For example, Transit Security Grant Program funds can be  used to create canine teams but cannot be used to maintain these  teams\u2014that is, the grant funds cannot be used for food, medical care,  and other such maintenance costs for the dogs on the team. Whether  other grant funds could be used for such maintenance costs would be  governed by the terms of those grants.

In response to a  previous recommendation we made, DHS and DOT signed a  memorandum of understanding (MOU) in September 2004 to develop  procedures by which the two departments could improve their  cooperation and coordination for promoting the safe, secure, and efficient  movement of people and goods throughout the transportation system. The  MOU defines broad areas of responsibility for each department. For  example, it states that DHS, in consultation with DOT and affected  stakeholders, will identify, prioritize, and coordinate the protection of  critical infrastructure. The MOU acknowledges that DHS has primary  responsibility for transportation security, with DOT playing a supporting  role by providing technical assistance and helping DHS implement security  policies.", "The MOU between DHS and DOT represents an overall framework for  cooperation that is to be supplemented by additional signed agreements,  or annexes, between the departments. These annexes are to delineate the  specific security-related roles, responsibilities, resources, and  commitments for mass transit, rail, research and development, and other  matters. TSA signed annexes to the MOU with FRA in September 2006  and FTA in September 2005. These annexes describe each agency\u2019s roles  and responsibilities for passenger rail security. These annexes also  describe how TSA and these DOT agencies will coordinate security-related  efforts, avoid duplication of efforts, and improve coordination and  communication with industry stakeholders. For example, the annex signed  by FTA includes a provision that FTA, TSA, and OGT will communicate  with each other about funding for transportation security projects in order  to present a coordinated position on transportation security funding and  to avoid duplicative funding requests. Table 1 describes some areas of  responsibility outlined in the annexes where DHS and DOT agencies play  different but coordinated roles.", "DHS and DOT officials have stated that the MOU and its related annexes  have improved how the two departments\u2019 agencies work together,  providing for close cooperation and increased efficiency and thereby  benefiting the passenger rail industry and the public. For example, FTA  officials said that using the MOU annex as a blueprint, they established an  Executive Steering Committee with TSA and OGT to oversee eight project  management teams implementing the tasks outlined in the MOU annex.  The teams\u2019 efforts address issues such as risk assessment and technical  assistance, annual planning and grant guidance, and standards and  research, among other areas.", "Although the execution of the MOU and related annexes is an important  step forward, additional efforts to maintain and improve coordination will  be required as both departments move forward with existing and new  initiatives. For example, as we reported in July 2006, after TSA hired 100  surface transportation inspectors, officials from state-designated agencies  that oversee rail transit safety and security under FTA\u2019s State Safety  Oversight program told us that they did not have a clear picture of who  was responsible for overseeing transit security issues. Some of these  officials expressed concern that TSA\u2019s rail inspectors would be duplicating  their role in overseeing transit security. Similarly, officials from rail transit  agencies said they were unsure of lines of responsibility for transit  security oversight and said they were confused about what standards they  would be required to meet. For example, while state oversight agencies  are free to create their own standards, TSA issued rail security directives  in May 2004 and has authority to undertake regulatory actions that impose  requirements upon transit agencies. To reduce confusion among transit  and oversight agencies, we recommended last year that TSA 1) coordinate  with FTA to clearly articulate to state oversight agencies and transit  agencies the roles and responsibilities TSA develops for its rail inspectors,  and 2) work with state oversight agencies to coordinate their security  audits whenever possible and include FTA in this communication to help  ensure effective coordination with these agencies. FTA and TSA officials  stated that they are working to determine how to implement the  recommendations."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In conclusion, the rail attacks in Europe and Asia highlight the inherent  vulnerability of passenger rail and other surface transportation systems to  terrorist attack. Moreover, securing rail and other surface transportation  systems is a daunting task, requiring the federal government to develop  clear strategies that are based on an assessment of the risks to the security  of the systems, including goals and objectives, for strengthening the  security of these systems. Since our September 2005 report, DHS  components have taken steps to assess the risks to the passenger rail  system, such as working with rail operators to update prior risk  assessments and facilitating rail operator security self assessments.  According to TSA, the agency plans to use these assessment results to set  priorities for securing rail assets deemed most at risk, such as  underground and underwater rail infrastructure and high density  passenger rail stations. A comprehensive assessment of the risks facing  the transportation sector and each mode, including passenger rail, will be  a key component of the TSSP and supporting plans for each mode of  transportation. Until TSA issues these plans, however, the agency lacks a  clearly communicated strategy with goals and objectives for securing the  overall transportation sector and each mode of transportation, including  passenger rail. As TSA moves forward to issue the TSSP and supporting  plans for each mode of transportation, it will be important that the agency  articulate its strategy for securing rail and other modes to those  government agencies and industry stakeholders that share the  responsibility for securing these systems.", "With the execution of the MOU and related annexes, DHS and DOT have  taken important steps forward in improving coordination among the  federal entities involved in passenger rail security matters. The execution  of the MOUs and related annexes is not a panacea, however. Effective and  continued coordination between the two departments and periodic  reassessment of roles and responsibilities will be important as both move  forward in implementing existing programs and new security initiatives.  We will continue to assess DHS and DOT\u2019s efforts to secure the U.S.  passenger rail system during follow-on work to be initiated later this year.", "Mr. Chairman and Madam Chairwoman, this concludes my statement.
