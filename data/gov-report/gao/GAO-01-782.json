This team reported in 1997 that the cost of the F-22 production program could grow substantially from the amount planned, but that the contractors should design cost reduction plans to fully offset that cost growth. The Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics generally adopted the team's recommendations to change certain aspects of the program as well as a plan to define and implement cost reduction plans. The contractors have continued since 1997 to refine and increase the number and dollar amounts associated with the plans to reduce F-22 production costs.", "Ultimately, the savings to be achieved by production cost reduction plans must be reflected in lower production contract prices, and lower expenditures by the Air Force than would have been the case if the plans had not been implemented. The Air Force and contractors have entered into memoranda of understanding that relate the affordability of F-22 production to contract prices that will be negotiated for low-rate initial production. The memoranda established target price objectives against which the negotiated prices will be evaluated and financial incentives to achieve the target price objectives for the applicable production lots. To encourage a reduction in production costs, the Air Force and contractors agreed that production cost reduction plans would be proposed, approved and implemented as appropriate. The Air Force agreed to reimburse certain investment costs and to pay award fees to the contractors based on negotiating contracts for certain prices.

Even though the cost estimates exceeded the $39.8 billion cost limitation in effect at that time, the Secretary of the Air Force maintained that the cost would not exceed the limitation, and established the Air Force's position on F-22 production cost at $39.8 billion.", "In estimates made in December 2000 to support the fiscal year 2002 budget request, both Air Force and Office of the Secretary cost estimators continue to project that F-22 production costs will exceed the congressional cost limitation.

This change reflects congressional action on the fiscal year 2000 Air Force budget, in which the Congress approved funding for 6 aircraft using appropriations for Research, Development, Test and Evaluation. Accordingly, the 6 aircraft and associated costs of $1.575 billion (excluding about $200 million that had been appropriated in fiscal year 1999 for advanced procurement for those aircraft) were eliminated from the production cost limitation and added to the development cost limitation.", "If the Office of the Secretary's higher estimate is correct and additional cost reduction plans are not developed and implemented, we project that the Air Force would have to buy about 85 fewer F-22s (or about 25 percent) than the 333 aircraft now planned to stay within the cost limitation.

In late 2000, the DCAA examined eleven cost reduction plans totaling $425 million of total estimated savings of $26.5 billion. These eleven plans were chosen so DCAA could examine cost reduction plans at different stages of development and at different locations including Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems, Marietta, Georgia; Lockheed Martin Tactical Aircraft Systems, Fort Worth, Texas; and Boeing Military Aircraft, Seattle, Washington. DCAA did not conduct detailed audits of these cost reduction plans. Their reviews focused primarily on methodologies used to calculate the reported savings or the verification of rates or material cost used in the calculations of contractor reported savings.", "DCAA did not take exception to the potential cost reductions for 8 of the 11 plans reviewed; found potential cost reductions on two others to be based on judgement, not discrete, measurable events; and found documentation on one to be lacking.

While the status of individual cost reduction plans are tracked by contractors and the F-22 Program Office, we believe regular reporting by the Air Force to the Under Secretary of Defense on the status of these plans is necessary to continuously assess their impact on the estimated cost of F-22 production. Achievement of the estimated cost reductions embodied in the plans is critical to completing F-22 production within the congressional cost limitation. Quarterly reporting of cost reduction plan information enhances its visibility. As a result, we recommended the Air Force report to the Under Secretary of Defense on the status of the cost reduction plans each quarter and that quarterly reports include summary information such as the total number of cost reduction plans identified, the number implemented, the total estimated cost reductions, cost reductions realized to date, and additions or deletions from the plans included in the prior report.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation in October 2000 and agreed to report cost reduction plan information in subsequent quarterly reviews to the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics.

We discussed the estimates with officials in the Office of the Secretary and the Air Force's F-22 Program Office to determine why they differed. We compared the two estimates, including the baseline estimate, the estimated reductions from cost reduction plans, and the net estimates. We obtained a description of the reasons for the variances between the two estimates. We also discussed the estimates and production cost limitation with Air Force and Office of the Secretary officials. The Office of the Secretary cost estimate shown in this report is recorded in briefing documents we obtained during the course of our review. The Office of the Secretary provided us neither its cost estimate nor documentation related to its cost estimate. Officials from the Office of the Secretary cited their policy of not allowing access to that information because they considered it predecisional. However, we corroborated the information contained in the briefing documents we analyzed. An Office of the Secretary official reviewed and agreed with the estimated and projected costs included in this report that are attributed to the Office of the Secretary. To calculate the number of F-22s that could not be procured within the cost limitation we allocated the dollars in the Office of the Secretary estimate to production lots 1 through 11 in the previous Air Force estimate. Starting with the adjusted costs for production lot 1, we determined how many aircraft could be purchased without exceeding the applicable cost limitation To evaluate whether the Office of the Secretary and the Air Force were complying with our prior recommendations, we determined whether a defense review, that potentially could reconcile the number of F-22s needed with the cost limitation, had been completed.
