Recent military operations have demonstrated  that space capabilities are critical to the success of defense missions,  such as precision engagement, search and rescue, and close air support.  Space-qualified personnel, both military and civilian, are needed to  develop technology, doctrine, and operational concepts for employing  space assets in the future and to operate complex space systems.

In January 2001, the commission report  identified some long-standing management challenges including  developing and maintaining a group of professional personnel, known  as the space cadre, for leadership roles in all aspects of space-related  activities. In its report, the commission made recommendations to  improve DOD\u2019s management and organization of space operations.  In April 2003, we reported on the implementation of the commission\u2019s  recommendations, as required by Congress. We recommended that DOD,  in conjunction with the services, establish a departmentwide space human  capital strategy with goals, measurable objectives, and timelines to  develop and maintain a cadre of military and civilian space professionals.  DOD concurred with our recommendation.", "Additionally, Congress, in the National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2004, required the Secretary of Defense to develop a strategy  for DOD to (1) promote the development of space personnel career fields  within each of the military departments and (2) ensure that the space  personnel career fields developed by the military departments are  integrated with each other to the maximum extent practicable. The act  also required the Secretary of Defense to provide a comprehensive  assessment of the adequacy of the actions of the Secretary of the Air Force  to establish a space career field for Air Force officers. DOD provided the  strategy and assessment to Congress in February 2004. The strategy set  out goals, objectives, and approaches to develop and integrate DOD\u2019s  space cadre. The assessment listed actions the Air Force had taken and  plans to take to improve management of its space cadre and training for its  space personnel.", "The act also required us to review DOD\u2019s space human capital strategy and  the status of efforts by the military departments to develop their space  personnel career fields.

In its January 2001 report, the Space  Commission made recommendations to DOD to improve coordination,  execution, and oversight of the department\u2019s space activities. One issue  the Space Commission identified was the need to create and maintain a  highly trained and experienced cadre of space professionals who could  master highly complex technology, as well as develop new concepts of  operations for offensive and defensive space operations. The Space  Commission noted that the defense space program had benefited from  world-class scientists, engineers, and operators, but many experienced  personnel were retiring and the recruitment and retention of space- qualified personnel was a problem. Further, the commission concluded  that DOD did not have a strong military space culture, which included  focused career development and education and training.

Further,  without clear performance measures, DOD and the services would be  unable to assess whether actions intended to meet departmentwide goals  and objectives are effective. Therefore, it is not clear that DOD can  achieve the strategy\u2019s purpose of integrating the services\u2019 space personnel,  to the extent practicable, into an integrated total force of well-qualified  military and civilian personnel. Failure to achieve this could jeopardize  U.S. primacy in this critical and evolving national security area.", "The military services\u2019 efforts to implement initiatives to develop their  space cadres vary and not all initiatives are linked to service strategies and  integrated with DOD\u2019s overall strategy. Further, some of the initiatives are  not fully developed and will require several years to complete. Because the  Army and the Navy lack a strategy to provide direction and focus for their  efforts to develop their space cadres and provide a basis to assess the  progress of their initiatives, it is unclear whether they will have sufficient  numbers of space-qualified professionals to meet future requirements in  joint and service space planning, programming, acquisition, and  operations. Furthermore, without an organizational focal point with  responsibilities for managing and coordinating space cadre efforts, the  Army and the Navy may not have the ability to develop and retain the  appropriate number of personnel with the right skills to meet both their  needs and the joint requirements of the national security space  community. Until the Army and the Navy develop strategies synchronized  with the department\u2019s overall strategy and establish a management  approach to implementing their strategies, they may not be able to support  the department\u2019s strategic goals and objectives and thus may undermine  efforts to strengthen this important mission area."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Defense take the following  five actions:    Direct the DOD Executive Agent for Space, in conjunction with the  military services, to develop an implementation plan for the DOD space  human capital strategy.

DOD stated that two different entities  are involved with managing the Army\u2019s space cadre and the Army is in the  process of determining whether a single organization will manage its space  cadre. During our review, Army officials had differing views on the need to  establish a single organizational focal point. They told us that the Army  wants to decide whether to expand its space cadre beyond military  officers before it designates management responsibilities for the space  cadre. We believe that the Army should establish a single organizational  focal point to develop its space cadre in a timely manner. This would help  the Army to develop and retain the appropriate number of personnel with  the right skills to meet Army and joint needs.", "We are sending copies of this report to interested congressional  committees; the Secretary of Defense; the DOD Executive Agent for  Space; the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force; and the  Commandant of the Marine Corps.

We discussed the strategy and its implementation  with officials in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel  and Readiness and the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Networks and  Information Integration.

We assessed the  actions taken to date to implement the strategy. We also discussed  whether the strategy would effectively integrate the services\u2019 efforts with  officials in each of the military services and at the National  Reconnaissance Office. Specifically, for the military services, we  interviewed officials and gathered information at the Air Force Space  Command, Peterson Air Force Base, Colorado; the Army Office of the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, Arlington, Virginia; the  Army Space and Missile Defense Command, Arlington, Virginia; the Navy  Space Cadre Advisor, Arlington, Virginia; and the Office of Plans, Policies,  and Operations, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Arlington, Virginia.", "To assess the extent to which the military services have planned and  implemented actions to develop and manage their space cadres, we  analyzed documentation on strategies, initiatives, and other implementing  actions at each service and discussed them with service officials.
