In recent years, ISC has taken several actions to develop policies and guidance for facility protection and to share related information. Although its actions to ensure compliance with security standards and oversee implementation have been limited, in July 2004, ISC became responsible for reviewing federal agencies' physical security plans for the administration. ISC, however, lacks an action plan that could be used to provide DHS and other stakeholders with information on, and a rationale for, its resource needs; garner and maintain the support of ISC member agencies, DHS management, Office of Management and Budget, and Congress; identify implementation goals and measures for gauging progress; and propose strategies for addressing various challenges it faces, such as resource constraints. Without an action plan, ISC's strategy and time line for implementing its responsibilities remain unclear. s ISC and agencies have paid greater attention to facility protection in recent years, several key practices have emerged that, collectively, could provide a framework for guiding agencies' efforts. These include allocating resources using risk management; leveraging security technology; coordinating protection efforts and sharing information; measuring program performance and testing security initiatives; realigning real property assets to mission, thereby reducing vulnerabilities; and, implementing strategic human capital management, to ensure that agencies are well equipped to recruit and retain high-performing security professionals. GAO also noted several obstacles to implementation, such as developing quality data for risk management and performance measurement, and ensuring that technology will perform as expected."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The war on terrorism has made physical security for federal facilities a  governmentwide concern. The federal government owns or leases  hundreds of thousands of facilities, with the vast majority concentrated in  the Departments of Defense (DOD), Veterans Affairs (VA), State (State),  Energy (DOE), and the Interior (Interior); the General Services  Administration (GSA); and the U.S. Postal Service (USPS). The makeup of  these facilities reflects the diversity of agencies\u2019 missions and includes  office buildings, military installations, hospitals, embassies, border  stations, laboratories, and park visitor centers.", "After the September 11, 2001, attacks, Congress passed the Homeland  Security Act of 2002, which created the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS). In creating DHS, the government\u2019s efforts to prevent, protect  against, and respond to potential terrorism\u2014including terrorism directed  at federal facilities\u2014were centralized. As a result of the act, DHS assumed  responsibility for chairing the Interagency Security Committee (ISC). ISC,  which has representation from all the major property-holding agencies and  was established after the bombing of the Oklahoma City federal building,  has a range of governmentwide responsibilities related to protecting  nonmilitary facilities. These generally involve developing policies and  standards, ensuring compliance and overseeing implementation, and  sharing and maintaining information. Although ISC was established to  bring a central focus to the government\u2019s efforts and provide a forum for  sharing key practices and lessons learned in protecting facilities, we  reported in September 2002 that ISC was having limited success in fulfilling  its responsibilities, because of the lack of consistent and aggressive  leadership by GSA, inadequate staff support and funding for ISC, and ISC\u2019s  difficulty in making decisions.", "Our objectives were to (1) assess ISC\u2019s progress in fulfilling its  responsibilities and (2) identify key practices in protecting federal facilities  and any related implementation obstacles. To assess ISC\u2019s progress in  fulfilling its responsibilities, we interviewed the Executive Director of ISC;  analyzed ISC publications and other documents; considered prior GAO  work; and reviewed various laws and policies, including the Homeland  Security Act of 2002. We also reviewed the executive order that established  ISC, a subsequent executive order that amended it in connection with the  transfer of ISC\u2019s function to DHS, and relevant homeland security policy  directives. To identify key practices, we systematically analyzed 170 GAO  and Inspector General (IG) reports issued since 1995 that addressed  homeland security and terrorism issues and pertained to facility protection.  We also contracted with the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to  convene a symposium of experts on key practices in facility protection.  Appendix II contains the symposium agenda and identifies the panelists.  We also interviewed officials and analyzed documents from DHS and the  major property-holding agencies, including DOD, VA, State, DOE, Interior,  GSA, and USPS. For the purpose of this review, we defined key practices as  those activities that, on the basis of our analysis, were recommended by  GAO and others, acknowledged by agencies, and validated by experts in  the area. More information on our scope and methodology appears in  appendix I. We did our work from November 2003 through October 2004 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Terrorists have targeted federal facilities several times over the past 10  years. After the 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in  Oklahoma City, the Department of Justice created minimum-security  standards for federal facilities. In October 1995, the President signed  Executive Order 12977, which established ISC. ISC was expected to  enhance the quality and effectiveness of security in, and protection of,  facilities in the United States occupied by federal employees for  nonmilitary activities and to provide a permanent body to address  continuing governmentwide security issues for federal facilities. ISC is  expected to have representation from all the major federal departments  and agencies, as well as a number of key offices. ISC\u2019s specific  responsibilities under the executive order generally relate to three areas:  developing policies and standards, ensuring compliance and overseeing  implementation, and sharing and maintaining information. Related to  policies and standards, the executive order specifically states that ISC is to  establish policies for security in and protection of federal facilities;   develop and evaluate security standards for federal facilities;   assess technology and information systems as a means of providing  cost-effective improvements to security in federal facilities;  develop long-term construction standards for those locations with  threat levels or missions that require blast-resistant structures or other  specialized security requirements; and  evaluate standards for the location of, and special security related to,  day care centers in federal facilities.", "In the area of compliance and oversight, ISC is to develop a strategy for  ensuring compliance with facility security standards and oversee the  implementation of appropriate security measures in federal facilities. And,  related to sharing and maintaining information, ISC is to encourage  agencies with security responsibilities to share security related intelligence  in a timely and cooperative manner and assist with developing and  maintaining a centralized security database of all federal facilities.", "Since September 11, the focus on protecting the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure has been heightened considerably. The Homeland Security  Act of 2002 and other administration policies assigned DHS specific duties  associated with coordinating the nation\u2019s efforts to protect critical  infrastructure, and Homeland Security Presidential Directive Number 7  (HSPD-7) stated that DHS\u2019s Secretary was responsible for coordinating the  overall national effort to identify, prioritize, and protect critical  infrastructure and key resources. Under the Homeland Security Act of  2002, the Federal Protective Service (FPS) was transferred from GSA to  DHS and, as a result of this transfer, DHS assumed responsibility for ISC in  March 2003.", "In September 2002, we reported that ISC was having limited success in  fulfilling its responsibilities. Specifically, ISC had made little or no  progress in areas including developing and establishing policies for  security in and protection of federal facilities and developing a strategy for  ensuring compliance with security standards. In January 2003, we  designated federal property as a high-risk area, in part due to the threat of  terrorism against federal facilities. As the government\u2019s security efforts  continue to intensify, and real property-holding agencies employ such  measures as searching vehicles that enter federal facilities, restricting  parking, and installing concrete bollards, important questions continue to  be raised regarding the level of security needed to adequately protect  federal facilities and how the security community should proceed. Figure 1  shows bollards installed at the Jacob Javits Federal Building in New York,  New York. Additionally, questions concerning the cost-effectiveness and  impact of various practices have emerged as the nation faces a protracted  war on terrorism."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ISC Has Made Progress but Faces Challenges in Fulfilling Some of Its Major Responsibilities", "paragraphs": ["ISC has made progress in coordinating the government\u2019s facility protection  efforts and has been given a prominent role in reviewing agencies\u2019 physical  security plans for the administration since we last reported on this issue. In  September 2002, we reported that ISC, at that time, had made little or no  progress in key elements of its responsibilities, such as developing policies  and standards for security at federal facilities; ensuring compliance with  security standards and overseeing the implementation of appropriate  security in federal facilities; and related to information, developing a  centralized security database of all federal facilities. Agency  representatives identified several factors that they believe contributed to  ISC\u2019s limited progress. These factors included (1) the lack of consistent and  aggressive leadership by GSA, (2) inadequate staff support and funding for  ISC, and (3) ISC\u2019s difficulty in making decisions. Nonetheless, there were  areas where we observed some progress over its then 7-year existence. For  example, ISC had developed and issued security design criteria and  minimum standards for building access procedures; disseminated  information to member agencies on entry security technology for buildings  needing the highest security levels; and, through its meetings and working  groups, provided a forum for federal agencies to discuss security-related  issues and share information and ideas.", "In commenting on the September 2002 report, GSA, which at the time had  responsibility for chairing ISC, agreed to take action to address the  shortcomings we identified. In March 2003, in accordance with the  Homeland Security Act of 2002, FPS was transferred from GSA to DHS. As  a result, DHS assumed responsibility for chairing ISC, and the executive  order establishing ISC was amended to reflect the transfer of this function  from GSA to DHS. Transferring responsibility for ISC to DHS reflected the  shift to having homeland security activities centralized under one cabinet- level department. Within DHS, the role of chairing ISC was subsequently  delegated to the Director of FPS in January 2004.", "Since our 2002 report, ISC has made clear progress in developing policies  and standards and maintaining and sharing information. Related to policies  and standards, ISC issued security standards for leased space in July 2003,  and OMB has approved them. These standards address security  requirements for leased facilities and, according to an ISC official, are  currently being used by ISC member agencies as a management tool. In  June 2003, ISC issued guidance on escape hoods for federal agencies and,  in October 2003, ISC issued an update to its May 2001 Security Design  Criteria for New Federal Office Buildings and Major Modernization  Projects. According to an FPS official, GSA is incorporating ISC\u2019s Security  Design Criteria in the construction of new facilities. More recently, ISC  became involved with Homeland Security Presidential Directive Number 12  (HSPD-12), issued in August 2004, which seeks to standardize identification  for federal employees and contractors. According to the directive, wide  variations in the quality and security of forms of identification used to gain  access to federal facilities, where there is a potential for terrorist attacks,  need to be eliminated. ISC\u2019s Executive Director informed us that he was  asked to be a member of the White House Homeland Security Council  Coordination Committee for HSPD-12. This ISC official would provide the  leadership role for this committee and ensure that physical security  requirements for the federal government, as they relate to the directive, are  included and coordinated with ISC members.", "Related to its role in maintaining and sharing information, ISC has  developed a Web site for posting policies and guidance and is developing a  secure Web portal for member agencies to exchange security guidance and  other information. Also, according to the Executive Director of ISC,  standard operating procedures were approved by ISC members in June  2004 and were finalized in September 2004. These operating procedures are  intended to improve the quality of information sharing among member  agencies at its meetings by establishing standards for attendance and  participation at ISC meetings. For example, each ISC agency representative  is required to attend all meetings or delegate a person to attend to ensure  full participation. Finally, DHS is developing a governmentwide facilities  database that the ISC Executive Director believes will meet ISC\u2019s  responsibility to assist with developing and maintaining a centralized  security database of all federal facilities. This database will list functions  and services that are mission critical, map federal assets and their critical  infrastructure, and identify key resources for both cyber and physical  security protection. According to ISC\u2019s Executive Director, ISC members  are an integral part of this process and will ensure that the required support  from within their departments and agencies is provided."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "New Role Could Provide Vehicle for Addressing Responsibilities Related to Ensuring Compliance and Overseeing Implementation", "paragraphs": ["Despite progress in its other areas of responsibility, ISC has not developed,  as specified in its 1995 executive order, a strategy for ensuring compliance  with security standards among agencies and overseeing the  implementation of appropriate security measures in federal facilities.  However, in July 2004, the administration made ISC responsible for  annually reviewing and approving physical security plans that agencies are  required to develop under a presidential homeland security policy  directive. HSPD-7, issued in December 2003, establishes a national policy  for federal departments and agencies to identify and prioritize critical  infrastructure and key resources in the United States so that they can be  protected from terrorist attacks. The directive makes DHS responsible for  overseeing the implementation of the directive and outlines the roles and  responsibilities of individual agencies. Among the roles and responsibilities  delineated, HSPD-7 establishes an annual reporting cycle for agencies to  evaluate their critical infrastructure and key resources protection plans for  both cyber and physical security. ISC\u2019s Executive Director informed us that  in July 2004, the administration designated ISC as the oversight body for  agencies\u2019 physical security plans. According to ISC\u2019s Executive Director,  ISC\u2019s role will be to review, approve, or disapprove each department or  agency\u2019s physical security plan.", "If ISC were to successfully fulfill its new responsibilities under HSPD-7,  which would be done under the broader umbrella of the administration\u2019s  central planning and coordination efforts for homeland security, it would  represent a major step toward meeting its responsibilities that relate to  oversight and compliance monitoring, as specified in the 1995 executive  order under which it was established. That is, the 1995 executive order that  established ISC specified that ISC should develop a strategy for ensuring  agencies\u2019 compliance with governmentwide facility protection standards  and oversee the implementation of appropriate security measures in  federal facilities. By having a role in reviewing agencies\u2019 physical security  plans in relation to HSPD-7, ISC would have a vehicle for carrying out its  existing responsibility related to compliance and oversight.

These included the following:  reaching a consensus with agencies on a risk management process for  the government that is reasonable and obtaining funding for this  activity;  addressing the issue of leased government space and the impact that  new physical security standards for leased space will have on the real  estate market;  developing a compliance process for agencies that can also be used as a  self-assessment tool to measure the effectiveness of ISC;  educating senior level staff from across the government and gaining  their support for ISC activities; and overall,   integrating all physical security initiatives for the entire federal  government and implementing change.", "We agree that ISC faces these challenges and, furthermore, that they will  have to be addressed in order for ISC to be successful. More specifically,  the sheer magnitude of integrating the government\u2019s facility protection  initiatives, which ISC and FPS officials identified, is formidable because it  involves many different agencies and varying perspectives on security.  Furthermore, in discussing the challenges associated with leased property,  ISC\u2019s Executive Director touched on one of several long-standing problems  in the federal real property area that have implications for facility  protection policy. As reported in GAO\u2019s 2003 high-risk report on federal real  property, the government\u2019s historical reliance on costly leased space\u2014 which achieves short-term budget savings but is more costly over the  longer term\u2014is problematic. To the extent that private sector lessors are  required to enhance the security of their property for federal tenants, the  associated costs will likely be passed on to the government in the form of  higher rent.", "Another long-standing problem that could affect ISC as it attempts to meet  its responsibilities is the historically unreliable nature of agency real  property data. Poor data could make it difficult for agency management to  implement and oversee comprehensive risk-based approaches to  protecting their facilities. As discussed later, risk management, as it  pertains to facility protection, relies heavily on accurate and timely data. At  the governmentwide level, inventory data maintained by GSA for the entire  government, and financial data on property reported in the government\u2019s  financial statements, have also been historically unreliable.", "Another challenge identified by ISC\u2019s Executive Director\u2014obtaining  adequate resources for its activities\u2014is a particular concern. According to  the Executive Director of ISC, as the ISC\u2019s only full-time staff person, his  ability to ensure that all of ISC\u2019s responsibilities are fulfilled is limited. Also,  according to this official, ISC is dependent entirely on participation and  input from member agencies. ISC\u2019s Executive Director said that, in the  past, getting buy-in and support from senior officials in member agencies  had been a challenge. It seems, however, that given ISC\u2019s new role in the  administration\u2019s homeland security efforts, it could make a persuasive case  for a sustained level of support from agencies. Also, it is important to note  that DHS has certain responsibilities under the executive order that  established ISC to ensure it has adequate resources. Specifically, the  executive order states that \u201cto the extent permitted by law and subject to  the availability of appropriations, the Secretary of Homeland Security  should provide ISC with such administrative services, funds, facilities,  staff, and other support services as may be necessary for the performance  of its functions.\u201d According to ISC\u2019s Executive Director, current ISC  resources are not sufficient for ISC to meet all of its evolving  responsibilities. This official told us that additional funding for ISC will not  be available until fiscal year 2006. However, given the prominent role ISC  will be playing in the administration\u2019s homeland security efforts, it will be  critical for DHS to help ISC undertake activities that will allow it to fulfill  its responsibilities, address other challenges it faces, and ultimately be  successful.", "Given the challenges ISC faces, its new responsibility related to HSPD-7 for  reviewing agencies\u2019 physical security plans, and the need to sustain  progress it has made in fulfilling its responsibilities, ISC would benefit from  having a clearly defined action plan for achieving results. Although ISC has  taken steps to address challenges, such as seeking additional resources for  fiscal year 2006, it lacks an action plan that could be used to (1) provide  DHS and other stakeholders with detailed information on, and a rationale  for, its resource needs; (2) garner and maintain the support of ISC member  agencies, DHS management, OMB, and Congress; (3) identify  implementation goals and measures for gauging progress in fulfilling all of  its responsibilities; and (4) propose strategies for addressing the challenges  ISC faces. Such a plan could incorporate the strategy for ensuring  compliance with facility protection standards that is required under ISC\u2019s  executive order, but has not yet been developed. Without an overall action  plan for meeting this and other responsibilities, ISC\u2019s strategy and time line  for these efforts remain unclear.", "Having an effective ISC is critically important to the government\u2019s overall  homeland security efforts as new threats emerge and agencies continue to  focus on improving facility protection. Prior to 1995, there were no  governmentwide standards for security at federal facilities and agencies\u2019  efforts to coordinate and share information needed improvement. Without  standards and mechanisms for coordination, there were concerns about  the vulnerability of federal facilities to acts of terrorism. As recently as  August 2004, information from DHS showed that threats against high- profile facilities in the New York area and Washington, D.C., are still a  major concern."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Key Practices in Federal Facility Protection", "paragraphs": ["As ISC and agencies have paid greater attention to facility protection in  recent years, several key practices have emerged that collectively could  provide a framework for guiding agencies\u2019 efforts.

Key facility protection practices  that we identified include allocating security resources using risk  management, leveraging the use of security technology, coordinating  protection efforts and sharing information with other stakeholders, and  measuring program performance and testing security initiatives. In  addition, we determined that two other practices GAO has highlighted as  governmentwide issues also have implications for the facility protection  area. These include realigning real property assets to agencies\u2019 missions,  thereby reducing vulnerabilities, and strategic human capital management,  to ensure that agencies are well equipped to recruit and retain high- performing security professionals. Our analysis\u2014based on our work and  Inspector General (IG) reports, the views of the NAS symposium experts in  facility protection, and interviews with federal agencies\u2014showed that  attention to these key practices could provide a framework for guiding  agencies\u2019 efforts and achieving success in the facility protection area.

Some examples of how agencies  applied risk management are as follows:  According to officials with FPS, which protects federally owned or  occupied facilities held by GSA and DHS, security needs and related  countermeasures are prioritized based on the level of risk to a particular  facility. Risk is determined by evaluating the impact of loss and  vulnerability that each specific threat would have on a facility.  According to these officials, FPS inspectors are trained to make  educated decisions on applicable countermeasures to the identified  threats and vulnerabilities on a recurring basis.", "We have reported that, for many years, DOE has employed risk-based  security practices. To manage potential risks, DOE uses a classified  document referred to as a \u201cdesign basis threat\u201d (DBT). The DBT  identifies the potential size and capabilities of terrorist forces and is  based on information DOE gathers from the intelligence community.  DOE requires contractors operating its sites to provide sufficient  protective forces and equipment to defend against the threat contained  in the DBT. DOE updated its 1999 DBT in May 2003 to better reflect  current and projected terrorist threats in the aftermath of September 11.", "VA conducts physical security assessments and prioritizes its protection  efforts for critical infrastructure, according to VA officials. The phases  of the assessment include defining the criticality of VA facilities,  identifying and analyzing vulnerabilities of VA\u2019s critical facilities, and  identifying appropriate countermeasures. According to VA documents,  VA determines vulnerability by factors such as facility population,  number of floors in the facility, and the presence or absence of armed  officers. This assessment also includes a procedure for scoring and  prioritizing identified vulnerabilities at each assessed site.", "We have reported that DOD requires its installations to assess, identify,  and evaluate potential threats to the installation; identify weaknesses  and countermeasures to address the installation\u2019s vulnerabilities; and  evaluate and rank criticality of the installation\u2019s assets to achieving  mission goals. These three assessments serve as the foundation of  each DOD installation\u2019s antiterrorism plan. The results of the  assessments are used to balance threats and vulnerabilities and to  define and prioritize related resource and operational requirements.", "Interior\u2019s Office of Law Enforcement and Security (OLES) has identified  16 Interior assets as needing special consideration because they are  critical to the nation\u2019s infrastructure or are national icons that could be  targets for symbolic reasons.

This effort involves annual security surveys of facilities  conducted by facility security control officers and periodic  comprehensive reviews at larger core postal facilities by the Postal  Inspection Service, which is the investigative branch of USPS.", "In commenting on this report, State noted that another example of an  agency\u2019s use of risk management is State\u2019s Long-Range Overseas  Buildings Plan (LROBP). LROBP is a 6-year plan, updated yearly, that  identifies embassy and consulate facilities most in need of replacement  due to unacceptable security, safety, and/or operational conditions.  State also said that the plan identifies State\u2019s facilities\u2019 program  objectives and prioritizes competing facility requirements with input  from the Bureaus of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) and  Diplomatic Security (DS), State\u2019s Regional Bureaus, and other overseas  agencies. State indicated that the LROBP provides a road map for  addressing long-term facility needs under the Capital Security  Construction Program, Regular Capital Construction Program, as well  as major rehabilitation, compound security, and other programs.  According to State\u2019s comments, to prepare the plan, each year OBO and  DS meet with the regional bureaus to discuss which posts should move  into the \u201ctop 80\u201d list, which contains the 80 primary posts requiring  replacement for security reasons, and for which, by law, the department  can spend security capital construction appropriations. Furthermore,  with respect to the original full list of facilities that need replacement,  the department, working with intelligence agencies, prioritizes these  facilities.", "At the NAS symposium, a private sector security expert discussed a risk  management methodology in use by FPS at GSA and Internal Revenue  Service facilities. We did not review the usefulness or effectiveness of this  methodology. Nonetheless, the methodology is an example of one risk  management process that is in use. The process, called Federal Security  Risk Management, or FSRM, is a risk matrix that compares credible threats  with assets and assesses the impact of loss and vulnerability. According to  the panelist, agencies use the risk matrix to apply security upgrades to the  risks deemed unacceptable and reevaluate the countermeasures until a  desired level of risk reduction is achieved. The agencies then develop  design or retrofit specifications and criteria. This risk assessment cycle  generally spans a 2-to-4 year time period.

Our work showed broad concurrence among GAO, IGs,  facility security experts, and agency experts that making efficient use of  security technology to protect federal facilities is a key practice, but that  the type of technology to use should be carefully analyzed. For example, in  reporting on border security and information security issues in 2003, we  found that prior to significant investment in a project, a detailed analysis  should be conducted to determine that benefits of a technology outweigh  costs, as well as to determine the effects of the technology on areas such as  privacy and convenience. In the facility access control area, we also  reported that agencies should decide how technology will be used and  whether to use technology at all to address vulnerabilities before  implementation. According to our 2003 testimony on using technologies  to secure federal facilities, technology implementation costs can be high,  particularly if significant infrastructure modifications are necessary.", "Another consideration is that lesser technological solutions sometimes  may be more effective and less costly than more advanced technologies.  For example, as we reported in 2002, trained dogs are an effective and time- proven tool for detecting concealed explosives. By using the risk  management process and balancing costs, benefits, and other concerns,  agencies can efficiently leverage technologies to enhance facility  protection.", "Among the advanced technologies that were identified during our review  were smart cards\u2014which use integrated circuit chips to store information  on individuals\u2014and biometrics\u2014which analyze human physical and  behavioral characteristics\u2014to verify the identity of employees.  Furthermore, sophisticated detection and surveillance systems such as  closed circuit television (CCTV) have also aided in securing facility  perimeters and monitoring activity in the building. Such technologies  expand surveillance capabilities and can free up security staff for other  duties. Several GAO and IG reports indicated that agencies currently have a  wide array of security technologies available for protecting facilities,  including smart cards, biometrics, X-ray scanners, and CCTV.

Officials at USPS  indicated that various detection technologies are used to secure its  facilities against biological and radiological agents. For example, as we  reported in 2002, USPS installed high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA)  filtration systems at some facilities to protect them from biohazards.  HEPA filtering technology is designed to remove particulate biohazards  and other particles.", "Currently, GSA is conducting a smart card pilot program for two federal  buildings in New York City. Although the first cards went into use in  October 2003, planning for the pilot program began before the September  11 terrorist attacks. One of the federal buildings participating in the  program is the Jacob Javits Federal Building, which houses approximately  35 agencies and more than 7,000 federal employees. All of the employees  participating in the program use smart cards to enter the building. In  addition to a person\u2019s name, title, and picture, the smart card contains  multiple layers of data substantiating the card\u2019s authenticity and personal  biometric data of the cardholder. Employees use the smart cards at access  portals near the building\u2019s entrances (see fig. 4). After the portal has read  the smart card and validated the user, glass doors swing apart to allow  entry. If the threat level is raised under the homeland security advisory  system, the building access technology requires additional security  procedures (e.g., entering a personal identification number (PIN), matching  a stored biometric record). Although agencies\u2019 use of smart cards in the  building has been optional, all of the agencies in the Javits building are  currently participating in the pilot program, including the Federal Bureau  of Investigation, the Small Business Administration, and the Department of  Housing and Urban Development.", "Overall, it was evident during our review that agencies are already using or  experimenting with a range of technologies in their facility protection  efforts. In terms of key practices, it is important to note that focusing on  obtaining and implementing the latest technology is not necessarily a key  practice by itself. Instead, having an approach that allows for cost- effectively leveraging technology to supplement and reinforce other  measures would represent an advanced security approach in this area.

In  considering the implications that information sharing and coordination  have for facility protection efforts, it is useful to look at how this practice is  being approached governmentwide, at the agency level, and at the  individual facility level.", "At the governmentwide level, DHS is expected to play a critical role in  information sharing and coordination in most homeland security areas,  including facility protection. In September 2003, we reported that  information sharing was critical for DHS to meet its mission of preventing  terrorist attacks in the United States, reducing vulnerability to terrorist  attacks, and minimizing damage and assisting with recovery if attacks do  occur. In 2003, we also reported that to accomplish its mission, DHS  needed to access, receive, and analyze law enforcement information,  intelligence information, and other threat, incident, and vulnerability  information from federal and nonfederal sources and analyze this  information to identify and assess the nature and scope of terrorist threats.  Furthermore, we reported that DHS should share information both  internally and externally with agencies, law enforcement, and first  responders. As we testified in September 2003, we have made numerous  recommendations to DHS to improve information sharing and coordination  to accomplish its homeland security responsibilities. These  recommendations involved, for example,  incorporating existing information-sharing guidance contained in  various national strategies and the information-sharing procedures  required by the Homeland Security Act of 2002;  establishing a clearinghouse to coordinate the various information- sharing initiatives to eliminate possible confusion and duplication of  effort;   fully integrating states and cities into a national policy-making process  for information sharing and taking steps to provide greater assurance  that actions at all levels of government are mutually reinforcing;   identifying and addressing perceived barriers to federal information-  using survey methods or related data collection approaches to  determine, over time, the needs of private and public organizations for  information related to homeland security and to measure progress in  improving information sharing at all levels of government.", "In addition to those recommendations, we identified a need for a  comprehensive plan to facilitate information sharing and coordination to  protect critical infrastructure in our August 2004 testimony on  strengthening information sharing for homeland security. We reported  that such a plan could encourage improved information sharing by clearly  delineating roles and responsibilities of federal and nonfederal entities,  defining interim objectives and milestones, setting time frames for  achieving objectives, and establishing performance measures. DHS has  concurred with the above recommendations to improve information  sharing and coordination and is in various stages of implementing them.  These recommendations clearly have implications for the facility  protection area, by, for example, increasing coordination among facility  stakeholders that would reduce duplicative efforts and reinforce protection  strategies.", "The emphasis on information sharing and coordination is also evident in  the National Strategy for Homeland Security and its related strategies to  protect critical infrastructure, including federal facilities. According to the  national strategy, successfully protecting facilities will rely on effective  information sharing and coordination among multiple entities as part of the  nation\u2019s broader homeland security efforts. In the related National  Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructure and Key  Assets, information sharing is a common theme. This strategy calls for the  federal government to work with various stakeholders to, among other  things, develop processes for visitor screening, assess vulnerabilities,  develop construction standards, and implement security technology. With  regard to national icon protection, the strategy recommends that Interior  work with other agencies, the public, and the private sector to define  criticality criteria, assess vulnerabilities, conduct security awareness  programs, and collaborate to protect national icons outside the purview of  the federal government. Related to dams, the strategy recommends that  DHS work with other agencies, dam owners, and local and state officials to  assess risks and institute a national dam security program.", "At the agency level, the agencies we contacted provided several examples  of their activities related to information sharing and coordination. These  activities are described in table 1.", "In addition to agencywide efforts, coordination and information sharing is  important at the individual facility level. As we have previously reported,  protecting federal facilities requires facility security managers to involve  multiple organizations to effectively coordinate and share information to  prevent, detect, and respond to terrorist attacks. Security managers  typically are not aware of potential threats to their facilities and depend on  intelligence from other organizations to prevent and/or deter attacks. For  example, according to officials from VA, due to limited resources and its  lack of an intelligence gathering capability, VA must rely on other agencies  to gain threat information. Additionally, security managers have to  coordinate and share information with state and local governments to  respond to terrorist attacks and do not have direct access to the range of  emergency resources required to respond to terrorist attacks. They rely on  state and local governments to provide first-responder services such as  firefighting, medical personnel, and other emergency services. They also  rely on local police and the judicial process to enforce and prosecute  violators of the laws and regulations governing the protection of federal  facilities. As such, at the individual facility level, security managers are less  equipped to make informed decisions about security without effective  information sharing and coordination.", "One way managers at the individual facility level may become better  informed is if they take advantage of emerging efforts by the government to  disseminate targeted threat information. For example, one recent DHS  effort to increase information sharing and coordination among security  stakeholders is its Homeland Security Information Network. According to  DHS\u2019s Web site, this unclassified network consists of Internet, phone, fax,  and pager communications systems that provides DHS with constant  access to real-time threat information from public and private industries  and agencies. DHS can also use the network to send targeted alert  notifications and other threat information to states, cities, and others,  which can then collect and disseminate this information among those other  entities involved in combating terrorism.

It aligns and focuses homeland security functions into six  mission critical areas, set forth as (1) intelligence and warning, (2) border  and transportation security, (3) domestic counterterrorism, (4) protecting  critical infrastructures and key assets, (5) defending against catastrophic  terrorism, and (6) emergency preparedness and response. As mentioned  before in relation to information sharing and coordination, the National  Strategy for the Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key  Assets incorporates facility protection efforts and identifies a set of  national goals and objectives. The strategy outlines the guiding principles  that will underpin the government\u2019s efforts to secure the infrastructures  and assets vital to national security, governance, public health and safety,  the economy, and public confidence. It also provides a unifying  organizational structure and identifies specific initiatives to drive the  government\u2019s near-term national protection priorities and inform the  resource allocation process. According to the strategy, the strategic  objectives that underpin our national critical infrastructure and key asset  protection effort include the following:  identifying and assuring the protection of those infrastructures and  assets that are deemed most critical in terms of national-level public  health and safety, governance, economic and national security, and  public confidence consequences;  providing timely warning and assuring the protection of those  infrastructures and assets that face a specific, imminent threat; and  assuring the protection of other infrastructures and assets that may  become terrorist targets over time by pursuing specific initiatives and  enabling a collaborative environment in which federal, state, and local  governments and the private sector can better protect the  infrastructures and assets they control.", "These strategies are national in scope, cutting across all levels of  government, and involve a large number of organizations and entities  including federal, state, local, and private sectors.

Under GPRA, agencies are to prepare 5-year strategic plans that  set the general direction for their efforts. These plans are to include  comprehensive mission statements, general and outcome-related goals,  descriptions of how those goals will be achieved, identification of external  factors that could affect progress, and a description of how performance  will be evaluated. Agencies are to then prepare annual performance plans  that establish connections between the long-term goals in the strategic  plans with the day-to-day activities of program managers and staff. These  plans are to include measurable goals and objectives to be achieved by a  program activity, descriptions of the resources needed to meet these goals,  and a description of the methods used to verify and validate measured  values.

DTRA\u2019s  2003 strategic plan contains most of the elements in a strategic plan  developed using GPRA standards. DTRA plays a key role in addressing  the threats posed by weapons of mass destruction (WMD), and its  specialized capabilities and services are used to support civilian agencies\u2019  efforts to address WMD threats, particularly the efforts of DOE and DHS.

As part of  one of its regularly scheduled assessments at one location, Interior  received assistance from DTRA, which performed an assessment of  vulnerabilities. According to Interior officials, DTRA officials looked at  whether the resulting effect from various types of attack would affect the  mission capabilities of the location.

During the review,  Interior IG officials identified some serious deficiencies with the overall  security program and made recommendations to remedy these problems.  For example, the IG\u2019s assessment revealed that necessary security  enhancements were delayed or wholly disregarded, that management  officials lacked situational awareness, and that other officials lacked the  expertise and resources to effectively assess, determine, and prioritize  necessary security actions. This type of active testing is useful in exposing  vulnerabilities and developing countermeasures.", "According to DOE officials, DOE\u2019s Performance Assurance Program  requires that performance testing determine the effectiveness of facility  protection systems and programs.

Assessments are made of the sites\u2019 ability to prevent  unacceptable, adverse impact on national security or on the health and  safety of DOE and contract employees, the public, or the environment. The  adequacy of safeguards and security measures are then validated through  various means such as surveys, periodic facility self-assessments, program  reviews and inspections, and assessments.", "In addition to testing facility access control through inspections and site  surveys, we found examples of security programs that tested the  effectiveness of physical security measures such as structural  enhancements, physical barriers, and blast-resistant windows. Blast- resistance in buildings is generally provided by passive features such as  additional reinforcement and connections in the structural frame for  increased malleability, composite fiber wraps to prevent shattering of  columns and slabs, and high-performance glazing materials that resist blast  pressures. In both field tests and experience (for example, the attack on the  Pentagon), these measures have been quite effective in reducing the  devastating effects of deliberate explosions and, consequently, reducing  casualties as well.", "In March 2004, a panelist from DOD at the NAS symposium indicated that  blast testing is also important in the prevention of injuries resulting from  progressive collapse of buildings and flying debris. He reported that 87  percent of the deaths occurred in the collapsed portion of the Alfred P.  Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, and only 5 percent of the deaths  occurred in the uncollapsed portion of the building. Furthermore, another  panelist noted that 70 of the over 2,000 publicly reported terrorist incidents  worldwide, since 1970, were directed at buildings. Most of these have  involved large vehicle bombs, incendiary bombs, or rocket-propelled  grenades.", "Training exercises and drills are also useful in assessing preparedness. We  have reported that effective security also entails having a well-trained staff  that follows and enforces policies and procedures. In these reports, we  found breaches in security resulting from human error are more likely to  occur if personnel do not understand the technologies, risks, and the  policies that are put in place to mitigate them. Furthermore, good training  and practice are essential to successfully implementing policies by  ensuring that personnel exercise good judgment in following security  procedures. Presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 39 requires key federal  agencies to maintain well-exercised capabilities for combating terrorism.  Exercises test and validate policies and procedures, test the effectiveness  of response capabilities, increase the confidence and skill levels of  personnel, and identify strengths and weaknesses in responses before they  arise in actual incidents. Counterterrorism exercises also include activities  where agency officials discuss scenarios around a table or other similar  setting, and field exercises, where agency leadership and operational units  actually deploy to practice their skills and coordination in a realistic field  setting.

Along with the need to secure facilities against the threat  of terrorism, excess property and the need to realign the federal real  property inventory were among the reasons GAO designated federal real  property as a high-risk area in January 2003. To the extent that agencies  are expending resources to maintain and protect facilities that are not  needed, funds available to protect critical assets may be lessened. Our past  work showed examples where funds spent to maintain and protect excess  property were significant. For example, we reported in January 2003 that  DOD estimates it is spending $3 billion to $4 billion each year maintaining  facilities that are not needed. In another example, costs associated with  excess DOE facilities, primarily for security and maintenance, were  estimated by the DOE IG in April 2002 to exceed $70 million annually. One  building that illustrates this problem is the former Chicago main post  office. In October 2003, we testified that this building, a massive 2.5 million  square foot structure located near the Sears Tower, is vacant and costing  USPS $2 million annually in holding costs.

VA\u2019s Capital Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services (CARES)  initiative, which VA started in October 2000, is an example where a  realignment effort is under way. In the mid-1990s, VA began shifting its role  from being a traditional hospital-based provider of medical services to an  integrated delivery system that emphasizes a full continuum of care with a  significant shift from inpatient to outpatient services.

During  2000, an interagency effort led by the Department of State began to assess  staffing of U.S. embassies and consulates to determine whether there were  opportunities to improve mission effectiveness and reduce security  vulnerabilities and costs by relocating staff. This process, referred to as  rightsizing, was initiated in response to the November 1999  recommendations of the Overseas Presence Advisory Panel (OPAP). In  the aftermath of the August 1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa,  OPAP determined that overseas staffing levels had not been adjusted to  reflect the changing missions and requirements; thus, some embassies and  consulates were overstaffed, and some were understaffed. The framework  provides a systematic approach for assessing workforce size and  identifying options for rightsizing, both at the embassy level and for making  related decisions worldwide. It links staffing levels to three critical  elements of overseas diplomatic operations: (1) physical/technical security  of facilities and employees, (2) mission priorities and requirements, and (3)  cost of operations.", "The first element includes analyzing the security of embassy buildings, the  use of existing secure space, and the vulnerabilities of staff to terrorist  attack. The second element focuses on assessing embassy priorities and  the staff\u2019s workload requirements. The third element involves developing  and consolidating cost information from all agencies at a particular  embassy to permit cost-based decision making. Unlike an analysis that  considers the elements in isolation, the rightsizing framework encourages  consideration of a full range of options, along with the security, mission,  and cost trade-offs. With this information, decision makers would then be  in a position to, for example, determine whether rightsizing actions are  needed either to add staff, reduce staff, or change the staff mix at an  embassy. Options for reducing staff could include outsourcing functions or  relocating functions to the United States or to regional centers. In May  2002, we testified that the use of this approach for the U.S. embassy in Paris  was successful in identifying security concerns and finding alternative  locations for staff, such as in the United States or other cities in Europe.  In April 2003, we reported that the rightsizing framework could be applied  at U.S. embassies in developing countries. We later testified in April 2003  that OMB should expand the use of the rightsizing framework and that  State adopt additional measures to ensure that U.S. agencies take a  systematic approach to assessing workforce size that considers security,  mission, and cost factors. GAO also recommended that State develop  guidance on a systematic approach for developing and vetting staffing  projections for new diplomatic compounds.

As the government\u2019s homeland security efforts evolve,  federal agencies involved with the intelligence community and other  homeland security organizations will need the most effective human capital  systems to reach projected security goals. For facility protection, as with  other areas related to homeland security, it is especially critical for  agencies to recognize the \u201cpeople\u201d element and implement strategies to  help individuals maximize their full potential. Also, it is important for  agencies to be well equipped to recruit and retain high-performing security  and law enforcement professionals.

The Director, Office of Safeguards and Security at  DOE, agreed with the recommendation.", "Successfully training employees on using emerging security technologies is  also an important element in facility protection (see fig. 6). Installing the  latest security technology alone cannot guarantee effective facility  protection if security personnel have not been adequately trained to use the  technologies properly. Training is particularly essential if the technology  requires personnel to master certain knowledge and skills to operate it,  such as detecting concealed objects in generated X-ray images. Without  adequate training in understanding how technology works, the security  system will likely be less effective. This is especially important in assessing  risks and vulnerabilities in facility protection. According to DHS officials,  FPS inspectors are trained to conduct risk assessments and to evaluate the  effectiveness of previously installed facility countermeasures. Trained FPS  inspectors articulate their findings to a building security committee for  approval and funding, after which FPS implements the necessary  countermeasures. At the NAS symposium, a security consultant from the  private sector said that the effectiveness of a risk management approach  depends on the involvement of experienced and professional security  personnel and that there is an increased chance that personnel could omit  major steps in the risk management process if they are not well trained in  applying risk management.", "As the emphasis on protecting people, property, and information has  increased, it has made the demand for professional security practitioners  become even more important.

Another obstacle is keeping  risk assessments up-to-date as threat levels change, and resources for this  activity are stretched. As we pointed out earlier in relation to ISC\u2019s  challenges, in our January 2003 high-risk report on federal real property, we  highlighted that some major real property-holding agencies face obstacles  in developing quality management data on their real property assets.

We testified in August 2004 that  there is a need for a comprehensive plan to facilitate information sharing  and coordination in the protection of critical infrastructure. However,  DHS has not yet developed a plan that describes how it will carry out its  overall information sharing responsibilities and relationships. In  commenting on this report, DHS indicated in its technical comments that  such an information plan is being developed. Another obstacle is  developing productive information sharing relationships among federal,  state, and local governments and the private sector. Improving the federal  government\u2019s capabilities to analyze incident, threat, and vulnerability  information from numerous sources could assist in more effectively  disseminating information to federal, state, local, and private entities. Not  sharing information on threats and on actual incidents experienced by  others can hinder the ability of agencies\u2019 to identify new trends, better  understand risks, and determine what preventive measures to implement.  As we reported in August 2003, information sharing initiatives implemented  by states and cities were neither effectively coordinated with those of  federal agencies, nor were they coordinated within and between federal  entities.", "At the agencywide level, we have reported that agencies face obstacles in  developing meaningful, outcome-oriented performance goals and  collecting performance data that can be used to assess the true impact of  facility security. Performance measurement under GPRA typically focuses  on regularly collected data on the level and type of program activities, the  direct products and services delivered by the program, and the results of  those activities. For programs that have readily observable results or  outcomes, performance measurement may provide sufficient information  to demonstrate program results. In some programs, such as facility  security, however, outcomes are not quickly achieved or readily observed,  or their relationship to the program is often not clearly defined. In such  cases, more in-depth program evaluations may be needed, in addition to  performance measurement, to examine the extent to which a program is  achieving its objectives. This approach is more challenging and represents  a more advanced level of performance measurement.", "Significant long-standing obstacles also hinder agencies\u2019 ability to realign  their asset portfolios. As we have reported, the complex legal and  budgetary environment in which real property managers operate has a  significant impact on real property decisionmaking and often does not lead  to businesslike outcomes. Resource limitations\u2014including those related  to facility protection\u2014in general, often prevent agencies from addressing  real property needs from a strategic portfolio perspective. When available  funds for capital investment are limited, Congress must weigh the need for  new, modern facilities with the need for renovation, maintenance, and  disposal of existing facilities, the latter of which often gets deferred.  Facility protection often falls within this latter category. Until these  competing factors are mitigated, agencies face budgetary and legal  disincentives when trying to realign their assets. State\u2019s experience to date  with rightsizing its overseas presence demonstrated some of the challenges  in realigning real property assets. We reported in November 2003 that  State\u2019s efforts to replace facilities at risk of terrorist or other attacks have  experienced project delays due to changes in project design and security  requirements, difficulties hiring appropriate American and local labor with  the necessary clearances and skills, differing site conditions, and  unforeseen events such as civil unrest.", "Finally, we have reported that agencies continue to face obstacles in  implementing and maintaining a strategic approach to human capital.  Specifically, agencies continue to face challenges in promoting (1)  leadership; (2) strategic human capital planning; (3) acquiring, developing,  and retaining talent; and (4) results-oriented organizational cultures in an  effort to strategically manage human capital. Although some progress has  been made since we designated human capital management as high-risk in  2001, today\u2019s federal human capital strategies are not appropriately  constituted to meet current and emerging challenges, especially in light of  the new security challenges facing the government. Human capital  challenges are relevant to the facility protection area because security is a  people-intensive activity involving active management and response, and  there is a high dependency on law enforcement and security officers, as  well as contract guards.", "Given these obstacles, and the need to overcome them, agencies would  benefit from having a set of key practices to guide their facility protection  efforts. GAO has advocated the use of guiding principles in other areas,  including human capital management, information technology, and capital  investment. ISC, in serving as the central coordinator for agencies\u2019 efforts,  is uniquely positioned to promote key practices in facility protection and  could use our work as a starting point.

Although this progress is encouraging, more work remains to fulfill  ISC\u2019s major responsibilities related to ensuring agency compliance and  overseeing the implementation of various policies and standards. Fulfilling  its new role in reviewing and approving agencies\u2019 physical security plans  for the administration represents a major step toward meeting its  compliance and oversight responsibilities. Furthermore, because DHS now  has responsibility for ISC, the department also has a responsibility, in  keeping with the executive order under which ISC was established, to  ensure that ISC has adequate resources to accomplish its mission. Given  the challenges ISC faces, its new responsibility related to HSPD-7 for  reviewing agencies\u2019 physical security plans, and the need to sustain  progress it has made in fulfilling its responsibilities, ISC would benefit from  having a clearly defined action plan for achieving results. Such a plan,  which ISC lacks, could be used to (1) provide DHS and other stakeholders  with detailed information on, and a rationale for, its resource needs; (2)  garner and maintain the support of ISC member agencies, DHS  management, OMB, and Congress; (3) identify implementation goals and  measures for gauging progress in fulfilling all of its responsibilities; and (4)  propose strategies for addressing the challenges ISC faces. Such a plan  could incorporate the strategy for ensuring compliance with facility  protection standards that is required under ISC\u2019s executive order but has  not yet been developed. Without an overall action plan for meeting this and  other responsibilities, ISC\u2019s strategy and time line for these efforts remain  unclear.", "Since September 11, the focus on protecting the nation\u2019s critical  infrastructure has been heightened considerably. At the individual building  level, agencies have improved perimeter security by, for example, installing  concrete bollards and are routinely screening vehicles and people entering  federal property. In looking at facility protection issues more broadly,  several key practices have emerged that include allocating resources using  risk management, leveraging security technology, sharing information and  coordinating protection efforts with other stakeholders, and measuring  program performance and testing security initiatives. In addition, other key  practices that have clear implications for the facility protection area  include realigning real property assets and strategically managing human  capital. Because agencies face various obstacles and would benefit from  evaluating their actions, it would be useful for them to have a framework of  key practices in the facility protection area that could guide their efforts,  and ISC is well positioned to lead this initiative as the government\u2019s central  forum for exchanging information and guidance on facility protection."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making two recommendations\u2014one to the Secretary of Homeland  Security and one to the Chair of ISC.

From this initial  selection, we identified over 450 reports related to homeland security,  which we subsequently reduced to 170 reports that were related to facility  protection. Thirty-six of the reports were from IG offices at the seven  agencies that control over 85 percent of federal facilities in terms of  building square footage. These agencies included the Departments of  Defense (DOD), Energy (DOE), the Interior (Interior), Veterans Affairs  (VA) and State (State); the U.S. Postal Service (USPS); and the General  Services Administration (GSA). We systematically reviewed these reports  using a data collection instrument we designed to identify and group key  practices according to theme or type of activity. In doing our work, we also  gave consideration to other GAO reports on governmentwide management  issues that, in our judgment, had implications for the facility protection  area. We also considered new GAO reports that were issued after the  selection time period that were relevant. For the purposes of this review,  we did not assess the extent to which agencies were using GPRA to  develop agencywide facility protection or security-related goals. Also, for  the purpose of this review, we did not assess the training and certifications  offered by ASIS International.", "We also interviewed officials at the major property-holding agencies,  including DOD, DOE, Interior, VA, State, USPS, and GSA to obtain updated  information on their facility protection activities and their use of key  practices. We then contracted with the National Academy of Sciences  (NAS) to convene a symposium with 21 security experts from the private  sector, government, academia, and foreign countries to validate the  practices and gain further insights. Using their judgment, NAS officials  selected security experts based on their broad expertise and backgrounds  in building security programs.

Although applying risk management principles to facility protection can  take on various forms, our past work showed that most risk management  approaches generally involve identifying potential threats, assessing  vulnerabilities, identifying the assets that are most critical to protect in  terms of mission and significance, and evaluating mitigation alternatives  for their likely effect on risk and their cost. We have concluded that without  a risk management approach, there is little assurance that programs to  combat terrorism are prioritized and properly focused. Risk management  principles acknowledge that while risk cannot be eliminated, enhancing  protection from known or potential threats can help reduce it. Drawing on  this precedent, we compiled a risk management framework\u2014outlined  below\u2014to help assess the U.S. government\u2019s response to homeland  security and terrorism risk. This framework, which we have used to assess  the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s programs to target oceangoing  cargo containers for inspection, also has applicability to protecting federal  facilities. For purposes of the risk management framework, we used the  following definitions:  Risk\u2014an event that has a potentially negative impact, and the possibility  that such an event will occur and adversely affect an entity\u2019s assets and  activities and operations, as well as the achievement of its mission and  strategic objectives. As applied to the homeland security context, risk is  most prominently manifested as \u201ccatastrophic\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d events  related to terrorism, i.e., those involving more that $1 billion in damage  or loss and/or more than 500 casualties.", "Risk management\u2014a continuous process of managing, through a series  of mitigating actions that permeate an entity\u2019s activities, the likelihood  of an adverse event happening and having a negative impact. In general,  risk is managed as a portfolio, addressing entity-wide risk within the  entire scope of activities. Risk management addresses \u201cinherent,\u201d or  pre-action, risk (i.e., risk that would exist absent any mitigating action)  as well as \u201cresidual,\u201d or post-action, risk (i.e., the risk that remains even  after mitigating actions have been taken).", "The risk management framework\u2014which is based on the proposition that a  threat to a vulnerable asset results in risk\u2014consists of the following  components:  Internal (or implementing) environment\u2014the internal environment is  the institutional \u201cdriver\u201d of risk management, serving as the foundation  of all elements of the risk management process. The internal  environment includes an entity\u2019s organizational and management  structure and processes that provide the framework to plan, execute,  and control and monitor an entity\u2019s activities, including risk  management. Within the organizational and management structure, an  operational unit that is independent of all other operational (business)  units is responsible for implementing the entity\u2019s risk management  function. This unit is supported by and directly accountable to an  entity\u2019s senior management. For its part, senior management (1) defines  the entity\u2019s risk tolerance (i.e., how much risk is an entity willing to  assume in order to accomplish its mission and related objectives) and  (2) establishes the entity\u2019s risk management philosophy and culture (i.e.,  how an entity\u2019s values and attitudes view risk and how its activities and  practices are managed to deal with risk). The operational unit (1)  designs and implements the entity\u2019s risk management process and (2)  coordinates internal and external evaluation of the process and helps  implement any corrective action.", "Threat (event) assessment\u2014threat is defined as a potential intent to  cause harm or damage to an asset (e.g., natural environment, people,  manmade infrastructures, and activities and operations). Threat  assessments consist of the identification of adverse events that can  affect an entity. Threats might be present at the global, national, or local  level, and their sources include terrorists and criminal enterprises.  Threat information emanates from \u201copen\u201d sources and intelligence  (both strategic and tactical). Intelligence information is characterized as  \u201creported\u201d (or raw) and \u201cfinished\u201d (fully fused and analyzed).", "Criticality assessment\u2014criticality is defined as an asset\u2019s relative  importance. Criticality assessments identify and evaluate an entity\u2019s  assets based on a variety of factors, including the importance of its  mission or function, the extent to which people are at risk, or the  significance of a structure or system in terms of, for example, national  security, economic activity, or public safety. Criticality assessments are  important because they provide, in combination with the framework\u2019s  other assessments, the basis for prioritizing which assets require greater  or special protection relative to finite resources.", "Vulnerability assessment\u2014vulnerability is defined as the inherent state  (either physical, technical, or operational) of an asset that can be  exploited by an adversary to cause harm or damage. Vulnerability  assessments identify these inherent states and the extent of their  susceptibility to exploitation, relative to the existence of any  countermeasures.", "Risk assessment\u2014risk assessment is a qualitative and/or quantitative  determination of the likelihood (probability) of occurrence of an  adverse event and the severity, or impact, of its consequences. Risk  assessments include scenarios under which two or more risks interact  creating greater or lesser impacts.", "Risk characterization\u2014risk characterization involves designating risk  as, for example, low, medium, or high (other scales, such as numeric,  are also be used). Risk characterization is a function of the probability  of an adverse event occurring and the severity of its consequences. Risk  characterization is the crucial link between assessments of risk and the  implementation of mitigation actions, given that not all risks can be  addressed because resources are inherently scarce; accordingly, risk  characterization forms the basis for deciding which actions are best  suited to mitigate the assessed risk.", "Mitigation evaluation\u2014Mitigation evaluation is the identification of  mitigation alternatives to assess the effectiveness of the alternatives.  The alternatives should be evaluated for their likely effect on risk and  their cost.", "Mitigation selection\u2014Mitigation selection involves a management  decision on which mitigation alternatives should be implemented  among alternatives, taking into account risk, costs, and the effectiveness  of mitigation alternatives. Selection among mitigation alternatives  should be based upon preconsidered criteria. There are as of yet no  clearly preferred selection criteria, although potential factors might  include risk reduction, net benefits, equality of treatment, or other  stated values. Mitigation selection does not necessarily involve  prioritizing all resources to the highest-risk area, but in attempting to  balance overall risk and available resources.", "Risk mitigation\u2014Risk mitigation is the implementation of mitigation  actions, in priority order and commensurate with assessed risk;  depending on its risk tolerance, an entity may choose not to take any  action to mitigate risk (this is characterized as risk acceptance). If the  entity does choose to take action, such action falls into three categories:  (1) risk avoidance (exiting activities that expose the entity to risk), (2)  risk reduction (implementing actions that reduce likelihood or impact of  risk), and (3) risk sharing (implementing actions that reduce likelihood  or impact by transferring or sharing risk). In each category, the entity  implements actions as part of an integrated \u201csystems\u201d approach, with  built-in redundancy to help address residual risk (the risk that remains  after actions have been implemented). The systems approach consists  of taking actions in personnel (e.g., training, deployment), processes  (e.g., operational procedures), technology (e.g., software or hardware),  infrastructure (e.g., institutional or operational\u2014such as port  configurations), and governance (e.g., management and internal control  and assurance). In selecting actions, the entity assesses their costs and  benefits, where the amount of risk reduction is weighed against the cost  involved and identifies potential financing options for the actions  chosen.", "Monitoring and evaluation of risk mitigation\u2014Monitoring and  evaluation of risk mitigation entails the assessment of the functioning of  actions against strategic objectives and performance measures to make  necessary changes. Monitoring and evaluation includes, where and  when appropriate, peer review and testing and validation; and an  evaluation of the impact of the actions on future options; and  identification of unintended consequences that, in turn, would need to  be mitigated.
