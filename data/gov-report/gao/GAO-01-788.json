The buildings, particularly much of the original infrastructure, have  exceeded their economic life expectancy.  They are energy inefficient and  no longer conform to current safety, fire, and building codes or to U.N.  technologic or security requirements. U.N. officials have discussed  renovating the 50-year-old complex for about a decade. (See app. I for  information on the U.N. headquarters and construction project planning.)   In June 2000, the Secretary-General presented to the General Assembly a  Capital Master Plan, which provides options for a multiyear effort to  renovate the headquarters.  The Secretary-General\u2019s preferred option was  estimated to take 6 years and cost about $1 billion. In December 2000, the  General Assembly approved $8 million for the Secretary-General to develop  design concepts and associated cost estimates for the renovation and  ensure that all viable renovation options had been considered.", "Because the United States is the largest contributor to the U.N. system and  the host country for U.N. headquarters, the Congress is concerned about  the reasonableness of the planning for the proposed renovation and its  potential cost and financing.  To address these concerns, you asked that we  (1) assess the reasonableness of the United Nations\u2019 renovation planning  efforts, including the initial cost estimate; (2) comment on the potential  cost to the U.S. government, including financing options and issues; and (3)  discuss the tentative time frames for key steps in the renovation process.   Because the Department of State, through the U.S. Mission to the United  Nations, is responsible for ensuring that U.S. interests at the United  Nations are met, we also inquired into what role State had played thus far  in the renovation."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Project Planning Has Been Reasonable", "paragraphs": ["The U.N. headquarters complex clearly needs to be renovated.  For  example, the Capital Master Plan notes that  \u201cusers of the United Nations  Headquarters site...have a lower chance of survival during a fire than they  would at comparable modern buildings\u2026\u201d While still in its early stages, we  believe that the renovation planning efforts to date, including the cost  estimate, are reasonable.  Our opinion is based on the following actions  taken by U.N. officials, which are consistent with typical industry best  practices for this phase of project development\u2014the conceptual planning  phase.", "Defined the need for a renovation.  About a decade ago, U.N. officials  identified the need for a major renovation to provide member states a 21st  century headquarters.  To define the technical needs, they competitively  procured the services of a multidisciplinary team of consultants, who  assessed the existing conditions of each infrastructure component.  The  assessments were based on visual inspections and selective probes of the  buildings\u2019 structure and their electrical, mechanical, plumbing, and other  systems.  The assessment reports formed the basis for the Capital Master  Plan conclusion that current building conditions render the headquarters  unacceptable for continued long-term use.", "Defined U.N. project expectations. The Secretary-General defined the  project expectation as follows: \u201cThe United Nations facility should be safe,  free of hazardous materials, environmentally sound, fully accessible to all  persons and cost-efficient to operate.\u201d  The Capital Master Plan presented a  framework of options that could meet this expectation and preliminary  cost estimates ranging from $875 million to $1.2 billion.  The estimates  were (1) developed using standard industry practices; (2) based on the  condition assessments; and (3) included costs for labor and materials,  project management, and contingencies\u2014all adjusted for the New York  City market and for inflation over the project duration.  However, the  estimates excluded some costs, such as (1) U.N. staff other than for project  management; (2) furniture, fixtures, and equipment; or (3) additional  security measures.  Based on standard estimating literature and our work  looking at the planning efforts, it is our opinion that the preliminary cost  estimate has a margin of error of 20 to 30 percent.   The estimates will be  refined after the scope of the renovation is decided and further design work  is completed.", "Recognized the value of a project management plan to guide  decisionmaking. U.N. project officials acknowledged the value of a project  management plan that could include (1) a statement of project goals and  objectives; (2) options for management of the project; (3) project  implementation schedules; (4) details about how the renovation would  affect day-to-day U.N. operations; and (5) observations about how U.N.  stakeholders, including member states, employees, the city of New York,  and others, would be involved in the process.  As part of conceptual  planning, U.N. officials are developing a new project management plan that  updates the Capital Master Plan.", "Recognized a need to augment management capability.  U.N. project staff  recognize that while the Secretariat does have project management  capability, it does not have the capability to manage a project as large and  complex as the proposed renovation.  While a decision regarding project  management has not been reached, U.N. officials have identified options  that could be implemented when funding is approved. These options range  from directly hiring individuals with the requisite skills to contracting for  such services.

The cost will depend  on the design and scope of work selected and the decisions member states,  New York City, and New York State make about how to finance and share in  the cost of the renovation. The Capital Master Plan suggested that some  voluntary and private contributions might be available but that the  following three financing options are the most likely alternatives.  A  financial advisory group will be established to explore further these three  and all other possible options.", "Cash payments by member states.  While this is the most straightforward  option, it would require member states to pay for the entire cost of the  renovation during the construction period.  Moreover, members would  have to agree on individual assessment rates for every member.", "Negotiations over the assessment rates have been contentious in recent  years.", "Interest-free loans provided by members.  Representatives from several  member states said that their governments might consider providing an  interest-free loan but the United States needs to take the lead in furthering  such a proposal.  According to Office of Management and Budget officials,  the Congress would have to appropriate the U.S. share of an interest-free  loan in full, and the funds would be obligated with outlays during the  renovation period.", "Bond financing in the capital markets.  According to the United Nations\u2019  financial consultant, the United Nations could raise funds in the  commercial capital markets and could expect to receive a credit rating  between AA (very high grade) and A (upper medium grade) for a  commercial bond offering.  A representative from at least one member  state said his government would be opposed to such a proposal because  some member states have a higher credit rating and could borrow the funds  at a lower cost.  Also, according to the financial consultant, the bond might  have to be secured by the United Nations\u2019 regular operating budget, which  could restrict the use of the regular budget funds for day-to-day activities.   (See app. III for more detail about the financing options and financial and  policy implications for members.)", "Some member states believe that the United States, New York State, and  New York City derive net economic benefits from the presence of the U.N.  headquarters in New York. Therefore, they say that these three entities  should pay a larger share of the renovation costs than the U.S. share of the  regular U.N. budget (22 percent as of January 2001).  Both New York City  and State have made contributions to the United Nations since its inception  and incur annual costs associated with the U.N.\u2019s presence and the  diplomatic community.  In turn, New York City realizes economic benefits  from being the host city to the United Nations, generating $3.3 billion in  economic activity as a result of the United Nations\u2019 presence, according to  a 1994 study.

At that point, member states would consider the  renovation options, the initial design concepts, and revised estimates of  project costs.  By the end of 2002, the Secretary-General anticipates  member states would make key decisions determining the future of the  renovation, including deciding on (1) a project scope of work, (2) the  appropriate funds for the final design (estimated to cost about $37 million),  and (3) the financing arrangements.

To  assess the reasonableness of the cost estimates, we looked at the  assumptions supporting the preliminary cost estimates, as well as the  methods used in constructing certain cost estimates.

The consultant report  noted that the facade exhibits signs of water penetration, with a possible  indication of serious deterioration of the anchorage system due to  uncontrolled water infiltration.  The report recommended that high priority  be given to the marble on the east facade, since some of the stones show  signs of failing anchorage as exhibited in the shifting of some stones.   Further, the report said that a program of stone removal should commence  and, that if the anchorage is deteriorated, it be replaced with stainless steel.", "The consultant report noted that a large part of the electrical system in the  basement consists of equipment that was originally installed in 1949, as  illustrated in the type of fuses shown in figure 7.  In this regard, the report  noted that the vast majority of the electrical distribution system should be  replaced, since it is no longer manufactured or is in a state of disrepair.", "Figure 8 shows asbestos that was used on the interior surface of the walls  below the windows in the U.N.

The planning decision considerations in  the three options were as follows: minimize the total time spent in  construction, control disruption and relocation, and cost less than other  approaches.  The Capital Master Plan noted that while the 3-year option  would be the least costly, at an estimated $875 million, it would also be the  most disruptive, with current planning envisioning about 50 percent of the  headquarters facility and staff affected by construction at the same time.  In  contrast, while the 12-year option would be more expensive, at an  estimated $1,054 million, it would be the least disruptive, with current  planning envisioning about 10 percent of the headquarters facility and staff  affected by construction at the same time.  In considering the 6-year option,  the Secretary-General stated his opinion that it was the most practical and  desirable approach, considering the estimated cost of $964 million, and that  current planning envisions 33 percent of the headquarters facility and staff  would be affected by construction at the same time.", "The Capital Master Plan also discussed two other options: (1) a reactive  approach of continuing to maintain the buildings and facilities as needed  and (2) a demolition and rebuild approach, which is an approach that may  not be practical since the structures are landmarks.  The report noted that  there are serious disadvantages to the reactive approach. Foremost is that  after $1,154 million in costs are incurred over 25 years, the organization will  still have the same deficient buildings and facilities because the facilities  would not be modernized or improved in any meaningful way.  Further, the  United Nations\u2019 energy costs would continue to rise because the major  alterations required to reduce energy consumption would occur  incrementally. Finally, many of the hazardous conditions would continue to  exist despite the costs incurred. The Capital Master Plan report estimated  the cost of the demolition option at $992 million.  However, additional costs  would be incurred for (1) relocating the entire Secretariat staff for a period  of up to 5 years, estimated at $218 million; and (2) convening all meetings  away from U.N. headquarters, at a substantial additional cost that has not  yet been determined."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Financing Options for U.N.
