In 1982, there were about 740,000 women veterans. By 1997, that number had increased by 66 percent to over 1.2 million, or 4.8 percent, of the veteran population. Today, women make up nearly 14 percent of the active duty force and, with the exception of the Marine Corps, 20 percent of new recruits. By 2010, women are expected to represent over 10 percent of the total veteran population.", "Like male veterans, female veterans who serve on active duty in the uniformed services for the minimum amount of time specified by law and who were discharged, released, or retired under conditions other than dishonorable are eligible for some VA health care services. Historically, veterans\u2019 eligibility for health care services depended on factors such as the presence and extent of service-connected disabilities, income, and period and conditions of military service.", "In 1996, the Congress passed the Veterans Health Care Eligibility Reform Act (P.L. 104-262), which simplified the eligibility criteria and made all veterans eligible for comprehensive outpatient care. To manage its health care services, the act requires VA to establish an enrollment process for managing demand within available resources. The seven priorities for enrollment are (1) veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 50 percent or higher; (2) veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 30 or 40 percent; (3) former prisoners of war, veterans with service-connected disabilities rated at 10 or 20 percent, and veterans whose discharge from active military service was for a compensable disability that was incurred or aggravated in the line of duty or veterans who with certain exceptions and limitations are receiving disability compensation; (4) catastrophically disabled veterans and veterans receiving increased non-service-connected disability pensions because they are permanently housebound; (5) veterans unable to defray the cost of medical care; (6) all other veterans in the so-called \u201ccore\u201d group,including veterans of World War I and veterans with a priority for care based on presumed environmental exposure; and (7) all other veterans. VA may create additional subdivisions within each of these enrollment groups.", "With the growing women veteran population came the need to provide health care services equivalent to those provided to men. Over the past 15 years, GAO, VA, and the Advisory Committee on Women Veterans have assessed VA services available to women veterans. In 1982, GAO reported that VA lacked adequate general and gender-specific health care services, effective outreach for women veterans, and facilities that provided women veterans appropriate levels of privacy in health care delivery settings. In 1992, GAO reported that VA had made progress in correcting previously identified deficiencies, but some privacy deficiencies and concerns about availability and outreach remained. In response to concerns about the availability of women veterans\u2019 health care and to improve VA\u2019s delivery of health care to women veterans, the Congress enacted the Women Veterans Health Programs Act of 1992 (P.L. 102-585). This act authorized new and expanded health care services for women. In 1993, VA\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) for Health Care Inspections reported that problems\u2014such as women veterans\u2019 not always being informed about eligibility for health care services as well as VA\u2019s lack of appropriate accommodations, medical equipment, and supplies to treat women patients in VA medical facilities\u2014still existed.", "In December 1993, the Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs, established VA\u2019s first Women Veterans\u2019 Program Office (WVPO). In November 1994, the Congress enacted legislation (P.L. 103-446) that required VA to create a Center for Women Veterans to oversee VA programs for women. As a result, WVPO was reorganized into the Center for Women Veterans. The Center Director reports directly to the VA Secretary.", "In compliance with the Government Performance Results Act, VA has a strategic plan that includes goals for (1) monitoring the trends in women\u2019s utilization of VA services from fiscal years 1998 through 2001, (2) reporting on barriers and actions to address recommendations to correct them, and (3) assessing progress in correcting deficiencies from fiscal years 1999 through 2001.

First, VA has increased outreach efforts to inform women veterans of their eligibility for benefits and health care services. However, it has not evaluated these efforts, so it is not known how knowledgeable women veterans are about their eligibility for health care services. VA has also designated coordinators to assist women veterans in accessing the system.", "In addition, VA has identified and begun to correct patient privacy deficiencies in inpatient and outpatient settings. VA has surveyed its facilities on two occasions to determine the extent to which privacy deficiencies exist. In fiscal year 1998, VA spent more than $67 million correcting deficiencies and has developed plans for correcting remaining deficiencies.

We and others reported that (1) women veterans were not aware that they were eligible to receive health care in VA and (2) VA did not target outreach to women veterans, routinely disseminate information to service organizations with predominantly female memberships, or adequately inform women of changes in their eligibility. To address these concerns, VA has targeted women veterans during outreach efforts at the headquarters, regional, and local levels.", "At the headquarters level, a number of outreach strategies have been implemented. For example, the Center for Women Veterans, as part of its strategic and performance goals for 1998 through 2000, is placing greater emphasis on the importance of outreach to women and the need for improved communication techniques. Since the inception of WVPO and the Center for Women Veterans, VA has held an average of 15 to 20 town meetings a year, along with other informational seminars. The Center also provided informational seminars at the annual conventions of the Women\u2019s Army Corp and the Women Marines; American Legion; American Veterans of World War II, Korea, and Vietnam; and Disabled American Veterans. The Center also provided information on VA programs for women veterans and other women veterans\u2019 issues at national training events for county and state veteran service officers and their counterparts in the national Veterans\u2019 Service Organizations. Further, the Center established a web site within the VA home page to provide women veterans with information about health care services and other concerns as well as the opportunity to correspond with the Center via electronic mail.", "At the regional and local levels, VBA regional and benefit offices, VA medical centers, and Vet Centers display posters, brochures, and other materials that focus specifically on women veterans. They also send representatives to distribute these materials and talk to women veterans during outreach activities, such as health fairs and media events, that are used to publicize the theme that \u201cWomen Are Veterans, Too.\u201d The VA facilities we visited were conducting similar activities. For example, the medical center in New Orleans directed its Office of Public Relations to work closely with the women veterans coordinator to develop an outreach program. The New Orleans Vet Center women veterans coordinator told us that she expanded her outreach efforts to colleges with nursing schools in an effort to reach women veterans who do not participate in veteran-related activities.", "In addition, VBA regional offices coordinate with the Department of Defense to provide information on VA benefits and services to prospective veterans during Transition Assistance Program (TAP) briefings. In addition to providing information to active-duty personnel who plan to separate from the military on how to transition into civilian life, TAP briefings provide information on the benefits they may be eligible for as veterans as well as how to obtain them.", "Although VA has greatly increased its outreach efforts, it has not yet evaluated the effectiveness of these efforts. Women veterans organizations have acknowledged the increase in VA\u2019s outreach efforts directed at women veterans but continue to express concern about whether women veterans are being reached and adequately informed about their eligibility for benefits and health care services. Several women veterans we talked with during our site visits said they found out by chance\u2014during casual conversations\u2014that they were eligible for care. Women veterans and agency staff acknowledged that \u201cword of mouth\u201d from satisfied patients appears to be one of the most effective ways to share information about various benefits and services to which women veterans may be entitled.", "In March 1998, the Advisory Committee for Women Veterans, the Center for Women Veterans, and the National Center for Veterans Statistics provided specific questions for inclusion in VA\u2019s Survey of Veterans for Year 2000 to address the extent to which women veterans are becoming more knowledgeable about their eligibility for services.

This role was established in 1985 because women veterans did not know how to obtain health care services once they became aware of their eligibility for these services. However, in 1994, VA\u2019s OIG reported that these coordinators often lacked sufficient training and time to perform effectively; many women veterans coordinators performed in this capacity on a part-time basis.", "VA has since provided women veterans coordinators training and more time to carry out their roles and help them provide better assistance to women veterans in accessing VA\u2019s health care system and obtaining care. In an effort to make them more effective in this role, in 1994, VA implemented a national training program designed to increase women veterans coordinators\u2019 awareness of their roles and familiarize them with women veterans\u2019 issues. The program is administered by a full-time women veterans\u2019 national education coordinator and staff at the Birmingham Regional Medical Education Center. In addition, the women veterans coordinators at VA\u2019s medical centers in Tampa and Bay Pines developed a mini-residency training program for women veterans coordinators. This program, approved in 1995, is the only training program of its kind and is offered for newly appointed women veterans coordinators.", "To allow women veterans coordinators more time to perform their duties, in 1994, VA established positions for additional full-time women veteran coordinators at selected VA medical centers and four full-time VBA regional women veterans coordinators. As of January 1998, about 40 percent of the women veterans coordinators in VA medical facilities were full-time.

Female patients had to compete with patients in isolation units for the limited number of private rooms in VA hospitals. Also, hospitals with communal bathrooms sometimes required staff to stand guard or use signs indicating that the bathroom was occupied by female patients.", "As required by section 322 of the Veterans\u2019 Health Care Eligibility Reform Act of 1996, VA conducted nationwide privacy surveys of its facilities in fiscal years 1997 and 1998 to determine the types and magnitude of privacy deficiencies that may interfere with appropriate treatment in clinical areas. The surveys revealed numerous patient privacy deficiencies in both inpatient and outpatient settings. The fiscal year 1998 survey also showed that 117 facilities from all 22 Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN) spent nearly $68 million in construction funds in fiscal year 1998 to correct privacy deficiencies. Another 91 facilities from 20 of the 22 VISNs used a total of 130 alternatives to construction to eliminate deficiencies. These alternatives included actions such as initiating policy changes that would admit female patients only to those areas of the hospital that have the appropriate facilities or issuing policy statements that gynecological examinations would only be performed in the women\u2019s clinics or contracted out. In addition, VISN and medical center staff developed plans for correcting and monitoring the remaining deficiencies.", "Although the 1998 survey showed that VA has improved the health care environment to afford women patients comfort and a feeling of security, the survey also revealed that many deficiencies still exist.

Further, VA plans to assess the progress made in correcting patient privacy deficiencies on an annual basis between fiscal years 1999 and 2001. VA requires that each facility have a plan for corrective action and a timetable for completion; VA has also directed each VISN to integrate the planned corrections into their construction programs.", "To correct the remaining deficiencies, VA projects it will spend $49.3 million in fiscal year 1999 and $41 million in fiscal year 2000. Over this same period, medical centers are estimated to spend approximately $647,000 more in discretionary funds to make some of these corrections. Beyond fiscal year 2000, VA projects it will spend an additional $77 million in capital funds; six facilities in VISNs 6 and 7 account for 58 percent of the total projected spending for beyond fiscal year 2000."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Task Force Is Assessing VA\u2019s Ability to Provide Inpatient Psychiatric Care to Women Veterans", "paragraphs": ["While correcting privacy deficiencies has allowed VA to better accommodate women veterans\u2019 health care needs, VA faces other problems accommodating women veterans who need inpatient mental health treatment.

In 1997, VA\u2019s Center for Women Veterans reported that women veterans hospitalized on VA mental health wards for post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, or other psychiatric diagnoses are often the only female on a ward with 30 to 40 males. This disparate ratio of women to men discourages women from discussing gender-specific issues and also makes it difficult to provide group therapy addressing women\u2019s treatment issues. Women veterans also noted that they were concerned about their safety in this environment. These concerns included male patients engaging in inappropriate remarks or behavior and inappropriate levels of privacy. During our site visits, two women veterans expressed similar concerns.", "VA has inpatient psychiatric facilities that have separate psychiatric units for women veterans within five areas: Battle Creek, Michigan; Brockton-West Roxbury, Massachusetts; Central Texas Health Care System; Brecksville-Cleveland, Ohio; and Palo Alto, California, Health Care System. Women veterans often do not want to or are unable to leave families and support systems to travel to one of these facilities for treatment. Staff at one of the medical centers we visited in Florida told us that a few of their women patients who had been sexually traumatized would be better served in an inpatient setting, but the nearest suitable inpatient facilities were those in California and Ohio, and the patients did not want to go that far from home."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Availability and Use of Services Have Increased for Women Veterans", "paragraphs": ["VA\u2019s greater emphasis on women veterans\u2019 health has resulted in an increase in both the availability and use of general and gender-specific services, such as pap smears, mammograms, and reproductive health care.

As a result, VA began to place more emphasis on women veterans\u2019 health and looked for ways to respond to these criticisms.", "For example, to ensure equity of access and treatment, VA designated women veterans\u2019 health as a special emphasis program that merited focused attention. In 1983, VA began requiring medical centers to develop written plans that show how they will meet the health care needs of women veterans. At a minimum, these plans must define (1) that a complete physical examination for women is to include a breast and gynecological exam, (2) provisions for inpatient and outpatient gynecology services, and (3) referral procedures for necessary services unavailable at VA facilities.", "VA also procured the necessary equipment and supplies to treat women. In addition, VA established separate clinics for women veterans in some of its medical facilities. The locations with separate women\u2019s clinics that we visited had written plans that contained the required information and the necessary equipment and supplies to provide gender-specific treatment to women. Also, we found evidence that women veterans coordinators were monitoring services provided to ensure proper care and follow-up.", "VA is more able to accommodate women patients than they were prior to the early 1990s. In 1997, VA provided inhouse 94 percent of the routine gynecological care sought by women veterans, even though its number of women\u2019s clinics fell from 126 in 1994 to 96 in 1998. Some VA facilities closed their women\u2019s clinics because of consolidation or implementation of primary care. Others are phasing their women\u2019s programs into primary care, especially the facilities that had limited services available in the women\u2019s clinic. This is consistent with VA\u2019s efforts to enhance the efficiency of its health care system.

Generally, these centers have full-time providers who may also be supported by other clinicians who provide specialty care on a part-time basis. For example, the Tampa Women Veterans\u2019 Comprehensive Health Center, which provided care to about 3,000 women in 1997, is run by a full-time internist, who is supported by another internist, four nurse practitioner primary care providers, a gynecologist, a psychologist, a psychiatrist, and other health care and administrative support staff. The Tampa center as well as the Boston center provide their services 5 days a week.", "Other facilities offer less extensive services than those offered within the comprehensive centers. For example, the VA medical center in Washington, D.C., offers only routine or preventive gender-specific care by a nurse practitioner about 4.5 days a week; acute or more specialized gynecological care is only offered one-half day a week with the assistance of a gynecologist and general surgeon through a sharing agreement with a local Department of Defense facility.

Other centers, however, offer services on a more limited basis. For example, the nonhospital-based clinic associated with one of the medical centers we visited only offers gynecological services once a week. According to the women veterans coordinator, the average waiting time to get a gynecology appointment at this clinic is 51 days. She explained that if the situation is urgent, arrangements are made to have the patient seen in the urgent care clinic or at the medical center.", "Variation in services at VA medical facilities may be attributable to one or more factors, such as medical center management\u2019s views on the level of services needed, funding, staffing, and demand for services. The specific services offered and the manner in which they are delivered within VA facilities are left to the discretion of medical center or VISN management. Most VA facilities did not receive additional funding to establish health care programs for women and had to provide these additional services while maintaining or minimally affecting existing programs. Initially, VHA provided additional funding for the comprehensive centers, which was supplemented by funds from the medical center\u2019s budget. VHA also provided some additional funding in 1994 to help VA facilities obtain resources to counsel women veterans who had been sexually traumatized.", "The women veterans coordinators at the five medical center locations we visited told us that the medical center directors have a strong commitment to providing quality health care to women veterans and that without such support, it would be difficult to meet women veterans\u2019 needs or improve the women\u2019s health program. Some women\u2019s programs had to be established and operated using the medical center\u2019s existing funding and resources, which included no provisions for these services. Although the Tampa and Boston centers received VHA funding to establish a comprehensive health center, they still had to obtain additional funding from the medical center, which required management\u2019s support.", "The availability of gender-specific services may also be influenced by the demand for these services. At two locations we visited, the women veterans coordinators told us that when they first opened their women\u2019s clinics, they operated on a very limited scale\u2014one-half to 1 day a week. However, the demand was so overwhelming that they increased their operations to 5 days a week. On the other hand, the women veterans population in some areas is small and may not generate a high enough demand for gender-specific services to provide them in a separate women veterans\u2019 health care program or within the medical center on a full-time basis. In such instances or if a very small number of female veterans have historically availed themselves of the services, it may not be cost-effective to provide these services in-house, as pointed out by VA\u2019s OIG in 1993.Instead, it may be appropriate to contract out for these services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Women Veterans\u2019 Use of Health Services Has Increased", "paragraphs": ["In the 1990s, women veterans\u2019 utilization of gender-specific services has increased significantly.
