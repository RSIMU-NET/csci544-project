From fiscal years 2002 through 2008, USAID's A&A obligations increased from about $5 billion to about $11 billion. A&A staff--contracting officers (COs) and A&A specialists--are primarily responsible for managing A&A instruments. This testimony is based on a September 2008 GAO report that examined USAID's capacity to develop and implement a strategic A&A workforce plan and the extent to which USAID has implemented a mechanism to evaluate its A&A function."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["USAID lacks the capacity to develop and implement a strategic A&A workforce plan because it is missing two elements: (1) sufficiently reliable and up-to-date data on its overseas A&A staff levels and (2) comprehensive information on the competencies of its overseas A&A staff. Data on the numbers of overseas A&A specialists collected by two USAID offices were unreliable or out of date. GAO found significant discrepancies between these offices' data sets and officials acknowledged that their A&A staff level data are neither reliable nor up-to-date. Also, USAID has not collected comprehensive competency information on its overseas A&A specialists. GAO's model of strategic workforce planning notes the importance of these data in developing a plan that could enable the agency to better match staff levels to changing workloads. During fieldwork at 7 USAID missions, GAO found that the numbers and competencies of A&A staff did not match A&A workloads at some missions. The numbers of A&A staff with the needed competencies were less than adequate at some missions, while at others they were more than adequate. For example, officials at the mission in Mali said they had delayed time-sensitive projects because key A&A staff were not available when needed to approve contracts, while officials at the mission in Peru said the current number of A&A staff may be more than adequate. In GAO's survey administered to USAID A&A staff in headquarters and overseas, most of the survey respondents overseas reported difficulty in altering staffing patterns to meet A&A workloads. USAID's efforts to address its A&A workforce issues do not constitute a strategic A&A workforce plan that takes into account the entire A&A workforce. Without accurate and reliable A&A staff data, USAID does not have adequate information to address current workload imbalances. USAID has not implemented an evaluation mechanism to provide oversight of its A&A function. The Evaluation Division in the Office of Acquisition and Assistance is responsible for providing this oversight to ensure that A&A operations follow USAID policies, primarily by assessing A&A operations worldwide. In fiscal year 2007, the division developed an evaluation mechanism that combines scorecard evaluations, in which COs self-assess their A&A operations, and onsite visits by division staff to selected locations based on the scorecard results and other factors. The division has completed scorecard evaluations at 4 missions and identified weaknesses in A&A operations. For example, the division found that one mission lacked resources to adequately monitor contractor performance. The division has set a goal of implementing this evaluation mechanism, including on-site visits to 5 missions within a 2-year period. However, according to agency officials, the division did not have the staff level needed to fully implement this evaluation mechanism. The division has increased its staff levels from 4 staff in fiscal year 2008 to 9 staff as of April 2009 and completed two more evaluations. However, USAID officials told us that OAA has not implemented the evaluation mechanism due to other priorities. As a result, USAID cannot certify the adequacy and effectiveness of management controls for the A&A function."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here to discuss the management challenges currently  facing the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) in  developing and implementing a strategic acquisition and assistance (A&A)  workforce plan. This hearing is of particular importance given that USAID  is primarily responsible for managing U.S. humanitarian and development  assistance efforts worldwide, and its total foreign assistance obligations  has more than doubled from about $5 billion in fiscal year 2002 to about  $11 billion in fiscal year 2008.", "Over the last few decades, as the U.S. government has increasingly come  to rely on the private sector to perform various functions, USAID has  shifted from conducting its own activities to managing A&A instruments,  which are awarded to and implemented by nongovernmental  organizations. For example, as we noted in previous work, USAID and  other government agencies have increasingly relied on contractors in  Afghanistan and Iraq to carry out their missions. USAID staff are  responsible for monitoring the activities of A&A recipients to provide  reasonable assurance that the funds provided are used in accordance with  applicable regulations and policies and sound business practices. These  staff include contracting officers (CO)\u2014assisted by A&A specialists\u2014who  have primary responsibility for managing A&A instruments. In  headquarters, these staff are part of USAID\u2019s Office of Acquisition and  Assistance (OAA); abroad, they are part of USAID\u2019s missions. Cognizant  technical officers (CTO), who work in USAID functional or geographic  bureaus or overseas missions, also design and manage assistance  activities. In addition, they share some of the responsibility of managing  A&A instruments.", "My testimony today is based on a report we issued on September 26, 2008.  I will focus on three topics. First, I will discuss USAID\u2019s capacity to  develop and implement a strategic A&A workforce plan. Second, I will  describe the extent to which USAID has implemented a mechanism to  evaluate its A&A function. Finally, I will summarize our recent  recommendations regarding the importance of a workforce plan for the  A&A function, as well as the actions that USAID has taken in response to  our reported findings and recommendations.", "In preparing this testimony, we largely relied on our September 2008  report and additional information provided by USAID in April 2009 on the  management of USAID\u2019s A&A function. To address our objectives, we  focused on USAID\u2019s administration of the A&A process. We analyzed  USAID\u2019s documents related to the A&A function; conducted audit work at  USAID headquarters in Washington, D.C., as well as at missions in  Cambodia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Mali, Peru, and  Thailand; conducted interviews with USAID and nongovernmental  organization officials; and administered a survey to USAID A&A staff in  headquarters and overseas, for which we received a response rate of 95  percent\u2014150 respondents out of a total of 158 surveyed. Both our prior  and current performance audits were conducted in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards. These standards  require that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings, conclusions, and  recommendations based on our audit objectives.

Its A&A staff provide professional advice and  technical support to USAID\u2019s functional and geographic bureaus for  developing and managing A&A instruments. USAID A&A staff at overseas  missions provide advice and support to mission staff who design and  manage assistance activities; they also have overall responsibility for the  administration of A&A instruments at overseas missions. A&A offices are  typically headed by a CO who reports to the mission director or deputy  mission director. At most bilateral missions, COs are co-located with A&A  specialists and CTOs. However, under USAID\u2019s regional mission structure,  COs often provide A&A support to more than one mission and are not  necessarily co-located with either the CTOs or the A&A specialists who  assist them. Some missions with no on-site CO may instead have on-site  A&A specialists who provide A&A support to CTOs.

We found several such examples, including the following:    A CO at the regional mission in Thailand said that she sometimes could  not address some missions\u2019 needs in a timely manner because of  competing workload demands. Staff at Cambodia, one of the missions for  which the regional mission provides A&A support, told us that at times  they have not received adequate A&A support, primarily due to a decline  in A&A specialist staff levels as well as the inexperience of the mission\u2019s  one remaining on-site A&A specialist.

For example, about 70 percent of A&A respondents  overseas reported that it was somewhat or very difficult to alter staffing  patterns to meet the demands of changing workloads. Most notably, one  respondent reported a disparity between the workload, numbers, and  competencies of A&A staff levels at the missions to which she was  previously and currently assigned. While the respondent found the  workload to be less manageable at her prior mission with inexperienced  A&A staff, she found the workload at her current mission more easily  manageable because it had more experienced A&A staff.", "In contrast, we noted that two missions we visited\u2014Peru and Indonesia\u2014 had more than adequate numbers of A&A staff with the necessary  competencies to manage their workload. Some staff even indicated to us  that these missions may not need all of their assigned COs to adequately  manage their A&A work. For example, a CO at the mission in Peru told us  that because the mission had so many experienced or competent A&A  staff, the A&A workload was more easily managed, and staff even had  sufficient time to volunteer the mission as a location for USAID to pilot a  new system through which USAID A&A instruments will be awarded."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "USAID\u2019s Recent Planning Efforts Do Not Comprehensively Address Its Strategic A&A Workforce Planning Needs", "paragraphs": ["USAID has launched some ad hoc attempts to address its A&A workforce  issues.
