However, the flexibility also came at the expense of transparency and accountability. For example, unlike certain other Department of Defense (DOD) major defense acquisition programs, a cost, schedule, and performance baseline does not have to be established or approved outside MDA. In addition, while most major defense acquisition programs are required by statute to obtain an independent verification of cost estimates, MDA has only recently developed cost estimates for selected assets and plans to work with DOD's Office of the Director for Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation to develop independent cost estimates for more MDA elements. Further, assessments of a system's suitability and effectiveness in combat have only been accomplished, with limitations, for the currently deployed Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense weapon system. Since its inception, MDA has employed at least three different strategies to acquire and deploy missile defense systems. Because these changes involved different structures for reporting cost, schedule, and performance data, they have exacerbated transparency and accountability challenges--each time a strategy changes, the connection between the old and new strategy planned scope and resources is obscured. In 2010, MDA made significant progress in addressing previously reported concerns about transparency and accountability. Specifically, MDA : (1) Established resource, schedule, test, operational capacity, technical, and contract baselines for several missile defense systems. It reported these to Congress in its June 2010 BMDS Accountability Report. (2) Identified three phases of development where baselines are approved-- technology development, product development, and initial production phases--and specified the key knowledge that is needed at each phase. (3) Established processes for reviewing baselines and approving product development and initial production jointly with the military services that will ultimately be responsible for those assets. GAO also reported last year that MDA extensively revised the test plan to increase its robustness and ability to inform models and simulations for assessing missile defense performance. While it is clear that progress has been made in terms of implementing new acquisition reviews and reporting detailed baselines, there remain critical gaps in the material reported, particularly the quality of the underlying cost estimates needed to establish baselines. Moreover, GAO still has concerns about realism in test planning and acquisition risks associated with the rapid pace of fielding assets. These risks are particularly evident in MDA's efforts to develop systems to support a new approach for missile defense in Europe as well as the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system. GAO does not make new recommendations in this testimony but emphasizes the importance of implementing past recommendations, including: (1) Establishing and reporting complete, accurate, reliable cost information. (2) Strengthening test planning and resourcing. (3) Following knowledge-based acquisition practices that ensure sufficient knowledge is attained on requirements, technology maturity, design maturity, production maturity and costs before moving programs into more complex and costly phases of development. DOD has committed to take action on many of our recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the transparency and  accountability progress made by the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD)  Missile Defense Agency (MDA). MDA has been charged with developing  and fielding the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), a system  expected to be capable of defending the United States, deployed troops,  friends, and allies against ballistic missiles of all ranges in all phases of  flight. The BMDS is DOD\u2019s single largest acquisition program\u2014spending  between approximately $7 billion to $9.5 billion per year \u2013 to develop and  field nine elements and supporting efforts. The system\u2019s architecture  includes space-based and airborne sensors as well as ground- and sea- based radars; ground- and sea-based interceptor missiles; and a command  and control, battle management, and communications system to provide  the warfighter with the necessary communication links to the sensors and  interceptor missiles.", "In fulfilling this charge, MDA began delivering an initial defensive  capability in 2004. In meeting this challenge, MDA was afforded much  more flexibility than DOD\u2019s other major weapons programs. However, this  flexibility also introduced transparency and accountability challenges that  persisted after the 2004 date for initial capability. Today, I will highlight  significant progress that MDA has recently made to strengthen  accountability and transparency and also the shortfalls that still need to be  addressed in order to further strengthen MDA\u2019s oversight posture and  ensure new capabilities are fiscally sustainable for the long term.", "Since 2002, the National Defense Authorization Acts have mandated that  we prepare annual assessments of MDA\u2019s ongoing cost, schedule, testing,  and performance progress. In March 2011, we issued our report covering  MDA\u2019s progress toward achieving its goals during fiscal year 2010 as well  as its efforts to improve transparency, accountability, and oversight. My  statement today will focus on the issues covered in that report. We  conducted this performance audit from March 2010 to March 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

Application of  many of these laws is triggered by the phases of the Department of  Defense\u2019s acquisition cycle, such as entry into engineering and  manufacturing development. Specifically, major defense acquisition  programs are generally required by law and policy to do the following:   \uf0b7  Document program parameters in an acquisition program baseline  that, as implemented by DOD, has been approved by the Milestone  Decision Authority, a higher-level DOD official prior to the  program\u2019s entry into the engineering and manufacturing  development phase. The baseline provides decision makers with  the program\u2019s best estimate of the program\u2019s total cost for an  increment of work, average unit costs for assets to be delivered,  the date that an operational capability will be fielded, and the  weapon\u2019s intended performance parameters.   \uf0b7  Once approved, measure the program against the baseline, which  is the program\u2019s initial business case, or obtain the approval of a  higher-level acquisition executive before making changes.   \uf0b7  Obtain an independent life-cycle cost estimate prior to beginning  engineering and manufacturing development, and/or production  and deployment. Independent life-cycle cost estimates provide  confidence that a program is executable within estimated cost.  \uf0b7  Regularly provide detailed program status information to Congress,  including information on cost, in Selected Acquisition Reports.   \uf0b7  Report certain increases in unit cost measured from the original or  current program baseline.  \uf0b7  Covered major defense acquisition programs and subprograms are  required to complete initial operation test and evaluation before  proceeding beyond low-rate initial production. After testing is  completed, the Director for Operational Test and Evaluation  assesses whether the results of the test confirm that the system or  components are effective and suitable for combat.", "When MDA was established in 2002, it was granted exceptional flexibility  in setting requirements and managing the acquisition, in order that its  BMDS be developed as a single program, using a capabilities-based, spiral  upgrade approach to quickly deliver a set of integrated defensive  capabilities. This decision deferred application of DOD acquisition policy  to BMDS until a mature capability is ready to be handed over to a military  service for production and operation. Because the BMDS program has not  formally entered the DOD acquisition cycle, application of laws that are  designed to facilitate oversight and accountability of DOD acquisition  programs and that are triggered by phases of this cycle, such as the  engineering and manufacturing development phase, has also effectively  been deferred. This gives MDA unique latitude to manage the BMDS and it  enabled MDA to begin delivering an initial defensive capability in 2004.  However, the flexibility also came at the expense of transparency and  accountability.", "Specifically, a BMDS cost, schedule, and performance baseline does not  have to be established or approved by anyone outside MDA. Recent laws  have created some baseline-related requirements for parts of the BMDS.  In addition, while most major defense acquisition programs are required  by statute to obtain an independent verification of cost estimates, MDA  has only recently developed cost estimates for selected assets and plans to  work with the DOD Office of the Director for Cost Assessment and  Program Evaluation to develop independent cost estimates for more MDA  elements.  Further, assessments of a system\u2019s suitability and effectiveness  in combat have only been accomplished, with limitations, for the currently  deployed Aegis BMD weapon system. The limited amount of testing  completed, which has been primarily developmental in nature, and the  lack of verified, validated, and accredited models and simulations prevent  the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation from fully assessing the  effectiveness, suitability, and survivability of the BMDS in annual  assessments. MDA has agreed to conduct an operational flight test in 2012.", "As we concluded in a prior report, having less transparency and  accountability than is normally present in a major weapon program has  had consequences.  The lack of baselines for the BMDS along with high  levels of uncertainty about requirements and program cost estimates  effectively set the missile defense program on a path to an undefined  destination at an unknown cost. Across the agency, these practices left  programs with limited knowledge and few opportunities for crucial  management oversight and decision making concerning the agency\u2019s  investment and the warfighter\u2019s continuing needs. At the program level,  these practices contributed to quality problems affecting targets  acquisitions, which in turn, hampered MDA\u2019s ability to conduct tests as  planned."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Numerous Strategy Changes Have Exacerbated Transparency and Accountability Challenges", "paragraphs": ["MDA has employed at least three strategies to acquire and deploy missile  defense systems, which has exacerbated transparency and accountability  challenges. From its inception in 2002 through 2007, MDA developed  missile defense capability in 2-year increments, known as blocks, each  built on preceding blocks intended to enhance the development and  capability of the BMDS. However, there was little visibility into baseline  costs and schedules associated with the systems that comprised the  blocks or how the blocks addressed particular threats.", "In response to our recommendations, in December 2007, MDA announced  a new capabilities-based block structure intended to improve the  program\u2019s transparency, accountability, and oversight. Instead of being  based on 2-year time periods, the new blocks focused on fielding  capabilities that addressed particular threats. Because the new block  structure was not aligned to regular time periods, multiple blocks were  under way concurrently. This approach included several positive changes,  including a DOD commitment to establish total acquisition costs and unit  costs for selected block assets, including only those elements or  components of elements in a block that would be fielded during the block  and abandoning deferrals of work from one block to another.", "MDA was still transitioning to this new capabilities-based block approach  when the Director, MDA terminated it in June 2009. According to MDA,  this was done in order to address congressional concerns regarding how  to structure MDA\u2019s budget justification materials. This termination marked  the third acquisition management strategy for the BMDS in the prior 3  years and effectively reduced transparency and accountability for the  agency. The agency then began to manage BMDS as a single integrated  program but planned to report on cost, schedule, and performance issues  by each element within the program.", "Changing the acquisition strategy is problematic because each time it is  changed, the connection is obscured between the old strategies\u2019 scope and  resources and the new strategy\u2019s rearranged scope and resources. This  makes it difficult for decision makers to hold MDA accountable for  expected outcomes and clouds transparency of the agency\u2019s efforts.", "We also reported in December 2010 that the adoption of the European  Phase Adaptive Approach (PAA) for deploying missile defense assets has  limitations in transparency and accountability. Specifically, we reported  that DOD made progress in acquisition planning for technology  development and systems engineering and testing and partial progress in  defining requirements and identifying stakeholders but had not yet  developed a European PAA acquisition decision schedule or an overall  European PAA investment cost. We found that the limited visibility into  the costs and schedule for the European PAA and the lack of some key  acquisition management processes reflect the oversight challenges with  the acquisition of missile defense capabilities that we have previously  reported. We concluded that for the European PAA, the flexibility desired  by DOD is not incompatible with appropriate visibility into key aspects of  acquisition management.  Moreover, as DOD proceeds with the European  PAA acquisition activities, it is important for Congress and the President to  have assurance that the European PAA policy is working as intended and  that acquisition activities are cost-effective. We made recommendations  also in January 2011 regarding the development of life-cycle cost estimates  and an integrated schedule for the acquisition, infrastructure and  personnel activities to help identify European PAA implementation risks.

The GMD consists of a ground-based interceptor\u2014a  booster with an Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle on top\u2014and a fire  control system that receives target information from sensors in  order to formulate a battle plan. GMD continues to deliver assets  before testing has fully determined their capabilities and  limitations. The Director, MDA testified on March 31, 2011 that he  considers the GMD interceptors essentially prototypes. In the  urgency to deploy assets to meet the Presidential directive to field  an initial capability by 2004, assets were built and deployed before  developmental testing was completed. During the ongoing  developmental testing, issues were found that led to a need for  retrofits. GMD intercept tests conducted to date have already led  to major hardware or software changes to the interceptors\u2014not all of which have been verified through flight testing. In addition,  manufacturing of a new variant called the Capability Enhancement  II is well underway and more than half of those variants have  already been delivered although their capability has not been  validated through developmental flight tests. To date, the two f tests utilizing this variant have both failed to intercept the target.  According to MDA, as a result of the most recent failure in  December 2010, deliveries of this variant have been halted. Again,  because of the urgency to deploy some capability, limited work  was undertaken on long-term sustainment for the system which is  critical to ensure the system remains effective through 2032.
