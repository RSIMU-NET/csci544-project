To do this, GAO assessed the inventories of the 24 CFO Act agencies against four key practices and selected six agencies\u2014the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, Labor, and NASA and NSF\u2014due to their IT spending, among other factors, to determine whether they had processes addressing applications."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Most of the 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 agencies in the review fully met at least three of the four practices GAO identified to determine if agencies had complete software application inventories. To be considered complete, an inventory should (1) include business and enterprise information technology (IT) systems as defined by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); (2) include these systems from all organizational components; (3) specify application name, description, owner, and function supported; and (4) be regularly updated. Of the 24 agencies, 4 (the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, and Justice, and the General Services Administration) fully met all four practices, 9 fully met three practices, 6 fully met two practices, 2 fully met one practice, and 3 did not fully meet any practice (see figure).", "A January 2016 OMB requirement to complete an IT asset inventory by the end of May 2016 contributed to most of the agencies fully meeting the first three practices. Agencies that did not fully address these practices stated, among other things, their focus on major and high risk investments as a reason for not having complete inventories. However, not accounting for all applications may result in missed opportunities to identify savings and efficiencies. It is also inconsistent with OMB guidance regarding implementation of IT acquisition reform law, referred to as the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act, which requires that Chief Information Officers at covered agencies have increased visibility into all IT resources. Not accounting for all applications also presents a security risk since agencies can only secure assets if they are aware of them.", "Each of the six selected agencies relied on their investment management processes and, in some cases, supplemental processes to rationalize their applications to varying degrees. However, five of the six agencies acknowledged that their processes did not always allow for collecting or reviewing the information needed to effectively rationalize all their applications. The sixth agency, the National Science Foundation (NSF), stated its processes allow it to effectively rationalize its applications, but agency documentation supporting this assertion was incomplete. Only one agency\u2014the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)\u2014had plans to address shortcomings.

In a memorandum issued in  March 2013, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) advocated the  use of application rationalization\u2014streamlining the portfolio with the goal  of improving efficiency, reducing complexity and redundancy, and  lowering the cost of ownership. Through this process agencies can  identify duplicative, wasteful, and low-value applications and identify  opportunities for savings.", "You asked us to review federal agencies\u2019 efforts to rationalize their  portfolio of applications. Our objectives were to determine (1) whether  agencies have established complete application inventories and (2) to  what extent selected agencies have developed and implemented  processes for rationalizing their portfolio of applications. For consistency,  we defined applications as those commodity IT assets associated with  enterprise IT systems and business systems commodity IT categories  identified in OMB guidance.", "To address the first objective, we identified four practices for establishing  complete inventories. We derived them primarily from our guide for  assessing the reliability of computer-processed data and best practices  identified in our 2014 report on federal software licenses. These practices  are (1) including the business and enterprise IT systems defined by OMB,  (2) including systems from all organizational components, (3) specifying  basic application attributes\u2014namely application name, description,  owner, and function supported\u2014, and (4) regularly updating the inventory  with quality controls to ensure the reliability of the data in the inventory.  The 24 Chief Financial Officers (CFO) Act of 1990 agencies provided us  with their software application inventories. We analyzed the inventories,  reviewed documentation, and interviewed agency staff to determine the  extent to which agencies implemented the practices we identified.", "To address the second objective, we selected six agencies\u2014the  Departments of Defense (DOD), Homeland Security (DHS), Labor  (Labor), and the Interior (Interior); the National Aeronautics and Space  Administration (NASA); and National Science Foundation (NSF). We  selected them based on their fiscal year 2015 IT spending\u2014we selected  two large agencies, two medium agencies, and two small agencies\u2014and  whether they claimed to have an application rationalization process. We  also included agencies recognized for effective rationalization efforts  based on our research and OMB observations. We identified a set of  common application rationalization practices, reviewed documentation,  and interviewed agency officials to determine whether the agencies had  processes addressing these practices.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2015 to September 2016  in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that  the evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. See appendix I for a more  detailed discussion of our objectives, scope, and methodology."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In March 2012, OMB launched the PortfolioStat initiative which required  agencies to conduct an annual review of their commodity IT portfolio to,  among other things, achieve savings by identifying opportunities to  consolidate investments or move to shared services. For PortfolioStat,  OMB defined broad categories of commodity IT: enterprise IT systems, which include e-mail, identity and access  management, IT security, web infrastructure, and collaboration tools; business systems, which include finance, human resources, and other  IT infrastructure, which includes data centers, networks, desktop  computers, and mobile devices.", "Of those categories, the first two include software applications, which are  software components and supporting software hosted on an operating  system that create, use, modify, share, or store data in order to enable a  business or mission function to be performed. This includes custom,  commercial off-the-shelf, government off-the-shelf, or open-sourced  software. The memorandum establishing the PortfolioStat initiative also  required agencies to develop a commodity IT baseline including the  number, types, and costs of investments for all commodity IT categories.", "In a subsequent memorandum, OMB advocated the use of application  rationalization to inform data center optimization efforts. Application  rationalization is the process of streamlining the portfolio to improve  efficiency, reduce complexity and redundancy, and lower the cost of  ownership. It can be done by retiring aging and low-value applications,  modernizing aging and high-value applications, eliminating redundant  applications, standardizing on common technology platform and version  (as is the case for moving to shared services), or consolidating  applications. OMB stated in its memorandum that application  rationalization would be a focus of PortfolioStat sessions and required  agencies to describe their approach to maturing the IT portfolio, including  rationalizing applications, in the information resource management plans  and enterprise roadmaps that are required to be updated annually.", "In December 2014, the law commonly referred to as the Federal  Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) was enacted  and required covered executive branch agencies (except for DOD) to  ensure that Chief Information Officers (CIO) have a significant role in the  decision making process for IT budgeting, as well as the management,  governance, and oversight processes related to IT. The act also required  that CIOs (in each covered agency except DOD) review and approve (1)  all contracts for IT services prior to their execution and (2) the  appointment of any other employee with the title of CIO, or who functions  in the capacity of a CIO, for any component organization within the  agency. OMB issued guidance in June 2015 that reinforces the  importance of agency CIOs and describes how agencies are to  implement the law.", "In that same memorandum, OMB changed PortfolioStat from being an  annual review session to quarterly reviews including a discussion of  portfolio optimization efforts and focus on commodity IT. Specifically, the  memorandum stated that agencies are to discuss how they use category  management to consolidate commodity IT assets; eliminate duplication  between assets; and improve procurement and management of  hardware, software, network, and telecom services during the sessions.  Furthermore, agencies are to share lessons-learned related to commodity  IT procurement policies and efforts to establish enterprise-wide  inventories of related information. The memorandum also specified key  responsibilities for CIOs\u2014including having increased visibility into all IT  resources\u2014and required agencies to develop plans to implement these  responsibilities by December 2015.", "Further, during the course of our review, in January 2016, OMB updated  guidance to agencies requiring that they provide information regarding  their IT asset inventories when making integrated data collection  submissions. The guidance required agencies to provide a preliminary  inventory by the end of February 2016 and a complete IT asset inventory,  including information on systems, sub-systems, and applications by the  end of May 2016 to OMB.", "Finally, federal law and guidance specify requirements for protecting  federal information and systems. Specifically, the Federal Information  Security Management Act (FISMA)  of 2002, among other things,  requires agencies to maintain and update an inventory of major  information systems at least annually, and the National Institute of  Standards and Technology specifies that this should include an accurate  inventory of software components, including the software applications  which are the subject of our review. OMB plays a key role in monitoring  and overseeing agencies\u2019 security activities and their FISMA  implementation.

Twenty had partially complete inventories and two did not  have any inventory. We recommended that agencies complete their  inventories. We also recommended that OMB issue a directive to help  guide agencies in managing licenses and that the 24 agencies improve  their policies and practices for managing licenses. In June 2016, OMB  issued a memorandum that is intended to improve agencies\u2019 acquisition  and management of enterprise software, consistent with our May 2014  recommendation.

The agency fully met the first practice  because its inventory includes enterprise IT and business systems,  with the exception of very small systems. In addition, it included  applications from all offices and regions in the organization. The  agency partially met the practice for including application attributes in  the inventory because, although it identifies the application name, and  description, component managing the applications, and the business  function associated with its applications, it does not identify the  business function for every application. Officials stated that they are  working to have this information populated for all applications.  Lastly,  the agency fully met the fourth practice of regularly updating the  inventory because it has processes to update its inventory through the  agency\u2019s software life cycle management procedure and provided  evidence of the annual data call issued by the CIO to ensure that the  inventory is current.", "The U.S. Agency for International Development fully met two  practices and partially met two. Specifically, the agency\u2019s inventory  includes business and enterprise IT systems and the inventory  includes basic application attributes. However, the agency\u2019s inventory  does not include systems from all organizational components because  officials stated that coordination and communication in the  geographically-widespread agency is difficult. In addition, the agency  has processes for updating its inventory; however, it relies on manual  processes to maintain it.", "The Department of Transportation partially met all four practices.", "While the department\u2019s inventory for the common operating  environment includes all business and enterprise IT systems and its  inventory of applications includes business systems, the inventory of  applications does not include all enterprise IT systems. Furthermore,  both of its inventories do not include applications used by all of its  components. Specifically, the inventory does not include applications  used by the Federal Highway, Federal Railroad, and Federal Transit  Administrations, among others, and the inventory for its common  operating environment does not include applications used by the  Federal Aviation Administration. The department also partially met the  practice of including basic application attributes because, although the  department\u2019s inventory includes these attributes, its common  operating environment does not provide the business function that the  applications support. Further, while the Department of Transportation  has a process for its partners to provide information on its individual  inventories in order to update the inventory of applications, it does not  have processes in place to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the  reported information, and thus partially met this practice.", "Regarding the four practices, the majority of the agencies fully met the  practices of including business systems and enterprise IT system;  including these systems from all organizational components; and  specifying the application name, description, owner, and business  function supported. Only five agencies fully met the practice of regularly  updating the inventory and implementing quality controls for ensuring the  reliability of the inventory data because they provided evidence of  performing both of these activities. Table 3 shows the number of agencies  who fully met, partially met, and did not meet the practices.", "OMB\u2019s requirement for agencies to complete an IT asset inventory by the  end of May 2016 greatly contributed to most of the agencies including  business systems and enterprise IT systems for all of their organizational  components and specifying key attributes for them. Those agencies that  did not fully address these practices provided various reasons for not  doing so. For example, one agency stated that it has not made its  software application inventory a priority because it has been focusing on  major and high risk investments, while delegating applications to the  component level. Others noted that the lack of automated processes  make collecting complete inventory information difficult. Further, others  noted that it is challenging to capture applications acquired by  components in the department-wide inventory.", "While it is reasonable to expect that priority be given to major and high  risk investments, applications are nevertheless part of the portfolio and  should be accounted for as such.

It is also  inconsistent with OMB guidance for implementing FITARA  which requires  that CIOs have increased visibility into all IT resources.", "In addition, the lack of a comprehensive inventory presents a security  risk. If agencies are not aware of all of their assets, they cannot secure  them, resulting in a vulnerable posture. Given the importance of securing  federal systems and data to ensuring public confidence and the nation\u2019s  safety, prosperity, and well-being, we designated federal information  security as a government-wide high-risk area in 1997. In 2003, we  expanded this area to include computerized systems supporting the  nation\u2019s critical infrastructure.

Based on  common practices identified in technical papers from industry experts, to  effectively perform rationalization, an agency should first establish a  complete inventory of applications. It should then collect and review cost,  technical, and business value information for each application, and use  that information to make rationalization decisions.

Estimated cost savings or avoidances were estimated at  $268,000 in fiscal year 2012 and almost $200,000 per year in fiscal  years 2013 through 2015. In addition, in an effort to improve its  financial management systems, the department has efforts underway  to reduce the number of financial management systems from 327 to  120 by fiscal year 2019.", "However, officials acknowledged that its processes do not address all  applications. Specifically, according to information provided by the  department, about 1,200 enterprise IT and business systems which  are associated with the Enterprise Information Environment Mission  Area are not reviewed by the department\u2014though they are reviewed  by components\u2014because they do not meet the definition of a defense  business system.", "Officials cited several challenges with implementing systematic  rationalization efforts, including the department\u2019s organizational  structure and contractual agreements. As an example, they noted that  the Navy\u2019s Next Generation e-mail system is being procured through  a contract with a particular vendor and as such would be difficult to  consolidate with other department e-mail systems. They also noted  that the cost of collecting additional cost, technical, and business  value information, along with maintaining even more data at greater  granularity, may outweigh the benefits.", "The department does not have plans at this time to further enhance its  processes to rationalize its applications. While we recognize the  challenges and costs that may be associated with systematic  rationalization efforts, the Enterprise Information Environment Mission  Area could be considered as a near-term target for rationalization  given the large number of enterprise IT and business systems  associated with it. Modifying  existing processes to allow for the  collection, review, and evaluation of cost, technical, and business  information of these systems at the department level could help  identify opportunities for savings and efficiencies.", "DHS: DHS has several processes for rationalizing applications. For  example, through its investment management process, portfolios are  regularly assessed against criteria which help identify duplication. In  addition, the department uses its DHS Collaborative Architecture  Methodology in conjunction with its segment architectures to help  identify duplication and fragmentation, at different levels, including at  the application level. The DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act of 2015  mandated the department to report on a strategy for reducing  duplicative IT systems  and the department used the DHS  Collaborative Architecture Methodology process to address this  mandate, including about 700 commodity IT and back-office  applications in the scope of the effort.", "Further, the department recently established an Application Services  Council, chaired by its Enterprise Business Management Office.  According to its charter, the council is a cross-component and cross- disciplined leadership team responsible for developing,  maintaining,  and overseeing the Enterprise Information Technology Services  Portfolio, Lifecycle Governance Model, and Roadmap. It is expected  to take a strategic approach to evaluating existing and future IT  service offerings\u2014including software, platform, and infrastructure  services\u2014and provide a forum to identify strategies, best practices,  processes, and approaches for enterprise IT services, cloud  computing, and shared service challenges. For example, officials  reported the council is currently developing a standard service level  agreement template and guidance, as well as a cloud adoption  strategy. The department also reported other mechanisms related to  rationalization include its Joint Requirements Council, strategic  sourcing initiatives, IT acquisition reviews, and executive-level  portfolio reviews.", "In addition, it reported that it uses its DHS Enterprise Architecture  Information Repository Technical Reference Model to track  application products and software versions\u2014mainly consisting of  commercial off-the-shelf software. The product information is gathered  through the use of continuous network discovery scans.", "Examples of rationalization include the consolidation of learning  management systems and the consolidation of site services, including  help desk operations. The consolidation of learning management  systems was identified through the segment architecture process and  is expected to result in projected savings of 10 to 20 percent in fiscal  year 2016 after transition costs are addressed.

Specifically, officials reported challenges tracking  product level information for deployed applications and difficulty  gaining visibility into all the supporting application products for large  systems. Officials particularly noted they have been challenged to  collect such information and cited a general lack of visibility into the  components\u2019 budget and their spending. They also noted it was not  clear whether there was a good return on investment for the  resources needed to collect additional technical, cost, and business  value data for systematic application rationalization efforts. Officials  reported the department had a financial systems modernization effort  underway which would provide greater visibility into components\u2019  spending but they did not have a plan to address the collection and  review of technical and business value information.", "While we recognize that collecting additional details on all applications  may not be cost-beneficial, the department could consider taking a  segmented approach and initially identify one high-cost function it is  currently not collecting or reviewing detailed cost, technical, and  business information for across the department. It could then modify  existing processes to collect and review this information. These  actions would assist the CIO in gaining visibility into all IT resources  as specified in the OMB implementation guidance for FITARA  and  also help identify additional opportunities for savings and efficiencies.", "NASA:  NASA uses its current investment management process\u2014the  Capital Planning and Investment Control process\u2014and its  configuration management tools\u2014to review its applications.", "NASA reported examples of rationalization resulting in significant  savings according to NASA officials.

In addition, officials stated  that determining application business value is currently subjective to  users because the agency\u2019s process for obtaining this information is  to ask the application owner the impact on the agency if the  application did not exist, whereas application technical health  information is more concrete. Furthermore, NASA officials stated that  there is no systematic process to review applications facing end-of-life  issues due to flat budgets and budget cuts.", "NASA has developed a plan for a supplemental process (the annual  capital investment review process) that is to allow the agency to,  among other things, collect detailed data about its applications. The  agency has begun to implement the plan and has completed the first  milestone of the process, which included conducting a data call to  gather and validate application information provided by the various  centers and agency stakeholders. At the time of our review, NASA  had also performed an initial review and analysis of the information  collected and identified optimization opportunities, including  developing a plan to consolidate, decommission, or invest to achieve  maximum cost efficiencies and process effectiveness across the  application program. Fully implementing the annual capital investment  review process could better position the agency to identify additional  opportunities for savings and efficiencies.", "Interior: As part of its budget formulation process, Interior performs  rationalization through annual reviews of its portfolio of investments  (and supporting applications) against criteria which measure business  value and technical fit.", "Reported examples of application rationalization include Interior\u2019s  cloud e-mail and collaboration services initiative, which consolidated  14 disparate systems into a single enterprise system and achieved a  cost savings/avoidance of $13.56 million, and the consolidation of the  Enterprise eArchive System with the eMail Electronic Records and  Document Management System which resulted in cost  savings/avoidance of $6.1 million.", "However, the department reported that its portfolio review process is  not standardized because it has not been fully defined or established  in policy.

In comments on a draft  of this report, the department noted that it has also yet to document a  plan to implement policy associated with these efforts which they  believe would establish a standard analytical technique for  rationalizing the investment portfolio. Such a plan would also help  secure the commitment needed to carry out planned efforts.", "The department reported several challenges to rationalizing its  applications, including (1) ensuring the quality and accuracy of data  collected since it relies largely on manual processes for collecting  information and (2) the lack of standard portfolio evaluation  techniques to support information resource management decision- making across the department.", "The department has efforts underway which should help address  these challenges. Specifically, it is making changes to its information  resource management governance. According to the department,  these changes, combined with efforts to implement the CIO  responsibilities specified in FITARA, should help to address the  challenges to rationalizing its applications and allow for rationalization  of all applications. However, while the department has defined and  begun to implement criteria to assess whether or not an investment  and its underlying applications are wasteful, low-value, or duplicative,  it has not documented its plan for improving its governance\u2014which,  according the department, would support application rationalization.  Such a plan would help secure the commitment needed to carry out  planned efforts.", "Labor: Similar to the other agencies, the department uses its  investment management process to review the majority of its business  and enterprise IT applications. In addition, officials stated that the  department initiated an enterprise-wide budget formulation and  Information Technology Acquisition Review Board approval function  beginning in fiscal year 2013 which has helped with rationalization.", "Officials stated that their efforts have resulted in rationalization of  commodity applications and on a case-by-case basis the  rationalization of other applications, such as for a case management  platform and an acquisition management system. Additional examples  of application rationalization include the deployment of a web-based  conferencing and collaboration shared service to employees which  resulted in cost avoidance of travel costs of about $2.3 million. The  department also noted benefits of moving to a cloud e-mail solution,  such as saved time and increased user satisfaction.", "However, officials identified weaknesses and challenges with  rationalizing their applications. Specifically, they reported that, in most  cases, IT investments are associated with a group of IT assets,  including applications, and individual application information is  therefore not reviewed, making it difficult to effectively rationalize. In  addition, officials stated that the fact that each bureau-level agency  has had authority and responsibility for managing its own applications  and that the department has over 600 locations present challenges.  Further, though senior officials including the CIO, agreed with the  benefits of rationalization, they did not have any plans to rationalize.  They questioned the value of developing such plans stating that (1)  maintaining mission critical applications and the department\u2019s aging  infrastructure are current priorities and (2) funding may not be  available to implement rationalization plans. While we agree that  mission critical applications should be given priority, rationalizing  mission support applications, including enterprise IT and business  systems, could result in solutions which allow agencies to focus more  on mission capabilities and at the same time generate savings which  could be reinvested. As we noted for DHS, the department could  consider taking a segmented approach to further rationalize and  identify a function for which it could modify existing processes to  collect and review detailed application cost, technical, and business  value information.", "NSF: NSF also uses its investment management processes and  supporting budget formulation process\u2014with key stakeholders such  as the Executive IT Resources Board, Capital Planning and  Investment Control Working Group, and Enterprise Architecture  Working Group\u2014to collect and review information for its investments.  In addition, NSF\u2019s Enterprise Modernization Roadmap\u2014which is  updated annually\u2014identifies applications along with their associated  business segment and modernization status and plans.", "NSF identified its e-mail migration to a new platform, which was  completed in July 2013, as an example of an application  rationalization effort with the highest savings. According to the  agency\u2019s November 2015 integrated data collection submission to  OMB, the migration effort resulted in cost avoidances of $60,000 in  2014.

The mission area nevertheless includes  enterprise and business IT applications which could benefit from  rationalization, as evidenced by the example of e-mail system  consolidation provided in the comments. Given the number of  systems involved (at least 1,200), collecting and reviewing cost,  technical, and business information for them would help identify  additional rationalization opportunities  which could yield savings and  efficiencies. We therefore believe a recommendation to address these  systems is still warranted.", "The department also stated that our draft implied that major IT  infrastructure modernization efforts, many of which involve the  Enterprise Information Environment Mission Area, were not reviewed  or properly managed by the department. However, as noted in our  report, we did not include IT infrastructure assets in the scope of our  review and therefore made no comment on how these assets are  being managed. We have restated our emphasis on enterprise and  business IT systems as it relates to the mission area where  appropriate.", "Finally, in its comments the department stated that our report ignored  significant Enterprise Information Environment Mission Area  application rationalization efforts, such as the Pentagon IT  consolidation under the Joint Service Provider, the Business Process  and System Review, and ongoing efforts concerning public-facing  websites and associated systems. While we were not informed of  these efforts during our review, our intent was to highlight additional  opportunities for rationalization, not discount any that might have  already been implemented.

In addition, the department stated that it partially  met the four practices associated with establishing a complete  software application inventory and provided the IT Asset Inventory it  submitted to OMB in May 2016 and other documentation supporting  this claim. Our review of the documentation found that the inventory  includes business and enterprise IT systems; however, it does not  include those systems from all organizational components and it is  missing the business function code for a large number of systems.  Furthermore, while the department is updating the IT Asset inventory  in response to OMB guidance for the fiscal year 2016 integrated data  collection submission process, it has not implemented quality control  processes to ensure the reliability of the data within the inventory.

To ensure consistency, we  decided to focus on the software applications associated with the  business and enterprise information technology (IT) commodity IT  categories defined in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)  guidance since they would be familiar to the agencies in our scope. OMB  defines enterprise IT systems as e-mail, identity and access  management, IT security, web infrastructure, and collaboration tools; and  business systems as finance, human resources, and other administrative  functions.", "We then identified practices to assess whether agencies had a complete  software application inventory. To identify these practices, we primarily  relied on our guide for assessing the reliability of computer-processed  data which addresses questions about the currency of the data and how  often it is updated, procedures for ensuring the completeness of the data,  and quality control processes in place to ensure the accuracy of the data;  and on criteria used in our recent report on federal software licenses  which determined whether agencies had a comprehensive software  license inventory, among other things. To be considered complete, we  determined an inventory should:  include business systems and enterprise IT systems, as defined by  OMB;  include these systems from all organizational components; specify basic attributes, namely, application name, description, owner,  and function supported; and be regularly updated with quality controls  in place to ensure the reliability  of the information collected.", "Following the identification of these four practices, we asked the 24 CFO  Act agencies for their software application inventories. We used a set of  structured questions to determine whether the agencies implemented the  practices and identify lessons learned and challenges faced in  establishing a complete software application inventory. We analyzed  supporting documentation, such as agency and departmental guidance,  policies, and procedures for updating the inventories, and interviewed  relevant agency officials, as needed. We compared the information  received to the four practices. We determined a practice to be fully met if  agencies provided evidence that they fully or largely implemented the  practice for establishing a complete application inventory; partially met if  agencies provided evidence that they addressed some, but not all, of the  practice for establishing a complete application inventory; and not met if  the agencies did not provide any evidence that they implemented the  practice for establishing a complete application inventory.", "To verify the inclusion of business and enterprise IT systems, we  analyzed agencies\u2019 inventories and looked for examples of each type of  system identified by OMB in the business and enterprise IT commodity  categories. We followed up with agencies when we were not able to  identify a type of system to determine the reason for the omission. We  considered the practice to be fully met if agencies\u2019 inventories included all  of the business and enterprise IT system types or if agencies provided  valid reasons for excluding them. We considered the practice to be  partially met if agencies acknowledged they were missing applications or  if we determined system types to be missing and agencies did not provide  a valid reason for this. Although we followed up with agencies to  determine whether they maintained separate inventories of software  licenses when they were not included in the inventories provided, we did  not consider the inclusion of these applications in determining our rating  because software licenses are expected to be tracked separately by  OMB.", "To verify the inclusion of systems from all organizational components, we  analyzed agencies\u2019 inventories against the list of organizational  components to determine whether they were included. We followed up  with agency officials to determine causes, if any, for missing components.  We considered the practice to be fully met if inventories included  applications from all organizational components or if agencies provided  valid reasons for excluding them. We considered the practice to be  partially met if agencies acknowledged they were missing organizational  components or if we determined several components to be missing and  agencies did not provide a valid reason for this.", "Regarding application attributes, we determined that, at a minimum,  agencies should have a name, a description, an owner, and function  supported for each application. We considered the practice to be fully met  if inventories included these attributes for all or most applications or the  agencies provided evidence that attributes not included in the inventory  provided were being tracked separately. We determined the practice to  be partially met if agencies acknowledged that they were missing any of  the attributes or if we determined them to be missing from the inventory  and agencies did not provide alternate sources for them.", "For the last practice, we determined whether agencies (1) used relevant  methods to update and maintain the application inventory and (2)  implemented controls to ensure the reliability of the information collected.  Regarding these controls, we looked for the use of automated tools to  collect and track information as their use increases reliability. We  determined the practice to be fully met if agencies provided evidence that  they regularly updated the inventory and had controls for ensuring the  reliability of information collected, including the use of automated tools, or  if agencies had mitigating factors when these processes were not in  place. We determined the practice to be partially implemented when  agencies provided policies and procedures but no evidence of actual  inventory updates or quality controls. We also determined the practice to  be partially implemented if agencies provided evidence of either regular  updates or controls for ensuring reliability  but not both or did not make  use of automated tools for collecting or maintaining information and had  no mitigation factors. Finally, we also determined the practice to be  partially implemented if agencies provided draft policy and guidance of  their processes.", "For our second objective, we selected 6 of the 24 CFO Act agencies\u2014the  Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, the Interior, and Labor; and  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and National Science  Foundation\u2014to assess their application rationalization plans and efforts  to implement them. We selected the agencies based on three factors: whether they had an application rationalization process; in our initial  set of structured questions to agencies, we asked whether they had a  plan or process for rationalizing applications and selected those that  reported having one;  the size of the agency based on fiscal year 2015 IT spending; we  selected two large agencies (i.e., with spending equal to or greater  than $3 billion), two medium agencies (i.e., with spending between $1  billion and $3 billion), and two small agencies (i.e., with spending of  less than $1 billion) for a full range of IT spending; and  if they were known for effectively rationalizing their applications based  on OMB observations and our research on IT acquisition reform  recognizing agencies for their application rationalization efforts.", "We identified key practices for effectively rationalizing applications. To do  so, we reviewed OMB guidance on federal IT management. We also  reviewed technical reports on application rationalization from industry  experts. We synthesized the information collected, looked for themes,  and determined that, to effectively rationalize applications, agencies  should have a process addressing the following four key practices: establish an application inventory; collect information on each application, such as total cost, technical  details, and business value; evaluate the portfolio and make application rationalization decisions  based on a review of collected information and determine what  applications to retain, retire, replace, eliminate, modernize, or  consolidate/move to shared services; and execute and manage the process by implementing decisions from the  evaluation and evaluate process outcomes against defined metrics  and adjust, as needed.", "While our research identified specific processes for rationalizing  applications, the principles of collecting application information and  reviewing it to inform decision making are consistent with those used to  manage investment portfolios. Therefore we considered established  practices related to investment management, budget formulation,  security, or enterprise architecture.", "Since the first key practice was addressed in our first objective, we  focused on the last three practices. To do so, we interviewed relevant  officials using a structured set of questions that were developed in  conjunction with internal experts. We also reviewed documentation to  determine the extent to which agencies had processes addressing these  practices. We also asked agencies to provide their two best examples of  application rationalization in terms of savings or cost avoidance\u2014to  illustrate the results of rationalization. When agencies did not provide two  examples meeting these conditions\u2014the case for DOD, DHS, and NSF\u2014 we drew examples from other documentation they had provided.", "Finally, we interviewed staff from OMB\u2019s Office of the Federal Chief  Information Officer to determine whether and how the office monitors  agencies\u2019 efforts to rationalize their portfolio of applications as  recommended in OMB guidance.
