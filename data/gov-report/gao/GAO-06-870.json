National emergency grants expand services to laid-off workers when other state and federal programs are insufficient to meet their needs. GAO assessed (1) whether Labor has shortened grant award times since GAO's 2004 report and was meeting own timeliness goal, (2) the uniformity of the program data that Labor now collects, and (3) Labor's oversight of national emergency grant projects. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed information for program year 2004 and the first 2 quarters of 2005 and compared it with data collected for program years 2000- 2002."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["We found that Labor's new electronic application system has, on average, shortened award processing time and most national emergency grants were awarded within Labor's goal of 30 working days as measured by GAO--from the time the application is submitted to the issuance of the award letter. In program year 2004, Labor averaged 25 working days to award grants, in contrast to program years 2000-2002, when it averaged 50 working days. Moreover, in program year 2004, Labor awarded 70 percent of all grants within 30 working days, in contrast to 38 percent for program years 2000- 2002. Although Labor has improved the overall timeliness for awards, award times ranged from 1 to 90 working days and varied by type of grant. For example, disaster grants were awarded, on average, in 16 days, but regular grants were awarded, on average, in 45 days. Delays in obtaining funds adversely impacted some grantees' ability to provide services. Also, we found that Labor's electronic application system and its timeliness goal did not capture every phase of the award process. In addition, users of this system reported some technical problems. Labor has taken steps to improve its two main sources of data for assessing how grant funds are used--the quarterly progress reports and the Workforce Investment Act Standardized Record Data (WIASRD) database. Labor introduced a new electronic quarterly report system in program year 2004. Since then, grantees have generally been submitting uniform and consistent information. Also, our review of available WIASRD data for program year 2004 shows that at least 92 percent of states that received national emergency grants included information on these grants in their WIASRD submissions. Labor's regional offices oversee each project to track performance and compliance with program requirements by conducting various monitoring activities, including approving program operating plans, reviewing quarterly progress reports, and conducting site visits. However, Labor has not issued complete, program-specific guidance that would standardize monitoring practices across regions, states, and local areas and help ensure consistent practices. In addition, officials in most of the states and local areas we visited said that Labor does not regularly help disseminate information about how states and local areas are managing their national emergency grant projects."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Between January 2004 and December 2005, the United States experienced  more than 30,000 mass layoffs involving 50 or more workers, with more  than 3.4 million workers losing their jobs. These losses affected all types of  workers\u2014including those working in the professional, service,  information processing, and manufacturing sectors\u2014in every state in the  nation. To help supplement regular dislocated worker funding, the  Department of Labor (Labor) administers the National Emergency Grant  program. Authorized under the Workforce Investment Act (WIA) of 1998,  national emergency grants provide temporary employment, training  assistance, and other supports to workers whose jobs were lost because of  major economic dislocations, such as plant closings or natural disasters,  such as floods and hurricanes. Dislocated workers can obtain temporary  employment performing clean-up activities after natural disasters, or  training\u2014such as working with computers\u2014to obtain the skills needed to  re-enter the workforce in a new occupation following a layoff. These  grants are time-limited discretionary awards to help states and local areas  provide employment and training services when basic formula WIA funds  are insufficient to meet the needs of dislocated workers.", "In program year 2004\u2014which began on July 1, 2004, and ended on June 30,  2005\u2014and the first 2 quarters of program year 2005\u2014July 1, 2005, to  December 31, 2005\u2014Labor awarded about $342 million in grant funds  ($232 million for program year 2004 and $110 million for the first   2 quarters of program year 2005). Most of these funds were provided as  disaster grants for victims of hurricanes and floods. Grantees used these  funds to provide temporary employment and humanitarian aid such as  water and other necessities to individuals who lost their jobs as a result of  these natural disasters. In addition, about $30 million of program year 2004  funds were awarded to help states and localities mitigate anticipated job  losses from military base realignments and closures. These base  realignment and closure (BRAC) grants funded activities to help states  initiate early community planning to provide assistance to large numbers  of workers who might lose their jobs due to BRAC decisions. In addition,  regular national emergency grants provided training, often through  community colleges, and support services, such as psychological or  financial counseling, for workers unemployed due to mass layoffs.", "In April 2004, we reported that services to dislocated workers were being  affected by delays in awarding national emergency grants in program years  2000 through 2002.  We identified weaknesses in Labor\u2019s processing and  management of national emergency grants, particularly with respect to the  timeliness with which they were awarded and the quality of data collected  regarding how grant funds were being used. In light of these problems,  Congress mandated that we examine the program\u2019s current  administration. Our objectives were to (1) determine whether Labor has  shortened grant award times since our 2004 report and has been able to  meet its own goal for awarding grants in 30 working days, (2) examine the  uniformity of the program data that Labor is currently collecting, and   (3) assess Labor\u2019s monitoring and oversight of national emergency grant  projects. To obtain national information on Labor\u2019s application processing,  data collection, and monitoring activities, we collected and analyzed  information on grants awarded in program year 2004 and the first   2 quarters of program year 2005. We examined grants from this time  period because program year 2004 was the first year that Labor  implemented a new electronic application system designed to improve  grant award timeliness. We calculated the number of days it took Labor to  award grants from the grantees\u2019 perspective. We began counting on the  day the application was submitted and ended on the day the award letter  was sent by Labor. We then compared our findings with the results of our  prior study to determine if there were changes in processing time. To  assess the quality of the data that Labor currently collects, we interviewed  officials in headquarters and examined quarterly progress reports to  determine the completeness and uniformity of this information. We  assessed the reliability of Labor\u2019s data and concluded they were  sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our report. We also examined  official grant files and reviewed relevant program documents. We  conducted site visits in four states (Florida, Maine, Oregon, and Texas).  We chose these states because they received substantial national  emergency grant funding in program year 2004 and the first 2 quarters of  program year 2005; represented different geographical regions; and  received grants addressing a variety of dislocation events, including plant  closings, natural disasters, out-sourcing, and military base realignments.  To evaluate Labor\u2019s monitoring activities, we conducted semi-structured  interviews with state and local officials involved in monitoring and  regional office officials in four of Labor\u2019s six regional offices that are  responsible for monitoring national emergency grants. We selected these  regions because they monitored activities in the states that we visited. See  appendix I for a detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. Our  work was conducted between September 2005 and July 2006 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["WIA authorizes the National Emergency Grant program and funds the  program through its dislocated worker funding stream. This funding  stream is one of three specified by WIA to fund services for its client  groups\u2014dislocated workers, youth, and adults. Dislocated workers  include individuals who have been terminated or laid off, or who have  received a notice of termination or layoff, individuals who were self- employed but are unemployed as a result of general economic conditions  in the community or natural disasters, and unemployed or underemployed  homemakers who are no longer supported by family members. Under  WIA, the Secretary of Labor retains 20 percent of dislocated worker funds  in a national reserve account to be used for national emergency grants,  demonstrations, and technical assistance and allots the remaining funds to  each of the states, local workforce boards, and other entities that  demonstrate to the Secretary the capacity to respond to the circumstances  relating to particular dislocations. Of the amount reserved by the Secretary  in any program year, at least 85 percent of the Secretary\u2019s national reserve  must be used for national emergency grants (see fig. 1). During program  year 2004, this amount was approximately $232 million and $110 million  during the first 2 quarters of program year 2005, for a total of $342 million.", "National emergency grants expand WIA services that are available to  dislocated workers when dislocated worker formula funds are insufficient  to meet the needs of affected workers. Under WIA, dislocated workers can  receive three levels of services\u2014core, intensive, and training. Core  services include job search and placement assistance, preliminary skill  assessments, and the provision of labor market information, and are  routinely available to anyone seeking assistance through a WIA service  center. Dislocated workers who need additional services to find work can  receive intensive services, such as case management and comprehensive  assessments. In addition, dislocated workers may also qualify for training  services, including occupational skills training, on-the-job training, skill  upgrading, and entrepreneurial training.", "Typically, state workforce agencies apply for national emergency grants  and distribute funds to local workforce boards in areas affected by the  dislocations. These boards, in turn, usually contract with organizations  that provide services or administrative support. Grantees can apply for  grants that fund three major types of projects:  regular grants to retrain workers who have lost their jobs because of plant  closings, layoffs, or military base realignments or closures;    disaster grants to provide temporary employment, humanitarian services,  and retraining for workers affected by natural disasters and other  catastrophic events; and   dual enrollment grants to provide supportive assistance such as case  management services and vocational assessments to workers certified by  Labor to receive training under the Trade Adjustment Assistance Reform  Act of 2002. These are usually for workers who have lost their jobs  because of increased imports from, or shifts in production to, foreign  countries.", "Like other programs authorized under WIA, national emergency grant  projects must be designed to achieve performance outcomes that support  Labor\u2019s performance goals. Also, Labor requires grantees to collect data  from local projects, certify the accuracy of the data, and use them to  complete various reports, such as the quarterly progress reports for  national emergency grants and the state\u2019s WIASRD data submissions.  Quarterly progress reports include project-level information on actual  performance to date\u2014for example, the number of individuals participating  in a project; the services provided, such as intensive services or training;  and the number who entered employment. WIASRD is a national database  of individual records containing characteristics, activities, and outcome  information for all enrolled participants who receive services or benefits  under WIA, including national emergency grants. The database includes  the services and training that each participant received and information on  their subsequent employment status and wages. In coordination with  federal agencies, the Office of Management and Budget developed uniform  evaluation measures, called \u201ccommon measures,\u201d for job training and  employment programs and other cross-cutting programs. The common  measures were designed to institute uniform definitions for  performance\u2014such as the percentage of participants who become  employed\u2014across federal workforce programs. Beginning in July 2005,  national emergency grant projects became subject to the common  measures and Labor expected grantees to include them in its WIASRD  data collection and reporting activities for program year 2004.", "In program year 2004, Labor funded a special type of grant, called a base  realignment and closure (BRAC) planning grant. These grants provided  resources to states and communities to plan for anticipated base closures,  unlike other regular grants that provide more general employment-related  services for dislocated workers. Accordingly, states that could be affected  by BRAC actions were eligible to apply for national emergency grant  funds. Labor issued guidance in May 2005 that explained the procedures  for obtaining these grants. This guidance also specified that applicants  must submit their applications by June 10, 2005.", "Labor\u2019s Office of National Response, in the Employment and Training  Administration (ETA), administers the National Emergency Grant  program. Headquarters and regional staff share responsibility for program  administration and oversight. At headquarters, officials make grant award  decisions and determine whether grants will be awarded in a single  payment or in increments. For grants disbursed in incremental payments,  grantees are required to submit supplemental information along with their  requests for future funding increments. Labor has established an internal  goal of making these decisions within 30 working days. After grants are  awarded, regional officials assume the lead role in conducting monitoring  and oversight activities. For example, after the grant is approved, regional  officials review and approve the project operating plan and budget,  conduct at least one site visit that examines project activities, and review  quarterly progress reports and financial reports."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Distribution and Uses of National Emergency Grants", "paragraphs": ["In program year 2004, Labor distributed about $232 million from the  dislocated worker fund for national emergency grants to 43 states, the  District of Columbia, and three territories (see fig. 2).

Labor awarded the largest proportion of funds  to Florida\u2014$76 million in grant funds, or 33 percent of the program\u2019s total  funds awarded during that year\u2014mostly in the form of disaster grants to  help the state respond to the needs of workers displaced as a result of  hurricane damage. Ohio and California each received over $20 million in  grants, primarily to help them meet the needs of workers displaced as a  result of floods and storm disasters. Other states, such as Maine and  Massachusetts, each received over $6 million, mainly to help them meet  the needs of workers dislocated because of plant closings and downsizing,  and Oregon received over $2 million, in part to help workers dislocated  because of competition from foreign countries.", "Over the past 5 program years, Labor has awarded proportionally more of  its national emergency grant funds for disaster grants and a smaller  proportion for regular and dual-enrollment grants. In program year 2000,  Labor awarded only 4 percent of its funds for disaster grants. In contrast,  in program year 2004, Labor awarded about 57 percent of grant funds for  disaster grants and 29 percent for regular grants (see fig. 3). For the first   2 quarters of program year 2005, Labor awarded 92 percent of all the funds  it awarded during those quarters for disaster projects in 11 states\u2014 Arkansas, Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi,  North Carolina, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas\u2014largely in response to  damage and dislocations resulting from Hurricane Katrina.

However, regular national emergency grants  (regular grants) took longer to award\u201445 working days on average\u2014and  most were not awarded within Labor\u2019s 30-working-day goal. Moreover,  Labor\u2019s new system and its stated goal for awarding grants do not take  into account important steps in the award process, such as obtaining  approval from key Labor officials and issuing the award letter to the  grantee. These steps added 11 days on average to the award process and  thus hampered Labor\u2019s ability to accurately evaluate its performance.  Further, the steps that are excluded involve actions that are of great  importance from the grantees\u2019 perspective\u2014the Secretary\u2019s final approval  and the award letter notifying them of the amount of money awarded.

Also in program  year 2004, Labor met this goal for 100 percent of the BRAC grants and for  91 percent of all disaster grants. In contrast, awards for regular grants took  longer. Processing time for these grants averaged 45 working days, and  Labor awarded only 16 percent of these grants within its 30-working-day  goal (see fig. 5).", "The new electronic system has facilitated improvements in award  processing time in three ways. First, because applicants cannot submit an  application on this system without completing all required data fields,  Labor no longer has to return incomplete applications. Second, because  applications are electronic, submissions are nearly instantaneous and the  format allows Labor and applicants to exchange information more  efficiently than the former paper-based system. Third, under the new  system, the applicants are only required to provide basic information\u2014 including project type, planned number of participants, planned support  services, and the project operator. Grantees receiving regular grants have  90 days from the grant approval date to submit project operating plans,  staffing plans, and budgets. In the case of disaster grants, grantees have   60 days from the grant approval date to submit the required information.", "Although average processing times have decreased in program year 2004,  the time to award grants varied widely, ranging from 1 to 90 working days,  with some types of grants taking longer than others. Several factors likely  contributed to this variance. For example, several disaster grants were  processed very quickly\u2014within 1 to 2 days\u2014because of the urgent need  for funds in areas impacted by storms and flooding. Also, the 39 BRAC  grants were awarded, on average, in only 14 days, reflecting the short  period of time that was available to submit and process them. In order to  be eligible for BRAC grants, states had to be included on the Department  of Defense\u2019s preliminary base realignment and closure list, issued on   May 13, 2005, and also had to follow Labor\u2019s special guidance for these  grants that specified that applications were due by June 10. Because the  funds for these grants were reserved from program year 2004 money,  Labor had to award them by June 30, the end of that program year. In  contrast, questions about the appropriateness of project applications  delayed the approval of other grants. For one project we visited, officials  reported that approval for an application to address a plant closure took  46 working days (about 2 months), largely because Labor questioned the  amount of funds they requested and required them to prepare additional  information to justify the costs. In addition, some grantees reported that  delays in obtaining funds adversely impacted their ability to provide  services, because individuals who needed employment left the affected  area to search for work in other places or found other jobs instead of  waiting for grant funds to become available. For example, one project we  visited was only serving 20 of 50 eligible participants according to project  officers, because workers could not afford to wait for services, left the  area, or found other jobs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Award Processing Time Was More Consistent during Program Year 2004", "paragraphs": ["Labor\u2019s award processing times were more consistent across quarters in  program year 2004 than in program years 2000-2002.

For example, Louisiana submitted its application on  September 1, 2005, and Labor awarded the grant 1 day later.

They also review the  project operating plan and analyze quarterly financial and progress reports  to assess their timeliness, accuracy, and effectiveness in providing  services to dislocated workers. Regional officials we interviewed told us  they generally conduct their most comprehensive review at the project\u2019s  midpoint by visiting grantees and project operators. According to Labor\u2019s  guidance on administering the National Emergency Grant program, a  major purpose of the on-site review for incremental grants is to review the  need for funds to complete the project. The guidance also states that  Labor officials will assess how well a grantee and its project operators are  meeting the major requirements of the program. These include participant  eligibility, financial management controls, project management,  effectiveness of support services, and job placement services. For disaster  grants, they also include temporary jobs for dislocated workers. The  regional officials reported that they usually meet with state and local  workforce officials, including project operators and dislocated workers  enrolled in the project, and conduct an exit interview with cognizant  officials to discuss their findings.", "According to officials in the four regions that we interviewed, Labor  modifies monitoring and reporting procedures as necessary to ensure that  these reviews are appropriate in terms of the special characteristics of  some grants. For example, one regional official said they visit projects  designated as \u201chigh risk\u201d within 90 days after grant award, rather than  waiting until the project\u2019s midpoint, and work closely with the grantee  throughout the project. Another Labor official said they monitor a grantee  more closely if they identify potential problems. For example, if a grantee  is late in submitting its quarterly progress reports or falls behind in  enrolling dislocated workers in a project, the regional office will conduct  more extensive monitoring such as telephoning the grantees or conducting  additional site visits to determine the cause. Labor can also require  grantees to submit reports in addition to their regular quarterly progress  reports for unusually large or highly visible grants, such as those awarded  to serve Hurricane Katrina victims. According to workforce officials in two  states that received Katrina grants and a cognizant regional official, they  initially had to submit numerous reports with different information on a  daily basis, then every 3 days, and then on a weekly, biweekly, and  monthly basis.", "Workforce officials in most of the states and local areas we visited told us  that Labor\u2019s oversight activities were generally beneficial and that the  monitoring activities often provided them with helpful feedback for  managing their grants. For example, an official in one local area said that  Labor\u2019s monitoring resulted in them strengthening their requirements for  maintaining critical documents in participant files. In this area, local  officials routinely required caseworkers to check a sample of their  coworkers\u2019 files to ensure that they were complete and contained  sufficient documentation to justify the services that were provided in  order to prepare for federal monitoring.", "Despite the general satisfaction with Labor\u2019s monitoring efforts, we found  that the guidance states and local areas received varied widely. Labor  issued a draft monitoring guide specifically for national emergency grants  in late 2005, which was based on its generic Core Monitoring Guide.  Officials in three of the four states we visited said that they had received a  copy of the draft monitoring guide, but none of the local areas we visited  had. In fact, one regional office official we interviewed had not yet  received a copy of the guide. Further, state officials told us that they had  received different types of information from Labor to help them prepare  for their on-site monitoring visits. For example, officials in all four states  said that regional officials sent a list before their visit of the documents  and participant files that they needed to review. An official in one state  said that they had not always received written guidance on how to  conduct their own monitoring or prepare for Labor\u2019s monitoring visits.", "To compensate for the lack of consistent, complete guidance, all four  states we visited had developed their own tools for monitoring local areas,  and many of the local areas used their state\u2019s tool or a modified version of  it to monitor their service providers. For example, one local area official  told us they modified the state\u2019s tool by adding procedures for reviewing  the documents that support a dislocated worker\u2019s eligibility to receive  services. An official in another state told us that their agency expanded the  tool that it uses for its 90-day on-site monitoring visit for its mid-point  review by including a review of the documents in participant files and  project cost."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Labor Has Not Disseminated Information on Promising Practices", "paragraphs": ["Officials in most states and local areas we visited said they do not  currently have opportunities to share information about promising  practices for managing and monitoring national emergency grant projects,  but many expressed an interest in having such opportunities. Workforce  officials in one state and six local areas said that having Labor facilitate  opportunities for disseminating such information would help project  operators manage their projects more efficiently. For example, according  to officials in one local area, they had experience operating grant projects  that served dislocated workers in the agricultural sector, but not in the  manufacturing sector. When faced with a layoff in a computer chip  manufacturing plant, they had to take time to research potential job  openings and skills required for jobs in this sector. Having information on  how other areas served workers laid off by manufacturing companies  would have helped shorten the time they spent developing the project and  allowed them to serve workers more quickly. Officials in one state also  suggested that Labor could help by creating a central repository of  documents used in managing projects, such as examples of agreements  used to establish temporary worksites for disaster victims. Although Labor  has a Web site for sharing promising practices with the WIA community,  Labor has not used this tool for facilitating improved information sharing  about national emergency grants."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["National emergency grants are an important tool for helping states and  localities respond to mass layoffs and disasters that result in large  numbers of dislocated workers. When major layoffs and disasters such as  hurricanes or floods occur, states and local areas must respond quickly to  ensure that dislocated workers receive the services they need to re-enter  the workforce. While the National Emergency Grant program is relatively  small, the reemployment activities it funds are important for workers who  have been dislocated due to mass layoffs or natural disasters. In this  regard, it is critical for grant funds to reach program participants in a  timely manner. By implementing an automated application system, Labor  has, on average, substantially decreased the time required to award  national emergency grants. However, because this system does not  capture the entire grant process\u2014including the time taken for the  Secretary to issue final award letters\u2014there is room for further  improvement. Moreover, while the system has improved the timeliness of  grant awards, some state and local officials have encountered problems  using the system. Effective management and oversight requires a  mechanism for states and localities to provide feedback to Labor, to  ensure that potential system weaknesses are identified and addressed.", "Effective monitoring is also a critical component of grant management.  While Labor\u2019s monitoring activities appear to provide reasonable  assurance that grant funds are being used for their intended purpose,  some state and local officials said that standardized guidance would be  beneficial. In particular, once Labor finalizes its monitoring guide for  grants, state and local officials responsible for grant administration and  oversight could benefit from more consistent, specific federal guidance.  Moreover, state and local officials could benefit from innovative project  management practices that have promoted efficiency and effectiveness in  other states where grant funds have been awarded. However, without  disseminating such information through a centralized mechanism, it is  difficult for state and local officials to learn of promising practices in other  jurisdictions and use this information early in the planning process."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order for Labor to better manage the grant award process and system,  accurately assess the time it takes to award grant funds, and improve its  guidance to states and local areas, we recommend that the Secretary of  Labor take additional actions. In particular, Labor should    extend its electronic application system and its own timeliness  measurement process to capture the entirety of the award process from  the perspective of grant applicants, specifically through final approval and  issuance of award letters by the Secretary;   solicit information from users of the application system to guide future  refinements to this system;   distribute more complete guidance and tools for monitoring grant    explore cost-effective ways to disseminate information to states and local  areas to help them learn about promising practices for managing national  grant projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Labor commented on a draft of this report, indicating  that it agrees with our findings and the intent of all four recommendations  (see app. III).

Labor reported that it has recently  implemented a new version of its electronic application system that has  expanded its capacity to manage all elements of the application process.  However, Labor did not directly address our recommendation that the  system be expanded to capture the entirety of the awards process,  including final approval and issuance of the award letters by the Secretary.  In addition, Labor agreed that information from users is needed to guide  future refinements to the system but noted that a survey of all users might  require a formal paperwork clearance process and, therefore, would  provide less timely information than its present system involving user tests  with selected grantees. While we agree that information from user tests is  useful, we believe feedback from all grantees would better inform future  enhancements. Regarding our recommendation that it distribute more  complete guidance and monitoring tools, Labor explained that it is  currently  field-testing a monitoring guide for national emergency grant  projects, and plans to release this guide by September 2006.  We believe  such a guide could be an important step toward establishing consistent  monitoring practices. Also, Labor concurred with our recommendation  that it explore cost-effective ways to disseminate information to states and  local areas to help them learn about promising practices for managing  national emergency grant projects.
