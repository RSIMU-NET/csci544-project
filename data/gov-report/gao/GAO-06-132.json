To protect against such losses, critical research and diagnostic activities are conducted at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York. The Department of Agriculture (USDA) was responsible for Plum Island until June 2003, when provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred the facility to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Under an interagency agreement, USDA continues to work on foreign animal diseases at the island. GAO examined (1) DHS and USDA coordination of research and diagnostic activities, (2) changes in research and diagnostic priorities since the transfer, and (3) long-term objectives of joint activities at Plum Island."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DHS and USDA's coordination at Plum Island Animal Disease Center has been largely successful because of the agencies' early efforts to work together to bring structure to their interactions at the island. For example, prior to the transfer, officials from DHS and USDA worked in concert to develop a written interagency agreement--effective when the island was transferred to DHS--that coordinated management activities. Subsequently, DHS and USDA created a detailed strategy to guide their joint work on foreign animal disease research and diagnostics. According to this joint strategy, DHS's role is to augment the research and diagnostic work that USDA's Agricultural Research Service (ARS) and the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) conduct at the island. Since the transfer, budget changes, in part, have modified overall priorities and the scope of work at the island. First, ARS narrowed its research priorities to focus its work primarily on a single foreign animal disease, foot-and-mouth disease (FMD). Traditionally one of the high-priority diseases studied at Plum Island, FMD has emerged as its top research priority because, according to officials, it poses the greatest threat of introduction because of its virulence, infectivity, and availability. Other research programs have been terminated or are proceeding at a slower pace. National experts we consulted confirmed the importance of studying FMD, but stated that it is also important to study a variety of other diseases to remain prepared. They suggested that, to free up limited space at the facility, some of the work that does not require the unique features of Plum Island could be performed elsewhere: for example, work that does not involve the use of a live virus, such as certain aspects of vaccine development. Second, while APHIS's overall priorities have not changed, diagnostic work has been curtailed. Officials said that, after the transfer, because the agency did not receive an expected budget increase, their plans to expand development of diagnostic tools for high-priority diseases were curtailed. This work is vital to rapidly identifying diseases when outbreaks occur. APHIS officials told us that the funds to support work on diagnostic tools remain insufficient. Finally, DHS has assumed responsibility for operations and maintenance at Plum Island and has established an applied research science and agricultural forensics team. While DHS and USDA plan to continue to work together on FMD, agency officials told us that it is not prudent to speculate on long-term objectives at Plum Island, in part, because DHS has plans to replace the Plum Island Animal Disease Center with a new, modernized facility that could be located at Plum Island or elsewhere. Pending congressional approval, DHS estimates that the new facility will be fully operational by 2012."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Over 40 contagious animal diseases identified in other countries\u2014known  as foreign animal diseases\u2014threaten the United States\u2019 agriculture  economy, the largest and most integrated in the world. A key component of  this economy is the livestock industry, which contributes over $100 billion  annually to the gross domestic product. To protect the nation\u2019s animal  industries and exports from catastrophic economic losses that would result  from the deliberate or accidental introduction of a foreign animal disease,  scientists and veterinarians conduct critical research and diagnostic  activities at the Plum Island Animal Disease Center, located off the coast of  New York.", "Plum Island\u2019s research and diagnostic activities stem from its mission to  protect U.S. animal industries and exports from deliberate or accidental  introductions of foreign animal diseases. The United States is normally free  of such diseases, and highly contagious pathogens could cause disastrous  losses in the agriculture sector if they were released outside the facility.  Plum Island\u2019s activities include conducting research to develop more  sensitive and accurate methods of disease detection and identification;  developing new strategies to control disease epidemics, including new  vaccines and antiviral drugs; investigating suspected cases of foreign  animal disease outbreaks in the United States; producing and maintaining  materials used in diagnostic tests and vaccines; and training animal health  professionals to recognize and diagnose foreign animal diseases. Moreover,  Plum Island is the only facility in the United States that is currently  approved to study high-consequence foreign livestock diseases, such as  foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), because its laboratory has been equipped  with a specially designed biocontainment area that meets specific safety  measures. Plum Island\u2019s work involves large mammalian animals. In fact, it  is the only facility in the United States that has special safety features  required to study certain high consequence foreign animal diseases in large  animals. Research on other highly pathogenic animal diseases is being  conducted at other facilities. For example, highly pathogenic avian  influenza is being studied at the U.S. Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA)  Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory in Athens, Georgia, and is being  diagnosed at the National Veterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa.", "USDA was responsible for Plum Island until June 1, 2003, when provisions  of the Homeland Security Act of 2002 were implemented. The act  transferred Plum Island, including all of its assets and liabilities, to the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS). This action shifted overall  responsibility for Plum Island to DHS, including all of the costs associated  with facility maintenance, operations, and security. The act specified that  USDA would continue to have access to Plum Island to conduct diagnostic  and research work on foreign animal diseases, and it authorized the  President to transfer funds from USDA to DHS to operate Plum Island.", "Responding to concerns from the agriculture sector that the transfer of  responsibilities at Plum Island could shift the focus away from agriculture  to other DHS priorities, the members of a congressional conference  committee inserted language in the conference report accompanying the  Consolidated Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2005 requesting that we  report on the coordination efforts between DHS and USDA and describe  the long-term objectives of joint activities at Plum Island. In this context,  we examined (1) how DHS and USDA coordinate research and diagnostic  activities at Plum Island; (2) what changes, if any, have taken place  regarding research and diagnostic priorities at Plum Island since the  transfer, and the reasons for and implications of such changes; and (3) the  long-term objectives of joint DHS and USDA activities at Plum Island.", "To address the first and second objectives, we analyzed DHS and USDA  strategy documents and interviewed officials at various levels from each  agency, including senior leadership officials in Washington, D.C. We also  reviewed budget data and interviewed analysts and officials at DHS, USDA,  and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB); lead scientists based at  Plum Island; and former USDA scientists who left Plum Island after its  transfer to DHS. In addition, we reviewed agency budget documents and  other budgetary information provided by the agencies to identify changes  in funding levels since the transfer and to determine the funding allocations  among the programs at Plum Island, before and after the transfer.", "We also interviewed selected animal disease experts to respond to the  second objective. We selected our experts for their diverse perspectives  and technical expertise on animal health and diseases based on the  following criteria: (1) recommendations we received from others  knowledgeable in the field of foreign animal diseases; (2) area of expertise  and experience; and (3) the type of organization represented, including  academic institutions and associated research centers.", "To address the third objective, we analyzed agency planning documents  and interviewed senior leadership officials representing DHS and USDA.

Scientists working at the facility are responsible for  protecting U.S. livestock against foreign animal diseases that could be  accidentally or deliberately introduced into the United States. Animal  health officials define an exotic or foreign animal disease as an important  transmissible livestock or poultry disease believed to be absent from the  United States and its territories that has the potential to create a significant  health or economic impact.", "Plum Island\u2019s scientists identify the pathogens that cause foreign animal  diseases and work to develop vaccines to protect U.S. livestock. The  primary research and diagnostic focus at Plum Island is foreign or exotic  diseases that could affect livestock, including cattle, swine, and sheep. In  addition to FMD and classical swine fever, other types of livestock diseases  that have been studied at Plum Island include African swine fever,  rinderpest, and various pox viruses, such as sheep and goat pox. Appendix  III provides more extensive information on animal diseases of concern  mentioned in this report.", "Some of the pathogens maintained at Plum Island are highly contagious;  therefore, research on these pathogens is conducted in a biocontainment  area that has special safety features designed to contain the pathogens. If  accidentally released, these pathogens could cause catastrophic economic  losses in the agricultural sector. The biocontainment area includes 40  rooms for livestock and is the only place in the United States that is  equipped to permit the study of certain contagious foreign animal diseases  in large mammalian animals. USDA uses this biocontainment area for basic  research, diagnostic work, and for clinical training of veterinarians in the  recognition of foreign animal diseases. These veterinarians would serve as  animal health first responders in the event of an emergency. The North  American Foot-and-Mouth Disease Vaccine Bank is also located on Plum  Island.", "USDA had owned and operated Plum Island for nearly 50 years when, in  June 2003, the island and its assets and liabilities were transferred to DHS.  Plum Island is now part of a broader joint strategy developed by DHS and  USDA to protect against the intentional or accidental introduction of  foreign animal diseases. Under the direction of the DHS\u2019s Science and  Technology Directorate (S&T), the strategy for protecting livestock also  includes work at two of DHS\u2019s Centers of Excellence, known as the  National Center for Food Protection and Defense and the National Center  for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease Defense, as well as other centers  within the DHS homeland security biodefense complex. These include the  National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center and the  Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. The strategy calls for building on  the strengths of each agency\u2019s assets to develop comprehensive  preparedness and response capabilities. (See fig. 1.)", "According to the strategy, DHS and USDA now work together to address  national biodefense issues and carry out the mission of the Plum Island  Animal Disease Center as follows:   DHS is responsible for coordinating the overall national effort to  enhance the protection of agriculture, which the President has defined  as a critical infrastructure sector. At Plum Island, DHS\u2019s Science and  Technology Directorate is working to advance the development of  vaccines and disease prophylactics based on ARS\u2019s basic research. Also,  DHS has established a bioforensics laboratory at Plum Island and is  working to conduct forensic analysis of evidence from suspected  biocrimes and terrorism involving a foreign animal disease attack.", "USDA/ARS scientists at Plum Island are responsible for basic research  on foreign livestock diseases and for early discovery of  countermeasures, such as evaluating countermeasures for rapid  induction of immunity in livestock.", "USDA/APHIS scientists are responsible for diagnosing livestock  diseases. Also, APHIS conducts diagnostic training sessions several  times a year to give veterinary health professionals the opportunity to  study the clinical signs of animal diseases found in other countries, such  as FMD.", "Currently, in addition to visiting scientists and fellows, there are  approximately 70 federal research scientists, veterinarians,  microbiologists, laboratory technicians, and support staff working at Plum  Island. DHS and USDA\u2019s combined annual operating funds at Plum Island,  based on fiscal year 2005 allocations and other funds, is about $60  million\u2014USDA\u2019s funding is about $8 million, and DHS\u2019s is about $51 million  (see fig. 2). Prior to the transfer of Plum Island to DHS, ARS and APHIS  shared responsibility for operating costs, although ARS had primary  responsibility for the facility. According to agency officials, both agencies  received appropriations to execute their research and diagnostic missions,  out of which operations and maintenance costs had to be funded. Neither  ARS nor APHIS received a specific appropriation for operations and  maintenance activities. Now, DHS is responsible for operations and  maintenance costs as well as programmatic costs that DHS incurs directly.

The success of the agencies  resulted from their early efforts to work together to bring structure to their  interactions at the island. The agencies developed a framework for  coordination in several stages.", "First, in accordance with provisions of the Homeland Security Act of  2002, DHS, ARS, and APHIS worked together before the transfer to  establish an interagency agreement. The purpose of the agreement is to  establish written guidelines that identify each agency\u2019s role and to  coordinate immediate operations and maintenance needs, such as fiscal  responsibilities and the use of shared equipment. Effective on the day of  the transfer, this agreement remained in place while the agencies  completed a more detailed strategic plan.", "Second, a working group, composed of DHS, ARS, and APHIS officials,  as well as representatives from nongovernmental producer groups,  convened about one month after the transfer to review the island\u2019s  mission and priorities and to develop a strategy for coordination.  According to a USDA official, DHS recognized that, as a newly  established agency, it needed to seek technical expertise through this  interagency group. The group began by discussing foreign animal  diseases from a broad perspective to inform the new DHS staff about  key issues. Subsequent meetings became more focused as stakeholders  evaluated the capabilities of the island and its programs, and identified  shortfalls and a common priority for the agencies\u2014FMD. The group  finalized a joint strategy to address this priority in August 2004.", "The Joint DHS and USDA Strategy for Foreign Animal Disease Research  and Diagnostic Programs (Joint Strategy) serves as the basis for the  agencies to prioritize and coordinate work on Plum Island\u2019s two critical  functions\u2014conducting research on foreign animal diseases and providing  diagnostic services to identify such diseases. The Joint Strategy describes  the role of each agency at Plum Island; identifies the agencies\u2019 common  goal to address the threat of foreign animal disease introduction; and  outlines the activities that DHS, ARS, and APHIS are to perform to fulfill  that goal. In particular, the Joint Strategy identifies gaps in the federal  government\u2019s effort to address foreign animal diseases and specifies how  DHS programs will fill those gaps. For example, DHS will use its resources  and expertise to support efficacy testing and advanced development\u2014an  identified gap\u2014of improved vaccines for FMD that showed promising  results in the early research stages\u2014i.e., basic research\u2014performed by  ARS scientists.", "Under the terms of the Joint Strategy, ARS and DHS will conduct research  to develop products, such as vaccines, antivirals, and diagnostic tools, that  could be used by APHIS, sold on the market, or both. ARS will continue to  focus on the early stages of the work and conduct basic research, which  explores generally untested ideas. Examples of recent ARS basic research  include obtaining new knowledge about diseases and their causative agents  and studying the immune responses of livestock infected with FMD. DHS  will augment the ARS work by performing targeted applied research, which  is intended to lead to the practical use of the most promising basic research  results. Among other things, DHS scientists will work with the results from  ARS experiments toward developing those concepts into tangible products  that will enhance the nation\u2019s ability to respond to a bioterrorism attack.  For example, ARS scientists could prove a vaccine concept in laboratory  experiments, while DHS could conduct the efficacy testing of this vaccine,  which would lead to securing licenses required for full-scale manufacture  of a vaccine product.", "Finally, the Joint Strategy confirms the role of APHIS to conduct  confirmatory diagnostic work, develop and validate diagnostic test  methods, support the federal and state network of laboratories intended to  quickly respond to disease outbreaks, and train veterinarians to recognize  and diagnose foreign animal diseases. The Joint Strategy also identifies  ways that DHS will augment the diagnostic role of APHIS. DHS will not  initiate diagnostic services at the island, but will contribute to APHIS work  by supporting validation and deployment of rapid diagnostic technologies  and enhancing training capabilities. For example, DHS has modernized  educational equipment used by APHIS to teach students and veterinarians  about diagnosing foreign animal diseases. DHS has also established its  bioforensic laboratory at Plum Island, and DHS scientists will use this  laboratory to validate the forensic assays used for FMD."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS and USDA Rely on Formal and Informal Communication to Coordinate Activities", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the Joint Strategy, the agencies established two other formal  mechanisms to ensure that their respective missions are well integrated  and to guide routine activities: a Board of Directors and an interagency  working group known as the Senior Leadership Group. The agencies also  rely on frequent informal communication among scientists and the  leadership at Plum Island to further enhance coordination.", "Composed of top officials from DHS, ARS, and APHIS, the Board of  Directors focuses on overall strategic issues and meets on a quarterly basis.  The board includes the DHS Director of the Office of Research and  Development, Science and Technology Directorate, and the administrators  of both ARS and APHIS. The Director of Plum Island, a DHS employee,  participates as the Executive Secretary, but is not a member of the board.  The board maintains responsibility for coordination and oversight of all  matters relating to the management, administration, research strategy, and  operations at Plum Island. The board also ensures that the operation of the  facility at Plum Island fulfills the agriculture security mission of the Science  and Technology Directorate, ARS, and APHIS.", "On the other hand, the Senior Leadership Group provides local  management and focuses on immediate on-site management decisions,  such as scheduling use of limited laboratory space. The Plum Island-based  leaders from each agency make up the Senior Leadership Group, and they  meet on at least a monthly basis. The group\u2019s responsibilities include (1)  establishing operational procedures and practices and conducting strategic  planning for future needs, (2) ensuring that individuals who use the facility  adhere to its operational procedures and practices, (3) scheduling use of  the facility and shared equipment, (4) establishing policies for workers to  access the facility, (5) reviewing the compatibility of the work performed at  the facility with the island\u2019s mission and operations, (6) identifying and  coordinating program management for joint projects, and (7) coordinating  continuity of operations procedures.", "The staff we interviewed at Plum Island also said that frequent informal  communication among scientists has contributed to effective coordination.  According to the Director of Plum Island, scientists discuss their work with  one another on an almost daily basis. One scientist noted that the informal  dialogue creates a collaborative environment, thereby strengthening their  work. The ease of informal communication appears to have resulted in part  from existing relationships among the scientists in the three agencies\u2014 some of the scientists that now work for DHS at Plum Island previously  worked for ARS and APHIS at the island.", "In addition, the lead scientists we spoke with attributed the effective  integration of DHS at the facility in part to the skilled leadership of the  Plum Island Director. For example, several scientists believe that the  leader\u2019s successful efforts in facilitating open communication among staff  have fostered a collaborative environment. Moreover, several noted that  the leaders currently based on the island value the comments and ideas  expressed by the scientists. One lead scientist concluded that the Director\u2019s  ability to establish positive relationships with staff has brought greater  focus to the research and diagnostic programs. USDA officials also noted  that the leadership of the Director and the entire Senior Leadership Group,  working as a team, have contributed to effective cooperation at Plum  Island.", "Finally, while there is now good coordination among the agencies at Plum  Island, scientists acknowledged that they experienced some administrative  difficulties during the transition period. The scientists we spoke with  generally viewed challenges such as these as inevitable given the  complexity of transferring responsibility for operations to a new agency  and incorporating new programs in the existing facility. For example, one  scientist said that the lack of procurement officers initially posed a burden  to scientists. He had to perform the duties of a procurement officer\u2014 searching for the products, obtaining cost estimates, and completing  extensive paperwork\u2014when he needed new supplies and equipment. As a  result, this scientist had to forgo some of his limited time in the laboratory  and delay his research while he learned how to process procurement  orders. This scientist noted, however, that he expected this to be a  temporary problem because the agency has since hired administrative  staff. DHS officials noted that two procurement officers currently are  working at Plum Island, which should alleviate this type of problem in the  future."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Budget Changes at Time of the Transfer in Part Modified Overall Priorities and the Scope of Work at Plum Island", "paragraphs": ["Program budget changes that occurred soon after the transfer\u2014resulting in  part from implementation of the Homeland Security Act of 2002\u2014modified  overall priorities and the scope of USDA\u2019s work at Plum Island.  Traditionally one of the high priorities at Plum Island, FMD has emerged as  the facility\u2019s top research priority. According to ARS officials, the agency  slowed or terminated other research activities in response to the budget  reductions that occurred soon after the transfer of the facility to DHS.  Many of the experts we spoke with raised concerns about focusing Plum  Island\u2019s research resources on one disease. They also noted that some of  the aspects of the research being conducted at the island could be  performed elsewhere. With regard to the diagnostic component of Plum  Island, APHIS\u2019s priorities have not changed, but APHIS officials told us that  budget changes at the time of the transfer curtailed the planned expansion  of diagnostic services.

Also, ARS responded  to budget reductions by slowing research on other high-priority diseases,  such as classical swine fever, and by terminating research on other  diseases, including African swine fever. According to ARS officials, the  agency determined the current research priorities\u2014FMD and, to a lesser  extent, classical swine fever\u2014using its research plan, which was developed  under the agency\u2019s formal planning process, known as the National  Program review.", "In addition to the priorities established by the National Program review, an  ARS official told us that the agency also considered other assessments,  including those of the White House Office of Science and Technology  Policy Blue Ribbon Panel on the Threat of Biological Terrorism Directed  Against Livestock. These assessments consistently ranked African swine  fever as a lower threat to the United States than FMD and classical swine  fever, and ranked FMD as the top threat to the agriculture economy from a  deliberate introduction because of its virulence, infectivity, and availability.  African swine fever has been perceived as a less imminent threat to the  United States because, according to USDA, outbreaks require a vector,  such as a tick, to spread the disease.", "As a result of these assessments, as well as a budget reduction soon after  the transfer, ARS officials told us that the agency had to slow the pace of  some research projects and terminate others. Specifically, ARS terminated  the African swine fever research program, which included genomic  sequencing of large DNA viruses, and slowed the pace of work on classical  swine fever. While these officials acknowledged the need to make FMD a  research priority at Plum Island, they raised concerns about the effect of  budget reductions on other diseases of concern. For example, research on  classical swine fever, which included development of a marker vaccine, is  proceeding at a slower pace than it did before the budget reductions. An  ARS official estimated that the reduced funds for classical swine fever  research will extend the project timeline about 5 to 10 years. Such delays  postpone the development of products that would improve the nation\u2019s  ability to respond to and manage an outbreak of disease.", "Since ARS is no longer responsible for operations and maintenance costs at  Plum Island, funds to meet these expenses were transferred to DHS in  fiscal year 2003. However, a reduction of ARS\u2019s programmatic funds for  research conducted at Plum Island also occurred. ARS budget data show  that the agency\u2019s programmatic funds decreased by 45 percent between  fiscal years 2003 and 2004. These changes are the result of OMB\u2019s actions to  create the first DHS budget for Plum Island in fiscal year 2004. According to  an OMB budget examiner, all of the funding for facility operations was  transferred to DHS. OMB also divided Plum Island program funds equally  between DHS and USDA in fiscal year 2004.", "ARS negotiated agreements with other government agencies (including  DHS) and a nongovernmental entity under which ARS was reimbursed to  carry out mutually beneficial research. The amount of these  reimbursements equaled about 80 percent of the reduction in the ARS  program budget in 2003 after the transfer. For example, in fiscal years 2004  and 2005, ARS received reimbursements from DHS for research ARS  performed in support of DHS\u2019s mission. Reimbursements from these  agreements, which an ARS official told us are not guaranteed to continue in  fiscal year 2006 or beyond, decreased from fiscal year 2004 through 2005.  One ARS management analyst noted that the agency cannot factor these  reimbursements into program planning because of their inherent  uncertainty\u2014such agreements are negotiated as reimbursements on a  case-by-case basis after the agency has completed the work.", "DHS officials stated that it may appear that ARS\u2019s research budget was  reduced posttransfer more than it actually was because it is not clear from  ARS\u2019s fiscal year 2002 and 2003 budgets how much of those budgets  included indirect costs (i.e., research overhead costs) and operations and  maintenance costs. ARS\u2019s budget data for fiscal years 2002 and 2003,  however, do not distinguish between indirect costs and operations and  maintenance costs. According to an ARS official, DHS now pays for some  of the indirect research costs at Plum Island, and the agencies continue to  negotiate how to share indirect support costs on a case-by-case basis.", "Table 1 summarizes the net effect of the budget reductions and subsequent  funding on ARS\u2019s research resources, exclusive of building and facility  funds, at Plum Island for fiscal years 2002 through 2005.", "Finally, a senior ARS official expressed concern that because of current  funding constraints, research at Plum Island does not address other  emerging livestock diseases. This official stated that researching other  diseases would mitigate some of the uncertainty and better prepare animal  health responders, such as veterinarians, to respond to the unknown. In  particular, this official emphasized the importance of developing expertise  in other foreign animal diseases."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Experts Regard FMD as the Most Significant Threat but Raised Concerns about Focusing Limited Resources on a Single Disease", "paragraphs": ["Nationally recognized animal disease experts we interviewed agreed that  FMD constitutes the greatest threat to American livestock, and, as such,  warrants increased attention. Therefore, most of the experts agreed that it  is prudent to marshal resources to study FMD at Plum Island. Most of the  experts also found it reasonable to terminate research on diseases of lesser  importance to the U.S. economy, such as African swine fever. However, all  of the experts questioned the wisdom of focusing limited resources almost  exclusively on a single disease. Several experts also expressed concern  that the focus on a single disease will constrain the development of  expertise in other critical diseases, exacerbating the current shortage of  talent in this area. For example, one expert told us that there is a shortage  of people with an interest in developing expertise in high-priority foreign  animal diseases.", "In fact, nearly all of the experts we interviewed believed that the current  work at Plum Island does not adequately address the potential threats  posed by deliberate and accidental introductions of foreign animal diseases  other than FMD. Specifically, all but one of the experts we consulted said  that focusing research on a single disease makes livestock more vulnerable  to the diseases that are not being studied to the same extent, or in some  cases, at all, such as Nipah virus. Many of these experts emphasized that  because it is difficult to predict foreign animal disease outbreaks, it is  important to maintain ongoing research on a range of diseases to be better  prepared. As a related example, one scientist pointed out that because little  was known about West Nile virus, officials were unprepared when the first  outbreak occurred in the United States in 1999. West Nile is a disease that  can be fatal to humans, horses, and birds. The first case of West Nile virus  in the United States was detected in New York, and the disease spread to an  additional 48 states by 2003. An ARS official acknowledged the limitations  of focusing research on a single disease and commented that ARS would  like to do more research on emerging diseases to be better prepared for the  unknown. DHS and ARS officials caution that resource and facility  constraints would make it difficult to expand the current research portfolio  at Plum Island. Also, such a portfolio would require significantly more  stringent biosecurity than is currently in place at the island if research were  performed on diseases that could affect both animals and humans.", "Some diseases of concern that are not currently being studied at Plum  Island include Nipah virus and Rift Valley fever. Members of a blue-ribbon  threat assessment panel pinpoint these diseases, which affect both humans  and livestock, as warranting greater attention because an outbreak could  result in economic disruption or interfere with trade. Some of the experts  we interviewed also said that Rift Valley fever research is needed. Research  conducted outside of Plum Island on Nipah virus and Rift Valley fever is  very limited. At the DHS-funded Center of Excellence at Texas A&M  University there are plans to develop a vaccine for Rift Valley fever, but  there is limited laboratory space to conduct this type of work on large  animals and, therefore, researchers at the center cannot test the vaccine on  large animals. The Texas A&M Center of Excellence anticipates that it will  rely on institutions overseas, such as the Onderstepoort laboratories in  South Africa, to conduct such tests.", "DHS and USDA officials told us that in order to study Rift Valley fever on  large animals at Plum Island, individuals involved with the research would  require a vaccination. Alternatively, Plum Island would need to enhance its  biosafety procedures to comply with the stricter biosafety level 4  standards. A DHS official noted that at the time of the transfer of Plum  Island, the Homeland Security Secretary pledged to the nearby  communities that DHS would not seek a more stringent biosafety  designation for the facility.", "Other experts commented on other factors that limit research on foreign  animal diseases. For example, one expert commented that while Plum  Island plays a critical role in the national effort to address foreign animal  diseases, researchers at this facility cannot study every foreign animal  disease of concern, especially given the resource constraints and that the  staff do not have expertise in other diseases, such as vector-borne diseases.  This expert believes that collaborations between Plum Island and other  research institutions would benefit the United States by enhancing the  nation\u2019s knowledge in areas that researchers would otherwise not be able  to address at Plum Island. Several experts suggested that DHS and USDA  might use the Plum Island facility more effectively by limiting its research  agenda to live infectious agents that can be studied only there and allowing  other institutions to perform the work that does not require the stringent  safety features of Plum Island. For example, researchers in other  institutions could develop vaccines without using a live form of infectious  agents or model disease outbreaks. One expert told us that researchers  could answer questions through modeling and risk assessment that would  be based on the data generated from tests using animals at Plum Island.", "Another way to maximize space resources at Plum Island may be to shift  work on domestic animal diseases off the island. An expert we consulted  said that doing this work at Plum Island decreases the island\u2019s already  limited resources available to study foreign animal diseases. For example,  this expert regards vesicular stomatitis\u2014a disease often mistaken for  FMD\u2014as inappropriate for Plum Island because it is a domestic disease  and is not highly contagious. Other experts highlighted the value of  studying this disease\u2014in part to provide researchers or responders with  experience in distinguishing this domestic disease from FMD\u2014but some  noted that it might be more appropriate to study it in other laboratories in  the mainland United States. USDA commented that it is necessary for the  agency to conduct its research on vesicular stomatitis at Plum Island  because scientists are working with samples that may be contaminated  with FMD. In addition, USDA commented that another benefit from  maintaining research on vesicular stomatitis at Plum Island is that such  work enables the agency to retain staff trained to work with diseases that  affect humans and animals. DHS officials stated that, in their opinion, this  type of work constitutes a minimal percentage of Plum Island's workload; a  senior ARS official concurred and estimated that this work accounts for  roughly 5 percent of the ARS research funds at Plum Island.", "According to DHS, the agency is exploring opportunities to involve other  research institutions. For example, the DHS officials noted that recently  Plum Island officials have begun to assess what work could be moved off  the island to other research facilities while taking into consideration what  parts of the combined research tasks can be possibly conducted off of the  island. A DHS official told us that the agency has tapped Lawrence  Livermore National Laboratory to coordinate closely with Plum Island  researchers and develop diagnostic and detection tools for FMD, and  demonstrate the performance of such tools in the field. Also, a researcher  at the DHS Center of Excellence at Texas A&M stated that the center is  investigating genetic methods for preventing FMD, deferring portions of  the research requiring use of the live virus to Plum Island; there, a smaller  team can handle the virus in a laboratory setting that meets the stringent  safety standards. Finally, USDA commented that ARS has established  collaborative relationships with eight universities and two other  institutions to accomplish its research mission."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "APHIS\u2019s Priorities Remain the Same, but Budget Changes Curtailed the Planned Expansion of Diagnostic Services", "paragraphs": ["According to APHIS officials, before the transfer of Plum Island to DHS,  they expected to receive a $2.3 million increase in funding, which Congress  had approved in February 2003 as part of the agency\u2019s appropriations.  APHIS was expecting this increased funding to meet rising demand for  diagnostic services. Specifically, the 2001 FMD outbreak in the United  Kingdom and the emphasis on bioterrorism prompted a shift from passive  foreign animal disease surveillance to a more active approach. These  events underscored the need for additional staff. In addition, APHIS had  assumed responsibility for establishing the validity of rapid diagnostic tools  to be used by scientists in a national network of state veterinary  laboratories.", "However, APHIS officials told us that as a result of the transfer, the $2.3  million increase that APHIS officials were expecting to receive was not  fully realized. According to budget documents, APHIS had expected to  allocate a total of $4.3 million in fiscal year 2004 to diagnostic work at Plum  Island, which included the $2.3 million. Instead, half of this amount\u2014$2.1  million\u2014was allocated to the DHS budget for Plum Island that year. OMB  decided to use the APHIS fiscal year 2003 budget allocation\u2014which  included the $2.3 million\u2014as a base to determine how much money APHIS  and DHS should receive in fiscal year 2004. Additionally, OMB transferred  a portion of APHIS\u2019s fiscal year 2003 programmatic funds (about $332,000)  to cover DHS\u2019s new responsibility for operations and maintenance at Plum  Island. This change in fiscal year 2003 funding for APHIS occurred because  the Homeland Security Act authorized the President to establish initial  funding for DHS by transferring funds from other agencies. Although  APHIS officials understood that APHIS\u2019s budget for Plum Island would  decrease when operations and maintenance funds were allocated to DHS,  they did not expect this further reduction in programmatic funds.", "APHIS officials noted that although they remain committed to the same  diagnostic priorities at Plum Island, the transfer to DHS has strained their  diagnostic capabilities at Plum Island. They said their plans to hire more  scientists and train more veterinarians to recognize foreign animal diseases  were seriously curtailed because they did not receive the anticipated  increase. The officials told us that anticipated enhancements to the  diagnostic tools at Plum Island would have facilitated a faster response to  an outbreak. In fact, an APHIS official told us that, at current funding  levels, APHIS staff are able to focus only on validating tests for the highest- priority diseases, such as FMD, and that APHIS lacks the staff and  resources to develop tests for other high-priority diseases, such as Rift  Valley fever and other emerging diseases. APHIS officials concluded that  Plum Island, which is the only place in the United States where hands-on  training on high-priority foreign animal diseases affecting livestock can be  provided, lacks the capacity to accommodate the increased demand for  such training. DHS officials noted that, since assuming responsibility for  Plum Island, the agency has funded a pilot program to provide distance  learning via audiovisual equipment. While the distance training does not  provide students with the desirable hands-on experience of observing and  diagnosing foreign animal diseases, DHS stated that this tool has  augmented the capability of the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostician  Course by providing instruction to practitioners in locations beyond Plum  Island.", "Though APHIS funding was reduced after the transfer, DHS has reimbursed  APHIS to perform diagnostic work at Plum Island in fiscal years 2004 and  2005. For example, in fiscal year 2004, DHS and APHIS negotiated an  Economy Act agreement that enabled APHIS to retain eight new  scientists\u2014a key step in carrying out its planned expansion of diagnostic  services. This agreement covered salary and benefits for eight new APHIS  employees rather than ongoing APHIS program costs at Plum Island. The  sum of the 2004 DHS reimbursement and the 2004 allocation to the APHIS  laboratory at Plum Island are roughly equivalent to the APHIS program  budget in the fiscal year before the transfer. However, APHIS officials do  not view these reimbursements\u2014referred to as Economy Act  agreements\u2014as an appropriate way to fund the agency\u2019s diagnostic work.  These officials said that the purpose of the agreements was \u201cto avoid  duplicating functions\u201d performed by the agencies at Plum Island, such as  caring for the animals, and noted that they do not expect to negotiate  additional agreements directly related to the planned expansion. Because  the reimbursements obtained through Economy Act agreements have  decreased in 2005 and recent congressional appropriations have not been  sufficient to support the additional eight scientists, APHIS officials  expressed concern about the agency\u2019s ability to retain these scientists. DHS  officials concurred with APHIS\u2019s view that Economy Act agreements are  not an appropriate way to fund the agency\u2019s diagnostic work at Plum  Island.", "Table 2 summarizes the net effect of the budget reductions and subsequent  funding received through interagency agreements on APHIS\u2019s overall  resources at Plum Island for fiscal years 2002 through 2005."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DHS Continues to Address Infrastructure Needs and Develop Programs Addressing Its Bioterrorism Priorities at Plum Island", "paragraphs": ["As discussed elsewhere in this report, DHS has assumed responsibility for  operations and maintenance at Plum Island and has developed its own  applied research program. As part of the 2003 transfer authorized by the  President, DHS received approximately $33 million for building and facility  funds from ARS and APHIS. In addition to the routine operations and  maintenance needs at the facility, the DHS budget at Plum Island includes  funds that allow the agency to conduct major infrastructure improvements  at the facility. External assessments of the Plum Island facility as well as  the agency\u2019s own evaluation revealed safety and security issues that the  agency needed to resolve. DHS\u2019s budget included $5.9 million in fiscal year  2004 and $12.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to conduct these improvements at  the facility, such as the installation of closed-circuit television surveillance  to control and monitor access to the containment area in the laboratory.", "DHS officials told us that the security and safety upgrades at Plum Island  have increased the funding needs to operate the facility.", "The programmatic funds for DHS\u2014which support the agency\u2019s applied  research science and agricultural forensics work\u2014accounted for $8.3  million of the $51 million total allocated to the agency for Plum Island in  fiscal year 2005. As of August 2005, DHS\u2019s applied research science team\u2014 which focuses primarily on developing vaccines for FMD\u2014included seven  scientists and support staff.

Agency  officials did not consider it prudent to speculate on long-term objectives of  joint work, in part, because DHS plans to replace the existing Plum Island  facility, and aspects of the new facility have not yet been determined.", "Although DHS and USDA officials told us they plan to continue to work  together on FMD, they are currently assessing the longer-term objectives of  future joint work at Plum Island or elsewhere. DHS and USDA have  established FMD as the immediate top priority for Plum Island, but they  have not yet identified which diseases, if any, they will address together  after FMD. In fact, the Joint Strategy provides a blueprint for coordinating  efforts to address FMD but does not currently address work on other  diseases. DHS officials told us that the agency remains committed to  studying the highest-priority livestock diseases at Plum Island and will  decide which diseases to study based on a scientific assessment of the  highest threats. DHS and USDA officials confirmed that if they decide to  conduct joint activities on other diseases, they will rely on the Joint  Strategy and the mechanisms they established to implement this strategy\u2014 such as the Board of Directors\u2014to coordinate the effort.", "DHS officials emphasized that the dynamic nature of threat assessments  makes it difficult to firmly commit to long-term priorities because  information and research needs may change frequently depending on the  nature of the threat. In terms of USDA research priorities, ARS will  establish its research objectives for the next 5 years at the 2005 National  Program review and assessment. An ARS official told us that in the near  term, the agency would like to conduct more work on classical swine fever,  though not at the expense of FMD research. This official noted that no  decisions have been made as to whether DHS will coordinate with ARS to  address classical swine fever, and that the work on this disease has not yet  advanced to a stage that would involve DHS and its applied research  capabilities.", "Several of the experts we interviewed agreed that, currently, the  prioritization of foreign animal disease threats produces the same ranking  of diseases whether the threat is based on an accidental or a deliberate  introduction; therefore, the experts stated that the current focus on FMD  addresses the disease posing the greatest threat through both accidental  and intentional introduction. However, the rise of new threats may disrupt  the alignment of the agencies\u2019 priorities and, in turn, affect the possibility of  joint activities. For example, one top ARS official told us that the agencies\u2019  research and diagnostic priorities at Plum Island may not continue to be so  closely aligned in the future because, in his view, the agencies have  different missions. DHS officials noted that the agencies\u2019 missions are, in  fact, closely aligned because DHS is also responsible for protecting against  the accidental introduction of foreign diseases. They also noted that the  agency\u2019s ranking of diseases would follow a formal risk analysis to  prioritize foreign animal diseases based on threat. Based on our analysis of  documents such as the Joint Strategy for Plum Island, we believe that  DHS\u2019s mission to protect agriculture is more oriented toward intentional  attacks on agriculture, and, therefore, we expect the agency will continue  to focus more on diseases that could be introduced deliberately than on  diseases that could accidentally break out in the United States.", "Furthermore, officials told us it is premature to firmly commit to long-term  objectives of joint work at Plum Island, in part, because DHS has plans to  replace the existing facility with a new, modernized facility. Recognizing  the shortcomings of the laboratory facilities at Plum Island\u2014insufficient  space and outdated infrastructure\u2014a senior DHS official told us the agency  will construct this facility, pending congressional approval, to expand its  capabilities to defend the nation\u2019s agricultural infrastructure against  terrorist attacks.

For example, DHS officials told us the agency has  not determined whether the new facility will address such research gaps as  the lack of an approved laboratory to study highly contagious viruses like  Nipah virus, which require higher biosecurity standards than those in place  at Plum Island.", "Some DHS and USDA officials speculated that the existing ARS and APHIS  programs at Plum Island would move with the DHS applied research  program to the new facility, but regardless of the facility\u2019s location, the  agencies are considering their options.

While Plum Island is the only  facility in the United States where scientists are currently authorized to  study diseases using certain highly contagious pathogens in large animals,  other important work related to these diseases could be conducted in other  institutions. As DHS evaluates the size and capabilities of the new foreign  animal disease facility that the agency estimates will be completed by 2012,  it will be important to explore the cost-effectiveness of shifting some  current work, such as research that does not involve the use of live agents,  to other laboratories and reserve the limited laboratory space at Plum  Island for work that can only be performed in that facility."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendation for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To make more effective use of Plum Island\u2019s limited laboratory space in the  short term, we recommend that DHS\u2019s Science and Technology Directorate,  in consultation with USDA\u2019s Agricultural Research Service and the Animal  and Plant Health Inspection Service, pursue opportunities to shift work  that does not require the unique features of Plum Island to other  institutions and research centers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DHS and USDA for their review and  comment.", "DHS generally concurred with the report and said that it accurately reflects  the current relationships and coordination between DHS and USDA at  Plum Island.

However, we  continue to believe that DHS\u2019s mission to protect agriculture is more  oriented toward intentional attacks on agriculture. First, the Homeland  Security Act of 2002 states that DHS\u2019s primary mission is to prevent  terrorist attacks within the United States. Second, the information  DHS provided about its role at Plum Island has emphasized deliberate  introductions. For example, the Joint Strategy emphasizes the  bioterrorism focus of DHS work at Plum Island in describing the  agency\u2019s mission \u201cto conduct, stimulate, and enable research and  development to prevent or mitigate the effects of catastrophic  terrorism.\u201d The Joint Strategy also states that DHS will \u201cfocus on  identified research and development gaps specifically targeted to  strengthen the nation\u2019s ability to anticipate, prevent, respond to, and  recover from the intentional introduction of a high consequence foreign  animal disease.\u201d      3.
