Specifically, GAO found that for the five air carriers selected for analysis, TSA performed approximately half of air carrier inspections in Cuba at the frequency established in its standard operating procedures in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Of the inspections TSA did not perform, over half were not performed because TSA was not able to identify or reliably track U.S.-bound public charter operations from Cuba. Improving TSA's ability to identify public charters requiring inspection in Cuba and implementing a tool it is currently developing that more reliably tracks air carrier operations would better position TSA to meet its goal of inspecting all air carriers operating U.S.-bound public charter flights from Cuba at the frequency established in its standard operating procedures.", "Several of the Cuban airports TSA assessed in fiscal years 2012 through 2017 were fully compliant with International Civil Aviation Organization Standards at the time of assessment.

ICAO  standards and recommended practices address operational issues at an  airport, such as ensuring that passengers and baggage are properly  screened and that unauthorized individuals do not have access to  restricted areas of an airport. ICAO standards also address non- operational issues, such as whether a foreign government has  implemented a national civil aviation security program for regulating  security procedures at its airports and whether airport officials  implementing security controls are subject to background investigations,  are appropriately trained, and are certified according to a foreign  government\u2019s national civil aviation security program.", "TSA utilizes 44 ICAO standards and recommended practices it sees as  most critical in conducting its foreign airport assessments, which cover  broad categories, including: passenger and cabin baggage security; and quality control.", "TSA uses a risk-informed approach to schedule foreign airport  assessments across all foreign locations, including Cuba. TSA defines  risk as a function of threat, vulnerability, and consequence. The agency  uses various data sources to assess the likelihood of a location being  targeted by bad actors, the protective measures in place to prevent an  attack, and the impact of the loss from a potential attack.

In general, public charter flights  are operated by air carriers but arranged or sponsored by a charter  operator. Consistent with scheduled service, TSA requires air carriers  operating U.S.-bound public charters to adopt and implement a TSA- approved security program. For inspection purposes, TSA does not  differentiate between scheduled service and public charter service and  inspects these operations to the same TSA security program  requirements.", "According to TSA\u2019s Operational Implementation Plans for fiscal years  2012 through 2016, TSA\u2019s stated objective was to inspect 100 percent of  air carriers operating U.S.-bound flights from foreign locations at the frequency established in its standard operating procedures. Specifically,  depending on an airport\u2019s vulnerability rating, TSA\u2019s standard operating  procedures provide that air carriers are to be inspected on either an  annual or semi-annual basis. However, our analysis of TSA inspection  data during fiscal years 2012 through 2016 identified that among the air  carriers we selected for our analysis, TSA conducted little over half of the  required inspections in Cuba at the frequency established in its standard  operating procedures. For example, our analysis revealed that TSA  inspected an air carrier in September 2013 and April 2015, but did not do  so in fiscal year 2014\u2014a year in which this air carrier operated a total of  127 U.S.-bound flights.", "In response to our analysis, TSA officials explained that host government  requests to reschedule inspections and the flight schedule data used to  track public charter flights hinder TSA\u2019s efforts to inspect 100 percent of  air carriers operating U.S.-bound public charter flights in Cuba. Among  the air carriers we selected for our analysis, TSA officials told us that 10  of the required air carrier inspections were not conducted at the  established frequency due to external factors, including host government  requests to reschedule TSA inspections. The officials told us that when  planned air carrier inspections are deferred, TSA works with the host  government to reschedule the inspection as close as possible to the  original inspection date. In some instances, TSA has been unable to  reschedule air carrier inspections within the specified time frame based  on their risk level, and as a result, did not conduct the air carrier  inspection at the established frequency.", "For example, TSA officials told us that the Cuban Government deferred  air carrier inspections planned for June 2015 at one airport to November  2015 (in fiscal year 2016). Although TSA completed these inspections as  rescheduled, the inspections were not conducted at this airport in fiscal  year 2015, as required by its standard operating procedures. In another  example, the officials told us that TSA did not conduct air carrier  inspections at an airport in fiscal year 2014 because of deferrals and  logistical challenges that hampered its attempt to reschedule. As a result,  TSA did not conduct air carrier inspections at this airport\u2014originally  planned for July 2014\u2014until 9 months later.", "Further, the flight schedule data TSA uses do not reliably identify and  track public charter operations in Cuba. In an effort to conduct 100  percent of air carrier inspections due for completion each fiscal year, TSA  develops an annual Master Work Plan which it uses to schedule air  carrier inspections in Cuba and other foreign locations at the start of each  fiscal year. According to TSA officials, TSA inspectors develop the Master  Work Plan by collecting flight schedule data from a variety of sources,  including past plans, past inspection data, Wikipedia, Secure Flight data,  bi-annual flight schedules provided by air carriers, and airline and airport  websites, among others, to identify the universe of air carriers requiring  inspection in the upcoming fiscal year and track flight schedules.", "However, TSA officials told us that these flight schedule data are not  always reliable and provide limited visibility into the universe of air carriers  operating U.S-bound public charter flights from Cuba. For example, the  flight schedule data TSA currently uses may fail to identify that an air  carrier is operating U.S.-bound flights from a specific Cuban airport. In  one such instance, TSA officials told us that during a planned air carrier  inspection at one Cuban airport, TSA inspectors learned that the air  carrier they intended to inspect had contracted with a different air carrier  to operate the flight on its behalf. TSA was previously unaware that the air  carrier contracted to operate the flight was operating U.S.-bound flights  from that Cuban airport and proceeded to inspect it.", "Although external factors, including host government deferrals and flight  schedule data, are outside of TSA\u2019s control, TSA officials acknowledged  that a tool that better corroborates and validates the flight schedule data it  uses to track air carriers requiring inspection each fiscal year would  improve the reliability of these data and help TSA ensure air carrier  inspections in Cuba occur at the frequency established in its standard  operating procedures. As of January 2018, TSA officials told us they were  developing a new tool intended to more reliably track flight schedules  worldwide. Specifically, TSA officials told us that this tool is intended to  analyze the aggregate flight data it currently uses and corroborate and  validate flight schedule information. According to TSA officials, the tool  may help improve the reliability of the flight schedule data TSA uses to  track air carriers requiring inspection each fiscal year. However, since this  tool is still under development, TSA has yet to demonstrate whether it will  ultimately improve the reliability of flight schedule data among public  charters in Cuba. Further, since the tool relies on the data sources TSA  already uses, the tool is unlikely to provide TSA with improved visibility  into the universe of U.S.-bound public charters requiring inspection  beyond those operations of which TSA is already aware.", "Without the ability to reliably identify and track U.S.-bound public charter  operations in Cuba, TSA will be at risk of continuing to fall short of its  stated goal of completing 100 percent of required air carrier inspections  and, therefore, cannot ensure that all air carriers are implementing TSA  security requirements for U.S.-bound flights departing Cuba. Developing  and implementing a tool that corroborates and validates the data TSA  currently uses can help TSA improve its ability to track flight schedules  and schedule inspection visits to coincide with air carrier operations.  Taking additional steps to better identify the universe of air carriers  operating U.S.-bound flights from Cuba can provide TSA with greater  assurance that it is accurately identifying all air carriers operating U.S.- bound flights from Cuba that require inspection. These steps can better  position TSA to meet its goal of inspecting all air carriers operating U.S.- bound public charter flights from Cuba to the United States at least once  per year\u2014as established in its standard operating procedures\u2014and help  them ensure that these air carriers are implementing TSA security  requirements."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "TSA Assessments of Cuban Airport Security Found Mixed Levels of Compliance", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "TSA Found Mixed Levels of Compliance with ICAO Standards and Recommended Practices at Cuban Airports", "paragraphs": ["TSA found mixed levels of compliance with ICAO standards and  recommended practices at Cuban airports during fiscal years 2012  through 2017.

A result of no  findings means that TSA inspectors determined that air carriers operating  these flights fully implemented all requirements in their TSA-approved  security program at the time of inspection. For example, air carriers fully  implemented security requirements such as access controls, area  security, and checked baggage screening. TSA also found that air  carriers generally implemented requirements concerning signs and  notifications, passenger screening, and aircraft search at the time of  inspection. For the one-third of inspections where air carriers had not fully  implemented requirements, issues ranged from failure to notify U.S.- bound passengers that carry-on items and checked baggage are subject  to search to inadequate aircraft searches. TSA subsequently closed each  finding after the respective air carriers took corrective actions. These  findings include:  Bilingual Signs/Notifications: TSA inspectors discovered that air  carriers at several airports failed to properly notify U.S.-bound passengers  that all carry-on items and checked baggage are subject to search. TSA  inspectors resolved each violation with on-the-spot counseling and  recommended that Cuba\u2019s airport security agency, the Empresa Cubana  de Aeropuerto y Servicios Aeron\u00e1uticos (ECASA), post signs at the ticket  counters or verbally advise U.S.-bound passengers that their property is  subject to search and subsequently closed each finding.

In general, air carriers are required to designate a  trained GSC for each U.S.-bound scheduled and public charter flight.  Each designated GSC serves as the air carrier\u2019s authorized  representative for all security-related matters and must be present at the  airport from the time the air carrier opens the first ticket counter for the  day until the air carrier\u2019s last flight scheduled for that day departs. For  each U.S.-bound flight, designated GSCs are responsible for reviewing  the implementation of relevant security requirements, including those  outlined in each air carrier\u2019s TSA-approved security program, such as the  screening of passengers and checked baggage, aircraft security, and the  prevention of unauthorized access to secure areas of the airport. Air  carrier officials we spoke with told us that they generally contract with  locally based GSCs or directly employ GSCs at foreign locations to serve  as their authorized representatives and oversee security matters for each  U.S.-bound flight.", "However, air carriers operating at Cuban airports have been unable to  designate their own GSCs to review security matters for U.S.-bound  flights for two reasons. First, the Government of Cuba controls most  sectors of the economy and employs the majority of the Cuban workforce.  As a result, according to an airline official we spoke with, there are no  private security firms or trained GSCs in Cuba that air carriers can  contract with to serve as their authorized representatives and review  security matters for each U.S.-bound flight at Cuban airports. Second,  TSA officials told us that the Government of Cuba employs Aviation  Security Technicians (AST) to review security matters for each U.S.- bound flight at Cuban airports. According to these officials, ASTs undergo  a training regimen similar to that of a GSC and can execute GSC roles  and responsibilities. As a result, the Government of Cuba has not allowed  air carriers to permanently station air carrier-employed GSCs at Cuban  airports because, according to TSA officials, it believes ASTs already  provide for these roles and responsibilities.", "Prior to the resumption of regularly scheduled commercial service  between the United States and Cuba in August 2016, TSA responded to  this issue by approving amendments to each air carrier\u2019s security  program. These amendments allowed air carriers operating in Cuba to  utilize Cuban ASTs instead of their own designated GSCs to oversee  security matters for each U.S.-bound flight at Cuban airports, provided  ASTs are trained to execute all GSC functions in accordance with TSA  requirements. Under these amendments, according to TSA officials,  Cuban ASTs were responsible for overseeing security measures  including Secure Flight prescreening as well as passenger and checked  baggage screening, among others, whereas the air carriers were  responsible for performing security measures aboard the aircraft,  including cabin searches and preventing unauthorized access to the  aircraft, among others. An official from one air carrier we spoke with  stated that they found AST performance to be at least equivalent in  quality to the performance of GSCs they contract with at other foreign  airports.", "TSA officials anticipated that once regularly scheduled commercial  service between the United States and Cuba commenced in August,  2016, the Government of Cuba would permit air carriers to designate their  own GSCs to review security matters for each U.S.-bound flight at Cuban  airports. As a result, TSA determined that it would not renew the existing  amendments, but would permit both U.S.-bound scheduled commercial  and public charters to operate under the existing amendment until it  expired in September 2017. However, TSA officials told us that during a  meeting in Havana in October 2016, the Government of Cuba informed  TSA and air carriers that ASTs would continue to perform GSC functions  at Cuban airports and that air carrier personnel were not authorized to  perform GSC functions within Cuba. In August 2017, the Government of  Cuba reiterated that it would not permit air carriers to designate GSCs at  Cuban airports and that Cuban ASTs would continue executing these  functions. In light of the situation, TSA decided in September 2017 to  renew the amendments to air carriers\u2019 programs allowing them to  continue utilizing ASTs instead of their own designated GSCs at Cuban  airports. These new amendments will expire in September 2019, at which  point TSA, air carriers, and the Government of Cuba may revisit the GSC  issue."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Since 2007, TSA\u2019s air carrier inspections have played a vital role in  ensuring that air carriers operating U.S.-bound flights from Cuba meet  security requirements designed to further ensure civil aviation security  keep passengers out of harm\u2019s way. These inspections allow TSA to  identify security deficiencies and help air carriers address them through,  for example, on-the-spot counseling. Exemplifying the importance of  these inspections, TSA aims to inspect each air carrier operating flights  from Cuba to the United States at each airport from which flights operate,  in accordance with its standard operating procedures. However, for the  air carriers selected for our analysis, many of the inspections in fiscal  years 2012 through 2016 did not take place within the established time  frames.", "While delays in inspections can occur due to deferments from host  governments, our analysis revealed that many air carrier inspections that  did not occur within the required time frames were because the flight  schedule data TSA uses do not reliably identify or track public charter  operations\u2014which account for the majority of flights between the United  States and Cuba in fiscal years 2012 through 2016. Without the ability to  reliably identify and track U.S.-bound public charter operations in Cuba,  TSA will be at risk of continuing to fall short of its stated goal of  completing 100 percent of required air carrier inspections and, therefore,  cannot ensure air carriers are implementing TSA security requirements  for U.S.-bound flights departing Cuba. TSA has a tool under development  that if successfully implemented, may help corroborate and validate the  flight schedule data TSA uses and assist TSA in more reliably tracking  U.S.-bound public charters from Cuba.

In its response letter, DHS described the challenges it faces in  scheduling inspections for air carriers that have entered into lease or  codeshare agreements with other carriers. We acknowledge the  challenges TSA faces in identifying the correct flights and responsible  regulated parties when scheduling inspections under the conditions  described and are encouraged by TSA\u2019s planned steps to better identify  public charter flight operations and shared flights.", "DHS\u2019s response letter describes steps that TSA is taking to develop a tool  that aims to better analyze flight data to use in scheduling inspections and  prompts manual confirmation of flight information when the automated  system identifies lower confidence of flight operations. During the course  of our review, TSA described this concept and explained how it plans to  use it to better identify scheduled flights for air carrier inspections.  However, as DHS indicates in its response letter, TSA is still exploring  how to best integrate public charter flights into this tool. DHS also  described planned improvement to TSA\u2019s Master Work Plan (MWP) to  corroborate and validate flight schedule data. While DHS does not specify  what these improvements include and how they will lead to more reliable  tracking of air carriers\u2019 public charter operations between the United  States and Cuba, we agree that improving the scheduling tool that is used  to plan inspections is a good place to start.", "DHS also described planned updates to the rules that guide the  management of data in its MWP. Specifically, TSA plans to record  anomalies in operations identified before, during, and after visits, such as  trip dates that were changed or air carriers that were scheduled to be  inspected, but were not, as well as the reason why. Our analysis  discovered some of these anomalies and explaining them required TSA  to engage in a lengthy process of tracking down historical information that  was not readily available. These improvements, if implemented, will be a  helpful step in providing better historical information to track and validate  carrier operations. Finally, DHS described TSA\u2019s plans to work with  aircraft operators, foreign air carriers, and U.S. Government agencies to  directly obtain flight information.", "These efforts, if implemented as planned, represent a positive step for  TSA in corroborating and validating flight schedule data to more reliably  track air carriers\u2019 public charter operations between the United States and  Cuba.

We also reviewed various TSA  documents on program management and strategic planning, including  TSA\u2019s master work plans for scheduling air foreign airport assessments  and air carrier inspections. Specifically, we reviewed TSA\u2019s 2016  standard operating procedures, which prescribes program and  operational guidance for assessing security measures at foreign airports  and inspecting air carriers and inform TSA personnel at all levels of what  is expected of them in the implementation of the program. We also  reviewed TSA\u2019s Operational Implementation Plans, which establish  program goals. In addition, we reviewed the job aids that TSA inspectors  use during each assessment and inspection, which are intended to  ensure that the TSA-specified International Civil Aviation Organization  (ICAO) aviation security standards and recommended practices and air  carrier implementation of TSA security requirements are fully evaluated  during each assessment and inspection.", "To understand how TSA assesses and manages its Cuban airport and air  carrier risk information, we obtained and reviewed documents on TSA\u2019s  methodology for assigning individual risk rankings (called tier rankings) to  each Cuban airport it assesses. We also, interviewed TSA officials  located at headquarters and in the field and interviewed other federal  stakeholders, such as the Department of State and the Department of  Transportation (DOT). Lastly, to obtain air carriers\u2019 perspectives on  aviation security in Cuba, we interviewed representatives from three air  carriers that DOT licensed to operate scheduled commercial flights  between the United States and Cuba.

For each finding resulting from Cuban airport  assessments and air carrier inspections we reviewed, we examined the  extent to which TSA followed its SOPs when following up and closing  findings. We also analyzed Cuban airport assessment and air carrier inspection data to determine if TSA performed each assessment and  inspection at the frequency established in its SOPs.
