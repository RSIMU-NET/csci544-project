Strategic planning helps agencies like CDC sustain a workforce with the necessary education, skills, and competencies--human capital--to fulfill their missions. In September 2007, CDC released its Strategic Human Capital Management Plan (CDC Plan). GAO was asked to review CDC's human capital planning. GAO determined (1) whether the CDC Plan was designed to address the human capital challenges CDC faces; (2) the extent to which the CDC Plan is strategically aligned with agency goals, plans, and budget; and (3) the extent to which CDC incorporated GAO's principles for strategic human capital planning. To do so, GAO interviewed officials and analyzed data and documents."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["GAO identified six key challenges CDC faces in its efforts to sustain a skilled workforce to fulfill its mission and goals, and the CDC Plan includes strategies that could help the agency address five of them. These challenges are (1) changing workforce demographics, highlighted by the potential loss of essential personnel due to retirement; (2) the limited supply of skilled public health professionals; (3) CDC's acknowledged need to increase the diversity of its workforce; (4) changing workforce needs resulting from the agency's expanding scope of work and responsibilities; (5) logistical difficulties involved in acquiring and retaining a skilled workforce; and (6) difficulties presented by managing a workforce with a large and growing number of contractors. While the CDC Plan includes strategies designed to address the first five challenges, it does not address the challenge involving contractors, which represent more than one-third of its workforce. Thus, the CDC Plan may not be as useful as it could be to provide a strategic view of its contractor workforce and to assist the agency with managing all of its human capital. The CDC Plan only partially meets the criteria for strategic alignment: the strategies in it are linked with the agency's mission and goals, but they are not integrated with the documents that serve as the strategic plan, performance plan, or budget. According to CDC officials, the agency will update the CDC Plan annually and will integrate it with these documents as it is updated. CDC incorporated aspects of all of GAO's principles of strategic human capital planning into the CDC Plan and has outlined intended actions that could further incorporate the principles in subsequent updates. CDC partially incorporated the first principle--to involve managers, other employees, and stakeholders in developing, communicating, and implementing the human capital plan--by formally involving management and stakeholders in plan development. CDC intends to involve other employees in implementation and future updates. CDC partially incorporated the second principle--to determine the skills and competencies needed to achieve agency mission and goals, including identifying skill and competency gaps--by conducting a preliminary workforce analysis. The agency had not completed its analyses of skill and competency gaps for the occupations it deemed most critical when the plan was developed, but has now completed an analysis for one critical occupation and is conducting others. The plan partially follows the third principle--to develop strategies to acquire, retain, and develop a skilled workforce and to address gaps. CDC developed strategies for its plan and intends to target gaps once they are identified. CDC has incorporated the fourth principle--to build capabilities to support the strategies--through such activities as ongoing efforts to streamline hiring. The fifth principle is to monitor and evaluate the contribution that strategies have made toward achieving mission and goals. The agency indicated in the CDC Plan that it intends to monitor and evaluate its strategies as part of its implementation activities. Further incorporation of GAO's principles into plan updates could help the agency strengthen its human capital efforts."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With an annual budget of about $8.6 billion, the Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC) has a mission to promote health and quality  of life by preventing and controlling disease, injury, and disability. The  agency\u2019s scope of work and responsibilities\u2014as one of the major  operational divisions of the Department of Health and Human Services  (HHS)\u2014have expanded over the years in concert with new and emerging  infectious diseases such as avian influenza, and health threats, including  bioterrorism. CDC\u2019s ability to fulfill its mission and address its expanded  scope of work and responsibilities depends on whether it can sustain its  human capital\u2014a workforce with the necessary education, knowledge,  skills, and competencies. However, concerns have begun to surface about  CDC\u2019s management of its workforce. For example, the Office of Personnel  Management\u2019s (OPM) 2006 Federal Human Capital Survey noted a CDC- wide decrease in staff satisfaction with the agency between 2004 and  2006. Reports issued by CDC\u2019s Ombudsman Office in 2007 delineated staff  concerns about personnel problems and the workplace environment.", "Additionally, media reports have highlighted several issues related to  CDC\u2019s workforce, such as stories in 2005 and 2006 on the loss of senior  leadership and key scientists and a 2007 journal article discussing  problems with morale at the agency.", "CDC\u2019s workforce consists of employees in about 168 occupations,  including physicians, statisticians, epidemiologists, and laboratory  experts. This workforce consists of full- and part-time federal staff\u2014Civil  Service or U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps\u2014and  contractors. In fiscal year 2007, CDC\u2019s workforce included 9,000 federal  staff and an estimated 5,000 contracted staff. Of the federal staff, about  two-thirds worked in CDC\u2019s headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia. In addition,  about 2,500 employees worked at other locations in the United States, and  about 200 federal staff worked in 50 foreign countries. The estimated 5,000  contractors worked in various locations and occupations throughout the  agency.", "Managing a complex federal agency such as CDC requires strategic human  capital planning\u2014the systematic assessment of current and future human  capital needs and the development of long-term strategies to address any  identified gaps\u2014in order to optimize workforce performance to achieve  the agency\u2019s mission and goals. In past work, we noted that effective  strategic human capital planning requires strategic alignment. Strategic  alignment exists when an agency\u2019s human capital strategies are linked  with its mission and goals and integrated with its strategic plan,  performance plan, and budget. It is important because it allows agencies  to assess and understand the extent to which their workforce contributes  to achieving their overarching mission and goals. We also noted in our  prior work that strategic human capital planning should incorporate five  principles, which are (1) involving top management, managers, other  employees, and stakeholders in developing, communicating, and  implementing the human capital plan; (2) determining the skills and  competencies needed to achieve an agency\u2019s mission and goals, including  identifying gaps in these skills and competencies; (3) developing strategies  to acquire, retain, and develop a skilled workforce and to address gaps in  skills and competencies; (4) building capabilities needed to support the  strategies; and (5) monitoring and evaluating the contribution that  strategies have made toward achieving the agency\u2019s mission and goals.", "We have previously identified strategic human capital management as a  governmentwide high-risk area. We found that a lack of attention to  strategic human capital planning is a pervasive problem in the federal  government and creates a risk to its ability to effectively serve the  American people and to address the challenges of the 21st century. In a  January 2004 report on CDC\u2019s management, we noted that while CDC was  facing several human capital challenges, including the loss through  retirement of a key portion of its workforce that possessed both  managerial and technical expertise, CDC had suspended development of  its human capital plan. At that time, we recommended that CDC ensure  that its human capital planning efforts receive appropriate leadership  attention, including resuming human capital planning and linking these  efforts to the agency\u2019s strategic plan. CDC resumed its strategic human  capital planning, and in September 2007 released its Strategic Human  Capital Management Plan (CDC Plan).", "Given your interest in strategic human capital planning in federal agencies  that heavily rely on a scientific, technical, and engineering-based  workforce, you asked us to review human capital planning at CDC. We  determined (1) whether the CDC Plan was designed to address the human  capital challenges CDC faces in sustaining a skilled workforce; (2) the  extent to which the strategies in the CDC Plan are linked with the agency\u2019s  mission and goals and integrated with its strategic plan, performance plan,  and budget, that is, the extent to which the plan is strategically aligned;  and (3) the extent to which CDC incorporated our five principles for  strategic human capital planning into its plan.", "To determine whether the CDC Plan was designed to address the human  capital challenges CDC faces in sustaining a skilled workforce, we  analyzed information collected from interviews we conducted with  officials from CDC, HHS, OPM, and CDC\u2019s external partners, which  include policy research and professional associations that work with the  agency. We corroborated testimonial evidence from our interviews with  analysis of relevant documents, such as reports on the public health  workforce, and workforce statistics and retirement eligibility data  computed by CDC. On the basis of our review and analysis of these  workforce data and our interviews with CDC officials, we determined that  the data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of this report. We used  this information to identify the challenges faced by CDC and then analyzed  the CDC Plan to determine whether it was designed to address the  challenges. To determine the extent to which the CDC Plan meets criteria  for strategic alignment, we interviewed CDC and HHS officials and  analyzed the CDC Plan and OPM\u2019s Human Capital Assessment and  Accountability Framework (HCAAF), which provides guidance on human  capital planning and management. We also analyzed other relevant CDC  and HHS documents. To determine the extent to which CDC incorporated  our five principles for strategic human capital planning, we examined the  CDC Plan and interviewed officials from CDC and HHS\u2019s Atlanta Human  Resources Center (AHRC), a stakeholder in CDC\u2019s human capital planning.  We also analyzed related documents about CDC\u2019s workforce and training  efforts and past and planned strategies to acquire, retain, and develop  CDC\u2019s workforce; new systems, programs, and processes that support  human capital planning; and efforts to monitor and evaluate the agency\u2019s  human capital efforts.

HCAAF is intended to assist federal agencies with their human capital  planning process, including developing strategies that support each  agency\u2019s mission and goals. HCAAF outlines an ongoing process of human  capital planning for five elements: (1) strategic alignment, (2) leadership  and knowledge management, (3) results-oriented performance culture,   (4) talent management, and (5) accountability.

As of the end of  fiscal year 2007, about 27 percent of CDC\u2019s overall workforce was eligible  for retirement within the next 5 years. For CDC\u2019s three most-populated  occupations\u2014general health scientist, public health analyst, and medical  officer\u2014the percentages of employees eligible for retirement in the next   5 years were 20 percent, 22 percent, and 34 percent, respectively.  Collectively, these three occupations account for 34 percent of CDC\u2019s  workforce eligible to retire within the next 5 years. The potential loss of so  many essential personnel creates a challenge for CDC because it could  result in a shortfall of staff with the experience and skills needed to fulfill  CDC\u2019s mission and goals. For example, one of the most-populated  occupations is medical officer, which is a difficult position to fill due to a  shortage of physicians with specific training in public health.", "The limited supply of skilled public health professionals is the second  challenge we identified. According to reports issued by CDC, the Institute  of Medicine, and the American Public Health Association, federal, state,  and local agencies are experiencing workforce shortages, some of which  are severe, in many of the public health professions vital to CDC. For  example, epidemiologists play an important role in responding to  emerging infectious diseases. However, states have reported needing more  epidemiologists than are currently available in the workforce. In addition  to shortages of public health physicians and epidemiologists noted in  these reports, other shortages occur in the positions of public health  informatics specialists, laboratory scientists, and environmental health  specialists.", "The third challenge that CDC faces is its acknowledged need to increase  the diversity of its workforce. Results from OPM\u2019s Federal Human Capital  Surveys showed a decrease from 2004 to 2006 in the percentage of staff  who agreed that CDC management worked well with employees of  different backgrounds and was committed to creating a diverse  workforce. CDC officials acknowledged that the agency\u2019s workforce was  not as diverse as it could be and told us the agency needs to improve its  recruitment of Hispanics and persons with disabilities. However, in its  plan, CDC noted that establishing a diverse workforce is a challenge for  several reasons. For example, technical skills and education levels vary  across racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic groups, which in turn can have  an impact on the pool of qualified job applicants from which to hire.", "CDC\u2019s fourth challenge is the changing workforce needs resulting from the  agency\u2019s expanding scope of work and responsibilities. For example, the  globalization of health threats has increased CDC\u2019s responsibility to  prepare for and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. In 2003 the rapid  spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Asia showed that  disease outbreaks pose an immediate threat beyond the borders of the  country where they originate. For this reason, CDC needs a workforce that  is capable of working with global partners, such as other countries\u2019  ministries of health, to expand surveillance systems used to detect and  respond quickly to outbreaks. In addition, throughout the SARS outbreak,  CDC was the foremost participant in the multinational response effort,  with CDC officials constituting about two-thirds of the public health  experts deployed to affected areas. CDC\u2019s significant role in the SARS  response highlights the agency\u2019s expanding need for a workforce that is  capable of rapidly responding to international public health emergencies.", "A fifth challenge that CDC faces is logistical difficulties involved in  acquiring and retaining a skilled workforce, including problems with the  hiring process and difficulties associated with retaining employees for  international positions. For example, from fiscal year 2003 to fiscal year  2007, CDC did not meet its 2007 goal of hiring new employees in an  average of 58 days or fewer; instead, during this time, it has averaged  between 73 and 92 days to hire each new employee. HHS and CDC  officials told us that logistical difficulties were exacerbated when hiring  responsibilities were centralized from CDC to HHS and the human  resources staff was reduced from 178 to 105 people. Logistical difficulties  have also hindered CDC\u2019s efforts to sustain international positions. For  example, HHS officials told us the process to approve and hire staff for  overseas positions can take 9 months to 1 year. Officials added that part of  this process\u2014the amount of time it takes to get an individual approved,  including obtaining clearance through the Department of State\u2014can be  particularly problematic because an individual may lose interest and  accept another employment offer. In addition, retaining staff can be  difficult because international programs have few opportunities for  promotion.", "The sixth challenge we identified is the difficulties presented by managing  a workforce with a large and growing number of contractors. From fiscal  year 2000 through fiscal year 2006, the estimated number of contractors  working at CDC increased 139 percent, while CDC\u2019s federal staff increased  by 3.5 percent. CDC officials told us that using contractors is beneficial,  particularly because they can be brought on board quickly to fill an  immediate need for specific skills. For example, as of August 2007 over   75 percent of employees in the National Center for Public Health  Informatics were contractors because the area is a relatively new field and  the skills needed are constantly changing. (See app. III for more  information on CDC\u2019s workforce and the number of contractors within  each organizational unit.) While there are benefits to using contractors,  there are also concerns. For example, CDC officials told us that because  contractors are not CDC employees, the agency does not control certain  aspects of their employment, such as diversity or training, and does not  technically supervise their work. For instance, if a CDC manager  determines that the work provided by a contractor is unsatisfactory, the  manager has to communicate his or her concerns to the contractor\u2019s firm  instead of directly addressing the contractor. Moreover, CDC does not  fund training to assist contractors in improving their work. CDC officials  also told us that data collection on how contractors are used within the  agency is primarily decentralized and not systematically monitored at an  agencywide level. CDC has begun collecting more data on contractors  across the agency because of increased security needs. Understanding  how contractors are used across the agency is important to ensure their  appropriate use and oversight. For example, federal regulations call for  enhanced oversight of contracts for services that could potentially  influence the authority, accountability, and responsibilities of government  officials. Issues may arise when contractors have been involved in  activities relating to policy development, reorganization and planning,  technical advice or assistance, developing or providing information  regarding regulations, or preparing budgets. Because CDC lacks  information on how its contractors are used across the agency, it may not  be able to ensure adequate oversight of contractors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CDC Plan Includes Strategies to Address Five Human Capital Challenges, but Not the Challenge of Managing a Workforce with a Large and Growing Number of Contractors", "paragraphs": ["CDC developed strategies to address the human capital challenges  described by the agency in the CDC Plan, which correspond to five of the  six challenges we identified.

On the basis of our analysis of the  CDC Plan and additional documentation, we found that the CDC Plan  contains strategies that could help address the first five challenges we  identified. According to CDC officials, the CDC Plan does not include  strategies to address the challenge of managing a workforce with a large  and growing number of contractors\u2014our sixth challenge\u2014because CDC  wanted to follow HHS guidance, under which contractors are not  considered part of the HHS workforce, and to maintain consistency with  the department in the treatment of contractors.", "However, without considering the challenge of managing a workforce with  a large and growing number of contractors and without developing related  strategies, the CDC Plan excludes any efforts to address more than one- third of the total workforce. As a result, it may not be as useful as it could  be in assisting the agency with improvements in human capital  management. For example, CDC cannot fully assess the human capital  available across the agency and how it is assisting the agency in meeting  its expanding scope of work and responsibilities without understanding  how contractors are used across the agency and what gaps in skills and  competencies they are filling. Because CDC does not monitor the use of  contractors agencywide, the agency\u2019s ability to determine the appropriate  balance of government-performed and contractor-performed services is  hindered. CDC\u2019s lack of information to oversee contractors agencywide is  also a problem because, as our reviews of other agencies have shown,  adequate oversight of contractors is critical to ensure that they are  producing outcomes to achieve the agencies\u2019 respective missions and  goals and the agencies are not risking having mission-related decisions  influenced by contractor judgment."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Strategies in the CDC Plan Are Linked with CDC\u2019s Mission and Goals but Are Not Integrated with Its Strategic Plan, Performance Plan, or Budget", "paragraphs": ["The CDC Plan partially meets criteria for strategic alignment.

Further, the plan integrates  CDC\u2019s Health Protection Goals and the Organizational Excellence  Assessment, which CDC uses to measure its progress toward meeting the  Health Protection Goals.

For the second principle, CDC  conducted a preliminary workforce analysis, but it has not completed the  analysis of gaps in skills and competencies. However, CDC intends to  conduct additional analyses and plans to use them in subsequent plan  updates.

AHRC  participated as part of the Management Council. A CDC official involved  in creating the plan briefed members of the board and councils on the  outline of the plan while it was being developed, and members  subsequently reviewed and provided recommendations on drafts of the  plan. Additionally, OWCD officials worked with selected members of the  board and the Management Council in developing some of the strategies.  CDC officials told us they did not formally involve nonsupervisory  employees in the development of the plan. For example, managers in the  diversity office informally shared the CDC Plan with nonsupervisory  employees during its development. In our prior work on the principles, we  found that involving such employees on strategic workforce planning  teams can identify new ways to streamline processes and improve human  capital strategies. Nonsupervisory employee involvement in the  development of the human capital plan can also garner support for  proposed changes and help an agency develop clear and transparent  procedures to implement strategies.", "CDC officials told us that they intended to communicate the CDC Plan  within the agency and to involve nonsupervisory employees in  implementing and updating it. The CDC Plan has been approved by the  Director of CDC and after final clearance will be communicated via CDC\u2019s  intranet site and an intranet article, or through an e-mail message to all  agency employees. CDC officials said that, in addition to top management,  other agency managers, and stakeholders, they intended to involve  nonsupervisory employees in implementing the plan and updating it in the  future. For example, OWCD has conducted several focus groups with  employees regarding the results of the 2006 Federal Human Capital  Survey, and CDC officials indicated that the findings from these focus  groups would be considered in updating strategies in future updates of the  CDC Plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CDC Conducted a Preliminary Workforce Analysis and Is Completing Efforts to Identify Gaps in Skills and Competencies", "paragraphs": ["CDC has begun to incorporate the second principle\u2014determining the  skills and competencies needed to achieve the mission and goals,  including identifying gaps in these skills and competencies\u2014by  conducting a preliminary workforce analysis and is working to complete  analyses to identify gaps in skills and competencies. In this preliminary  analysis, CDC determined useful information regarding its workforce,  including the number of individuals in each occupation, the size and  diversity of its workforce, agencywide retirement eligibility, and the  number of mission-critical occupations in each coordinating center and  coordinating office. However, CDC has not completed competency gap  analyses for its employees to determine whether employees have the skills  needed to perform effectively, and to identify any gaps between their  current skill levels and skills needed in the future. In 2006, CDC conducted  a competency gap analysis for one of its mission-critical occupations, and  it has begun competency gap analyses for its other mission-critical  occupations.", "In addition, CDC plans to conduct additional workforce analyses, which it  anticipates completing in fiscal year 2008, as part of the workforce  planning process outlined in the CDC Plan. Prior to the CDC Plan, each  coordinating center and coordinating office conducted its own workforce  planning activities, resulting in wide variability across the agency. CDC  has implemented standardized procedures for its workforce planning  process, by developing a consistent methodology and approach for  workforce analyses to be used throughout the agency. As part of the  agencywide methodology, the coordinating centers and coordinating  offices have been asked to provide information about how federal  employees and contractors are used to meet their needs. Additionally,  OWCD has developed a standardized template for the coordinating centers  and coordinating offices to use to collect data on employees\u2019 skills and  competencies.

However, the plan\u2019s strategies may  have limitations in how well they address skill and competency gaps,  because they were developed before the agency finished its gap analyses.", "Developing new strategies to acquire and retain staff is important because  CDC\u2019s efforts conducted prior to the publication of the CDC Plan had  several weaknesses with regard to recruitment and retention. For  example, because recruitment efforts were decentralized throughout the  agency, CDC and AHRC officials conducted recruitment efforts on an ad  hoc basis, and coordinating centers and offices offered recruitment and  relocation incentives as part of their recruitment efforts with little  coordination. Regarding retention, we found that CDC had programs and  incentives designed to promote retention, but lacked information on their  effectiveness. For example, CDC offers retention incentives to key  individuals to induce them to remain with the agency. However, CDC does  not collect and analyze data on how successful these programs and  incentives have been in retaining skilled employees.", "As part of CDC\u2019s efforts to improve recruiting and retention efforts, one of  the strategies in the CDC Plan calls for developing, implementing, and  evaluating a collaborative strategic recruitment effort, for the purpose of  establishing initiatives, resources, operational strategies, and practices to  ensure agency access to quality candidates and to aid in meeting CDC\u2019s  recruitment objectives. In January 2008, CDC established a strategic  recruitment team comprised of representatives from various entities,  including each coordinating center and coordinating office, AHRC, and  OWCD. As part of its work, this team intends to develop a database for  targeted recruitment, which is scheduled for completion in February 2009.  This strategy could help address weaknesses in CDC\u2019s current ad hoc  approach. Another strategy involves expanding the use of \u201ccareer  ladders\u201d within the agency, including identifying target positions to be  used on a career ladder and assessing the career ladder program for  potential areas of improvement. CDC anticipates completing this strategy  by the end of 2008.", "Our review of CDC\u2019s current efforts to develop skilled staff found that the  agency based its current employee development efforts on a training needs  assessment and had additional strategies that could improve employee  development in the CDC Plan. According to CDC officials, CDC University,  the unit responsible for training at CDC, worked with partners throughout  the agency to develop and implement agencywide strategies for training  and to identify the skills needed by CDC\u2019s workforce in the future. CDC  University also conducted annual competency-based needs assessments  that allow employees and supervisors to review the competencies for each  occupation and determine whether sufficient training exists or additional  training is needed. Several strategies in the CDC Plan could build on  these current efforts. For example, CDC plans to implement a transition  from its current training system to HHS\u2019s Learning Management System.  According to CDC, this transition will improve the career development of  its employees, in part by allowing CDC to target its learning plans to  specific groups of employees and to track competency gaps by employee,  CDC entity, occupational group, and specific competency. CDC has begun  this transition and expects it to be completed by September 2008.", "Although CDC has developed strategies that may improve some of its  current efforts, it is unclear how well these strategies will address current  gaps in skills and competencies. In our prior work on the principles, we  found that it is important for agencies to consider how their strategies can  be aligned to eliminate gaps and improve the contribution of critical skills  and competencies. However, developing strategies to eliminate gaps  assumes that an agency has identified the gaps in skills and competencies  before its strategies are developed, and while CDC has begun gap  analyses, these analyses were not completed when the CDC Plan was  developed. As a result, the strategies in the plan could not be tailored to  address specific gaps in skills and competencies. However, CDC  recognized this need, is completing the gap analyses, and has outlined, as  part of one strategy, the development of additional steps to close identified  gaps in skills and competencies.

For example, OWCD has  hired a strategic recruiter to oversee the development and implementation  of its recruitment function strategy, as described in the CDC Plan.", "CDC officials are also planning to streamline the agency\u2019s administrative  processes, with a focus on hiring. In response to AHRC\u2019s current efforts to  achieve its goal of hiring new employees within an average of 58  workdays, CDC and AHRC have developed a system to track the hiring  process and have created a committee to evaluate the current hiring  process. The system has generated reports that would allow managers to  see how long the hiring process takes. In addition, CDC officials are  implementing some of the recommendations made by the hiring  committee. One problem the committee identified was the use of  individualized position descriptions for vacancies. Historically, managers  requested individualized descriptions for most positions. New position  descriptions needed to be formally reviewed, adding time and complexity  to the hiring process. As of February 2008, AHRC and CDC have  standardized position descriptions for 20 occupations, which could help  the agency reduce the time it spends filling positions.", "In addition, CDC is working to create transparency and accountability and  to improve the utilization of its human capital flexibilities.

According to CDC officials, the agency intends to  incorporate this responsibility into these individuals\u2019 performance  reviews. Also, agency supervisors and managers are to receive training on  their roles and responsibilities in employee development, which includes  using human capital flexibilities. Detailed information on these flexibilities  is available via the Web to all employees. However, CDC officials told us  they were limited in how they implemented some of these flexibilities  because policies and practices of this type are developed at the  department level by the HHS Office of Human Resources.

This strategy outlines specific milestones and time  frames for addressing this issue, such as conducting a literature review of  factors affecting employee turnover, which was completed in November  2007. In addition, CDC officials planned to develop strategies in January  2008 to increase the exit survey response rate. Improving the response rate  could make the data collected more valuable.

However, the strategies in the CDC Plan do not address  the sixth challenge we identified\u2014the difficulties presented by managing a  workforce with an increasing number of contractors, which make up more  than one-third of the agency\u2019s workers. Without addressing this challenge  as part of its strategies, the CDC Plan may not be as useful as it could be in  providing the agency with a strategic view of its governmental and  contractor workforce. Thus, the plan will be less helpful to guide the  agency in improving the management of its entire human capital so it can  effectively and efficiently meet its expanding scope of work and  responsibilities and thereby achieve its mission and goals.", "The strategies in the CDC Plan are linked with the agency\u2019s mission and  goals; however, they are not integrated into a strategic plan, performance  plan, or budget. CDC officials told us they intended to integrate the  strategies in the CDC Plan with the documents that serve as the agency\u2019s  strategic plan, the performance plan, and the budget as the plan is  updated. Completing this effort is important because without it the CDC  Plan may not be as effective as it could be in helping the agency meet its  human capital needs or in assessing and understanding the extent to  which CDC\u2019s workforce contributes to achieving its mission and goals.

HHS stated that it addressed the issue of  aligning the plan with the Goal Action Plans in its January 2008 revision of  the CDC Plan, but the documentation it provided to us did not show how  strategies from the CDC Plan would be integrated with the Goal Action  Plans. Further, strategic alignment includes integrating the CDC Plan with  the agency\u2019s performance plan and budget, a step that CDC has yet to  complete.", "HHS also stated that our recommendation\u2014to incorporate strategies in  the CDC Plan that address the challenge of managing a workforce with a  large and growing number of contractors\u2014was somewhat unexpected.  HHS noted that CDC officials reviewed human capital plans of other  agencies and several GAO and OPM human capital reports and did not  address the use of contractors in detail when developing the CDC Plan in  order to be consistent with these sources.

At CDC, contractors represent more than one-third  of the agency\u2019s workforce and thus are clearly a critical part of the  agency\u2019s human capital. Our December 2003 report on key principles for  effective strategic human capital planning noted that it involves  developing long-term strategies for acquiring, developing, and retaining an  organization\u2019s total workforce, which includes full- and part-time federal  staff and contractors. In our current report, we clearly state that CDC does  not control certain aspects of contractor employment such as diversity or  training and technically does not supervise the work of contractors.", "Nevertheless, as we have explained in this report, strategic human capital  planning includes identifying the skills and competencies needed and  developing strategies to address those needs. CDC could not provide us  with specific information on how contractors were being used agencywide  to complement federal staff. Without this information, the CDC Plan  cannot present the nature of the current balance of government-performed  and contractor-performed work at the agency, a complete picture of the  skills and competencies needed agencywide, or strategies to address those  needs. It is unclear to us how the entire workforce of both federal and  contractor staff could be managed strategically without such information.  Such information would facilitate making informed decisions, such as  whether CDC needs to increase training for federal staff or contract for  those skills. Similarly, without information on how contractors are used  throughout the agency, it remains unclear to us how top-level management  can be assured that contractors are being used appropriately and that  sufficient oversight is provided for contractor staff engaged in activities  that could potentially influence the authority, accountability, and  responsibilities of government officials. Consequently, we concluded that  CDC should incorporate strategies related to the use of contractors into  the CDC Plan.", "HHS also commented that our report indicated that CDC does not have a  comprehensive repository of human capital information on its contracting  staff and thus does not ensure adequate contractor oversight.
