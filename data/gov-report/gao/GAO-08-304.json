Its 26 libraries contain a wide range of information and resources and are located at headquarters, regional offices, research centers, and laboratories nationwide. In 2006, EPA issued a plan to reorganize the network beginning in fiscal year 2007. The plan proposed closing libraries and dispersing, disposing of, and digitizing library materials. GAO was asked to assess (1) the status of, and plans for, the network reorganization; (2) EPA's rationale for reorganizing the network; (3) the extent to which EPA has communicated with and solicited the views of EPA staff and external stakeholders in conducting the reorganization; (4) EPA's steps to maintain the quality of library services after the reorganization; and (5) how EPA is funding the network and its reorganization. For this study, GAO reviewed pertinent EPA documents and interviewed EPA officials and staff from each of the libraries."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Since 2006, EPA has implemented its reorganization plan to close physical access to 4 libraries. In the same period, 6 other libraries in the network decided to change their operations, while 16 have not changed. Some of these libraries have also digitized, dispersed, or disposed of their materials. Since the reorganization, EPA has begun drafting a common set of agencywide library procedures and has hired a program manager for the network. While these procedures are under development, however, EPA has imposed a moratorium on further changes to the network in response to congressional and other expressions of concern. EPA's primary rationale for the library network reorganization was to generate cost savings by creating a more coordinated library network and increasing the electronic delivery of services. However, EPA did not fully follow procedures recommended in a 2004 EPA study of steps that should be taken to prepare for a reorganization. In particular, EPA did not fully evaluate alternative models, and associated costs and benefits, of library services. EPA officials stated that they needed to act quickly to reorganize the library network in response to a proposed fiscal year 2007 funding reduction. EPA did not develop procedures to inform staff and the public on the final configuration of the library network, and EPA libraries varied considerably and were limited in the extent to which they communicated with and solicited views from stakeholders before and during the reorganization effort. In particular, EPA's plan did not include information that the Chemical Library was to close, and EPA did not inform staff or the public until after the fact. EPA's communication procedures were limited or inconsistent because EPA acted quickly to make changes in response to a proposed fiscal year 2007 funding reduction, and because of the decentralized nature of the library network. EPA is currently increasing its communication efforts. EPA does not have a post-reorganization strategy to ensure the continuity of library services and has not yet determined the full effect of the reorganization on library services. Moreover, EPA has recently made several changes that could have impaired user access to library materials and services. For example, EPA did not determine whether federal property management regulations applied to the dispersal and disposal of library materials before it closed the libraries. Furthermore, EPA lacked oversight of the reorganization process and does not have procedures that would allow the agency to measure performance and monitor user needs. Several different EPA offices are responsible for the libraries in the network. Each office generally decides how much funding to allocate to the libraries for which it is responsible and how to fund their reorganization. However, when faced with a proposed budget reduction of $2 million in fiscal year 2007, EPA specifically directed that these offices reduce funding for their libraries and did not specify how to achieve the reduction. Additional funds were not allocated to assist offices in closing their libraries."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) library network provides  The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) library network provides  access to critical environmental information that the agency needs to  access to critical environmental information that the agency needs to  promote environmental awareness, conduct research, enforce  promote environmental awareness, conduct research, enforce  environmental laws, make policy decisions, and fulfill its mission of  environmental laws, make policy decisions, and fulfill its mission of  protecting human health and the environment.

In general, their concerns focus on  several procedural aspects of the reorganization effort. These include the  closing of libraries or reducing their hours of operation; the rationale for  reorganizing the library network in the first place; the procedures used in  dispersing, disposing of, and digitizing library materials; steps being taken  to guard against potential degradation of library services; and the  availability of resources to enable the libraries to continue meeting their  missions.", "In this context, you asked us to obtain and analyze information relevant to  these concerns.

Established in 1971, the network is composed of libraries and repositories  located in the agency\u2019s headquarters, regional offices, research centers,  and laboratories throughout the country. The combined network  collection contains a wide range of general information on environmental  protection and management; basic and applied sciences, such as biology,  chemistry, engineering, and toxicology; and extensive coverage of topics  featured in legislative mandates, such as hazardous waste, drinking water,  pollution prevention, and toxic substances. Several of the libraries  maintain collections that are focused on special topics to support specific  regional or program office projects. As such, the libraries differ in  function, scope of collections, extent of services, and public access.", "During this period, EPA\u2019s library network operations were guided by  EPA\u2019s Information Resources Management Policy Manual. Chapter 12 of  the policy manual stipulated that the library network provide EPA staff  with access to information to carry out the agency\u2019s mission, and that the  libraries provide state agencies and the public with access to the library  collection. Chapter 12 also established the role of the national program  manager with responsibility for coordinating major activities of the EPA  library network. A national program manager within OEI is responsible for  coordinating the major activities of the EPA library network. The role of  the national program manager is to work with the library network and its  managers to provide several essential services, such as assessing the  needs of program staff and providing services to meet those needs. Unlike  other national program manager positions at EPA, the national program  manager for the library network does not have budget authority for the  libraries.", "Before the 2007 reorganization, 26 libraries comprised the library network,  each funded and managed by several different program offices at EPA:   1 library was managed by OEI, 10 libraries were managed by regional  offices, 8 libraries were located at EPA laboratories within the Office of  Research and Development (ORD), and 2 libraries were located within  OARM. In addition, each of the following program offices had 1 library:  Office of the Administrator, Office of General Counsel, OPPTS, Office of  Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Air and Radiation.", "In addition to its physical locations and holdings, the EPA network  provides access to its collections through a Web-based database of library  holdings\u2014the Online Library System (OLS)\u2014that is known as EPA\u2019s  online \u201ccard catalog.\u201d OLS enables EPA staff and the public to search for  materials in any of the EPA libraries across the country that are part of the  network. According to EPA estimates, the combined EPA collection in  2003 included 504,000 books and reports; 3,500 journals; 25,000 maps; and  3,600,000 information objects on microfilm. If an item is not available on- site to EPA staff or the public, it is made available through interlibrary  loan from another library within the network or another public library. Up  to 26,000 of these EPA documents are available electronically to EPA staff  and the public through a separate online database\u2014the National  Environmental Publications Internet Site (NEPIS). In addition, EPA staff  have access to over 120,000 information sources\u2014such as online journals,  the Federal Register, news, databases of bibliographic information, and  article citations\u2014from their desktop computers.", "Librarians are available to assist EPA staff and the public, and, as of March  2007, professional librarian staff accounted for just over 36 full-time- equivalent employees. In addition to these 6 federal librarians and   30 contract librarians, several other staff, such as technical specialists and  library technicians, also work at the libraries. Library staff provide a  number of services to both EPA staff and the public, including (1) support  for EPA scientists and technical staff, such as responding to quick and  extended reference questions, conducting literature and database  searches, and providing training to EPA staff on how to conduct their own  searches; (2) support for EPA enforcement staff, such as conducting legal  or business research and providing scientific and technical information to  support enforcement cases; (3) collection cataloging and maintenance;  and (4) support for the general public, such as answering quick and  extended reference questions, and providing training on how to search  EPA databases. In fiscal year 2005, the services provided to EPA staff by  librarians at OEI headquarters and regional office libraries included   41,029 quick and extended reference checks, 8,286 interlibrary loans, and  85,226 database and literature searches. These librarians also provided  EPA staff with 52,975 resources, such as books and journal articles.", "Beginning in 2003, EPA conducted a business case assessment of its  library network and a study of options for future regional library  operations. These two studies, which primarily focused on the OEI  headquarters library and the regional office libraries, were intended to  determine the value of library services and inform management in the  regions of their options to support library services beyond fiscal year 2006.  In August 2005, regional management formed a Library Network  Workgroup, composed of regional and headquarters library managers as  well as library managers from OARM and the National Environmental  Investigations Center libraries, to review the two reports and develop  recommendations on ways to maintain an effective library network if the  library support budget were reduced. The workgroup issued its internal  report, EPA Library Network: Challenges for FY 2007 and Beyond, in  November 2005.", "After the Library Network Workgroup\u2019s report was issued, EPA  established a Library Steering Committee, composed of senior managers  from EPA\u2019s program offices and regions, to develop a new model for  providing library services to EPA staff. As such, the steering committee  reviewed the recommendations made by the workgroup and, in August  2006, issued the EPA FY 2007 Library Plan: National Framework for the  Headquarters and Regional Libraries. See figure 1 for a timeline of the  assessments and planning efforts that EPA conducted and library network  reorganization activities.", "The August 2006 library plan provided the framework for the network to  begin reorganizing in the summer of 2006 in preparation for the proposed  fiscal year 2007 budget reduction beginning in October 2006.

The plan describes a \u201cphased  approach\u201d to disperse and dispose of library materials in the libraries that  will close. The plan also provided guidelines for EPA staff to determine  how the collections are to be managed. According to the plan, OEI  libraries in Regions 5, 6, and 7 would close and the headquarters library  would close physical access to its collection but would function as one of  three repository libraries. OARM libraries located in Cincinnati, Ohio, and  Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, would serve as the other two  repositories.

The information and options provided were based on  several assessments of the network, such as consultation visits and staff  surveys. In addition, some libraries conducted their own assessment of  services. For example, after the fiscal year 2007 budget cut was proposed,  Region 1 assessed the core library services it provided, library use, and the  possible effects of the fiscal year 2007 budget reduction on providing core  services and presented a range of options to regional management for  consideration.", "EPA did not fully complete its assessments, however, before it closed  libraries and began to reorganize the network. The assessments were  incomplete for the following reasons:    EPA did not adequately survey library users to determine their needs.", "EPA administered a survey to compare and contrast the relative value of  library services across program and regional offices and ascertain the  willingness of library users to accept electronic resources and services;  however, only 14 percent of EPA staff responded to the survey. With such  a low response rate, EPA could not adequately determine user needs. The  survey also did not ask questions that would allow the agency to  adequately characterize the needs of library users in reorganizing the  library network. In addition, EPA did not attempt to gather views from, or  determine the needs of, the public, which is a significant user of EPA  libraries. Furthermore, statistics on library use across the network, which  EPA relied on, in part, to decide whether and how to reorganize the  network, were incomplete and inconsistent. EPA is now developing  procedures for keeping complete and accurate use statistics. Such  statistics would allow EPA to make more informed decisions regarding the  use of its libraries and to determine variation in use on the basis of factors  such as where the library is located organizationally, whether it is  managed under a separate contract or in combination with related  information service functions, or where it is located physically in relation  to other publicly accessed areas.", "EPA did not conduct a complete inventory of libraries\u2019 information  resources before beginning to close them. For example, journal  subscriptions are a significant cost to the agency, and these subscriptions  are duplicated throughout the network. However, EPA did not completely  assess duplication and the potential for reducing duplication before  beginning to reorganize the network.", "EPA did not fully characterize and assess organizational, business, and  technological factors that would either enable or constrain an optimal  level of library services. For example, EPA did not review, in advance of  the library closures, leading practices in digitizing library materials to  ensure that such materials are digitized and cataloged correctly. EPA is  now undergoing a third-party review of its current digitization standards  and procedures, which will inform and serve as a benchmark for the  development of EPA\u2019s future digitization procedures for library materials.  In addition, EPA is relying more on NEPIS to distribute EPA reports  electronically, but it only began integrating NEPIS with OLS in late  summer 2007 to ensure that hard copy reports digitized in NEPIS are also  available through OLS. According to EPA officials, electronic links were  established in OLS to all 26,000 reports in NEPIS by the end of December  2007. Many of the electronic reports in NEPIS are born digital and not  available in hard copy.", "EPA did not develop and fully evaluate alternative models of library  services that described the benefits, costs, opportunities, and challenges  of each approach. In its Optional Approaches report, EPA describes five  different service options: (1) current status\u2014where a library chooses to  make no changes to the library operation; (2) network node approach\u2014 where a library continues to provide its core services on-site, but  purchases or sells some services from or to the library network; (3) liaison  approach\u2014where a library greatly reduces or eliminates its physical  collection and the labor needed to maintain it with many services  purchased from the network; (4) virtual services approach\u2014where a  library maintains no library presence on-site, but has a mechanism through  which staff can purchase services and resources directly from the  network; and (5) deferral of responsibility\u2014where a library ceases all  affiliation with the network, forcing staff to procure information services  on their own. The report explored the estimated costs associated with  each option and recommended a mix of at least three network nodes,  three liaison locations, two virtual services locations, and participation of  at least one environmental center. However, the alternatives were based  on the report\u2019s assessment of the regional libraries, rather than on all of  the libraries in the network, and it did not explore the benefits, along with  the costs, of the various options, including the recommended \u201cmixed\u201d  option. Thus, each library had to decide whether it would close without  having information on what mix of closed and open libraries would  present the most beneficial option and on where to best geographically  locate Centers of Excellence or repository libraries.", "EPA did not, in advance of the reorganization, review the existing  policy framework for library resources and develop revisions to this  framework to address the roles and responsibilities of regional offices,  centers, laboratories, and program offices in providing information  services to staff. Until April 2007, EPA relied on a library policy  established in July 1987 that, by 2007, was based on an outdated  organizational scheme\u2014the library network under the coordination of an  office that did not exist. As we have previously discussed, EPA developed  an interim library policy in April 2007, after beginning the reorganization,  and is currently developing new library procedures stemming from the  policy.", "According to EPA officials, EPA decided to reorganize its libraries without  fully completing the recommended analyses because it wanted to reduce  its fiscal year 2007 funding for the OEI headquarters and regional office  libraries by $2 million. However, this claimed savings was not  substantiated by any formal EPA cost assessment. According to EPA  officials, the $2 million funding reduction was informally estimated in 2005  with the expectation that EPA would have been further along in its library  reorganization effort prior to fiscal year 2007. Furthermore, EPA did not  comprehensively assess library network spending in advance of the $2  million estimation of budget cuts. According to OPPTS officials, in  December 2005, they decided to close the Chemical Library to expand  accessability to library materials through digitization and to achieve  related cost savings. Although they planned on closing the Chemical  Library at a later date, they moved to close it before the start of fiscal year  2007 because the space was to be reconfigured.", "By not completing a full assessment of its library resources and not  conducting a benefit-cost analysis of various approaches to reorganizing  the network, EPA did not justify the reorganization actions in a way that  fully considered and ensured adequate support for the mission of the  library network, the continuity of services provided to EPA staff and the  public, the availability of EPA materials to a wider audience, and the  potential cost savings. In effect, EPA attempted to achieve cost savings  without (1) first determining whether potential savings were available and  (2) performing the steps that its own study specified as necessary to  ensure that the reorganization would be cost-effective."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Did Not Fully Inform or Solicit Views from the Full Range of Stakeholders on the Reorganization but Is Now Increasing Its Outreach Efforts", "paragraphs": ["Communicating with and soliciting views from staff and other  stakeholders are key components of successful mergers and  transformations.

The plan discussed the creation of Library Centers of  Excellence and also noted that as a part of the transition to the new library  services model, the headquarters, Region 5, Region 6, and Region 7  libraries would close.

As a result, EPA libraries varied  considerably in the information they provided to staff on library changes.  For example, EPA officials from the headquarters and three regional office  libraries that closed explicitly informed EPA staff of when the libraries  would be closed to physical access. However, EPA officials from the  OPPTS Chemical Library did not inform its staff and users of the Chemical  Library closure. Rather, these EPA officials informed them that they would  be reducing library services and then closed the library without notice or  explanation to EPA staff. These officials acknowledge that they could have  made a more thorough effort to inform library users about the timing of  the library closure. We also found that some of the closed regional  libraries informed their staff of the changes occurring at their libraries  earlier than the closed headquarters library or other closed regional  libraries, and that some libraries communicated changes to their staff  more frequently than others. Officials from Regions 5 and 6, for example,  began to inform their respective staff of their library closures about 5  months before their libraries closed, whereas officials from Region 7 and  headquarters informed their staff of the changes occurring at their  libraries only a few weeks prior to their closures.

However, management in only a few of the regions solicited views from  their regional staff through discussions with their unions. According to  most of the union representatives we talked with from the libraries that  closed, reduced their hours of operation, or changed the way that they  provided library services to their users, they were not asked by  management to provide their views on the changes that were occurring at  their library. At the national level, OEI officials stated that they briefed  union representatives on several occasions prior to the reorganization, and  that they also provided the union with a draft library plan for review and   comment.

In addition, management in Region 5 did not ask the regional  science council to provide input on the Region 5 library closure. However,  the regional science council in this region submitted a memorandum to  management expressing concerns regarding the library closing, and  potential impacts the closing would have on the duties performed by EPA  scientists and engineers.", "In addition, EPA generally did not communicate with and solicit views  from external stakeholders, such as the public, before and during the  reorganization because the agency was moving quickly to make changes in  response to proposed funding cuts. Of the libraries that closed, only the  headquarters library informed the public of the changes occurring at its  library by posting a notification in the Federal Register. The notification  informed members of the public on how they could access EPA  documents held in the headquarters repository library and or in electronic  format. However, the notification was published in the Federal Register  just 10 days before the library was slated to close and become a repository  library. Furthermore, the notification did not provide public users of the  library with an opportunity to provide comments on the changes. Rather  than publishing a Federal Register notice to inform the public of changes  or to obtain public views, some of the closed libraries announced the  closures to the public through their individual library Web sites after the  closures had already occurred. In early 2007, however, we found that  EPA\u2019s Web site did not include links to the closed regional libraries\u2019 Web  sites. As a result, members of the public had no way of knowing that the  library had closed or of knowing how to access materials that were  housed in these libraries.", "EPA also did not fully communicate with and solicit views from  professional library associations while planning and implementing its  library reorganization. EPA did meet with the American Library  Association, a professional library association, on a few occasions, but did  so later in the reorganization planning process.

Based on our review of key practices and  implementation steps to assist mergers and organizational  transformations, organizations that are undergoing change should seek  and monitor staff attitudes and take the appropriate follow-up actions.  While EPA\u2019s library plan describes the reorganization effort as a \u201cphased  approach,\u201d it does not provide specific goals, timelines, or feedback  mechanisms needed to allow the agency to measure performance and  monitor user needs to ensure a successful reorganization while  maintaining quality services. The plan recognizes the need to provide  training to instruct affected staff on the new services provided, but it does  not recognize the need to obtain feedback from library users affected by  the changes to identify any concerns they may have in using the new  services. EPA has begun to provide training to some staff affected by the  reorganization. The agency has also collected staff feedback from some of  the libraries; however, such efforts have been random and have not  included all of the affected library users nor a statistically valid sample of  such users. For example, the Research Triangle Park library solicits  feedback from EPA staff on the services provided through the service  agreements\u2014and according to EPA officials, the responses so far have  been mostly positive; however, the Region 3 library, which also provides  services through a service agreement, does not collect such feedback.  Without a systematic approach for obtaining feedback from those affected  by the reorganization, EPA cannot know whether, or to what extent, the  library reorganization has impaired the ability of library users to access  environmental information, and if it has impaired their ability, what  corrective actions it would need to take to improve services.", "To balance the continued delivery of services with merger and  transformation activities, it is essential to ensure that top leadership drives  the transformation. However, during the reorganization, EPA did not have  a national program manager for the library network to oversee and guide  the reorganization effort. After the position became vacant in late 2005, it  was not filled until May 2007. Without a national program manager for the  library network, EPA did not have an official providing an essential level  of oversight and guidance that could have ensured that libraries dispersed  and disposed of materials properly and in a consistent manner. For  example, we found that a universal list of materials available for dispersal  from the libraries that were closing was not produced; rather, libraries  announced available materials on several different occasions, and the  Regions 5 and 6 libraries began dispersing materials prior to the library  plan being finalized. In addition, libraries that were closing were not  required to develop a list of materials that were to be dispersed or  disposed of. Without a program manager in place to consolidate lists of  materials to be dispersed and disposed of, some libraries may not have  been aware of materials available that could be used for its collection.  Because EPA\u2019s library plan was unclear and lacked specific procedures  and because EPA provided very little oversight, guidance, or control over  the reorganization process, it cannot ensure that libraries properly and  consistently dispersed or disposed of its library collection, and that library  services will continue to be provided to its staff and the public."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Made Several Changes That May Have Impaired the Provision of Materials and Services", "paragraphs": ["Several changes that EPA made to its library network may have impaired  the continued delivery of library materials and services to its staff and the  public. First, according to EPA\u2019s library plan, the agency is moving to  deliver more materials and services online. According to EPA estimates,  the combined EPA collection in 2003 included 504,000 books and reports;  3,500 journals; 25,000 maps; and 3,600,000 information objects on  microfilm. Since the reorganization began, the number of documents in  NEPIS increased from 10,700 documents to 26,000, after the unique EPA  documents from some of the libraries were digitized and entered into the  system. EPA expects to have about 51,000 documents in NEPIS after all  hard copy reports are digitized. However, according to EPA officials,  because of copyright issues, only unique reports produced by or for EPA  will be digitized. Therefore, only about 10 percent of EPA\u2019s holdings of  books and reports will be available electronically in NEPIS. If the material  is not available electronically, EPA staff in locations where libraries have  closed will receive the material through an interlibrary loan\u2014delaying  access to the materials from 1 day to up to 20 days. According to EPA  officials, most interlibrary loan requests are completed in less than 5 days.", "Second, with more library materials and services becoming available  online, EPA will be relying more on its electronic databases, such as  NEPIS and OLS, to identify and distribute library materials. However, EPA  has only just recently begun to integrate these systems to allow for easier  identification and retrieval of materials that were digitized or that have  always been available electronically; nor has it updated these systems to  reflect the current location of materials that have been dispersed or  disposed of to ensure that staff and the public can identify and receive  library materials through them. Although dispersal procedures in EPA\u2019s  library plan state that the libraries that are closing are responsible for  updating OLS, we found that they have not done so. According to EPA  officials where libraries had closed, the staff in the receiving libraries were  responsible for updating OLS. As a result of such confusion and lack of  coordination, for example, all Chemical Library materials still appear as  being physically located at the library through OLS, although the library  has been closed for over 1 year.", "Third, EPA cannot ensure that the service agreements between libraries  that had closed and other EPA libraries will be effective. Specifically:    Only two of the seven service agreements that EPA established were  tested in advance to ensure that the services being provided were timely  and effective. Even in these cases, EPA did not consider the full range of  requests that may be received from the locations planning to close or  reduce services. For example, the service agreement between the  Cincinnati library and EPA Region 5 was tested for only 4 weeks in 2006,  just before the library was to officially close on August 28, 2006. During  these weeks, the number of requests made were only 3 percent of the total  research and interlibrary loan requests made in Region 5 during fiscal year  2006. This does not provide a realistic assessment of the Cincinnati  library\u2019s ability to fulfill research requests and interlibrary loans in a timely  and effective fashion. Even for this 3 percent, EPA surveyed only a sample  of staff to determine their satisfaction with the library services.", "Library materials and services provided under the service agreements are  based on a fee-for-service arrangement, which could constrain access to  information. For example, due to reduced budgets, prior to the  reorganization, OPPTS required management approval of research  requests and other service requests. If the agency finds that costs are more  than anticipated under the new fee-for-service model, it may require such  approvals to try to limit costs. Such actions could limit the research that  EPA staff conduct and also delay research efforts. EPA officials have  stated that they believe the service agreements provide adequate services  and, thus far, believe that they are cost-effective based on preliminary  results.", "The Centers of Excellence libraries that provide services to the locations  that closed their libraries are all based in the Eastern time zone, which  may constrain when services can be provided, especially for EPA staff  located in the West.", "Although EPA is attempting to continue to meet the needs of its staff, it  does not have a plan in place to ensure the continuation of library services  for the public, such as state and local government environmental agencies,  environmental groups, and other nongovernmental organizations. EPA\u2019s  library plan stated that the locations where libraries have closed would  have a plan to manage public inquiries, and that such locations would refer  public requests for information to the public affairs office or program staff.", "However, we found that many of the locations where libraries closed have  not developed such a plan. In addition, the service agreements with the  locations where libraries closed only refer to how services would be  provided to EPA staff and not the public.", "Finally, EPA may have inadvertently limited access to information because  it did not determine whether federal property management regulations  applied to the dispersal and disposal of library materials and hence may  have disposed of materials that should have been retained. To ensure that  federal property is reused to the extent possible, regulations generally  require that agencies report surplus property to GSA, which will attempt  to find another agency that needs it. If no federal agency needs the  property, it may be sold to the public or donated to state or local  governments or nonprofit entities. Although agencies may discard  property that is subject to the regulations, they must first make a written  determination that the property has no value.", "While EPA\u2019s Fiscal Year 2007 Library Plan included dispersal and disposal  criteria and procedures for libraries to follow when deciding on its  collections, these criteria and procedures were vague and did not  incorporate the federal property regulations. According to a Region 3 EPA  official who developed the dispersal and disposal criteria, a clear answer  from GSA and from EPA property management officials was not obtained  regarding the applicability of federal property management regulations to  library materials in the time available before the plan was issued.  Furthermore, many of the individual libraries that had dispersed or  disposed of library materials did not contact GSA, EPA property  management officials, or EPA legal counsel to determine whether federal  property management regulations applied, and did not consider the  applicability of the federal property management regulations before  dispersing or disposing of their library materials. As a result, EPA libraries  dispersed and disposed of library materials in a manner inconsistent with  federal property management regulations. For example, the Regions 5 and  6 libraries gave materials to private companies, and the OEI headquarters  library and the Chemical Library discarded materials without first  determining that they had no monetary value. Furthermore, several journal  titles from the Chemical Library were disposed of, despite the fact that  EPA\u2019s Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance offered to take  the materials and archive them. EPA officials stated that there was lack of  clarity regarding whether library materials, such as books and journals,  were subject to federal property management regulations.

OEI, which is the primary source of funding for the  regional libraries, typically provides funding for them through each  region\u2019s support budget, and generally gives regional management  discretion on how to allocate this funding among the library and other  support services, such as information technology.

After $500,000 of the $2  million reduction was applied to the headquarters library, the regional  administrators together decided that the remaining $1.5 million reduction  should be spread equally across all regions, rather than by staffing ratios in  each region or previous years\u2019 spending. However, because it was one of  the agencies included in the full-year continuing appropriations resolution  for fiscal year 2007, EPA operated near fiscal year 2006 funding levels.", "According to EPA, OEI restored $500,000 to the library budget in fiscal  year 2007 to support reorganization activities.

For example, when the relatively small library in Edison, New  Jersey, closed in 2004, EPA estimated that it cost $150,000 to disperse  1,000 boxes of materials. EPA did not allocate funds specifically to help  the closing libraries manage their collections. According to EPA, the  funding for library closures was taken into account during the budget  process.

Furthermore, EPA cannot be sure  that the changes are meeting the needs of EPA staff and external  stakeholders, and that it is incorporating leading practices for library  services and the digitization of materials.", "Finally, EPA did not implement best practices that would allow it to  measure or monitor the effects of the reorganization or provide oversight  of the process, despite EPA having made changes to its library network  that may have negatively affected how materials and services are provided  to its staff and the public. For example, EPA did not disperse and dispose  of library materials in accordance with federal property management  regulations or its own procedures and, therefore, may have disposed of  materials that are of value and needed for use by staff and the public.  Without sufficient monitoring or oversight of the process, EPA cannot be  sure of the extent to which the library reorganization has degraded library  services, if at all, and therefore cannot take corrective actions if necessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To ensure that critical library services are provided to EPA staff and other  users, we recommend that the Administrator of EPA continue the agency\u2019s  moratorium on changes to the library network until the agency  incorporates and makes public a plan that includes the following four  actions:    Develop a strategy to justify its reorganization plans by (1) evaluating and  determining user needs for library services; (2) taking an inventory of EPA  information resources and determining the extent to which these  resources are used; (3) evaluating technological factors, such as  digitization procedures and integration of online databases, to ensure an  optimal level of services; (4) evaluating and conducting a benefit-cost  assessment for each alternative approach for the network, including the  approach that existed before the reorganization; and (5) reviewing and  revising, as appropriate, the existing policy and procedures that guide the  library network.", "Improve its outreach efforts by developing a process that (1) informs  stakeholders of the final configuration of the library network, and the  implementation goals and timeline to achieve this configuration;   (2) communicates information to stakeholders early, often, and  consistently across all libraries, and solicits the views of EPA staff and  external stakeholders; and (3) obtains the views of industry experts to  determine leading practices for library services.", "Include a process that (1) ensures sufficient oversight and control over the  reorganization process, (2) continuously and consistently monitors the  impact of the reorganization on EPA staff and the public, and (3) takes  corrective actions as necessary to provide the continued delivery of  services.", "Implement procedures that ensure that library materials are dispersed and  disposed of consistently and in accordance with federal property  management regulations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided EPA with a draft of this report for its review and comment.

According to EPA officials, a library is considered part of the  network if its collections are listed in the agency\u2019s Online Library System  (OLS). Generally, we also conducted the following activities:    Reviewed relevant EPA documents, plans, policies, guidance, and  procedures as well as related laws and requirements pertinent to the  library network and the reorganization effort.", "Visited the Office of Environmental Information\u2019s (OEI) headquarters  library and the Office of Prevention, Pesticides, and Toxic Substances\u2019  Chemical Library\u2014both located in Washington, D.C.; the Region 10 library  in Seattle, Washington; and the Office of Administration and Resources  Management (OARM) library in Cincinnati, Ohio. We visited these libraries  because the headquarters library closed physical access to its library space  and transitioned into a repository library; the Chemical Library closed  physical access to its library space and dispersed and disposed of its  library materials; the Region 10 library reduced its hours of operation; and  the OARM library in Cincinnati was identified by EPA as a repository  library, a Center of Excellence, and the facility was responsible for  digitizing library materials from the closed EPA libraries.", "Interviewed representatives from Lockheed Martin and Integrated  Solutions and Services\u2014because these two companies digitized and  electronically indexed library materials through already existing contracts  with OARM in Cincinnati\u2014and visited a Lockheed Martin facility to  observe the digitization process.", "Interviewed EPA librarians, library managers, and program office and  regional office managers for the 26 libraries in EPA\u2019s library network.  When possible, we corroborated information provided to us by EPA  officials during the interviews with relevant documentation.", "For each of our objectives, some analysis was based on documentation  and information provided to us by EPA officials. To the extent possible,  we tried to corroborate this information. However, we did not  independently verify this information or assess whether it was complete or  accurate.", "In addition, we conducted work that was specific to each of the report\u2019s  objectives. To determine the status of and plans for the library network  reorganization, we analyzed information that EPA libraries provided to us  on the operating status of the libraries as well as materials that have been  digitized, dispersed to other EPA and non-EPA libraries, or disposed of as  a part of the reorganization effort. We also reviewed drafts and final  versions of EPA procedures and criteria for digitizing, dispersing, and  disposing of EPA library materials.", "To evaluate EPA\u2019s rationale for reorganizing the library network, we  conducted the following activities:    Reviewed documents that EPA developed before the reorganization in  fiscal year 2007. One of these documents was EPA\u2019s 2004 study on the  costs and value of EPA\u2019s libraries. We did not assess the robustness and  adequacy of the methodology and data that EPA used for this study.  However, we used this study\u2019s recommendations for information on how  to further assess and determine the future of the library network to guide  our assessment of EPA\u2019s subsequent evaluation efforts of the library  network. We spoke with a contract official from Stratus Consulting, which  helped develop the 2004 study on the costs and value of EPA\u2019s libraries, as  well as with a researcher from Simmons College who helped conduct an  independent review of the study. In addition, we reviewed federal  guidelines from the Office of Management and Budget on benefit-cost  analyses. We also assessed EPA\u2019s survey of library users, examining the  adequacy of the response rate of the survey and survey questions. We  found the 14 percent response rate to EPA\u2019s survey not to be adequate for  EPA\u2019s purpose because the response rate was low and because EPA did  not do any nonresponse analyses to show that those 14 percent who  responded were representative of the target population. To determine  whether EPA\u2019s survey contained questions to adequately characterize the  needs of library users in reorganizing the library network, we looked for  survey questions that assessed how and how often users used the library  space, the library holdings, and the librarian in performing their jobs; the  utility of, and satisfaction with, each resource; and to what extent the  library materials were available electronically versus in hard copy.", "Asked each of the 26 libraries to provide us with data on the number of  walk-ins to the library and other use data between fiscal years 2000 and  2006. We reviewed these data to determine their reliability and sufficiency  for EPA to use as a basis for deciding to reorganize the library network. To  determine the reliability and sufficiency of EPA\u2019s library use data, we  checked whether all libraries kept such statistics and whether enough  years of data were available to detect a trend in the level of use. We found  that not all libraries tracked such library use data and some libraries only  kept data for a limited number of years.", "Assessed the National Environmental Publications Internet Site (NEPIS)  and OLS to determine the extent of integration between the two systems  and to determine how the location of library materials that have been  dispersed or disposed of are being updated in OLS.", "Assessed the comprehensiveness of EPA\u2019s efforts to evaluate alternative  models of library services.", "To assess EPA\u2019s efforts to communicate with and solicit the views of EPA  staff and external stakeholders in planning and implementing the  reorganization, we reviewed our past work on key practices and  implementation steps to assist mergers and organizational transformations  and compared these key practices and implementation steps with EPA\u2019s  reorganization effort (app. II provides more details on these key practices  and implementation steps). More specifically, to determine EPA\u2019s efforts  to communicate with and solicit input from stakeholders, we reviewed   e-mails, notices, and memorandums from EPA library management and  program office and regional office management to EPA staff. We also  interviewed local union representatives from headquarters and all of  EPA\u2019s regional offices. Furthermore, we interviewed regional science  council representatives from most of the regional offices. The science  councils are located in each regional office and consist of EPA scientists  and technical specialists. To determine the extent to which EPA  communicated with and solicited views from outside stakeholders, we  interviewed representatives from several professional library associations  and other external stakeholder groups, such as the American Library  Association, the Association of Research Libraries, the American  Association of Law Libraries, the Special Libraries Association, the Library  of Congress\u2019 Federal Library and Information Center Committee, and the  Union of Concerned Scientists. We also reviewed information that EPA  provided to the public via the EPA Web site or, when applicable, Federal  Register notices.", "In evaluating the steps that EPA has taken to maintain the quality of  library services following the reorganization both currently and in the  future, we reviewed our past work on key practices and implementation  steps to assist mergers and organizational transformations and compared  these key practices and implementation steps with EPA\u2019s reorganization  effort (app. II provides more details on these key practices and  implementation steps). Furthermore, we reviewed federal property  management regulations regarding the dispersal and disposal of federal  property, and assessed whether EPA followed these regulations. We also  reviewed drafts and final versions of EPA procedures and criteria for  dispersing and disposing of EPA library materials. Separately, we  determined the possible effects of changes to the library network by   (1) determining and evaluating the total number of library materials that  would be digitized and made available in NEPIS, and the length of time it  would take a user to receive materials via interlibrary loan; (2) evaluating  the accuracy of information in NEPIS and OLS; and (3) reviewing and  evaluating service agreements between libraries. Finally, we reviewed the  roles and responsibilities of the EPA library network management.", "To determine funding for the library network and its reorganization, we  obtained information on library funding from each of the 26 libraries in the  network between fiscal years 2002 and 2007. Because EPA does not  specifically track funding for the libraries, the information provided  contained a mix of outlays for some fiscal years and budget authority for  other fiscal years. In addition, the information provided from each of the  libraries only reflected spending by the library and not the source of the  funds. For example, a large portion of the funding for the regional office  libraries come from OEI, but funding is also received from other EPA  program offices, such as Superfund. Furthermore, the funding data  received from the libraries contained a mix of funding for contract  support; library staff salaries; and acquisition costs for books, journals,  and other materials. We interviewed EPA officials to assess data reliability,  but we did not independently verify the accuracy and completeness of the  data that they provided. After discussions with EPA officials, we decided  not to include a table showing funding for each library for fiscal years 2002  through 2007 because of concerns with its reliability. Separately, we  interviewed library management from each of the 26 libraries to obtain  information on the costs of the reorganization.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2006 through  February 2008 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
