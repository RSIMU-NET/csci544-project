By developing relationships with members of the  communities in which they live and work, volunteers contribute to greater  intercultural understanding between Americans and host country  nationals. Volunteers are expected to maintain a standard of living similar  to that of their host community colleagues and coworkers. They are  provided with stipends that are based on local living costs and housing  similar to their hosts. Volunteers are not supplied with vehicles. Although  the Peace Corps accepts older volunteers and has made a conscious effort  to recruit minorities, the current volunteer population has a median age of  25 years and is 85 percent white. More than 60 percent of the volunteers are  women.", "The Peace Corps emphasizes community acceptance as the key to  maintaining volunteer safety and security. The agency has found that  volunteer safety is best ensured when volunteers are well\u2013integrated into  their host communities and treated as extended family members and  contributors to development. While emphasizing protection measures such  as locks and window bars, the Peace Corps generally avoids measures such  as housing volunteers in walled compounds, which would reduce volunteer  integration into the community. The agency also typically withdraws from  countries in which breakdowns in civil authority require strong protection  or deterrence measures to protect volunteers. To the extent that they  share the Peace Corps\u2019 commitment to advancing intercultural  understanding, other organizations that face similar security and safety  challenges also tend to emphasize community acceptance as an underlying  principle.

Agency  officials note that the reason for this may be attributable to a number of  factors, including agency efforts to improve data collection and volunteer  reporting. The Peace Corps has used its data analyses to gain insight into  the characteristics of assaults against volunteers and to shape volunteer  training programs. However, the full extent of crime against volunteers is  unclear because recent volunteer surveys show that volunteers may  significantly underreport crime.

Reported incidence rates also  increased for minor physical assaults and, to a lesser extent, for minor  sexual assaults. The reported rate of major sexual assaults decreased from  about 10 incidents per 1,000 female volunteer years at the beginning of the  1990s to an average of slightly more than 8 per 1,000 female employees at  the end of the decade. According to agency officials, the decreasing  incidence of major sexual assaults in the face of increases in minor sexual  assault suggests that the decline in major sexual assaults is a true decline  rather than a reporting artifact. Appendix III provides more information on  crime rates and trends.", "According to Peace Corps officials, the general increase in reported  assaults may reflect an actual increase in the number of such incidents  suffered by volunteers, better efforts by the agency to ensure that all  medical officers report all assault events, or an increased willingness  among volunteers to report incidents. Through its volunteer satisfaction  surveys, the agency is aware that the level of underreporting is significant.  For example, according to the 1998 survey, volunteers did not report 60  percent of rapes and 20 percent of nonrape sexual assaults. Underreporting  reduces the Peace Corps\u2019 ability to state crime rates with certainty and to  develop well-informed plans for addressing crime problems. The agency  has taken steps to encourage volunteers to report incidents. For example,  the coordinator for volunteer safety and security stated that he is  developing training materials for medical officers to ensure that they  transmit clear messages to volunteers about incident reporting. The Peace  Corps is also including questions about underreporting in its current  volunteer satisfaction survey. Volunteers may not report criminal incidents  for a variety of reasons, including embarrassment, fear of repercussions,  concern about confidentiality, and the belief that Peace Corps staff could  not help. Volunteers may decline to report minor incidents when, aside  from offering counseling, it is unclear what Peace Corps staff can do for the  volunteer.

These analyses also have influenced the content  of the Peace Corps\u2019 volunteer training programs. For example, agency  analyses of the circumstances surrounding rape incidents have shown that  nearly 60 percent of such crimes from 1993 to 1999 were perpetrated by  volunteers\u2019 friends, coworkers, or acquaintances, and that more than 50  percent occurred in a home environment. The Peace Corps\u2019 coordinator for  volunteer safety and security stated that the agency was revising volunteer  rape awareness training materials to reflect these insights.", "In recent years, the Peace Corps has made a number of improvements in its  crime data collection and analysis system. In 1999, the agency revised its  assault reporting form to include information on victim and assailant  alcohol use and on whether victims were alone when incidents occurred.  Additional analyses would enhance the Peace Corps\u2019 ability to identify  other characteristics of crimes and crime risk factors and develop better- informed prevention and intervention strategies. For example, as shown in  figure 3, we found that the number of reported assaults is highest among  volunteers in their first few months of service. Nearly a third of all reported  assaults after 1993 occurred in the volunteer\u2019s 4th to 8th months of service\u2014 immediately after the volunteers have completed training and taken up  residence at their assigned sites. This finding could be explored and the  results considered in developing volunteer training materials. Medical staff  and safety and security staff at the Peace Corps agreed that the agency  could benefit from additional research on crime against volunteers but  observed that neither the medical office nor the coordinator for volunteer  safety and security had staff available to perform such research. Among the  new initiatives the Peace Corps has stated that it will implement is the  hiring of a statistician to perform additional analyses on crime data.", "The Peace Corps distributes its crime data analyses to agency officials but  does not provide access to this information for potential volunteers.

Our previous work in this area has shown that  the Peace Corps has had difficulty providing volunteers with well- structured assignments. At the posts we visited, we met volunteers whose  counterparts had no plans for them when they arrived at their sites, and  only after several months and much frustration did the volunteers find  productive activities. Several inspector general reports support this finding.  For example, at one post volunteers reported that their coworkers were  not at all or were poorly prepared for their arrival. Some volunteers had no  real job to do or had not been assigned a counterpart. Senior Peace Corps  officials agreed that poorly defined assignments pose a safety risk because  volunteers who lack the routine a job provides may spend time away from  their sites and have difficulty integrating into their communities.

For example, at one post we visited, two female  volunteers who experienced severe sexual harassment at their site were  reassigned to new sites. Records of the incident were kept in their personal  files, but the post had no file organized geographically to track after the  volunteers were moved.

In some cases, posts set goals on time frames for reaching  volunteers, either through communication technology or by travel to the  volunteer, as benchmarks for measuring the test\u2019s successfulness. For  example, of the five country directors we interviewed, two had set targets  for reaching at least 90 percent of their volunteers within 24 hours or less;  both country directors achieved their goals. Our review of EAP test results  showed that most tests are limited to sending a message to all volunteers  during business hours and requesting that volunteers respond when they  receive the message.

For  example, we visited one post where staff members relied on six volunteer  leaders to play a significant role in developing sites and responding to  volunteer concerns. Four of these volunteer leaders had held the position  for several months, but the Peace Corps had not yet trained them for their  duties.

As organizations become less concerned with establishing person-to- person ties within a host community and more concerned with achieving  specific technical or development goals, they may place more emphasis on  protection and, sometimes, deterrence measures.

In contrast to the Peace  Corps, the organization advertises and recruits on a job-by-job basis in  response to specific requests from counterpart organizations in developing  countries. The organization thus faces less of a challenge than the Peace  Corps in finding productive employment and supportive organizations for  volunteers. Volunteers average 38 years of age and are often experienced.  Although its approach to identifying housing and monitoring volunteers is  similar to the Peace Corps, the organization provides less safety and  security training. It provides general risk-awareness training before  volunteers\u2019 departure for their country of service and limited country- and  placement-specific risk awareness and management training upon  volunteers\u2019 arrival in the country.

The agency has not  developed clear guidance for posts to apply in responding to minor  incidents. However, the Peace Corps does have well-defined notification  and response protocols for major sexual assaults, and posts follow similar  procedures when volunteers report major physical assaults.

In addition to  giving guidance for reporting the incident to agency headquarters as  previously described in this report, the handbook clearly establishes that  the post\u2019s medical officer is responsible for providing medical care to the  volunteer who has been assaulted and for collecting forensic evidence in  case the volunteer decides to prosecute. The country director is  responsible for ensuring that the victim, as well as other volunteers and  trainees, is safe; preserving the option to prosecute (e.g., by advising the  volunteer of her legal rights, preserving evidence, etc.); and notifying the  security office at the U.S. embassy of the assault while protecting the  volunteer\u2019s identity unless identification is essential. Embassy security staff  are expected to support the Peace Corps in any investigation or  prosecution following the incident.", "The Peace Corps follows similar notification and response protocols when  a volunteer reports a major physical assault. The medical officer reports  the assault to the Office of Medical Services at headquarters and provides  medical treatment to the volunteer. As with a rape incident, the medical  officer notifies the country director of the assault, although in the interest  of medical confidentiality the volunteer\u2019s identity and details of the incident  may not be disclosed. The country director is responsible for informing the  U.S. embassy security officer of the assault and may work with the  embassy if the volunteer decides to prosecute.", "According to Peace Corps data, 18 percent of volunteers who experienced  a major sexual assault and 26 percent of volunteers who reported a major  physical assault between 1997 and 1999 said that they intended to  prosecute. When a volunteer decides to prosecute, the Peace Corps\u2019 Office  of General Counsel covers the cost of legal counsel in the country where  the assault happened.   The Office of the Inspector General\u2019s investigations  unit, in conjunction with other federal agencies, may also provide support  in investigations of crimes against volunteers. For example, inspector  general staff may conduct interviews with Peace Corps staff and local  authorities, escort volunteers who are asked to identify suspects, or  arrange for examination of forensic evidence."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments from the Peace Corps", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to Ms. Anderson, key contributors to this report were Wendy  Ahmed, Kriti Bhandari, Lynn Cothern, Suzanne Dove, Bruce Kutnick,  Michael McAtee, James Strus, and Christina Werth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO\u2019s Mission", "paragraphs": ["The General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, exists to  support Congress in meeting its constitutional responsibilities and to help improve  the performance and accountability of the federal government for the American  people.
