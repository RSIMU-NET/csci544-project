These codes are intended to indicate whether stored inventory is (1) issuable without qualification, (2) in need of repair, (3) usable for only a limited time, or (4) unrepairable and ready for disposal. DOD\u2019s inventory management goal is to achieve a cost-effective system that provides the inventory needed to maintain readiness. When items in DOD\u2019s inventory cannot be readily placed in one of these categories, DOD uses other condition codes to indicate suspended inventory. Because these codes do not indicate an item\u2019s usability, item managers must direct that the item be inspected or tested to determine its usability. The primary suspended inventory condition codes are as follows:", "J \u2014 inventory at storage warehouses that is awaiting inspection to determine its condition (hereafter referred to as material in inventory),", "K \u2014 inventory returned from customers or users to storage warehouses and awaiting condition classification (hereafter referred to as customer returns),", "L \u2014 inventory held at storage warehouses pending litigation or negotiation with contractors or common carriers (hereafter referred to as inventory in litigation),", "Q \u2014 quality-deficient inventory returned by customers or users due to technical deficiencies (hereafter referred to as quality-deficient inventory), and", "R \u2014 inventory returned by salvage activities that do not have the capability to determine the material condition (hereafter referred to as reclaimed inventory).", "Appendix II contains a detailed explanation of DOD\u2019s supply condition codes.", "Inventory categorized as suspended is not available for use until it has been tested to determine whether it is usable. In some instances, inventory in this category that has been found to be usable can meet customer needs, thus contributing to overall military capability. DOD recognizes that inventory in a suspended status for long periods can adversely affect the availability of resources and the effectiveness and economy of supply operations. To minimize the amount of items in suspended inventory, DOD set standards for the amount of time inventory should remain categorized as suspended. These standards consider the reason for suspending the inventory and the difficulty of determining the usability of the items. The time standards by suspension category are shown in table 1.", "A number of organizations are involved in the management and control of suspended inventory. The Air Force Materiel Command (AFMC) administers the Air Force supply system and provides suspended inventory management policies and procedures. AFMC has five Air Logistics Centers (ALC) that are located in different regions throughout the United States.Within each ALC, item managers are responsible for maintaining the records for suspended inventory, initiating efforts to determine the usability of suspended inventory, deciding whether to procure items in addition to those in suspended status, and deciding whether suspended items should be returned to inventory or disposed. Suspended inventory is stored at warehouses operated and managed by the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA). These storage activities receive, store, and issue inventory and maintain inventory records.

About 65 percent of these backorders were essential to a weapon system\u2019s operation and thus adversely affected the system\u2019s ability to carry out all or portions of its assigned operational missions.

When we informed AFMC officials that both customer returns and repair items were commingled in the customer returns suspension code, one official acknowledged that items not in need of repair may not receive management attention. When we brought this same matter to the attention of Warner Robins officials, they told us that, in complying with the supplemental guidance, they assumed all items (including $115 million worth of items in an unknown condition that were returns from customers) were in need of repair, and thus made no attempts to inspect and reclassify them.

At the time of our visit, one M-16 rifle conversion kit (see fig. 8) had been suspended for almost 9 years. An additional 985 kits were being held in an issuable condition, according to the item manager. Subsequent to our visit, we were informed that the item manager misinterpreted the retention instructions.
