The space shuttle is the primary vehicle supporting the assembly  and resupply of the station. Figure 1 shows the Space Shuttle Endeavour  docked to the International Space Station. Following the Columbia  accident in February 2003, the NASA Administrator grounded the space  shuttle fleet pending an investigation into the cause of the accident. The  administrator appointed the Columbia Accident Investigation Board to  determine the cause of the accident and to make recommendations for  improving the safety of the space shuttle before it could return to flight.  The board issued its report in August 2003 with 29 recommendations for  improvement\u201415 of which must be implemented before the space shuttle  can return to flight. NASA plans to return the shuttle to flight in July 2005.", "While the shuttle has been grounded, space station crew transfers and  logistics resupply have depended on Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles.  Europe and Japan are also developing logistics cargo vehicles to support  space station operations later this decade. These Russian, European, and  Japanese vehicles are launched on expendable rockets. The European  Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV), scheduled to be available for missions  to the space station in 2006, is being designed to rendezvous and dock  with the space station\u2019s Russian Service Module. The Japanese H-II  Transfer Vehicle (HTV) is scheduled to be available in 2008 and will fly  within the proximity of the space station to be caught by the station\u2019s  robotic arm before being berthed to the space station. The ATV and HTV  also carry less cargo than the shuttle.", "Because the Russian Soyuz and Progress are the only vehicles currently  available and carry significantly less payload than the space shuttle,  operations are generally limited to transporting crew, food, potable water,  as well as propellant resupply for reboosting the space station to higher  orbits. Launches of space station assembly elements and large orbital  replacement items for maintenance have effectively ceased.", "From 2000 to early 2004, NASA performed two studies that focused on the  potential use of commercial launch vehicles to provide logistics services to  the space station. In a 90-day study conducted in 2000, NASA determined  that no commercial logistics service for the space station was possible at  that time, as no launch vehicles possessed the critical capabilities  necessary to provide logistics services, including automated rendezvous  capabilities. As a result of this study, NASA decided to solicit and fund a  more detailed review of concepts designed to provide logistics services to  the space station. The Alternate Access to Station (AAS) study contracts  were awarded in July 2002, with 1-year contracts given to four contractors.  In summer 2003, these contractors presented architectures that relied on  existing domestic or international expendable launch vehicles. In the fall  of 2003, the contracts were extended, and the contractors were asked to  address larger cargo delivery capabilities and \u201cdownmass\u201d (e.g. returning  research materials to earth) requirements were added for the return of  cargo. This study ended in January 2004 with the contractors briefing on  their study results, at which time NASA concluded that developing a  domestic capability to meet most of the space station cargo service needs  was possible within 3 to 5 years.", "In January 2004, the President announced a new Vision for Exploration  that called for retiring the shuttle in 2010, requiring NASA to find an  alternative to support space station operations through 2016 by the end of  the decade. The President called for a shift in NASA\u2019s long-term focus,  envisioning that NASA will retire the space shuttle after nearly 30 years of  service as soon as assembly of the International Space Station is  completed, planned for the end of the decade, and will develop a new crew  exploration vehicle as well as launch human missions to the moon  between 2015 and 2020. In essence, NASA\u2019s implementation plan holds  aeronautics, science, and other activities at near constant levels and  transitions funding currently dedicated to the space station and space  shuttle programs to the new exploration strategy as the space station and  space shuttle programs phase out. The vision also changed the space  station\u2019s on-board research focus. Originally, the space station was to be  used for conducting experiments in near-zero gravity to include life  sciences research on how humans adapt to long durations in space,  biomedical research, and materials-processing research. Under the new  vision, the research will be focused on determining the effects of long  duration space travel on humans and developing countermeasures for  those effects, with the goal that the space station research necessary to  support human explorers on other worlds would be complete by 2016.

NASA officials stated they used the AAS  study, which concentrated solely on logistics support missions, as the  foundation for its 2004 informal assessment. In a summary of that study,  NASA reported that the AAS contractors projected the cost to develop an  alternate launch capability would be approximately $1 billion, take 3 to 5  years to develop, and require $2 to $3 billion per year for operations.

We recently reported that the majority of NASA\u2019s budget  estimates for returning the space shuttle to flight had not been fully  developed. In fact, NASA officials stated that they did not compare  estimated costs for developing alternative launch vehicles against budget  estimates for the 28 space shuttle flights currently planned to support the  space station, which total more than $22 billion between fiscal year 2005  and fiscal year 2010. In addition, NASA has also requested $1.8 billion for  crew and cargo services over the same time frame to purchase commercial  services using existing and emerging capabilities, both domestic and  foreign.

The results of these two analysis are used together to produce a  cost-effectiveness comparison that allows decision-makers to assess cost  and effectiveness simultaneously.
