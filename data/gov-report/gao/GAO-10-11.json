As shown in the figure below, from fiscal year 2005 through 2009 there was a significant shift from nonelectronic collection methods to partly electronic methods. This shift was largely a result of a growth in electronic check-processing capacity. Moving to electronic collection methods can reduce costs and mitigate risks, such as theft, but the specific circumstances of individual agencies and payers have affected agencies' ability to fully adopt these methods. Use of electronic methods can result in cost savings, increased processing speed and accuracy, and improved security of staff and deposits. Specifically, FMS reports that on average the government saves 78 cents for each electronic transaction. Additionally, case-study agencies and payer groups GAO spoke with reported reduced costs when using electronic collection methods. Despite the advantages, payer characteristics, other agency considerations, and set-up costs or required system changes have limited agencies' adoption of electronic collection methods. Also, agencies may not have enough information to make cost-effective decisions about their choice of collection method. FMS is implementing a plan to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of federal collections, but the plan excludes important cost considerations and does not use all available incentives. Specifically, the plan does not consider the cost differences among different electronic methods or ensure the consistent application of policies on reimbursement for certain services. The FMS plan also does not include a strategy for incorporating key lessons-learned from agency reviews into its guidance and communicating that information to agencies. With such information, agencies not scheduled for review until later years could begin to transition to more efficient methods."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Financial Management  Service (FMS) collected almost $509 billion in funds received by agencies  other than the Internal Revenue Service (non-IRS collections) in fiscal  year 2009. In prior work we found that the method used to collect  payments can affect compliance with payment requirements as well as  administrative costs for both agencies and fee payers. Although certain  FMS collections services can reduce government borrowing costs, reduce  agency/payer administrative costs, and improve the security of collections,  some agencies do not use these services for collections, relying instead on  agency deposit of paper-based collections. As a result we reported there  were delays between the time payments were received and the time they  were deposited into the Treasury, thus increasing government borrowing  costs.", "This report responds to your request that we examine opportunities to  improve the efficiency of federal collections governmentwide. Specifically,  we examined (1) the extent to which agencies other than IRS use  collection methods in FMS\u2019s collections program, (2) how FMS and these  agencies can maximize the benefits of and overcome any barriers to use of  the various collection methods, and (3) issues FMS should consider as it  implements its plans for improving the efficiency and security of these  collections. As agreed with your offices, we did not review IRS collections.  Also excluded from the review are collections of the Commodity Credit  Corporation (CCC), a federal corporation within the U.S. Department of  Agriculture.", "To assess the extent to which agencies use various collection methods, we  analyzed FMS data on collections received by agencies other than IRS for  fiscal years 2005 through 2009, by collection method. We reviewed FMS  guidance and interviewed FMS officials to gather operational information  on each collection method and understand why use of the various  collection methods changed over time. To identify ways FMS and selected  agencies can maximize the benefits of and overcome any barriers to the  use of collection methods, we conducted case-study reviews of five  agencies within two departments: the Minerals Management Service  (MMS), the National Park Service (NPS), and the U.S. Geological Survey  (USGS) in the Department of the Interior; and the United States Patent and  Trademark Office (USPTO) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric  Administration (NOAA) in the Department of Commerce. The case-study  agencies selected permitted us to cover the variety of collection methods  and payer characteristics, however the findings cannot be generalized  across the government. For each case-study agency, we analyzed  collections data; observed agency collection processes; reviewed relevant  legislation, regulations, agency guidance, and audit reports; and  interviewed agency officials. We also reviewed FMS regulations and  guidance, analyzed FMS data related to the costs and benefits of the  various collection methods, and interviewed FMS officials. We also met  with four payer groups identified by case-study agencies to gain an  understanding of the effects of the shift to electronic collections on  payers. These payer groups were trade organizations, one private-sector  company, and representatives from state governments. To identify the  issues FMS should consider in implementing its plans for improving the  efficiency and security of collections, we reviewed legislation and FMS  plans and agency agreements, applied relevant findings from our case  studies, and interviewed FMS and case-study agency officials. We assessed  the reliability of the data we used for this review and determined that they  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes.

Through its collections program, FMS also provides services  to federal agencies to collect, deposit, and account for federal collections.  Its collections program provides a means for individuals and  organizations, including businesses, state and local governments, and  nonprofit organizations, to remit funds such as taxes, duties, fees, sales,  leases, and loan repayments to the government. FMS offers a range of fully  electronic, partly electronic, and nonelectronic collection methods (see  table 1 and fig. 1).", "The agencies we examined for our case studies use a variety of these  collection methods (see table 2).", "FMS manages the services through which all federal collections are  deposited in the Treasury and strives to minimize the time between when  funds are collected and when they are deposited in the Treasury. Treasury  regulations state that when it is cost effective, practicable, and consistent  with current statutory authority, electronic transfers of funds are the  optimal method for federal collections, especially when fees are recurring  or of large dollar amounts. Accordingly, FMS may require an agency  wishing to use a collection method other than electronic transfer to  provide a cost-benefit analysis to justify this selection. In past work, we  highlighted the benefits of electronic collection processing. Specifically,  we reported that electronic collections provide better accuracy, lower  mailing and processing costs, and fewer delinquencies and defaults. When  the Federal Reserve moved to electronic conversions of paper checks,  work hours spent on check processing decreased by almost half and  transportation costs associated with check processing decreased by about  11 percent. In recent years FMS has made it a priority to increase the use  of electronic collection methods and reduce collection costs. FMS has  begun an initiative, called the Holistic Approach, to further these goals.", "Selection of the best collection mechanism is a joint responsibility of  agencies and FMS. Agencies have responsibility for working with FMS to  conduct cash-management reviews, gathering volume and dollar data  relative to the operation of the systems, and funding any implementation  and operational costs above those normally funded by Treasury. FMS  provides guidance to agencies in its Treasury Financial Manual regarding  the selection and cost-effective use of collection mechanisms. Agencies  must provide FMS with a recommended mechanism for any new or  modified cash flows. FMS reviews the recommendations, approves a  mechanism, and assists with implementation.", "FMS\u2019s oversight of federal agencies\u2019 cash-management activities includes  review of collections. FMS uses findings from such reviews to develop  initiatives to improve an agency\u2019s collections and set and monitor dates by  which the agency must implement changes. Moreover, FMS may charge  agencies that do not meet the implementation deadlines for the amount of  interest savings that would have been realized by timely implementation.", "According to Treasury regulations, when funds are not collected  electronically, agencies generally must deposit funds into the Treasury or  a designated depositary on the day of receipt.", "FMS\u2019s collections program is funded in part by permanent and indefinite  appropriations for all financial agent (banking) services required or  directed by Treasury. In some cases federal agencies reimburse FMS for a  part or all of these costs. For fiscal year 2009, FMS obligated $568 million  for banking services, an 8 percent increase over the $528 million obligated  in fiscal year 2008.

Fully electronic payments  accounted for more than 80 percent of dollars collected by agencies other  than IRS for fiscal years 2005 through 2009, with $441 billion of the almost  $509 billion collected using fully electronic methods in fiscal year 2009.  While the percentage of funds collected through nonelectronic methods in  2009 was low, it constituted over $36 billion. Nor does it represent a  similarly low percentage of transactions. For example, in fiscal year 2008,  MMS\u2019s Minerals Revenue Management program collected over $23 billion  in federal rents and royalties from the public; while payments by check  represented only 2 percent of the dollars collected, they represented 77  percent of the total number of its transactions.", "In fiscal year 2009, of the almost $509 billion in non-IRS collections, about  $68 billion was collected as cash or checks and processed using either  partly electronic or nonelectronic collection methods. As shown in figure  2, there was a significant shift from nonelectronic to partly electronic  methods from 2005 to 2009. In 2005, partly electronic collection methods  accounted for just under 2 percent of cash and check collections, but by  2009 this share had increased to over 46 percent. Given the significant  process and cost differences between fully electronic and partly electronic  collection methods, we distinguish between them in this analysis.", "The growth in partly electronic payments largely represents a change in  agency processes rather than in payer behavior: the shift is largely the  result of a growth in electronic check processing capacity both at agencies  and through lockbox banks. In fiscal year 2008 almost $24 billion in  collections settled as paper checks at lockbox banks, but in fiscal year  2009 less than $2.4 billion was settled this way. Conversely, collections  through electronic check processing were about $27 billion in fiscal year  2008, but were over $31 billion in fiscal year 2009. FMS attributes this  growth to a large marketing effort and new electronic check processing  locations (according to FMS officials, 209 new locations\u2014185 agency PCC  and 24 lockbox ECP locations\u2014were added in fiscal year 2009).", "FMS plans to discontinue some current electronic collection methods and  shift programs that use those methods to Pay.gov\u2014a Web-based portal  that processes collections made through ACH transfer and credit card\u2014 which will consolidate and simplify the number of collection methods  available through FMS. FMS officials told us that they expect ACH pre- authorized debits will be phased out and replaced by Pay.gov by the end of  calendar year 2009. In addition, FMS plans to shift most of the existing 32  lockbox ACH accounts to Pay.gov or other electronic collection methods,  leaving only 2 such accounts in existence at the end of calendar year 2010.  There are also plans to shift certain collections from nonelectronic  methods to Pay.gov; for example, MMS is currently shifting its rent  collections from paper checks to Pay.gov and, according to MMS officials,  will continue to expand its use of Pay.gov in 2010."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Movement to Electronic Collection Methods Can Reduce Costs and Mitigate Some Risks, but Agency-Specific Circumstances Have Affected Adoption of These Methods", "paragraphs": ["FMS, case-study agencies, and the payer groups we interviewed have  identified a variety of cost savings stemming from the use of electronic  collection methods. These savings stem from more efficient agency  processing, expected lower future costs for system changes, the  acceleration of deposits to the Treasury, and a lower administrative  burden for payer groups. The shift to electronic methods has also  mitigated some security and accuracy risks for agencies. Nevertheless,  some organizations identified agency-specific circumstances that make  full adoption of electronic collection methods less beneficial. These  circumstances were determined by the characteristics of an agency\u2019s  payer base, other agency considerations, and the initial system or  equipment costs related to the transition."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Electronic Collection Methods Have Reduced FMS\u2019s, Agencies\u2019, and Customers\u2019 Costs", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all five case-study agencies cited a decrease in current or  estimated future costs resulting from the use of electronic collection  methods but none of the agencies could fully quantify these savings.", "In some cases, agencies increased the efficiency of internal processing  operations. For example, officials at USGS said their 2008 move from  nonelectronic check processing to partly-electronic paper check  conversion increased process efficiency. Specifically, according to  officials in one USGS office that underwent the transition, the change  reduced the time it takes staff to process checks, thus freeing up staff to  undertake additional tasks. This office disseminates USGS products such  as maps and books and processes checks, credit card payments, and small  amounts of cash from its sales. Prior to the transition, the nonelectronic  check process required manual preparation of the deposit and a staff  member to take the deposit to the bank each day. The new partly  electronic process permits a Web-based deposit process and reduces the  need to physically go to the bank.  In another case, a decrease in agency processing costs has the potential to  reduce the size of cost-recovery fees. A NOAA regional permit official said  that an upcoming shift from using a lockbox bank to Pay.gov for its fee  collections is expected to increase staff efficiency and reduce payment  processing costs such as the office\u2019s mailing costs. If these cost savings  are realized, the cost reductions may be passed along to the payers of the  fee.", "In addition, fully electronic collection methods may incorporate electronic  submission of remittance data, enabling automatic transfers of payment  and remittance data to the agency\u2019s accounting system. For example, to  account for ACH transfers after funds are deposited in the Treasury, MMS  prints out detailed payment information from FMS, matches payment  information to the correct payer, and manually enters the detailed data  into MMS\u2019s internal accounting system. MMS officials told us that they are  planning to update their accounting software to make this process  automatic. They also said they expect that the implementation of Pay.gov  will be designed to automate this process and thus reduce costs.  In May 2008 USPTO shifted its credit card processing function to Pay.gov  both to decrease current costs and avoid future system costs for the  agency. Adopting Pay.gov enabled USPTO to discontinue the lease of a  line to a credit card authorization provider, a monthly savings of about  $1,000. Agency officials also said they expect that costs associated with  future agency system changes stemming from a change in the FMS credit  card processor will be eliminated because Pay.gov will manage the  transition. Potential exists for similar savings at other agencies; according  to officials at NPS and USGS, they also incurred costs for system and  equipment changes that were required after FMS changed its credit card  processor.", "Some payer groups also cited benefits of a shift towards electronic  collection methods. Three of the four payer groups we spoke with  reported that the increased use of electronic methods has improved  efficiency and saved money for their organizations or members by  reducing administrative time, costs, or both. For example, state  government representatives agreed that for many organizations, paying by  ACH transfer is preferred because paying by check is expensive in terms  of the cost and time of printing, mailing, and reconciling payments. More  specifically, a representative of the state of Mississippi said that the state  requires all vendors, besides federal agencies, to accept payments from the  state electronically. The specific challenges faced by these payers when  using federal agency collection methods is discussed later in this report.", "As we have previously reported, the acceleration of deposits to the  Treasury can reduce the amount Treasury needs to borrow each day to  pay government obligations. According to FMS, moving to electronic  check processing reduces processing time by 1 day on average, whether  done at the agency or at a lockbox bank. These total times range from 1  day to 6 days depending on the collection method selected and whether  mail time is included (see table 3). In the case of paper check conversion,  this improvement brings check processing on par with some fully  electronic collection methods such as ACH transfers and credit cards."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Case-Study Agencies Make Collection Decisions without Full Information", "paragraphs": ["Although the shift to electronic collection methods has increased  efficiencies and decreased costs, agencies are generally unable to consider  the full range of the federal government\u2019s expenses\u2014specifically FMS\u2019s  total collection costs\u2014when analyzing program costs and setting fee rates.  This is because FMS generally does not provide these cost data to  agencies, although according to officials, it could. FMS officials stated  that FMS does not track cost of collection information by agency, but  instead by collection method and bank. FMS has this cost information and  could provide it, but based on past practices, it generally has not. As we  have previously reported, reliable information on the costs of federal  programs and activities is crucial for effective management of government  operations. Currently, agencies make decisions about collection methods  without the benefit of this information. Moreover, agencies could  determine whether such costs should be considered in the design and level  of full-cost recovery fees. To the extent such cost data are provided,  agencies that are authorized to charge full-cost recovery fees\u2014for  example, fees charged under the Independent Offices Appropriation Act of  1952 (IOAA)\u2014could, in some cases, include FMS\u2019s cost of collections in  their fee rates and deposit these funds into the Treasury."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Electronic Collection Methods Mitigate Security Concerns and Risks of Inaccuracy, Potentially Decreasing Collection Losses", "paragraphs": ["Officials from all five case-study agencies and FMS stated that use of  electronic collection methods have reduced the risk of either security  problems or processing errors.

Alternatively, some agencies reduced concerns  about staff safety by making bank deposits by means of a courier service.  However, using couriers poses other security risks and adds costs to the  collections process. For example, MMS officials said that courier costs at  its Denver office are approximately $80,000 a year for two daily mail  deliveries and one daily bank deposit.", "NPS guidance also deals with security concerns pertaining to cash  collections and the use of personnel to collect fees. For example, this  guidance notes that parks\u2019 implementation of a type of ACH transfer that is  primarily used for commercial tour groups reduces the amount of cash  handled by staff and therefore improves security. In addition, officials at  the Rocky Mountain National Park said that permitting unattended  entrance stations to accept only credit cards, rather than both cash and  credit cards, reduced collection costs and made the machines less  vulnerable to attempted theft.", "Officials from three of our case-study agencies stated that the electronic  collection or provision of payment data has lowered the risk of processing  errors, reducing repeated work and lost time and effort.", "USGS staff said that using paper check conversion has reduced the errors  in the process because the system confirms deposit totals before  completing a deposit.", "Similarly, MMS officials reported a decrease in administrative errors  stemming from the use of Pay.gov for a selection of its fees.", "USPTO\u2019s adoption of an automated method for uploading remittance  information for organizations making multiple payments also reduced  errors. In some cases, USPTO may receive several thousand patent  renewals in one submission from a single company that manages these  renewals for multiple customers. In the past, these renewals would be sent  to a lockbox bank and remittance information would be entered manually.

All five of our case-study agencies stated that payer characteristics and  customer needs affected the selection of collection methods. In some  cases, customer preferences as well as customer access to banks and  online banking systems have influenced the different payment methods  that agencies offer.", "MMS said that its customers, while typically large companies, also include  smaller operations that may not be amenable to electronic collections.  When MMS mandated electronic submission of royalty collections, it  granted waivers for those that appealed the requirement\u2014approximately  100 of the 2,100 entities for which it processes royalty revenues. Although  a small percentage, such accommodation requires that the agency manage  a waiver system and requires the maintenance of a nonelectronic or partly  electronic collection method alongside the new fully electronic collection  method. In the case of MMS, the agency maintained its nonelectronic  check processing for collections other than royalties, so the nonelectronic  processes were not solely maintained for those customers with waivers.", "A representative of a commercial tour operator industry group stated that  smaller operators in his membership would prefer the maintenance of a  more flexible method of payment for NPS entrance fees than that  preferred by larger operators. NPS is considering adopting Pay.gov to  allow customers to use a Web portal to make online purchases. The tour  representative recommended that NPS continue to accept credit cards  from commercial operators at its entrances in order to accommodate  smaller operators as the agency shifts to Pay.gov. While credit cards are an  electronic collection method, the desire to maintain this alternative  payment option in order to better serve its customers imposes costs on the  agency, such as the purchase of necessary equipment.", "Other agency considerations also influence the selection and adoption of  collection methods. MMS officials told us that they decided to pursue  Pay.gov for MMS\u2019s rent collections rather than selecting a commercial  lockbox because a lockbox service would not meet their internal process  needs. Although the shift to Pay.gov is underway, officials acknowledge  there will always be some paper check collections to manage. In another  case, NPS officials told us that the services provided by those performing  collection activities go beyond the collection itself. They explained that  they do not wish to remove all representatives from entrance fee  collection stations\u2014even if it were possible\u2014because fee collectors are  often \u201cambassadors\u201d for the park and provide an important public service.  Nonetheless, it requires that NPS incur some level of labor costs related to  collections.", "For two case-study agencies the setup costs or required system changes  necessary to implement electronic collection methods affected the ability  or the extent to which the agency or program office could adopt or  maintain electronic collection methods.", "In 2002 and 2003, one NOAA regional permit office used Pay.gov as a  payment method. The office discontinued the use of Pay.gov because of  changes to the office\u2019s database system and lack of information  technology support required to establish the new system\u2019s connection to  Pay.gov. Nonetheless, a current project aims to reestablish the link to  Pay.gov.", "NPS reports that at some remote park locations the telephone and Internet  access necessary to support electronic collection methods may be difficult  to establish. Even in less remote areas, geographic dispersion may create  challenges, such as the need to maintain and purchase equipment for  multiple collection or processing points within one park. For example,  Rocky Mountain National Park, which covers 265,800 acres and has four  entrances, maintains two remittance offices to prepare collections for  deposit because the road crossing the park also crosses the continental  divide and is impassable during winter months. Therefore, collections  cannot be transported from one side of the park to the other and must be  prepared for deposit separately.", "Finally, meeting the varying system requirements for some electronic  collection methods can also be a barrier for customer use. Officials from  three state governments that submit payments to USGS told us that, while  they prefer electronic collection methods such as ACH transfers, the  differing technical requirements and data formats at each federal agency  can make such transfers a burdensome, manual process. Our prior work  has found a similar lack of standardization across federal grant-making  agencies. For example, the use of multiple payment systems has resulted  in an excessive administrative burden for grantees.

Consistent with these responsibilities, FMS developed a 5-year \u201cHolistic  Approach\u201d plan, which establishes a framework for increasing the use of  electronic collection mechanisms governmentwide; streamlining the  collections process; offering collection mechanisms that are easy to use,  convenient, and secure; managing depositary services that banks provide  to federal agencies; and providing timely collection of federal receipts. To  implement this plan, FMS ranked agencies for review based largely on  their dollar volume of collections using nonelectronic methods. It plans to  review the collections of and draft Strategic Cash Management  Agreements with 112 agencies spread about evenly over fiscal years 2009  through 2013. During the development of the agreements, FMS reviews  all agency collections, including those already using electronic methods, to  see if a more efficient method could be adopted. According to FMS  officials and as described above, the payer and type of collection are key  factors in choosing a collection method. Each interagency Strategic Cash  Management Agreement will outline the methods currently used by the  agency for each of its collections; recommend electronic collection  mechanisms; set conversion timelines, agencywide goals, and metrics; and  estimate savings from conversion. The agreements commit both FMS and  the agencies to implement improvements to agencies\u2019 overall cash- management practices.", "As laid out in its Holistic Approach plan, FMS estimates savings of  conversion from nonelectronic to electronic collection methods as part of  each agency review. FMS estimates that average per transaction collection  costs are $1.679 for nonelectronic methods and $0.897 for electronic  methods. Using these figures, FMS estimates that shifting to electronic  collections will save an average of $0.78 per transaction. However, there  are significant differences in cost per transaction between different  electronic collection methods which may be obscured by using only these  two broad categories to estimate savings. For example, FMS estimates  that, on average, ACH transfers processed through Pay.gov cost $0.64 per  transaction, credit card transactions cost $1.30 per transaction, and  lockbox ECP costs $0.58 per transaction.", "Although the cost of using different collection methods also can vary by  the dollar amount of the transaction, FMS officials said they do not use  volume threshold guidelines when working with agencies to select  payment methods. Specifically, credit card merchant fees are, in part, a  percentage of the value of the transaction. Though it may be less costly to  process a small collection by credit card than by check, the reverse may be  the case for large-dollar-value collections. We recently reported that the  average merchant discount rate FMS paid in fiscal year 2007 was 1.43  percent. In a hypothetical example using this rate, the total fees for a  $100 transaction would be $1.43 and the fees for a $10,000 transaction  would be $143. FMS limits individual credit card transactions to under  $100,000 in order to limit merchant fees.", "FMS\u2019s Holistic Approach plan does not provide for all available incentives  to encourage agencies to increase the use of more cost effective collection  methods. By using FMS services, agencies can reduce their own costs of  collection. Specifically, as noted earlier, agencies that collect credit card  payments through Pay.gov would be able to avoid the costs of future  system changes because with Pay.gov those changes would be handled by  FMS. The Holistic Approach plan includes a provision for an inefficiency  charge of $1.00 per transaction for any collection not converted by the  deadline as outlined in the agreement. Although FMS has the authority to  assess inefficiency charges against agencies regardless of an agreement,  according to FMS officials, the charge is only assessed on agencies that  voluntarily sign an agreement and then only if the agency misses agreed- upon and likely flexible deadlines. Furthermore, FMS officials said they  are not using the Holistic Approach to review whether agencies are paying  for certain collection services as required. FMS guidance\u2014Treasury  Bulletin 94-07\u2014requires that agencies reimburse FMS for ancillary  services and for standard lockbox collection services unless lockbox  processing provides a net financial benefit to the Treasury\u2019s general fund.  In one case, we found that charges for a NOAA lockbox were initiated by  FMS and then halted for an unknown reason. In the past, NOAA  reimbursed FMS for services on one of its lockboxes. However, when the  lockbox was moved to a different bank in 2005, the reimbursement charge  was discontinued. FMS officials do not have any records of why they  ceased to charge NOAA; NOAA officials were also not aware of the reason  why the charges were discontinued. By not reviewing agency  responsibility to pay for collection services, FMS does not make use of an  available incentive to agencies to move to more efficient collection  methods. FMS officials stated that as part of the review, FMS negotiates  the collections proposals with the agency, but that agencies may have  other, higher priorities than making the investments needed for a change.  If FMS also reviewed whether the agency should reimburse FMS for the  collection services and charged the agency based on the findings of that  review, the agency would have a financial incentive to adopt the more  cost-effective method."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FMS Plan Does Not Include Strategy for Communicating and Incorporating Lessons Learned from Agency Reviews as It Proceeds with Expanded Implementation", "paragraphs": ["The Holistic Approach plan does not include a strategy for communicating  lessons-learned from earlier reviews to agencies.

In its reviews to date, FMS found that two agencies  were holding funds outside of TGA banks and is aware of some inefficient  collection practices that do not rise to the level of being unauthorized  cash-management practices. In our case-study reviews we also found  examples of inefficient collection practices, including the following:    On a few occasions, USPTO accepted credit cards as payment for multiple,  individual sale transactions processed on the same day to the same credit  card account number. This resulted in the sum of the payments to the  same credit card account number to be at or near the dollar limit for credit  card transactions.

FMS does  not have an official volume threshold for lockboxes, but officials stated  that processing checks through a lockbox might be a good choice for a  program collecting a minimum of 1,000 checks and $1 million per month.  Of the eight NOAA lockboxes, all had calendar year 2008 collections  volume that averaged less than 1,000 checks per month and only one  processed over $1 million per month on average; one lockbox processed  208 checks totaling less than $5,000 that year. Check volume affects the  per-transaction cost of lockbox services because some lockbox bank  charges are fixed (e.g., monthly account maintenance charges).", "As a standard practice for one NOAA regional permit office, payers mailed  checks to the office and then NOAA mailed the checks to the lockbox  bank for processing on a weekly basis. This practice delays deposit of the  collections.", "Agencies not scheduled for review until later years also may lack  information on how to overcome barriers to the use of electronic  collection methods or invest in more cost-effective collection methods.  Such barriers include agency regulations that define the methods an  agency uses to make collections, and payers that are less amenable to  electronic collection methods. With better information about the  capabilities and benefits of the various collection methods, agencies could  in turn communicate that information to their payer groups. According to  payer groups we spoke with, their members would be more likely to adopt  electronic collection methods if agencies encouraged them. According to  FMS, existing agency collection contracts and systems can be a barrier to  adoption of more efficient collection methods.", "Some FMS collections guidance is outdated, but the Holistic Approach  plan does not include a strategy for updating guidance based on lessons- learned from the agency reviews. The primary guidance to agencies on the  various options for collection methods\u2014FMS\u2019s Cash Management Made  Easy\u2014was last updated in April 2002 and includes outdated descriptions  of some methods.

However, it  can be difficult for agencies to effectively manage their programs or make  informed choices among collection options because FMS generally does  not provide agencies data or information on FMS\u2019s costs of collections for  a given agency, program, or collection method. FMS has cost information  by collection method but generally does not provide it to agencies. While  FMS officials said that they could and have provided cost information  upon request, we believe provision of such data should not be ad hoc.  Rather, data should be distributed systematically to facilitate agency  program management. The lack of information on FMS\u2019s costs of  collections means that agencies do not have complete information for  analysis of their fee structure and level. For some full-cost recovery fees  this means that the federal government may be inappropriately foregoing  revenues.", "FMS\u2019s ongoing initiative to analyze and review the collection activity in  each agency through implementation of its Holistic Approach plan  facilitates growth in the use of electronic collection methods. However,  two aspects of the approach may lead to decisions that are not the most  cost-effective. First, FMS groups all fully and partially electronic methods  together when developing an estimate of the cost savings of shifts from  nonelectronic to other collection methods. Second, FMS does not make  use of all available financial incentives\u2014including enforcing its own  guidance by requiring agencies to reimburse it for certain collection  services.", "Finally, some inefficient agency collection practices may persist longer  than necessary because FMS\u2019s Holistic Approach plan does not include  either a strategy to communicate key lessons-learned from early agency  reviews to other agencies whose reviews are scheduled for future years or  a way to use the information to update FMS guidance to agencies.

FMS commented that it is working on establishing such criteria in an  initiative separate from the Holistic Approach. In describing this initiative  to us, FMS officials explained that by separating the two initiatives they  expect to be able to review and update the policy on reimbursement more  quickly. They expect to complete the review of the reimbursement policy  by April 2010. The officials also noted that enforcement of the policy may  need to be phased-in over time as agencies will need to ensure that their  appropriations allow reimbursement to FMS for certain collection  services.
