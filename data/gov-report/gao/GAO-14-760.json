From application receipt to loan decision, SBA took an average of 45 days to process physical business disaster loans and 38 days for economic injury loans, both of which exceed SBA's 21-day application processing goal. SBA said it was challenged by an unexpectedly high volume of loan applications that it received early in its response to the disaster, in addition to other challenges, such as technological issues. SBA estimated that application submissions would peak about 7 to 9 weeks after Hurricane Sandy, but it received a larger volume of applications than were expected prior to that period. While SBA officials told GAO that the agency has taken steps to respond to some challenges, it has not revised its disaster planning documents\u2014including the Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan\u2014to reflect the early volume of application submissions received after Hurricane Sandy and the potential impact a similar experience could have on staffing, resources, and forecasting models for future disasters. Federal internal control standards state that management should identify risks and take action to manage them.

This rate was lower than those of Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, and Wilma, higher than that of Ike, and comparable to that of Irene (the five disasters that generated the most SBA disaster loan applications since 2005). For Hurricane Sandy and for previous disasters, SBA declined business loan applications primarily because of applicants' lack of repayment ability and credit history.", "SBA has not implemented the guaranteed disaster loan programs Congress mandated in 2008, including the Immediate Disaster Assistance Program (IDAP)\u2014a bridge loan program through private sector lenders providing disaster victims with up to $25,000 with a 36-hour application approval period. SBA officials told GAO they are trying to implement IDAP but have received feedback from lenders that some program requirements\u2014such as a statutory minimum 10-year time frame for servicing the loan under certain circumstances\u2014may discourage lenders from participating. However, SBA has not conducted a formal documented evaluation of lenders' feedback that would establish the basis for proposed changes to requirements for Congress to consider.

According to SBA, the early  spike in applications occurred because a majority of applications were  submitted electronically rather than on paper, which resulted in a large  volume of applications within a few days of the disaster. SBA stated that  the earlier receipt of electronic submissions was caused by the  convenience and speed of the Internet-based application as well as the  elimination of postal handling time.

Further,  ODA officials noted that most of the additional processing staff members,  particularly those in the Sacramento center, were new hires because it  was more cost-effective to hire loan officers from the area than to incur  costs of transporting pre-identified staff from various locations.

According to SBA, the agency is  taking several steps to improve DCMS for future disasters. For  example, SBA planned to institute a process for updating system  equipment based on a consistent life-cycle by, among other things,  conducting a baseline inventory and implementing a plan to replace  outdated hardware. According to SBA officials, the inventory has been  validated by center directors and the plan has been completed. In  addition, SBA officials said that the agency has made improvements  to its DCMS Help Desk, which responds to loan officers who  experience system issues. These improvements include implementing  a tiered approach to addressing system issues and better ensuring  that the Help Desk is used by all centers in a standardized way.", "Loan Officer Training: As mentioned previously, most of the  additional processing staff, particularly those at the Sacramento  center, were new hires, but SBA found that these new loan officers  were not effectively trained to quickly respond to the backlog of  business applications. According to SBA, loan processing production  was not fully realized immediately following the increase in staff  because it took new loan officers longer than expected to fully learn  how to process loan applications. In addition, loan officers were not  converted into business loan officers until they demonstrated  proficiency in processing home loans. Further, these loan officers  required additional specialized training to learn how to process a  business loan within DCMS. According to SBA, this strategy was  ineffective because it was implemented at the peak of receiving and  processing applications. SBA has taken steps to revise its loan officer  training for future disasters to be more production-oriented rather than  focusing on DCMS use. According to SBA officials, the PDC  developed a revised training course for processing business loans in  May 2014 that is required for all loan officers. As of July 2014, three  classes of approximately 18 loan officers each have completed the  training.

Therefore, the  potential effectiveness of these programs remains unclear. As previously  discussed, the act mandated the creation of the Immediate Disaster  Assistance Program (IDAP), the Expedited Disaster Assistance Loan  Program (EDALP), and the Private Disaster Assistance Program (PDAP).  According to SBA officials, the agency opted to implement IDAP first,  because the loan limit is lower than that of EDALP and PDAP and funds  were appropriated to pilot this program.", "A majority of entities with whom we spoke said that a program like IDAP  (i.e., a loan up to $25,000 with a 36-hour application approval time) would  be useful, as it could provide business owners with a short-term infusion  of capital to complete tasks such as debris removal, repairing physical  damage, and purchasing inventory. As previously discussed, on average,  it took SBA 45 and 38 days to process physical business disaster loan  and EIDL applications resulting from Hurricane Sandy, respectively (from  application receipt to loan decision).

GAO also reported that SBA requested funding to carry out  the requirements for these two programs in the President\u2019s budget for  fiscal year 2010. SBA received subsidy and administrative cost funding  totaling $3 million in the 2010 appropriation, which would allow the  agency to pilot test about 600 loans under IDAP The agency also issued  regulations for IDAP in October 2010.

First, the electronic systems that  would be used to process IDAP applications did not interface smoothly  with one another. According to SBA officials, IDAP\u2019s readiness was, in  part based on the ability of E-Tran (the 7(a) program\u2019s electronic loan  processing system) to interface with DCMS (the Disaster Loan Program\u2019s   Officials said that a new information  electronic loan processing system). technology system is being developed\u2014SBA One\u2014and that it is more  efficient to make DCMS interoperable with the new system to process  IDAP applications than to make enhancements to E-Tran.anticipates that SBA One will be operational by early 2015.", "Second, SBA told us that they received feedback from lenders indicating  challenges that may discourage lenders from participating in the program,  although SBA\u2019s documentation of this feedback is limited. In March 2010,  SBA organized a forum with 11 lenders in the Gulf Coast to obtain their  views on IDAP. Lenders stated that the program had to have simple  eligibility determination, as well as confirmation that a potential IDAP  borrower had applied for an SBA disaster loan before the lender would  approve an IDAP loan. Lenders also expressed concerns about the  possibility of guarantee denials if an applicant did not take out an SBA  disaster loan. In addition, according to SBA, in 2010 the agency also  consulted with Iowa lenders in flood-prone regions within the state via  conference calls and lenders expressed similar concerns about IDAP.  However, both the Gulf Coast forum and the conference calls with Iowa  lenders were not documented at the time the lender outreach was  conducted. As such, SBA officials must rely on the memory of staff who  were present for the discussions. In response to our request for  information on SBA\u2019s outreach to these lenders, in July 2014, SBA  provided a one-page summary on the outreach to both the Gulf Coast  and Iowa lenders.

Based on lender feedback, SBA officials said that the current statutory  requirements, such as the 10-year loan term, make a product like IDAP  undesirable and that lenders are not likely to participate in IDAP unless  the loan term is decreased\u2014for example, to between 5 and 7 years.  However, revising statutory program requirements requires congressional  action. SBA officials said that they have not discussed the feedback  received from lenders with Congress. As a result, Congress does not  have this information about SBA\u2019s challenges with and plans to pilot and  implement IDAP.

While SBA officials told us the agency has taken steps to respond  to these challenges, it has not revised its disaster planning documents\u2014 including the Disaster Preparedness and Recovery Plan and ODA  Playbook\u2014to reflect the unexpected volume of early applications and its  potential impact on staffing, resources, and forecasting models. Federal  internal control standards state that management should identify risks and  take action to manage them. Without taking the large volume of  applications it received shortly after Hurricane Sandy into account in its  disaster planning documents and analyzing the risk that trend may pose  for timely disaster response, SBA risks being unprepared for a similar  experience following future disasters, which may result in delays in  providing loan funds to disaster victims.", "Due to lender feedback and technology challenges, SBA has yet to pilot  IDAP and has not implemented IDAP, EDALP, and PDAP as required by  Congress in the Small Business Disaster Response and Loan  Improvements Act of 2008. SBA has also not developed an  implementation plan for addressing the act\u2019s requirements, as GAO  recommended in 2009. This plan was to include, among other things,  challenges the agency faces in implementing the act\u2019s requirements.  Private sector lenders have given SBA feedback on barriers to their  willingness to participate in IDAP, such as statutory program  requirements that could make the make the loans undesirable for lenders.  However SBA has not conducted a formal documented evaluation of  lenders\u2019 feedback that would establish the basis for proposed changes to  requirements for Congress to consider. In addition, SBA has not provided  lenders\u2019 feedback and its evaluation of that feedback to Congress\u2014the  entity that could remove potential barriers to SBA\u2019s implementation of the  program.

In addition, SBA stated that it has already taken steps to  document and address the early volume of application submissions. For  example, SBA noted that the most recent Disaster Planning and  Recovery Plan (DPRP) released in June 2014 addresses the increased  usage of the electronic application and the resulting impact of early  application submissions on staffing and resources due to both the  convenience and speed of the Internet-based application and to the  elimination of postal handling time. SBA further stated that it believes the  agency has already met this recommendation. While SBA has  acknowledged the impact of early application submissions on staffing and  resources, SBA has not yet developed details of how it will incorporate its  experience with Hurricane Sandy throughout its disaster planning to  better address resource and staffing needs resulting from early  application submissions. Thus, we maintain that SBA should take  additional action to fully address this recommendation. SBA stated that it  plans to go further and incorporate the early application submissions in  the next update of the ODA Playbook and in other ODA planning  documents. It will be important for SBA to follow through on these plans in  order to reduce the risk that increased early application submissions pose  to SBA\u2019s ability to deliver timely disaster assistance.", "In response to our recommendations that SBA conduct a formal  documented evaluation of lenders\u2019 feedback on IDAP, and report to  Congress on challenges to implementing the program, SBA agreed that  its Office of Capital Access (OCA) has not performed a formal  documented evaluation of IDAP.

Specifically, SBA noted that  about 83 percent of loan applications received after Hurricane Sandy  were for home disaster loans, which caused a significant impact on the  agency\u2019s overall response. In our report, which specifically reviewed  SBA\u2019s assistance to small businesses following Hurricane Sandy, we  acknowledge that SBA disaster assistance is not limited to small  businesses and home loan applications comprised about 80 percent of all  Hurricane Sandy disaster applications. Our report also notes that  business owners could have faced delays due to the large number of  home loan applications submitted ahead of them and that one process  improvement SBA made after Hurricane Sandy was to revise its loan  processing approach to create two separate tracks for home and  business disaster loan applications.", "Finally, consistent with information provided in the report, SBA  summarized various other process improvements that the agency has  implemented to mitigate the challenges faced during Hurricane Sandy  and for future disasters. The draft report that we sent to SBA for comment  also described many of these changes. For example, we note in our  report that SBA is taking several steps to streamline the documentation  requirements for applicants and improve the process to submit additional  information.
