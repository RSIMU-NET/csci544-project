The Coastal Barrier Resources Act, as amended (CBRA), designates 585 units of undeveloped coastal lands and aquatic habitat as the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). CBRA prohibits most federal expenditures and assistance within the system that could encourage development, but it allows federal agencies to provide some types of assistance and issue certain regulatory permits. In 1992, GAO reported that development was occurring in the CBRS despite restrictions on federal assistance. GAO updated its 1992 report and reviewed the extent to which (1) development has occurred in CBRS units since their inclusion in the system and (2) federal financial assistance and permits have been provided to entities in CBRS units. GAO electronically mapped address data for structures within 91 randomly selected CBRS units and collected information on federal financial assistance and permits for eight federal agencies."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["An estimated 84 percent of CBRS units remain undeveloped, while 16 percent have experienced some level of development. About 13 percent of the developed units experienced minimal levels of development--typically consisting of less than 20 additional structures per unit since becoming part of the CBRS, and about 3 percent experienced significant development--consisting of 100 or more structures per unit--since becoming part of the CBRS. According to federal and local officials, CBRA has played little role in the extent of development within the CBRS units that we reviewed because they believe that other factors have been more important in inhibiting development. These include (1) the lack of suitably developable land in the unit; (2) the lack of accessibility to the unit; (3) state laws discouraging development within coastal areas; and (4) ownership of land within the unit by groups, such as the National Audubon Society, who are seeking to preserve its natural state. In units that GAO reviewed where development had occurred, federal and local officials also identified a number of factors that have contributed to development despite the unit's inclusion in the CBRS. These include (1) a combination of commercial interest and public desire to build in the unit, (2) local government support for development, and (3) the availability of affordable private flood insurance. Multiple federal agencies have provided some financial assistance to property owners in CBRS units that is expressly prohibited by CBRA; some assistance allowed under CBRA; and hundreds of permits for federally regulated development activities within the unit. Specifically, four agencies--the Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Small Business Administration--provided financial assistance, such as flood insurance and loan guarantees, totaling about $21 million that is prohibited by CBRA to property owners in CBRS units. Although most of these agencies had processes in place to prevent such assistance from being provided, they cited problems with inaccurate maps as being a key factor leading to these errors. With regard to financial assistance allowed by CBRA, GAO found that three federal agencies have provided such assistance but did not track how much assistance they provided, so the total extent of this assistance is unknown. With regard to permits issued in CBRS units for federally regulated activities, GAO identified hundreds of permits issued by the Army Corps of Engineers and state agencies authorized to issue permits on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency. These permits covered various activities such as the construction of piers, the discharge of dredged or fill material into federally regulated waters, and permits associated with water discharges from construction sites or wastewater treatment systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. coasts are among the most rapidly growing and developed areas  in the nation. From 1980 to 2003, the population in U.S coastal areas is  estimated to have increased by 33 million people and is projected to  increase by another 7 million people by 2008. Coastal barriers, such as  islands and broad sandy barrier beaches, serve as the mainland\u2019s first line  of defense against the impacts of hurricanes and coastal storms. These  areas are also biologically rich and provide protection for a variety of fish  and wildlife species, including migratory birds, shellfish, and sea turtles.  While the geological composition of coastal barriers makes them highly  unstable areas on which to build, their desirable waterfront locations  make them attractive for development. As development and population  increase, the risk to human life, property, and valuable habitat increases,  and the natural buffers that minimize storm damage are degraded. For  example, when Hurricane Isabel made landfall along North Carolina\u2019s  Outer Banks in 2003, it caused widespread wind and storm surge damage  to several piers, several thousand homes and businesses, and damaged or  washed away sections of a highway.", "Recognizing that development in coastal barrier areas can be impacted by  the actions and programs of the federal government, Congress enacted the  Coastal Barrier Resources Act in 1982. The stated purpose of the Coastal  Barrier Resources Act as amended (CBRA) is to minimize (1) the loss of  human life; (2) wasteful expenditures of federal revenue; and (3) damage  to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources associated with coastal  barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts and the shores of the Great  Lakes by restricting future federal expenditures and financial assistance,  which have the effect of encouraging development of coastal barriers.  Through CBRA, Congress designated 585 units of undeveloped coastal  land and associated aquatic habitats comprising nearly 1.3 million acres as  the John H. Chafee Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS). Congress,  through the Coastal Barrier Improvement Act of 1990, also designated an  additional 1.8 million acres already held for conservation or recreation,  such as national wildlife refuges, national parks and seashores, and state  and county parks, as otherwise protected areas (OPA).", "CBRA does not prohibit development in CBRS units by owners willing to  develop their properties without the benefit of federal financial assistance,  such as federal flood insurance, loans, grants, subsidies or other forms of  direct or indirect federal assistance. Instead, with certain exceptions,  CBRA prohibits federal expenditures or financial assistance within CBRS  units that might encourage development. The prohibition includes\u2014but is  not limited to\u2014the issuance of flood insurance policies, home loans, loan  guarantees, and new or expanded infrastructure construction within CBRS  units. However, the act does exempt certain federal expenditures or  financial assistance from the general prohibition, such as emergency  operations that are essential to saving lives, maintaining and replacing  existing publicly owned infrastructure, energy development, and activities  related to national security. In addition, CBRA allows agencies to issue  permits to entities within the CBRS for certain federally regulated  activities, such as the construction of bridges and docks or the discharge  of dredged or fill materials into waters that fall under federal jurisdiction.", "Under CBRA, no single federal agency is assigned overall responsibility for  administering activities in the CBRS; instead, all federal agencies must  abide by the provisions of the act and are required to certify annually that  they are in compliance with CBRA. CBRA does assign the Secretary of the  Interior responsibility for, among other things, the tasks of consulting with  other federal agencies that propose spending funds within the CBRS,  maintaining maps for each CBRS unit, and recommending modifications to  CBRS unit boundaries, as needed. These maps are used by property  owners; federal, state, and local agencies; and other parties, such as  insurance agents, to determine whether a property or planned project is  within a CBRS unit and therefore whether it is ineligible for federal  financial assistance. Within the Department of the Interior (DOI) these  responsibilities belong to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS). The  existing maps that depict CBRS unit boundaries are outdated  technologically and present challenges to users.  In May 2006, the  Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to initiate a map  modernization project for all of the units in the CBRS that is to be  completed by 2013. This effort is designed to create digital maps of all  CBRS units that are more accurate and less time consuming for agencies  and others to use than the maps currently available.", "In 1992, we reported that development was occurring in some CBRS units  despite restrictions on federal assistance. CBRA has been amended  several times and the CBRS has expanded to include significantly more  units. In this context, you asked us to update our 1992 report and review  the extent to which (1) development has occurred in the CBRS and (2)  federal agencies have provided financial assistance and issued permits to  entities in CBRS units.", "To determine the extent of development that has occurred within CBRS  units, we selected a stratified random sample of 91 units located  throughout the system. The sample included units designated as part of  the system in 1982 and 1990. We did not include otherwise protected areas  in our analysis. For each unit, we obtained and electronically mapped  address or parcel data for structures within the unit boundaries.  Throughout this report, the percentage of units that have experienced  development is a statistical estimate based on our analysis of the  development in the 91 randomly selected units, which can be projected to  the entire system. The random sample was stratified by region to select an  equal number of units in northern and southern regions. In addition, we  conducted site visits and/or interviewed officials for a subset of 59 units in  13 states to determine the extent of and reasons for development. To  determine the extent of federal expenditures and financial assistance  made to individuals and entities within CBRS units, we identified and  collected information on financial assistance provided in selected CBRS  units from those federal agencies that, based on our previous report and  our discussions with FWS, were the most likely to have provided  assistance. These agencies include the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s  (DHS) Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), Federal Highway  Administration (FHWA), Small Business Administration (SBA), U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (the Corps), U.S. Department of Agriculture,  Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and the  Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). We also interviewed officials with  these agencies about the agencies\u2019 procedures for preventing prohibited  expenditures from being provided to individuals and entities in CBRS  units. To determine the extent to which federal agencies issued permits for  projects within selected CBRS units, we interviewed officials and analyzed  data provided by the Corps, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA),  and state agencies authorized to administer EPA programs. The  information we gathered on federal financial assistance and permits  cannot be generalized to the entire universe of CBRS units. We determined  that the agency data were sufficiently reliable for the purposes of our  review. A more detailed description of our scope and methodology is  presented in appendix I. We performed our work between February 2006  and February 2007 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Coastal barriers are unique land forms that function as buffers, protecting  the mainland against the destructive forces of hurricanes and other coastal  storms. Coastal barriers also provide habitat for migratory birds and other  wildlife; and they provide essential nesting and feeding areas for  commercially and recreationally important species of fish and other  aquatic organisms such as sea turtles. In the United States, coastal barriers  are predominantly distributed along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts but can  also be found in areas surrounding the Great Lakes, the Virgin Islands, and  Puerto Rico. From the Gulf of Maine to Padre Island, Texas, coastal  barriers form an almost unbroken chain along the coastline. Coastal  barriers are generally unsuitable for development because the movement  of unstable sediments undermines man-made structures. Despite this  threat, coastal areas that include coastal barriers are among the most  rapidly growing and developed areas in the nation, accounting for 53  percent of the total population in the United States according to a 2004  report by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA),  National Ocean Service.", "In 1982, Congress enacted the Coastal Barrier Resources Act to minimize  (1) the loss of human life; (2) wasteful expenditures of federal revenue;  and (3) damage to fish, wildlife, and other natural resources associated  with coastal barriers along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts by restricting  future federal expenditures and financial assistance, which have the effect  of encouraging development of coastal barriers. The act designated 186  units, comprising about 453,000 acres along 666 miles of shoreline from  Maine to Texas, which would later be known as the John H. Chafee  Coastal Barrier Resources System (CBRS).", "Subsequently, the CBRS was further expanded to include additional units  along coastal states from Maine to Texas, plus units in the Great Lakes, the  Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico. Currently, the CBRS includes 585 units,  which consist of undeveloped coastal barrier lands and aquatic habitat  that comprises nearly 1.3 million acres of land and associated aquatic  habitat. The CBRS was also expanded to include 272 OPAs that comprise  an additional 1.8 million acres of land and associated aquatic habitat. Most  of the land in these OPAs is publicly held for conservation or recreational  purposes, such as national wildlife refuges, national parks and seashores,  and state and county parks; but some OPAs may also include some private  property that may or may not be held for conservation.", "Under CBRA, no single federal agency has overall responsibility for  administering activities within the CBRS; instead, all federal agencies must  abide by the provisions of the act. CBRA does assign the Secretary of the  Interior responsibility for, among other things, maintaining maps of each  CBRS unit and recommending modifications to CBRS unit boundaries, as  needed. Within the Department of Interior, these responsibilities belong  to the FWS. Both agencies and property owners can request decisions  from FWS regarding whether specific properties are within CBRS  boundaries. Finally, agencies must consult with FWS to determine  whether a proposed project is within the CBRS, and if so, whether the  project is consistent with CBRA.", "The Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization Act of 2000 directed the  Secretary of the Interior to complete a Digital Mapping Pilot Project for at  least 50 but not more than 75 units in the CBRS and submit a report to the  Congress that describes the results of the pilot project and the feasibility,  data needs, and costs of completing digital maps for the entire CBRS.  Currently, FWS is conducting a pilot project to create updated digital  CBRS maps that would provide federal agencies and others with an  enhanced tool for determining accurate boundary locations. Later, the  Coastal Barrier Resources Reauthorization Act of 2005 directed the  Secretary of the Interior to create digital maps by 2013 for all CBRS units  not included in the pilot project. However, according to agency officials,  the ability to conduct this project and the actual completion date will  depend upon the specific funding that the agency receives for this project.", "CBRA does not prohibit development in CBRS units by owners who are  willing to develop their properties without the benefit of federal financial  assistance. Instead, with certain exceptions, CBRA prohibits federal  expenditures or financial assistance within CBRS units that might  encourage development. The prohibitions include, but are not limited to  the following:  the construction or purchase of any structure, facility, or related  infrastructure;  the construction or purchase of any road, airport, boat landing facility, or  other facility on, or bridge or causeway to, any CBRS unit;   any project to prevent the erosion of, or to otherwise stabilize, any inlet,  shoreline, or inshore area for the purpose of encouraging development;  and the issuance of flood insurance coverage under the National Flood  Insurance Act of 1968 for any new construction or substantially improved  property.", "CBRA allows certain federal assistance within the CBRS for limited  activities after consultation with FWS. However, the act does not require  the agencies to obtain FWS\u2019 approval before acting. Such assistance  includes, but is not limited to the following:  the exploration, extraction, or transportation of energy resources that can  be carried out only on, in, or adjacent to a coastal water area; the maintenance or construction of improvements of existing Federal  navigation channels and related structures; the maintenance, replacement, reconstruction, or repair, but not the  expansion, of publicly owned or operated roads, structures, or facilities  that are essential links in a larger network or system;   military activities essential to national security; and    assistance for emergency operations essential to saving of lives and  protecting property.", "CBRA has no provisions prohibiting the administration of federal  regulatory activities, such as issuing certain permits, within the CBRS.  Three federal agencies\u2014the Corps, EPA, and the U.S. Coast Guard\u2014issue  permits that regulate, among other things, the discharge of dredged or fill  material into federally regulated waters, including wetlands; the discharge  of wastes into navigable waters; and the construction of bridges over  navigable waters. Because much of the CBRS is comprised of wetlands  and aquatic habitat, activities undertaken in these areas can require a  permit from one or more of these agencies. Federal legislation other than  CBRA provides the authority for issuing these permits. Among these are  the Clean Water Act, the Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899,  and the Bridge Act of 1906, as amended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CBRS Remains Largely Undeveloped", "paragraphs": ["Despite the concentration of significant levels of development in a few  units, most of the CBRS remains undeveloped.

For the units in our sample, the  undeveloped units were generally smaller in total acreage and had less  developable acreage than the developed units.", "Although CBRA does not appear to have been a primary factor in  discouraging development in the units we reviewed, officials indicated  that in those areas where CBRA prohibitions are complemented by local  and state government objectives for development, it is unlikely that there  will be significant increases in development. Local officials cited several  factors as being primarily responsible for inhibiting development.", "The Lack of Suitably Developable Land. This was a primary factor for the  lack of development in a number of CBRS units that we reviewed. For  example, the Boat Meadow unit in Massachusetts is comprised almost  entirely of salt marshes with small sand bars scattered throughout shallow  water, making the land unsuitable for development. Similarly, in the  Wrightsville Beach unit in North Carolina, the sand continuously shifts,  making the land too unstable for development. Figure 1 is an example of  the type of terrain generally found in the Boat Meadow CBRS unit in  Massachusetts.", "Lack of Accessibility to the Unit. A number of federal and local officials  noted that some CBRS units are not easily accessible or are located in  remote locations that are not desirable to developers. For example, a  number of units, such as the Bay Joe Wise Complex in Louisiana, are only  accessible by boat. Other units, such as the Boca Chica unit in Texas, are  in such remote locations that an official said developers are not willing to  build there. In addition, several remote and inaccessible locations do not  currently have the infrastructure needed to develop the unit. For example,  an official said the lack of existing infrastructure and the high cost of  constructing development-quality water and sewage infrastructure have  discouraged development on the North Padre Island unit in Texas.", "State Laws Discouraging Development. State laws were cited by a  number of officials as reasons why development had not occurred in some  CBRS units. Some states have adopted specific restrictions to prevent  development in coastal or wetland areas, which are often found in CBRS  units. For example, a number of units in Massachusetts\u2014such as Black  Beach and Squaw Island\u2014have not experienced development due in part  to wetland and coastal protection laws enacted by the state. In addition,  both Maine and Massachusetts do not allow state funds or grants to be  used for projects to encourage development in barrier beaches. In Rhode  Island, any coastal development project must receive a permit from the  Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council, and an official  explained that it was highly unlikely that permits would be issued for new  development in coastal regions of the state.", "Preservation Efforts by Conservation Groups. A number of CBRS units  include land owned by entities seeking to preserve the area in its natural  state. In some cases, CBRS units have lands that are owned by federal,  state, or local governments, such as local parks or national forests. For  example, the Whitefish Point unit in Michigan is part of the Hiawatha  National Forest. In other cases, land in CBRS units is owned by  conservation groups seeking to prevent development. For example, a  significant portion of the Southgate Ponds unit in the U.S. Virgin Islands is  owned by the St. Croix Environmental Association; the Fox Islands unit in  Virginia is owned by the Chesapeake Bay Foundation; and the Pine Island  Bay unit in North Carolina is mostly owned by the National Audubon  Society. Although these owners have sought to prevent development  within the unit, as the land becomes more valuable, owners may  experience pressure to sell it for development purposes. Private home  owners have also taken actions to prevent continued development in one  CBRS unit we reviewed. Some portions of the Prudence Island Complex  unit in Rhode Island are located in private home owners\u2019 backyards. Home  owners have voluntarily placed their land into a conservation easement to  formally protect it from future development."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Small Percentage of Units Have Experienced Some Level of Development, but Significant Development Has Been Concentrated in a Few Units", "paragraphs": ["Although the majority of CBRS units remain undeveloped, 16 percent have  experienced some level of development. While the range of development  varies between one additional structure for some units to over 400 new  structures for another unit, the amount of development in most of the  units has been small. Thirteen percent of the units have added less than 20  structures. Where there has been significant development, it has been  concentrated in a relatively small number of units. We estimate that only 3  percent of CBRS units have experienced the addition of 100 or more new  structures since their inclusion in the CBRS.", "The majority of the CBRS units within our sample that have experienced  development are located in the southern United States. Two units  experiencing the most extensive development were the Topsail, North  Carolina unit and the Cape San Blas, Florida unit. Several other units in  the south, such as the Four Mile Village unit in Florida and Bird Key  Complex in South Carolina, have plans for continued development. None  of the units in our sample located in the northern United States had  experienced such extensive development. One factor contributing to  increased development in the south is the greater amount of developable  acres; 80 percent of the developable land in the CBRS is located in  southern units\u2014those located south of New Jersey.", "Local officials cited several factors as being primarily responsible for the  development that has occurred.", "Commercial Interest and Public Desire to Build in the Unit. Officials  told us that development had occurred in several areas because the  public\u2019s desire to develop in the unit was stronger than the disincentive of  CBRA. For example, the Currituck Banks unit in North Carolina has  experienced an increase of at least 400 new residential homes since its  inclusion in the CBRS. Although this unit only has beach access for four- wheel drive vehicles, approximately 75 percent of the land south of the  unit is currently built to capacity, and the increasing demand for  residential structures is sending developers into the adjoining CBRS unit.  Local officials stated that the lack of federal assistance did not appear to  have any affect on the rate of development in the area. Similarly, the Cape  San Blas unit in Florida has continued to experience increased  development with at least 900 new structures\u2014primarily single family  vacation homes\u2014being built since the unit\u2019s inclusion in the CBRS.  Officials in Cape San Blas believe that as other coastal locations around  Florida became too expensive to find affordably priced ocean front homes,  the area of Cape San Blas became a highly desirable location. Accounting  for the significant development that has occurred in the Topsail unit in  North Carolina, officials stated that the basic reason was simply supply  and demand: people want to live on the coast of North Carolina, and the  area that includes the CBRS unit had developable land available.", "Local Government Support for Development. Local officials explained that  local governments with a pro-development attitude aided in increasing  development in CBRS units. For example, local officials in Topsail, North  Carolina told us that most of the 1,600 structures located in the Topsail  CBRS unit were constructed after the unit\u2019s inclusion in the CBRS. These  officials indicated that the county government had begun development  plans for land within the unit prior to its inclusion in CBRS. These officials  noted that the county had targeted the area for development to promote  tourism and increase the local tax base, and that certain infrastructure was  built to support this increased development. As the result of these pro- development policies, a large portion of the unit has been developed with  residential homes\u2014many of which serve as vacation rentals during the  summer months. Similarly, in the Cape San Blas unit in Florida the local  government had development plans for the area prior to the adoption of  CBRA. Local officials there said that the area was already subdivided into  lots for development and that some existing infrastructure, such as roads,  water systems, and telephone systems, was already built when the unit  was added to the CBRS.", "Availability of Affordable Private Flood Insurance. Officials familiar with  several CBRS units told us that initially restrictions on the availability of  federal flood insurance had little impact on the development that occurred  in some CBRS units. Lenders did not require flood insurance in order for  home owners to obtain mortgage loans at the time most of the  development occurred. According to these officials, home owners within  CBRS units that chose to get flood insurance could readily get private  flood insurance at rates comparable with federal flood insurance.  However, in the past few years FEMA has updated its flood-zone maps and  has designated some CBRS areas as special flood hazard areas. This  change in designation has made areas that once did not require owners to  obtain flood insurance in order to receive financing into areas where  owners are now required to have flood insurance prior to obtaining  mortgage loans. At the same time, officials said that in several CBRS units  the cost of private insurance has skyrocketed and is no longer comparable  to national flood insurance program rates. According to a local banker in  Cape San Blas, a $250,000 home outside the CBRS unit can obtain flood  insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program for $470 per  year, but private flood insurance for homes located in the CBRS unit that  are not eligible for national flood insurance could cost between $5,070 and  $12,500 a year, depending on the insurance company.", "The new requirements mandating flood insurance for mortgages in some  units and the increased costs of private flood insurance may begin to  impact development in the CBRS in the future, according to local officials.  For example, officials in Currituck County noted that the flood zone  determination change had significantly reduced the number of building  permits issued for new development in the CBRS unit since 2005 and  suggested that the unit will now experience less future development.  Likewise, the Cape San Blas unit in Florida has also been affected by the  flood zone determination change. A local official stated that since FEMA  adopted a special flood hazard area for the CBRS unit in 2002, property  values in the unit have decreased by 30 percent. Because the cost of  private flood insurance has risen dramatically in the last couple of years, a  number of residents and officials representing areas within the CBRS,  including Cape San Blas and Topsail, have unsuccessfully attempted to  remove the areas from the CBRS, primarily so that residents would be  eligible to obtain flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance  Program.", "Our review of CBRS units did not include OPAs because FWS officials  informed us that these areas were classified separately from system units  and that the land was already protected from development by other  mechanisms\u2014such as its designation as a state or federal park. OPAs are  not under the same limitations as CBRS units; the only restriction placed  on federal spending within these areas is the prohibition on federal flood  insurance. However, we found instances where land within OPAs was sold  to private developers and development had increased in the area. For  example, in the St. Andrews Complex unit in Florida, the Bahia de  Tallaboa unit in Puerto Rico, and the Mustang Island unit in Texas,  development has continued despite the units\u2019 designation as an OPA."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Extent to Which Federal Agencies Have Provided Financial Assistance and Permits to Entities in CBRS Units Varies", "paragraphs": ["We found that federal agencies have provided some financial assistance  prohibited by CBRA, some assistance allowed by CBRA, and hundreds of  permits for federally regulated construction projects to entities within the  CBRS units included in our review. Four agencies provided financial  assistance expressly prohibited by CBRA to property owners in CBRS  units. Three federal agencies also provided financial assistance to entities  in CBRS units that is allowed under CBRA, but they do not track the  amount of assistance they provided. As a result, we were unable to  determine the total extent of such assistance. Finally, the Corps and EPA- authorized state agencies have issued hundreds of permits for a variety of  federally regulated construction projects within CBRS units."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Four Federal Agencies Have Provided Some Financial Assistance That Is Prohibited by CBRA", "paragraphs": ["Four federal agencies\u2014FEMA, HUD, SBA, and VA\u2014provided some  financial assistance that is expressly prohibited by CBRA to property  owners in CBRS units. Our review of approximately 4,500 addresses  uncovered 73 active FEMA flood insurance policies, 37 inappropriate  FEMA disaster assistance payments, 5 HUD home loan guarantees, 3 SBA  disaster loans, and 11 VA home loan guarantees that should not have been  made to property owners in CBRS units. Although three of the four  agencies have procedures to prevent and detect assistance to property  owners in CBRS units, agency officials cited several reasons why this  erroneous assistance was provided in violation of CBRA, including the  lack of updated CBRS maps, which makes determining the precise  locations of properties and CBRS unit boundaries difficult."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "FEMA National Flood Insurance Program", "paragraphs": ["FEMA provides federally backed flood insurance for home owners,  renters, and business owners in participating communities that are not in  the CBRS. Structures that are built or substantially improved following  their inclusion within the CBRS are not eligible for federal flood insurance.  However, our review of policies active as of May 2006 identified 73  National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) policies for properties in CBRS  units. The flood insurance policies ranged from $26,500 to $350,000 and  totaled approximately $20 million. Although these policies violated the  CBRA, FEMA officials said it is unlikely that the agency would actually pay  a claim on these policies, because before paying a claim, FEMA adjusters  would first conduct a physical inspection of the property and determine  whether it was in a CBRS unit. If a property was found to be within the  CBRS, FEMA would deny the claim and refund the policy owner\u2019s  insurance premium.", "To prevent flood insurance policies from being issued for properties in  CBRS units, FEMA\u2019s Flood Insurance Manual requires that private  insurance companies participating in the NFIP determine if a property is  eligible for flood insurance. Prior to issuing a policy, the agent is required  to review FEMA\u2019s flood insurance maps to determine if the property is  located within the CBRS and collect information to determine if the  structure was built prior to the unit\u2019s inclusion in the CBRS. However,  according to FEMA, insurance agents have made mistakes and issued  policies in violation of CBRA for two reasons:  It may be difficult to locate a property and determine whether it is in a  CBRS unit, especially when a property is near or adjacent to a CBRS  boundary. For example, at one location we visited, we identified homes  adjacent to each other where one property was in the CBRS and the other  was not. In other CBRS units, some homes had backyards that fell within  the CBRS. Furthermore, new streets may not be depicted on existing  maps. According to FEMA officials, the insurance agent must often make a  judgment call when determining whether a property is within the CBRS.", "The agent may not be familiar with CBRA prohibitions and may not follow  procedures. According to FEMA officials and officials from a private  insurance agency with whom we spoke, some home owners obtain flood  insurance from insurance agents located inland, away from coastal areas,  who might not have been aware of the CBRA restrictions.", "According to FEMA officials, the agency takes a number of steps to  identify properties that may have inappropriately received federal flood  insurance. Since 1998, FEMA has sought to assist private companies with  identifying flood insurance policies that potentially were ineligible for  flood insurance coverage because the property was within the CBRS. To  accomplish this task, FEMA uses computer mapping technology to plot  addresses and determine whether they are potentially in a CBRS unit.  However, the computer software FEMA relies on cannot always correctly  locate all addresses on the map. For example, this can occur if a street or  address range is not included in the software, which can happen when a  street or a range of addresses is new. Twenty of the 73 flood insurance  policies that we determined were issued for a property that was in a CBRS  unit could not be located on a map by FEMA\u2019s computer software. In  addition, computer mapping technology has inherent inaccuracies and  may plot properties in the wrong location. For example, using our  mapping software, we determined another 20 of the 73 flood insurance  policies were for a property in the CBRS but were not identified as being  in a CBRS unit by FEMA\u2019s mapping software. FEMA officials said they  recognize that their software may not always identify new addresses and  streets in CBRS units, and so the agency obtains quarterly updates of new  streets and addresses and rechecks insured properties against the updated  information to identify any that might be located in CBRS units.", "When FEMA\u2019s computer plotting reveals that a property for which a  federal flood insurance policy has been issued may be in a CBRS unit,  FEMA reports the error to the insurance company. Once an insurance  company receives notification in the form of an error message that they  may have written an ineligible policy, the company may take one of four  actions:  1.  The company can agree that the property is located in a CBRS unit and  cancel the policy back to the inception date of coverage.  2.  The company may agree that the property is located in a CBRS unit but  prove that the building was constructed prior to the CBRS designation.  In these cases, the policy is deemed valid and may remain in effect.  3.  The company can disagree that the property is located in a CBRS unit  and assume responsibility for the risk. In these cases, the policy would  remain active, FEMA would continue to collect the premiums, but the  insurance company would be responsible for paying any claims filed.  Insurance companies have assumed liability for the risks associated  with 29 of the 73 flood insurance policies that we identified had been  issued for properties located in CBRS units.  4.  The company can request that FWS make an official determination  regarding whether the property is in the CBRS. If FWS determines that  the property is in a CBRS unit, the policy is then cancelled back to the  inception date of coverage. However, FEMA officials expressed  concern about the length of time FWS takes to make a property  determination. Typically, it takes FWS a year to respond to inquiries  for a property determination. As of January 17, 2007, FEMA was  waiting for determinations on 544 addresses from FWS.", "According to FWS officials, the process for making property  determinations is labor intensive because they are using CBRS maps that  were created more than 15 years ago and are not available in digital  format. FWS officials told us that modernized digital maps of the CBRS  would improve the accuracy and efficiency of the property determination  process, allowing its customers and partners, in many cases, to determine  within minutes whether a property is located within the CBRS. In 2000, the  Congress directed the Secretary of the Interior to create draft digital maps  for at least 50 and not more than 75 units, or nearly 10 percent of the  CBRS. FWS has created draft digital maps of 60 CBRS units that it must  submit to the Congress for its consideration. In May 2006, the Congress  also instructed the Secretary of the Interior to create maps for the rest of  the CBRS by May 2013. According to FWS, digital maps would replace the  paper maps currently being used that are (1) outdated technologically and  (2) sometimes inaccurate and may not align precisely with the natural or  man-made features that the Congress intended the boundaries to follow.  FWS officials believe that modernizing the CBRS maps will address the  inaccuracies of the existing maps.", "To implement the map modernization project, FWS officials said that they  investigated several options for procuring data to produce the required  draft digital maps, including federal, state, local, and private sources. In  many cases, FWS was able to obtain data internally or from other federal  agencies at little or no cost, including wetlands data and national wildlife  refuge boundaries from within FWS, aerial imagery from the U.S.  Geological Survey, hydric soils data from the Department of Agriculture\u2019s  Natural Resources Conservation Service, and digital boundaries for many  federally protected areas from NOAA.", "FEMA is also conducting a map modernization effort that includes  preparing digital flood insurance maps. In 2006, FWS entered into an  interagency agreement with FEMA whereby FWS will place current CBRS  boundaries onto FEMA\u2019s digital flood maps. FEMA provided FWS with  $40,000 for an initial set of maps for some units. While the FEMA maps are  not the \u201cofficial\u201d CBRS maps adopted by the Congress, FWS officials said  that these digital maps will allow property owners, insurance agents, and  others to have a much more accurate and precise tool for determining  whether a property or project site is located near a CBRS area and would  require an official determination from FWS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FEMA Individuals and Households Program", "paragraphs": ["FEMA\u2019s Individuals and Households Program (IHP) provides housing  assistance and other assistance, such as medical or funeral assistance, for  needs arising from a declared emergency or major disaster.

HUD officials further indicated that while they could  implement better controls for restrictions on providing single family  mortgage insurance in the CBRS, it would be unnecessary in practical  terms. HUD officials provided three primary reasons why it was unlikely  that a HUD-insured loan would be provided for a property in a coastal  area. First, HUD regulations require that flood insurance be obtained  under the NFIP before HUD will insure single family mortgages for  properties in FEMA-identified special flood hazard areas. HUD officials  stated that because properties located in the CBRS would likely be in  special flood hazard areas and the NFIP flood insurance is prohibited in  the CBRS, HUD would not be able to insure single family mortgages for  these properties. However, HUD\u2019s explanation does not account for the  fact that portions of CBRS units may not be in a special flood hazard area  and that FEMA prohibitions are not universal as the NFIP flood insurance  may be available to homes built before the area\u2019s inclusion in the CBRS.  Second, most HUD insurance for single family mortgages is for first-time  home owners who typically are not buying homes in the higher priced  ranges found in the CBRS. Third, property values in the CBRS are such  that mortgage amounts would likely exceed the program limits for typical  HUD-insured single family mortgages, as the mortgage limit for a one  family property ranges from approximately $170,000 to $310,000,  depending on the location.
