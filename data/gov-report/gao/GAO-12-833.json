It requires programs to develop documents demonstrating critical knowledge that would help leaders make better informed investment decisions when managing individual programs. However, DHS has not consistently met these requirements. The department has only verified that four programs documented all of the critical knowledge the policy requires to proceed with acquisition activities. Officials explained that DHS\u0092s culture has emphasized the need to rapidly execute missions more than sound acquisition management practices. Most major programs lack reliable cost estimates, realistic schedules, and agreed-upon baseline objectives, limiting DHS leadership\u0092s ability to effectively manage those programs and provide information to Congress. DHS recognizes the need to implement its acquisition policy more consistently, but significant work remains.", "DHS acquisition policy does not fully reflect several key portfolio management practices, such as allocating resources strategically, and DHS has not yet re-established an oversight board to manage its investment portfolio across the department. As a result, DHS has largely made investment decisions on a program-by-program and component-by-component basis. The widespread risk of poorly understood cost growth, coupled with the fiscal challenges facing the federal government, makes it essential that DHS allocate resources to its major programs in a deliberate manner. DHS plans to develop stronger portfolio-management policies and processes, but until it does so, DHS programs are more likely to experience additional funding instability, which will increase the risk of further cost growth and schedule slips. These outcomes, combined with a tighter budget, could prevent DHS from developing needed capabilities.", "DHS has introduced seven initiatives that could improve acquisition management by addressing longstanding challenges GAO and DHS survey respondents have identified, such as funding instability and acquisition workforce shortfalls. Implementation plans are still being developed, and DHS is still working to address critical issues. Because of this, it is too early to determine whether the DHS initiatives will be effective, as GAO has previously established that agencies must sustain progress over time to address management challenges.

Analyze/Select phase: the Acquisition Decision Authority designates a  qualified official to manage the program, and this program manager  subsequently reviews alternative approaches to meeting the need,  and recommends a best option to the Acquisition Decision Authority;  3.  Obtain phase: The program manager develops, tests, and evaluates  the selected option; during this phase, programs may proceed through  ADE 2B, which focuses on the cost, schedule, and performance  parameters for each of the program\u2019s projects; and ADE 2C, which  focuses on low rate initial production issues; and  4.  Produce/Deploy/Support phase: DHS delivers the new capability to its  operators, and maintains the capability until it is retired; this phase  includes sustainment, which begins when a capability has been  fielded for operational use; sustainment involves the supportability of  fielded systems through disposal, including maintenance and the  identification of cost reduction opportunities; this phase tends to  account for up to 70 percent of life-cycle costs.", "Figure 1 depicts the acquisition life cycle.", "An important aspect of the Acquisition Decision Events is the review and  approval of key acquisition documents critical to establishing the need for  a major program, its operational requirements, an acquisition baseline,  and testing and support plans.

Specifically, when DHS submitted the FYHSP to  Congress in 2011, it reported that 34 of the 43 programs lacking  department-approved APBs were expected to cost $108.8 billion over  their acquisition life cycles. DHS did not provide cost estimates for the  other 9 programs because the data were unreliable.", "In addition to overall cost, schedule, and performance goals, the APB  also contains intermediate metrics to measure a program\u2019s progress in  achieving those goals. These intermediate metrics allow managers to  take corrective actions earlier in the acquisition life cycle. DHS\u2019s lack of  APBs, PARM officials explained, makes it more difficult to manage  program performance. In March 2012, PARM reported that 32 programs  had experienced significant cost growth or schedule slips in its internal  Quarterly Program Accountability Report. However, DHS has only  formally established that 8 of its programs have fallen short of their cost,  schedule, or performance goals, because approximately three-quarters of  the programs PARM identified lack the current, department-approved  APBs needed to authoritatively measure performance.", "To accurately assess a program\u2019s performance, managers need accurate  cost and schedule information.

DHS has taken  some steps to improve investment management, but most of its major  acquisition programs continue to cost more than expected, take longer to  deploy than planned, or deliver less capability than promised. These  outcomes are largely the result of DHS\u2019s lack of adherence to key  knowledge-based program management practices, even though many  are reflected in the department\u2019s own acquisition policy. DHS leadership  has authorized and continued to invest in major acquisition programs  even though the vast majority of those programs lack foundational  documents demonstrating the knowledge needed to help manage risks  and measure performance. This limits DHS\u2019s ability to proactively identify  and address the challenges facing individual programs. Further, although  the department\u2019s acquisition policy contains many key practices that help  reduce risks and increase the chances for successful outcomes, the  policy does not include certain program management practices that could  further enhance acquisition management. For example, the policy does  not require that programs demonstrate technologies in a realistic  environment prior to initiating development activities, or that exit criteria  be quantifiable to the extent possible.", "Cost growth and schedule slips at the individual program level complicate  DHS\u2019s efforts to manage its investment portfolio as a whole.

For example, the policy  does not empower portfolio managers to invest resources in a disciplined  manner or establish that investments should be ranked and selected  using a disciplined process. DHS acknowledges the importance of having  strong portfolio-management practices. However, DHS does not have a  process to systematically prioritize its major investments to ensure that  the department\u2019s acquisition portfolio is consistent with DHS\u2019s anticipated  resource constraints, which is particularly important because of the  diversity of the department\u2019s missions.

To answer these questions, we  reviewed 77 of the 82 programs DHS included in its fiscal year 2011  Major Acquisition Oversight List (MAOL), which identified each program  the department designated a major acquisition in 2011. We excluded 5  programs that were canceled in 2011; these are identified in appendix IV.

Respondents were sent an e-mail invitation to complete  the survey on a GAO web server using a unique username and  password. During the data collection period, nonrespondents received a  reminder e-mail and phone call. Because this was not a sample survey, it  has no sampling errors. The practical difficulties of conducting any survey  may also introduce nonsampling errors, such as difficulties interpreting a  particular question, which can introduce unwanted variability into the  survey results. We took steps to minimize nonsampling errors by  pretesting the questionnaire in person with program management officials  for five different programs, each in a different component. We conducted  pretests to make sure that the questions were clear and unbiased, the  data and information were readily obtainable, and that the questionnaire  did not place an undue burden on respondents. Additionally, a senior  methodologist within GAO independently reviewed a draft of the  questionnaire prior to its administration.

If the DHS policy reflected a particular key practice, we  assigned the policy a score of 5 for that practice. If the policy did not  reflect the key practice, we assigned it a score of 1. We then took the  average score for all the key practices in a particular area\u2014as identified  in appendix II\u2014to establish an overall score for each key practice area.  We concluded that key practice areas that scored a 5 were reflected in  the policy, scored a 4 were substantially reflected, scored a 3 were  partially reflected, and scored a 2 were minimally reflected. We  subsequently met with PARM officials to discuss our analysis, identify  relevant sections of the policy that we had not yet accounted for, and  solicit their thoughts on those key practices that were not reflected in the  policy. In order to assess DHS\u2019s processes for implementing its policy, we  surveyed program managers, and interviewed component and  department-level officials. We also reviewed DHS\u2019s plans for the  Integrated Investment Life Cycle Model (IILCM), which is being designed  to better integrate the department\u2019s investment management functions.  Further, we reviewed all acquisition decision memoranda documenting  DHS executive review board decisions from November 2008 to April  2012, the March 2012 QPAR, and other management memos identifying  available program-performance data, and any limitations of that data.", "To determine the extent to which DHS has taken actions to resolve the  high-risk acquisition management issues we have identified in previous  reports and this audit, we reviewed the first three versions of the DHS  Integrated Strategy for High Risk Management\u2014issued in January, June,  and December 2011. We also reviewed the DHS Program Management  and Execution Playbook, issued in December 2011. We identified  initiatives intended to improve acquisition management, the department\u2019s  progress in implementing those initiatives, and enduring challenges  confronting the department. We also surveyed program managers, and  interviewed component and department-level officials to obtain their  perspectives on the initiatives.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2011 to September  2012 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.
