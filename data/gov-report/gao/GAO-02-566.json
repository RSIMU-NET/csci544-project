Although current tests have been adequate for evaluating the few genetically modified foods that have, so far, undergone relatively simple compositional changes, new technologies are being developed to evaluate the increasingly complex compositional changes expected. Monitoring the long-term health risks of genetically modified foods is generally neither necessary nor feasible. No scientific evidence exists, nor is there even a hypothesis, suggesting that long-term harm, such as higher cancer rates, results from these foods. Moreover, technical challenges make long-term monitoring infeasible."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Proponents and opponents of modern agricultural biotechnology hold passionate views about the benefits and risks of using this technology to produce genetically modified (GM) food.

Opponents of biotechnology argue that not enough is known about the safety of these foods and that they should be more rigorously controlled.", "While confidence in the safety of GM foods is essential to their commercial success, governments and consumers from different parts of the world have taken very different positions on their safety and regulation. Some consumers in Western Europe have shown their opposition to this technology by destroying GM food crops, and European regulatory entities have not approved any new GM foods in the past several years. In the United States, consumers and regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generally support GM foods, with a number of these foods having been made available for sale in recent years. However, the debate on the safety of these foods is ongoing and may intensify in the future as genetic modifications to foods become increasingly complex.", "To ensure public confidence in GM foods, the U.S. biotechnology industry recognized in the early 1990s the need for oversight by FDA, which has primary responsibility for the safety of most of the nation\u2019s food supply. In response, FDA published guidelines in 1992 to ensure that companies developing GM foods worked with the agency in assessing the safety of these foods. As part of the process, companies test new GM foods to assess their safety, including their potential health risks, and submit test data to FDA for evaluation. As of April 2002, FDA has evaluated 50 GM foods, many of which have subsequently been placed on the market. Currently, submission of information to FDA is voluntary, but FDA published a proposed rule in January 2001 that would make this submission mandatory.", "In light of the continued debate about GM foods, you asked us to (1) identify the types of potential human health risks associated with GM foods and experts\u2019 views regarding the adequacy of tests used to evaluate these risks, (2) describe FDA\u2019s controls for ensuring that companies submit test data it requests and identify experts\u2019 views of the agency\u2019s overall evaluations of these foods, (3) describe potential changes in future GM foods and any associated changes in tests to evaluate them, and (4) identify experts\u2019 views on the necessity and feasibility of monitoring the long-term health risks of these foods.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed scientific and technical studies and other literature and spoke with experts in government, academia, private industry, and consumer groups. We selected these experts in consultation with officials from the National Academy of Sciences. As agreed with your offices, we did not assess the potential environmental risks associated with GM food production. In addition, since there have been no GM animals evaluated for commercialization, we did not assess their potential environmental or human health risks. Also, we did not independently evaluate FDA\u2019s controls for ensuring it receives safety data. Further details of the scope and methodology of our review are discussed in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["Modern agricultural biotechnology refers to various scientific techniques, most notably genetic engineering, used to modify plants, animals, or microorganisms by introducing into their genetic makeup genes for specific desired traits, including genes from unrelated species. For centuries people have crossbred related plants or animal species to develop useful new varieties or hybrids with desirable traits, such as better taste or increased productivity. Traditional crossbreeding, however, can be very time-consuming because it may require breeding several generations to obtain a desired trait and breed out numerous unwanted characteristics. Genetic engineering techniques allow for faster development of new crop or livestock varieties, since the genes for a given trait can be readily introduced into a plant or animal species to produce a new variety incorporating that specific trait. Additionally, genetic engineering increases the range of traits available for developing new varieties by allowing genes from totally unrelated species to be incorporated into a particular plant or animal variety.", "In the 1970s, scientists learned how to extract a specific gene from a DNA strand and insert this gene into a different organism where it would continue to make the same protein that it did in its original organism. Scientists have applied this technology to bacteria, plants, and animals. For example, as shown in figure 1, scientists produced pest-resistant plants by identifying a gene responsible for pest resistance in an organism, isolating and copying the gene, and then inserting it into the target plant\u2019s DNA. The plant was then tested to determine that the transferred trait (transgene) was inherited in subsequent generations and that the \u201ctransgenic\u201d plant grew and functioned as well as the conventional variety.", "Biotechnology offers a variety of potential benefits and risks. It has enhanced food production by making plants less vulnerable to drought, frost, insects, and viruses and by enabling plants to compete more effectively against weeds for soil nutrients. In a few cases, it has also improved the quality and nutrition of foods by altering their composition. Table 1 summarizes the GM foods evaluated by FDA.", "Table 1 shows that the majority of modifications have been aimed at increasing crop yields for farmers by engineering a food plant to tolerate herbicides or attacks from pests such as insects and viruses (48 out of 62 modifications). Further, only two food plants have been altered to produce modified oil: the soybean and canola plants. According to industry officials, the modified soybean produces healthier oil. They also stated that the canola plant was modified to have a domestic source for laurate cooking oil. Because soybean oil is the most commonly consumed plant oil worldwide, scientists say that the new oil could significantly improve the health of millions of people.", "For three key crops grown in the United States\u2014corn, soybeans, and cotton\u2014a large number of farmers have chosen to plant GM varieties. In 2001, GM varieties accounted for about 26 percent of the corn, 68 percent of the soybeans, and 69 percent of the cotton planted in the United States. These crops are the source of various ingredients used extensively in many processed foods, such as corn syrup, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil, and they are also major U.S. commodity exports. The United States accounts for about three-quarters of GM food crops planted globally.", "However, the use of biotechnology has also raised concerns about its potential risks to the environment and people. For example, some people fear that common plant pests could develop resistance to the introduced pesticides in GM crops that were supposed to combat them. Further, some fear that crops modified to be tolerant to herbicides could foster the evolution of \u201csuper weeds.\u201d Finally, some fear that scientists might unknowingly create or enhance a food allergen or toxin. Therefore, as biotechnology was being developed, U.S. scientists, regulators, and policymakers generally agreed that GM plants should be evaluated carefully before being put into widespread use. As a result, the United States published a Coordinated Framework for Regulation of Biotechnology in 1986. This framework outlined the regulatory approach for reviewing GM plants, including relevant laws, regulations, and definitions of GM organisms.", "Responsibility for implementing the coordinated framework fell primarily to three agencies: USDA, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and FDA. Within USDA, the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) bears the main responsibility for assessing the environmental safety of GM crops. The primary focus of APHIS\u2019 review is to determine whether or not a plant produced through biotechnology has the potential to harm natural habitats or agriculture. Developers can petition APHIS to exempt a GM plant from regulation once sufficient and appropriate data have been collected regarding the potential environmental impact of a GM plant.", "To safeguard the environment and human health, EPA is responsible for regulating genetic modifications in plants that protect them from insects, bacteria, and viruses. These protectants are subject to the agency\u2019s regulations on the sale, distribution, and use of pesticides. EPA must review and grant a permit for field-testing plants with such protectants on more than 10 acres of land. Prior to commercialization of a GM plant with such a protectant, EPA reviews the application for approval of the protectant, solicits public comments, and may seek the counsel of external scientific experts.", "FDA has primary authority for the safety of most of the food supply. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act establishes the standard for food safety as food being in an unadulterated condition. FDA established its basic policy regarding the review of GM foods in its 1992 Policy on Foods Derived from New Plant Varieties. According to this policy, FDA relies on companies developing GM foods to voluntarily notify the agency before marketing the foods. Notification leads to a two-part consultation process between the agency and the company that initially involves discussions of relevant safety issues and subsequently the company\u2019s submission of a safety assessment report containing test data on the food in question. At the end of the consultation, FDA evaluates the data and may send a letter to the company stating that the agency has no further questions, indicating in effect that it sees no reason to prevent the company from marketing the GM food. In 1997, FDA supplemented its 1992 Policy with the current Guidance on Consultation Procedures, clarifying procedures for the initial and final consultations.", "In January 2001, FDA issued a proposed rule in the Federal Register that provides further information on these procedures and, more importantly, would require pre-market notification by companies. Among the reasons that FDA cited for this change are concerns expressed by consumers and public interest groups about the limited transparency and voluntary nature of the current process. FDA also pointed to the growing power of biotechnology to create potentially more complex safety issues that could require more stringent regulatory evaluations. FDA, tentatively, expects to finalize this rule as early as fiscal year 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GM Foods Share the Same Types of Health Risks as Conventional Foods and Are Evaluated by Tests That Appear Adequate", "paragraphs": ["All foods, including those from GM plants, pose the same types of inherent risks to human health: they can cause allergic or toxic reactions, or they can block the absorption of nutrients. Although some foods from GM plants have contained allergens, toxins, and antinutrients, scientists agree that the levels of these compounds have been comparable to those found in the foods\u2019 conventional counterparts. To reach such a finding, each GM food is evaluated using a regimen of tests. This regimen begins with tests on the source of the gene being transferred, proceeds to tests examining the similarity of the GM food to conventional varieties with known allergens, toxins, and antinutrients, and may include tests on the safety of the modified protein from the GM food in simulated digestive fluids. At every phase, test results are compared to the risk levels found in the food\u2019s conventional counterpart.

These risks are not unique to GM foods. People have consumed foods containing allergens, toxins, and antinutrients throughout human history. The small percentage of the population with food allergies (1-2 percent of adults and 6-8 percent of children) tries to prevent allergic reactions by avoiding offending foods. Additionally, people commonly consume toxic substances in foods, but they usually do so at levels that are considered safe. People also frequently consume foods containing antinutrients, such as certain proteins that inhibit the digestion of nutrients in the intestinal tract, but common food preparation techniques, such as cooking, break down the antinutrients. Moreover, consumption of a varied diet, in which a person is exposed to multiple nutrient sources, mitigates the risk of malnutrition from antinutrients, according to FDA officials and various academicians.", "Because conventional foods contain allergens, toxins, and antinutrients, scientists recognize that food cannot be guaranteed to pose zero risk. The primary concern with the genetic modification of food with respect to human health, state industry officials, is the potential for unintentional introduction of a new allergen, an enhanced toxin, or an enhanced antinutrient in an otherwise safe food. For this reason, developers evaluate GM foods to determine if they are as safe as their conventional counterparts."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Allergic Reactions", "paragraphs": ["An allergic reaction is an abnormal response of the body\u2019s immune system to an otherwise safe food.

For example, in 1996 FDA reviewed the safety assessment for a GM soybean plant that can produce healthier soybean oil. As part of a standard safety assessment, the GM soybean was evaluated to see if it was as safe as a conventional soybean. Although soybeans are a common food allergen and the GM soybean remained allergenic, the results showed no significant difference between its allergenicity and that of conventional soybeans.

If a GM food has toxic components outside the natural range of its conventional counterpart, the GM food is not acceptable.", "To date, GM foods have proven to be no different from their conventional counterparts with respect to toxicity. In fact, in some cases there is more confidence in the safety of GM foods because naturally occurring toxins that are disregarded in conventional foods are measured in the pre-market safety assessments of GM foods. For example, a naturally occurring toxin in tomatoes, known as tomatine, was largely ignored until a company in the early 1990s developed a GM tomato.

The genetic modification altered the fatty acid composition of canola oil. To minimize the possibility that an unintended antinutrient effect had rendered the oil unsafe, the company compared the antinutrient composition of its product to that of conventional canola.

If the GM protein has an amino acid sequence similar to that of known allergens, the company initiates further, more specific allergenicity testing. The company would undertake in vitro digestibility tests to see if the GM protein was broken down in simulated digestive fluids. If there were any concerns about the speed with which the GM protein was broken down, the company would use serum-screening tests to support or refute the results of the digestibility tests when serums are available.

If the source contains a common allergen or toxin, industry scientists must prove that the allergenic or toxic components have not been transferred. However, as a practical matter, biotechnology companies repeatedly state that if the conventional food is considered a major food allergen, they will not transfer genes from that source.

For example, there are limitations to the acceptability of amino acid sequence similarity test results, in part because there is not agreement on what level of amino acid similarity indicates a likelihood of allergenicity and, therefore, the need for additional testing. Industry scientists assert that as long as amino acid sequences in a protein are less than 50 percent identical to those in known allergens, then the protein should not raise concerns. On the other hand, a scientist associated with a consumer group, as well as a report from the United Nations\u2019 Food and Agriculture Organization, believe a more conservative level, such as less than 35 percent identical, is appropriate.

The graphs in figure 3 illustrate three scenarios: graph (a) shows a GM mustard plant with small molecule levels nearly identical to its conventional counterpart; graph (b) shows a GM mustard plant with a few easily measurable decreases; and graph (c) represents a GM mustard plant with many significant differences from the small molecule levels of its conventional counterpart.", "If baseline data on normal ranges of variation, such as those developed for the mustard plants, can be made available for all GM food crops, companies might use this type of testing to develop safety data. For example, in graph (a), the absence of significant changes in the small molecules would strongly indicate that no significant changes had resulted from the genetic modification. Hence, a change in the risk of allergenicity, toxicity, or antinutrients would be very unlikely. In the case represented by graph (b), the software could determine which small molecules have changed. Then, traditional testing techniques such as toxicity testing, could be used to determine if the altered small molecules would have any effect on human health, plant growth, or crop yield. In the case shown in graph (c), scientists would probably not proceed with development and commercialization of the GM food in the absence of extensive evaluations for allergens, toxins, or antinutrients, due to the significant differences in small molecules between it and its conventional counterpart."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Comments from the Department of Health and Human Services", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals above, Nathan J.
