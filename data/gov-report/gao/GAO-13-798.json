GAO's objectives were to (1) identify key questions for congressional committees, managers, and other reviewers to consider when evaluating carryover balances, including whether to reduce them, and (2) describe how answering these key questions provides insight into why carryover balances may exist in selected accounts.", "GAO reviewed carryover balances from fiscal years 2007 through 2012 in eight selected accounts from the Departments of Defense (DOD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Housing and Urban Development (HUD), and Treasury. Account selection was based on several characteristics, including the average size of the balance, budget function, type of account, agency, and whether the account was composed of mandatory or discretionary funds.", "GAO is not making any recommendations.

Answering key questions during review of carryover balances provides insights into why a balance exists, what size balance is appropriate, and what opportunities (if any) for savings exist. Given that a single account may support a single program or multiple programs--or that multiple accounts may support a single program--these questions can be applied when evaluating balances at either the account or program level. Examination of balances may assist decision makers in identifying opportunities to achieve budgetary savings or redirecting resources to other priorities. However, the complexity of the federal budget is such that a case-by-case analysis is needed to understand how best to achieve these financial benefits.", "What mission and goals is the account or program supporting? Understanding the mission activities, goals, and programs the account supports provides information about whether a program needs to maintain a balance to operate smoothly, what size balance is appropriate, and whether opportunities for savings exist. Accounts GAO reviewed maintained balances to support activities such as long-term acquisition of military aircraft and public health emergency preparedness.", "What are the sources and fiscal characteristics of the funding? The sources and fiscal characteristics of the funding present different issues in changing the size of carryover balances. Accounts such as Treasury's Exchange Stabilization Fund, receive \"such sums as may be necessary\" and may require programmatic changes to effectively reduce balances. In such cases, simply reducing balances may have no economic benefit and could impose unnecessary administrative costs. If funds are discretionary, such as with HUD's Homeless Assistance Grants, balances can be controlled through appropriations acts.", "What factors affect the size or composition of the carryover balances? Understanding factors within and outside an agency's control that affect its \"spendout rate\" provides insight to the composition of the carryover balance as a whole. Funds in accounts that support activities such as certain procurement or disaster relief may be obligated fairly quickly, but are expended over a longer period as milestones are met or as grantees draw down funds. Accounts with quick spendout rates, such as those that provide cash payments to government-sponsored enterprises, disburse funds soon after obligation.", "How does the agency estimate and manage carryover balances? Understanding an agency's processes for estimating and managing balances provides information to assess how effectively agencies anticipate program needs and ensure the most efficient use of resources. For the mandatory accounts GAO reviewed, such as the Federal Housing Administration's Mutual Mortgage Insurance Capital Reserve account, agencies focused on future needs of the account and relied on economic indicators and historical trends to estimate future balances. For discretionary accounts GAO reviewed, such as the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Construction account, agencies used historical data combined with current variables to estimate carryover balances."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Given the fiscal pressures facing the nation, the need to identify  opportunities for savings, find ways to better leverage resources, and  increase accountability has become even more critical to the success of  federal agencies and the programs they administer.

One area that managers  and other decision makers look to when seeking potential savings are  carryover balances: balances in individual agency accounts that are  carried forward into future fiscal years.

Discretionary  spending is controlled through annual appropriations acts (plus in some  cases supplemental appropriations acts), which may provide multi-year or  no-year funds. Under certain legal authorities, some discretionary  accounts are funded entirely, or in part, through the collection of user  fees, interagency transactions, or dedicated excise taxes. Specifically, the  level of discretionary funding in an account is provided by, and controlled  through, the annual appropriations process.", "In contrast, mandatory spending accounts, which include \u201centitlements,\u201d  receive budget authority through laws other than appropriations acts.  Many mandatory programs receive budget authority for an unspecified  amount made available as the result of previously enacted legislation,  with no need for further legislative action. For example, Medicare,  veterans\u2019 pensions, Social Security, and federal crop insurance are  mandatory programs. By statute, funding to these programs is driven by  eligibility rules and benefit formulas, which means that funds are made  available as needed to provide benefits to those who are eligible and wish  to participate.

Based on the level of total available budget authority in the account,  agencies may then obligate funds throughout the fiscal year. An  obligation is a definite commitment that creates a legal liability of the  federal government for the payment of goods and services.

Answering each of the four overarching questions and their second-tier  questions provides insight into why a carryover balance exists, what size  balance is appropriate, and what opportunities, if any, for savings exist. In  addition, it may provide opportunities for enhanced oversight of agencies\u2019  management of federal funds and identify areas where the federal  government can improve and maximize its use of resources. These  questions can be applied when evaluating carryover balances at either  the account or program level. A single account may support a single  program or multiple programs. Conversely, a single program may be  supported by multiple accounts.

Therefore, a longer view is preferable.", "Since the many accounts that make up the federal budget vary greatly  and individual accounts have their own unique characteristics, we do not  suggest that the following set of questions represents all the questions  that could be considered when evaluating carryover balances. As  congressional committees, managers, and other reviewers apply these  evaluative questions, additional questions may arise.

For example, an account established to provide stability in the  financial or housing market needs a balance to ensure the agency has  sufficient resources to respond quickly to adverse events.

Mandatory funding is budget authority  provided in laws other than appropriations acts, such as authorizing acts.  In such cases, to change or reduce the size of carryover balances,  changes need to be made to authorizing language affecting program or  eligibility requirements, for example. Moreover, since mandatory funds  are often provided in \u201csuch sums as may be necessary\u201d to make  payments to those eligible, reducing the balance in such an account may  have no practical or economic benefit and instead could impose  unnecessary administrative costs.

If an account  receives multi-year or no-year appropriations, some accounts or  programs should be expected to have carryover balances. Similarly, if an  account receives multi-year supplemental appropriations late in the fiscal  year or for long-term projects, there is an increased likelihood, and  perhaps expectation, for a carryover balance in the account.  Nevertheless, a growing carryover balance over a number of years may  indicate challenges in executing a program as planned.", "Accounts that receive funding primarily from outside sources, such as  fees, have their own unique considerations.

Accordingly, the specific types of  activities funded through the accounts varied as well, including  construction projects, procurement, grants, and emergency  preparedness. Over the fiscal year 2007 through 2012 period, each of  the accounts had a carryover balance that was tied to the manner in  which the agency went about fulfilling its related mission responsibilities.", "For example, the Mutual Mortgage Insurance Capital Reserve account  maintains a balance for unexpected insurance claim expenses and was  established to hold reserve funds to meet Federal Housing  Administration\u2019s (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund)  statutory capital reserve requirement. Under the MMI Fund, FHA insures  a variety of mortgages for home purchases and refinancing to meet the  housing needs of traditionally underserved borrowers. balance in the capital reserve account is composed entirely of  unobligated funds and is affected by changes in the anticipated  performance of FHA-insured mortgages. Consequently, the housing crisis  that started in 2007 had a significant effect on the size of the account\u2019s  unobligated balance. During the housing crisis, the balance was drawn  down as more pessimistic forecasts of economic conditions\u2014house  prices, in particular\u2014resulted in higher projected insurance claims.

For example, in some cases where an account received  supplemental appropriations, the level of carryover funds was significantly  affected by the timing of that supplemental appropriation. For example,  the Community Development Fund (CDF) account, which primarily  supports the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) program,  received a large supplemental appropriation on September 30, 2008, to  provide disaster relief to areas affected by hurricanes, floods, and other  natural disasters. The receipt of supplemental funds at the end of the  fiscal year caused a significant spike in the account\u2019s carryover balance  for that year.", "Additionally, the timing of final appropriations decisions had a significant  effect on the size of unobligated balances in certain accounts. When  continuing resolutions (CR) are enacted in lieu of annual appropriations  bills, it creates uncertainty about both the timing and level of funding that  ultimately will be available. For example, agencies are directed to operate  at a conservative rate of spending while CRs are in effect, thus  compressing the time period to obligate funds once final appropriations  decisions are made. We have previously reported that this also limits an  agency\u2019s management options. In addition to affecting the rate of  obligations, agencies may be uncertain how Congress will ultimately  choose to direct funds until final appropriations decisions are made. For  example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers develops and presents  construction plans for specific projects as part of its annual budget  request. Corps officials reported that in some cases, committee reports  accompanying appropriations acts included language directing the Corps  to carry out additional construction projects than those which already had  work plans developed.

The spendout rate was very quick\u2014that is, funds were  disbursed soon after obligation\u2014which resulted in the agency reporting  no obligated balance in the account by year end. Accordingly, the  remaining unobligated balance represents the cash balance in the  account.", "In contrast, the carryover balance in Army\u2019s Aircraft Procurement account  was largely made up of unliquidated obligations.

However, funds were disbursed only  as work was completed according to the terms of the contract.", "In the case of the grant accounts we reviewed, the size of the carryover  balance depended on the particular grant cycle. For example, the  carryover balance in the Department of Housing and Urban  Development\u2019s (HUD) Homeless Assistance Grants account contained a  relatively smaller portion of unobligated funds compared to obligated  funds. The unobligated balance resulted from the timing of the grant  award process, which is done on a calendar year rather than fiscal year  basis. Consequently, while a portion of funds are unobligated at the end  of the fiscal year, the agency plans to award grants at a later date during  the current or next calendar year, likely during a new fiscal year, at which  point the available multi-year funds will be obligated.

In such cases, reducing an account\u2019s  balance may have no economic benefit and  instead could impose unnecessary  administrative costs. If funds are discretionary,  balances can be controlled by the annual  appropriations process.  Some accounts or programs may be expected  to have carryover balances if the agency has  multi-year or no-year funds. Supplemental  appropriations enacted late in the fiscal year  (or for long-term projects) may also increase  the likelihood, and perhaps expectation, for a  carryover balance.

It is important to consider which factors were  within the agency\u2019s control and which were not.  Agencies or programs may operate in a way  that contributes to a faster or slower spendout  rate for a particular account.

The  majority of the carryover balance was composed of unliquidated  obligations.", "According to DOD officials, the majority of the carryover balance is  obligated but unliquidated due to the nature of the procurement process  for aircraft, which can take many years. Once the Army identifies a  requirement and receives appropriations to fund that requirement, it  issues a request for proposals to develop a product to meet the  requirement. After the request for proposal is issued, awarding a contract  generally takes three to nine months. Once a contract is in place and  funds are obligated, the agency periodically disburses funds to the  contractor as milestones are reached. The majority of the payment is  made upon delivery.", "DOD officials said a portion of unobligated funds are committed  (reserved) for specific projects. However, balances that are considered  \u201ccommitted\u201d are not officially obligated until a contract is awarded. For  example, in 2011 the subaccount dedicated to modifications of aircraft  had an unobligated balance of about $420,000, of which approximately  $355,000, or about 85 percent, was already \u201ccommitted\u201d to specific  projects.", "In 2009, several events contributed to a delay in the contracting cycle that  resulted in higher unobligated balances for 2010 and 2011. A 2009  executive policy memo directed DOD to issue new guidance regarding  sole-source contracting. In anticipation of the guidance, APA officials  chose to wait to award any further contracts. Additionally that year, we  identified issues with the Defense Contract Audit Agency, including with  the independence of their auditors. As a result of these two factors, APA  reviewed and revised its processes, which delayed the contracting  timeline that year from approximately 3 to 9 months to 9 to 18 months.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "DOD estimates carryover balances for the Army Aircraft Procurement  account using a formula based on historical data. The agency first  determines the average obligation rate over the previous five years. Using  this weighted average, officials then apply that rate against current  obligated balances in the account to estimate the amount of unobligated  funds and unliquidated obligations that will carry forward to the next fiscal  year.", "As shown in figure 6, actual unobligated balances have steadily risen,  while estimates have remained fairly steady. Further, actual unobligated  balances were higher than estimates for all years, with the greatest  differences occurring in 2010 through 2012.

The majority of the carryover  balance was unobligated funds.", "A portion of the carryover balance is a result of no-year supplemental  appropriations. Corps officials said that, in some cases, supplemental  funds were not intended to be obligated immediately because they fund  long-term projects. For example, between fiscal years 2006 and 2009, the  Construction account received approximately $5 billion to aid in disaster  recovery following Hurricane Katrina, a portion of which had still not been  expended in 2012. In fiscal years 2009 through 2012, the size of the  obligated portion of the balance was larger than in previous years as the  Corps had the opportunity to obligate funds from supplemental  appropriations it received.", "Further, officials cited delays in final appropriations execution decisions  as a contributing factor to increased unobligated balances at the end of  each fiscal year. The Corps develops and presents construction plans for  specific projects as part of its annual budget request. In some cases,  committee reports accompanying appropriations acts included language  directing the Corps to carry out additional construction work beyond that  for which the agency had already developed work plans. Consequently,  Corps officials said obligating the funds to support this additional work  was delayed until they developed the necessary work plans.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Corps officials said that carryover on individual projects is influenced by  factors such as real estate and environmental considerations, including  whether a project will affect local water quality. Officials also use ten-year  historical averages of the account\u2019s obligations and outlays to identify  possible trends that may affect balances going forward. To manage  carryover balances, officials said they adjust work plans consistent with  Congressional direction.", "As shown in figure 8, the actual unobligated balance was larger than what  the agency initially estimated each year during fiscal years 2007 through  2012. While in some cases, current year estimates were closer to actuals,  the graph of estimated balances below suggests that the agency\u2019s  estimation process generally underestimated the amount of unobligated  funds that would be carried over each year.

Within ASPR, the largest  programs are the Hospital Preparedness Program and the Biomedical  Advanced Research and Development Authority. Other programs and  offices that PHSSEF supports include HHS\u2019 Cybersecurity program, the  Medical Reserve Corps, and Pandemic Influenza. In addition, the account  includes the balance of the Special Reserve Fund, which supports the  procurement of biodefense countermeasures as part of the Project  BioShield Act.", "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "The account receives annual appropriations, supplemental  appropriations, and transfers from other accounts outside of HHS. Annual  appropriations primarily support ASPR and consist of a mix of both one- year and multi-year funds. Supplemental appropriations were provided for  preparedness and response to pandemic influenza in 2009 and  emergency relief and reconstruction aid related to the earthquake in Haiti  in 2010. Those funds are available until expended (no-year funds). In  addition, the account received a transfer of funds from the Department of  Homeland Security for Project BioShield activities and reimbursements  from the Federal Emergency Management Agency. All funds in the  account are discretionary.", "What Factors Affect the Size or Composition of Carryover  Balances?", "As shown in figure 9, the actual carryover balance dramatically increased  in fiscal year 2009, to approximately $11 billion, and subsequently  declined through 2012. In most years, the obligated portion of the balance  was greater than the unobligated portion. However, in fiscal year 2010,  with the receipt of supplemental appropriations, the unobligated balance  was almost twice as large as the obligated portion of the balance.", "Agency officials said that carryover balances in the account were  primarily the result of no-year supplemental appropriations. For example,  in fiscal years 2009 and 2010, balances reflect supplemental  appropriations to address the H1N1 pandemic influenza outbreak and  emergency relief after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti. In addition, funds  transferred from DHS for Project BioShield activities contributed to the  carryover balance.", "In addition, some of the multiple programs that PHSSEF supports have  slower spendout rates than others. For example, agency officials  explained that funds supporting Project BioShield activities were available  for obligation at intervals over a ten-year period during fiscal years 2004  to 2013. They said the intent of the funding method was to provide  procurement funds with availability over a long period of time to  encourage industry to engage in the advanced development of  countermeasures. As a result, some portion of unobligated funds would  be carried forward each year. Once HHS has entered into a contract for  the procurement of a specific countermeasure, agency officials said it  may take years to progress through contractual milestones, thereby  contributing to the size of the obligated portion of the carryover balance in  any given year.", "In contrast, agency officials said the spendout rate of PHSSEF funds  supporting National Special Security Events (NSSE) is relatively shorter.   Planned events which require HHS support include the Presidential  Inauguration and July 4th celebrations on the National Mall. An example  of an unplanned event is when HHS used PHSSEF funds to provide  mental health response teams to Sandy Hook Elementary students,  families, and staff after the school shooting in December 2012. HHS  officials said the obligation of these funds for NSSE purposes is  somewhat sporadic, but once obligated, funds are quickly disbursed.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Agency officials said the Office of Budget works with program and budget  offices to obtain information to incorporate into budget year estimates of  carryover balances. These balances are informed by prior year actuals  and take into account any planned procurement, other contract actions,  and grant awards.", "As shown in figure 10, during fiscal years 2007 through 2012, actual  unobligated balances in the account were higher than budget-year  estimates in most years with the largest differences occurring in fiscal  years 2009 and 2010. Agency officials said emergency supplemental  appropriations contributed to higher than expected unobligated balances  in 2009 and 2010. Specifically, supplemental appropriations were  provided to address the influenza pandemic in 2009 and to respond to the  earthquake in Haiti in 2010. Both events were unexpected and  accordingly, were not included in the agency\u2019s initial estimates of the  unobligated balance. In addition, HHS officials said obligations slowed in  fiscal year 2010 when the influenza pandemic proved to be less severe  than originally anticipated. In both 2011 and 2012 unobligated balances  were lower than budget-year estimates.", "Community Development Fund (CDF)  Department of Housing and Urban Development  (Budget Subunction 451)", "What Mission and Goals Is the Account or Program Supporting?", "The Community Development Fund (CDF) primarily supports programs  targeted for low to moderate income individuals and families that include  activities such as job creation. The Department of Housing and Urban  Development (HUD) uses the funds in this account to distribute grant  assistance through several programs, the largest of which is the  Community Development Block Grant (CDBG). CDBG provides formula  grants to units of general local government and states to support activities  such as public infrastructure improvements, housing, rehabilitation, and  public service activities including child care.", "CDF also supports other programs such as Section 108 loan  guarantees, the Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) and  disaster recovery programs. CDF has received large supplemental  appropriations for various disaster recovery efforts such as those  following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Wilma.", "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "CDF receives annual CDBG appropriations for grants to state and local  governments which are available for obligation for three years. HUD  officials said that CDBG funds are distributed through formulas, with  approximately 70 percent allocated to entitlement communities and 30  percent to non-entitlement communities. According to HUD, entitlement  communities are defined by statute, as cities with populations greater  than 50,000 people or urban counties with populations of 200,000 or  more.", "CDF also receives supplemental appropriations for its disaster recovery  programs, which have varying periods of availability depending on the  legislation. In addition, HUD officials said funds supporting NSP1 and  NSP3 are mandatory and all CDBG funds are discretionary.", "What Factors Affect the Size or Composition of the Carryover  Balance?", "During fiscal years 2007 through 2012, the size of the carryover balance  in the CDF account ranged from approximately $16 billion to about $29  billion. As shown in figure 11, the obligated but unexpended portion of the  balance remained fairly steady over the six year period. The unobligated  portion peaked in 2008 and subsequently decreased for the remainder of  the period.", "Supplemental appropriations contributed to larger than anticipated  unobligated balances in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. Although officials  said they make an effort to obligate supplemental appropriations quickly,  if funds are received late in the fiscal year, it is more likely that a portion  of the unobligated funds will carry over into the next fiscal year. For  example, in 2008, HUD received a supplemental appropriation on  September 30th to provide disaster relief to areas affected by hurricanes,  floods, and other natural disasters. The timing of the appropriation led to  a large increase in the unobligated balance carried over into the next  fiscal year. In 2009, additional supplemental appropriations were enacted.", "HUD officials said they typically obligate funds quickly; however, the rate  of expenditure may be slow, resulting in a large obligated, unexpended  balance from year to year. This is because once funds are obligated, the  time it takes to expend funds depends on the rate at which grantees are  drawing down their grant money. In the case of supplemental funds, the  increased amount of grants may be a challenge for grantees to disburse.  For example, HUD officials said that in one instance, a grantee that  typically received a couple hundred thousand dollars per year received  approximately $18 million in grant funds. Such a dramatic increase in the  amount of grant funding posed administrative challenges for the grantee,  which contributed to a slower spendout rate.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Estimates of carryover balances are determined through a review of prior  year balances in the account. For example, when estimating the portion  of the balance attributed to the traditional CDBG program, officials said  they look at the composition of carryover balances from recent years,  including whether the balances are composed of funds in their first year,  second year, or third year of availability. They also consider historical  rates of obligations and outlays. For the portion of the balance attributed  to disaster recovery grants, it is more difficult to estimate carryover  because estimating the timing and size of supplemental appropriations for  disaster recovery are beyond the agency\u2019s control.", "As shown in figure 12, actual unobligated balances were larger than  estimated during fiscal years 2007 through 2012, with the largest  difference occurring in 2008. Although the budget-year estimate of the  unobligated balance for fiscal year 2007 was fairly close to the actual, the  agency generally underestimated the amount of unobligated funds that  would be carried over each year. For example, in 2008 and 2009, as  discussed above, the agency unexpectedly received supplemental  appropriations that caused the actual balance to be considerably higher  than the previous estimates.", "Federal Housing Administration   Mutual Mortgage Insurance (MMI) Capital   Reserve Account  Department of Housing and Urban Development  Agency:  National Priority:   Mortgage Credit (Budget Subfunction 371)", "What Mission and Goals Is the Account or Program Supporting?", "The MMI Capital Reserve account supports the Federal Housing  Administration\u2019s (FHA) Mutual Mortgage Insurance Fund (MMI Fund).  Under the MMI Fund, FHA insures a variety of mortgages for home  purchases and refinancing to meet the housing needs of traditionally  underserved borrowers. FHA has played a prominent role in the single- family mortgage market and accounted for more than 25 percent of the  home purchase mortgages originated in fiscal year 2012.", "Like other federal credit agencies, FHA estimates and re-estimates the  net lifetime costs\u2014known as credit subsidy costs\u2014of the mortgages it  insures. When the present value of estimated cash inflows (such as  borrower insurance premiums) exceed the present value of expected  cash outflows (such as insurance claims), negative subsidies are  generated. These negative subsidies are held in the MMI Capital Reserve  account as an unobligated balance. When FHA experiences  unanticipated increases in estimated credit subsidy costs (upward re- estimates), balances in the MMI Capital Reserve account help to cover  these increases.", "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "The MMI Capital Reserve account accumulates negative subsidies  resulting from FHA\u2019s single-family mortgage insurance activities. It also  earns interest and realizes gains on investment in nonmarketable  Treasury securities. In the event the MMI Capital Reserve account is  depleted, FHA is authorized to draw on permanent and indefinite budget  authority to cover additional increases in estimated credit subsidy costs.", "The MMI Capital Reserve account contains only mandatory funds, and  those funds are available until expended.", "What Factors Affect the Size or Composition of the Carryover  Balance?", "As shown in figure 13, carryover balances declined during the 6 years we  reviewed, with a steep decline in 2009 and 2010. Because the spendout  rate in this account is very quick, and in effect obligations are equivalent  to outlays, nearly all of the carryover balances are unobligated.", "The MMI Capital Reserve account maintains balances to cover  unexpected insurance claim expenses, so when FHA experiences  financial stress, the account balance decreases. For example, when the  MMI Fund experiences higher-than-expected mortgage defaults (resulting  in higher claims), there will be an upward re-estimate of credit subsidy  costs. When there is an upward re-estimate, the MMI Capital Reserve  account is the first source of funds used to cover the higher costs, thus  lowering balances in the account. During the housing crisis that began in  2007, more pessimistic forecasts of economic conditions\u2014house prices,  in particular\u2014resulted in higher projected insurance claims. As a result,  balances in the MMI Capital Reserve account fell dramatically. From 2009  through 2012, FHA has submitted upward credit subsidy re-estimates  ranging from about $6.8 to $10.5 billion annually. If upward re-estimates  were to deplete the balance in the MMI Capital Reserve Account, FHA  would need to draw on permanent, indefinite budget authority to have  sufficient reserves for all future insurance claims on its existing portfolio.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "The MMI Fund is reviewed from actuarial, financial and budgetary  perspectives each year, which helps officials estimate carryover  balances. From the actuarial perspective, FHA is statutorily required to  ensure that the MMI Fund maintains a 2-percent capital ratio (discussed  in more detail below). For its financial statements, FHA calculates the  liability for loan guarantees, which represents the net present value of  future cash flows on FHA\u2019s existing portfolio. From a budgetary  perspective, FHA must follow the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990,  which requires the agency to estimate and re-estimate the net lifetime  costs of the mortgages it insures.", "The MMI Capital Reserve account holds funds to help FHA meet the  statutory 2-percent capital ratio requirement for the MMI Fund and, as  previously noted, maintains balances for unexpected claim expenses.  The capital ratio is defined as the MMI Fund\u2019s economic value divided by  the total insurance-in-force. The balance in the MMI Capital Reserve  account is one component of the economic value, along with the balance  in the MMI Financing Account (which maintains balances to cover  estimated credit subsidy costs) and the net present value of future cash  flows. However, as a result of the economic downturn and housing crisis,  the fund did not meet this requirement from 2009 through 2012. To help  increase balances in the MMI Capital Reserve account and bring the MMI  Fund back into compliance, FHA has implemented policy changes,  including increases in borrower insurance premiums and enhanced  underwriting requirements.", "As shown in figure 14, actual unobligated balances were lower than  originally estimated for all years. Current year estimates were very close  for almost all years during the period. This shows that the agency\u2019s  process for estimating unobligated balances assumed an accurate trend  in most years, but tended to overestimate future balances, especially in  fiscal year 2012.", "Account Name:   Agency:    National Priority:   Housing Assistance (Budget Subfunction 604)", "What Mission and Goals Is the Account or Program Supporting?", "The Homeless Assistance Grants (HAG) account funds two primary grant  programs: the Continuum of Care program and the Emergency Solutions  Grant program. The Continuum of Care program is HUD\u2019s largest and  broadest targeted program to provide funds to address homelessness  and the Emergency Solutions Grant Program includes funds for a variety  of activities such as rapid re-housing. Grants through the Continuum of  Care program are awarded through a national competition. An average of  87 percent of those funds per year goes to renew existing projects. The  process to register, compete, and award grants is done on a calendar  year basis and generally takes about seven months. The grant  competition cycle begins after the agency receives a final annual  appropriation. Once grants are awarded, funds are obligated and  disbursed to grantees.", "What are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "Funds in the HAG account are discretionary, provided through annual  appropriations, and available for obligation for three years.

As shown in figure 15,  unobligated balances remained steady over the six year period. In 2009,  there was an increase in the obligated balance that subsequently  decreased in later years.", "A portion of the unobligated balance results from the timing of the grant  competition and award process, which is done by calendar year rather  than fiscal year. For HAG, the typical grant competition cycle involves  several phases. First, once the agency has received its annual  appropriations, it then opens a program registration period. After the  agency reviews registrations, it opens the grant application process.  Following the final application review, grants are awarded at a later date  during the current or next calendar year (likely during a new fiscal year).", "At that point the available multi-year funds will be obligated. Because  grant awards are typically made after the end of the fiscal year,  unobligated balances are carried over from one fiscal year to the next.", "Officials said the increase in the obligated, unexpended balance that  occurred in 2009 and 2010 was the result of two events. In 2009, the  account received $1.5 billion for HUD\u2019s Homelessness Prevention and  Rapid Re-housing Program, which contributed to the increase in the  obligated balance. In addition, the agency implemented a change in its  process to review renewal grants. This change in process, which started  in 2008, involved transitioning from a paper-based system to an  electronic-based system. Officials said launching the new system caused  a delay in awarding and disbursing grants, which resulted in an increased  carryover balance.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Renewal grants account for the largest share of grant funding in the  account and are typically funded before new grant applications are  considered. Accordingly, HUD officials develop estimates of the account\u2019s  carryover balance based on the historical rate of grant renewal from  previous years. This helps the agency project the number of grants that  will likely be renewed in the future, thereby informing HUD\u2019s estimate of  the amount of funds that will be carried forward from one fiscal year to the  next.", "As shown in figure 16, from 2007 through 2010 actual unobligated  balances were slightly higher than initial estimates. From 2009 through  2012, the actual unobligated balance remained fairly steady while agency  estimates predicted more fluctuation.

The primary  purpose of the fund is to stabilize international financial markets,  consistent with U.S. obligations in the International Monetary Fund (IMF).  To carry out this purpose, the Secretary is authorized to purchase, sell, or  deal in gold, foreign currencies, and other instruments of credit and  securities. The ESF holds international reserve assets of the United  States, including U.S. dollars, foreign exchange, and Special Drawing  Rights (SDR). If the maturity on an ESF loan or credit to a foreign entity  or government will extend beyond six months, the President must give  Congress a written statement that unique or emergency circumstances  exist.", "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "The account received a $2 billion appropriation in 1934 when the fund  was created. The Bretton Woods Agreements Act of 1945 directed the  Treasury Secretary to pay $1.8 billion from the ESF to the IMF for the  initial U.S. quota subscription in the IMF, thereby reducing ESF\u2019s  appropriated amount to $200 million. Since that time, the major sources  of the fund\u2019s income have been (1) gains (or losses) due to changes in  exchange rates, (2) SDR allocations, and (3) earnings on investments  held by the fund including interest earned on fund holdings of U.S.  Government securities or interest on loans or credits to foreign  governments.

The obligated portion of the balance held steady in fiscal years  2007 through 2009. By the end of fiscal year 2010, the obligated portion  of the total carryover balance had grown significantly. The unobligated  balance stayed fairly steady throughout fiscal years 2007 to 2012 with the  exception of a dramatic spike in fiscal year 2009.", "Treasury officials said the largest single factor affecting the obligated  balance is attributed to changes made to ESF\u2019s budgetary reporting in  fiscal year 2010. According to Treasury officials, prior to fiscal year 2010,  the U.S. Standard General Ledger (USSGL) did not support the  budgetary transactions of the ESF, thereby making it impossible to do  ESF reporting using government-wide automated standards. The USSGL  Board established a standard ledger account specifically for the ESF as a  step toward correcting the budgetary reporting. Treasury\u2019s  implementation of this reporting change resulted in significant  adjustments to ESF account balances and caused the size of the  obligated balance to grow as a share of the total carryover balance in  fiscal years 2010 through 2012.", "The spike in the unobligated balance in 2009 is almost entirely attributed  to approximately $50 billion of new SDR allocations and one transaction  that occurred over a one-month period. Pursuant to decisions made by  the IMF membership, the IMF provided general and special SDR  allocations to its members, including approximately $47.3 billion to the  United States. As noted earlier, SDRs are held in the ESF. Treasury  officials said the general allocation was an important element of the  response to the global economic crisis. Further, they said the IMF general  allocation provided an additional reserve buffer for IMF member countries  that was critical to stopping the capital drain from emerging market  countries and restoring global market confidence. In addition, Treasury  monetized $3 billion of its ESF SDRs in a transaction authorized under  the Special Drawing Rights Act.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Treasury officials said they do not estimate carryover or unobligated  balances for the ESF as they do in other accounts (e.g., salaries and  expenses). The balances represent investments and the unobligated  balance is calculated from ESF\u2019s balance sheet: assets minus liabilities.", "Account estimates reported in the President\u2019s Budget each fiscal year are  based on projected net interest earnings on ESF assets. The estimates  are subject to considerable variance, depending on changes in the  amount and composition of assets and the interest rates applied to  investments. The estimates make no attempt to forecast gains or losses  on SDR valuation or foreign currency valuation.", "As shown in figure 18, the nearly $50 billion of SDR-related transactions  in fiscal year 2009 led to an actual unobligated balance in the ESF that  was much larger than was estimated in fiscal year 2007 when the  President\u2019s fiscal year 2009 budget was developed. Moreover, these  transactions had a direct impact on Treasury\u2019s estimates of the  unobligated balance in subsequent years. Treasury officials said the  general timing of those transactions was concurrent with the agency\u2019s  development of its fiscal year 2010 mid-year estimate and fiscal year  2011 budget-year estimate for the account.

The  first amendment in May 2009 increased the allowable investment level to  $200 billion for each GSE. In December 2009, the second amendment  changed the investment level so it was based on a formulaic cap that  would automatically adjust upwards quarterly by the cumulative amount of  any losses realized by either GSE and downward by the cumulative  amount of any gains, but not below $200 billion.", "What Are the Sources and Fiscal Characteristics of the Funding?", "HERA established temporary authority for the GSE Purchase Agreements  account and granted the Treasury Secretary temporary authority to  purchase obligations and securities.

In 2009, the  maximum allowable funding commitment was increased by an additional  $200 billion for the account. Treasury also made its first payments to the  GSEs equal to $95.6 billion. As shown in figure 19, this translated into an  unobligated balance of $304.4 billion at the end of fiscal year 2009. Prior  to making payments to the GSEs, Treasury received an apportionment of  its budget authority from OMB at the beginning of the fiscal year for the  unobligated balance brought forward in the account.", "The gradual decline in the unobligated balance reflects Treasury\u2019s  subsequent payments to the GSEs in fiscal years 2010 through 2012,  bringing the balance down to $212.5 billion by the close of fiscal year  2012.", "How Does the Agency Estimate and Manage Carryover Balances?", "Budget year estimates of the unobligated balance are derived from the  estimated draws on the account from year to year. To do this, Treasury  annually prepares a series of long-range forecasts to determine the  estimated amount of contingent liability to the GSEs under the purchase  agreements. These projections inform the agency\u2019s estimation of  payments to the GSEs for a given year. Based on the size of the  estimated payments, Treasury estimates the amount of budget authority  that will be carried over into the next year. By the time the agency  develops current year estimates, agency officials said they typically know  what the size of the payment request will be, thereby contributing to a  more accurate estimate of the unobligated balance that is carried forward.  This informs apportionment decisions to ensure there are sufficient funds  to cover the payments to the GSEs.", "As shown in figure 20, there were no estimated unobligated balances in  fiscal years 2007 through 2009. This is attributed to the timing of the  President\u2019s budget preparation for each of those years, and to the  creation of the Purchase Agreement account. The account was  established after the enactment of HERA in 2008, which meant that the  account\u2019s estimates were issued for the first time in the President\u2019s fiscal  year 2010 budget. Similarly, there were no actual unobligated balances to  report prior to 2008. During fiscal years 2010 through 2012, Treasury\u2019s  estimates of the unobligated balance in the account were slightly lower  than, but fairly close to, the actual balance at year-end.
