HMO enrollment is further concentrated in urban areas. The 5 metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) with the largest risk contract enrollments accounted for 34 percent of nationwide risk program enrollment in 1995, and the top 10 MSAs accounted for 51 percent of nationwide risk program enrollment. Enrollment data for the top 100 MSAs appear in appendix II.", "Although the HMO share nationwide is small, recent HMO enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries has grown rapidly. From 1990 through 1992, enrollment grew by about 13 percent annually but, during 1993 and 1994, grew by an annual average of 23 percent. Preliminary data for 1995 suggest a growth rate approaching 30 percent. Similarly, the number of risk contract HMOs, which declined substantially during the early years of the program, has nearly doubled since 1991 from 83 to the current 164. (See fig. 2.)", "In 1994, the HMO enrollment rate in California and 14 other states\u2014whose enrollees account for 55 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries\u2014experienced double-digit increases.

For the most part, these states have had extremely low HMO market penetration."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HMO Rate-Setting Methodology Thwarts Medicare\u2019s Efforts to Realize Savings", "paragraphs": ["Our work suggests that Medicare\u2019s HMO rate-setting methodology does not maximize the potential of managed care to yield cost savings and, in some cases, can even discourage HMO participation in the program. By linking HMO payments to Medicare costs in the fee-for-service sector, the current methodology causes three problems. First, the rate-setting formula restricts potential savings and ignores the ability of competitive market forces to help produce additional savings. Second, the lack of adequate risk adjusters in the formula allows some HMOs to be overcompensated given the health status of their enrollees. Third, the formula may discourage plan participation by setting payments that are too low in some areas and by causing rates to vary greatly both among geographic areas and over time."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Formula Encourages Competition Between HMOs That Primarily Benefits Enrollees", "paragraphs": ["Under the present system, Medicare pays all HMOs in a county the same capitation (base) rate. With the payment rate fixed and independent of both HMO costs and the competitiveness of the local managed care environment, HMOs compete only for the enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries. Efficient, low-cost HMOs may be able to offer more generous benefit packages to enrollees and still prosper under the fixed capitation rate. Because the payment rate is fixed, however, the government derives little benefit from HMOs\u2019 increased competition or increased efficiency. Moreover, Medicare beneficiaries have only limited incentives to seek care from low-cost health plans.", "Medicare may be underestimating HMOs\u2019 efficiency and requiring an HMO discount from fee-for-service costs that is too modest. The HMO capitation rate is set by statute at 95 percent of the AAPCC: in other words, 5 percent below the estimated cost of serving beneficiaries in the fee-for-service sector. HMOs that can attract Medicare enrollees and provide health care for less than the capitation rate\u2014for example, for 85 percent of fee-for-service costs\u2014keep the difference (within limits) between their costs and the capitation payment.", "The recent surge in HMO participation indicates that many organizations now view Medicare risk contracts as potentially lucrative. In addition, in caring for Medicare beneficiaries, HMOs are estimated to achieve cost savings in excess of 5 percent. Research suggests that HMO costs for caring for their enrollees are at least 10 percent less than HCFA would have spent on fee-for-service care for them. Finally, some experience of private-sector employers with HMOs suggests that the 5-percent discount may be too low, especially in certain urban areas with mature managed care markets. In those markets, even a larger discount (lower capitation rate) might not significantly discourage HMOs\u2019 participation in Medicare risk contracts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Risk Adjustment Methodology Inadequate to Prevent Overcompensation", "paragraphs": ["HCFA\u2019s capitation payment to HMOs is currently risk adjusted for only four demographic factors: beneficiary age, sex, Medicaid status, and institutional status. These adjustments are designed to modify HMO payments for expected variations in medical costs. For example, the capitation payment is higher for older beneficiaries because they are expected to require more medical care than younger beneficiaries. This risk adjustment is inadequate, however, because it does not specifically adjust for the health status of enrollees. By enrolling the healthier individuals, HMOs deliver less health care but are compensated as if they had enrolled a costlier clientele of both the healthier and the sicker individuals.", "Our review of studies on risk selection shows that, because most HMOs benefit from favorable selection (the healthier individuals typically enroll in HMOs), Medicare has paid HMOs more than it would have paid for the same patients\u2019 care by fee-for-service providers. Estimates of the excess payments range from almost 6 percent to 28 percent. However, these estimates have been criticized as too high for various technical reasons, such as the data analyzed (from 1991) no longer reflect current conditions. Nonetheless, our review suggests that favorable selection persists despite HMO enrollment expansion. HCFA officials agree that the risk contract program displays favorable selection, though they believe that excess payments are at the lower end of this range."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Formula Produces Capitation Rates That Vary Considerably Within Market Areas", "paragraphs": ["Capitation rates are set separately for each U.S. county and vary considerably nationwide among regions and states, urban and rural counties, and even neighboring counties. This variation may discourage some HMOs from participating in risk contracts. For example, under the present system, an HMO is paid 27 percent less for serving a beneficiary living in Montgomery County, Maryland, than for serving an otherwise identical beneficiary living in neighboring Prince George\u2019s County, Maryland\u2014even if the two individuals are treated in the same facility by the same doctor. The disparity of payment rates among counties leads some HMOs to enroll beneficiaries from a limited portion of their service area.", "The formula\u2019s link to local fee-for-service spending, which reflects local variations both in the price and volume of medical services used by Medicare beneficiaries, causes the disparity of the capitation rates among areas. Much of the occurring variation may, however, be attributable to underutilization of health care in some areas and overutilization in others instead of differences in the cost of providing appropriate health care. If fee-for-service beneficiaries use a large volume of services (either because beneficiaries demand these services or because their doctors order additional services), then HMO payment rates will be relatively high in that county. In contrast, if Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries use few services\u2014perhaps because of inadequate transportation or a lack of providers in rural areas\u2014then HMO payment rates will be relatively low. As a result, rates in some areas are too low to induce HMO participation in the risk contract program, while rates in other areas are too high for Medicare to realize the potential cost savings generated by capitated payments."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Strategies Exist for Medicare to Realize Savings", "paragraphs": ["Modifying the present payment system could help generate Medicare savings. Our review of the private sector\u2019s experience, reforms in other public health care programs, and empirical research suggests that several strategies hold promise. These strategies fall into three broad categories: fostering price competition among HMOs, developing better risk adjusters, and revising the AAPCC-based capitation rate.", "In our view, HCFA could generate the most Medicare savings if it would pursue strategies in all three categories concurrently. Trying to address all obstacles in a uniform way in all regions of the country is likely to fail. This is because the predominant challenges to saving costs in large cities are not necessarily the same ones that exist in rural counties and because the challenges vary from region to region even for otherwise similar communities. Consequently, a variety of strategies is warranted; local conditions would determine the particular strategies for any specific area.", "The details of implementing any strategy are important. Changing Medicare\u2019s rates for paying HMOs could affect their decision to participate in risk contracts and the benefits they provide. This, in turn, could affect Medicare beneficiaries\u2019 decisions to enroll in managed care plans and the quality of care they receive in those plans. Thus, estimating the dollar savings and determining the best method of implementing specific strategies would be possible only after quickly conducting and evaluating demonstrations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Fostering Price Competition Among HMOs", "paragraphs": ["Requiring qualified HMOs to submit competitive bids could encourage price competition that would enlist market forces to help contain Medicare costs. The accepted bid would set the capitated rate at which HMOs would provide comprehensive care to Medicare enrollees in an area. This approach completely decouples capitation rates from average fee-for-service spending. Under a competitive bidding system, HMOs would have an incentive to submit bids that reflect their actual costs of providing health care to Medicare enrollees. Low bidders would be rewarded with risk contracts. High bidders could be excluded, included if they accepted the winning bid amount, or included but subject to a financial penalty.", "A competitive bidding strategy would be most effective in locations likely to attract many bidders\u2014typically urban areas with well-developed managed care markets. Table 1 indicates that competitive bidding looks promising in at least 17 urban areas (accounting for about 50 percent of all risk contract beneficiaries) because each has 10 or more participating HMOs. Competitive bidding might not be viable, however, in at least 47 other urban areas (accounting for about 11 percent of enrollees) where three or fewer HMOs participate in Medicare. Unless the competitive bidding structure were to attract additional HMOs, many locations likely would not be good candidates for determining HMO rates through competitive bidding. Consequently, an alternative rate-setting methodology would need to coexist with a competitive bidding approach.", "Competitive bidding, rate negotiation, and beneficiary incentive approaches have been used successfully in other public health insurance programs. Arizona, for example, since 1982 has delivered health care to its indigent population mostly through capitated managed care organizations in which the capitation rates are set through a competitive bidding process. A recent study concluded that, compared with traditional Medicaid programs (predominately fee for service), Arizona achieved significant cost savings and a lower rate of expenditure growth. CalPERS, serving about 1 million members, also relies on price competition among health plans and consumer incentives to control costs. Negotiating rates with HMOs has helped CalPERS to reduce premiums in each of the past 3 years; reductions ranged from 0.4 percent in 1993-94 to 5.2 percent in 1995-96.", "Designing a good competitive bidding system requires attention to many issues, such as whether beneficiaries in plans that lose the bidding must shift to the winning plan. In addition, savings may not be realized immediately because of high initial start-up costs\u2014for example, developing the bidding process and establishing the necessary management information systems. Administrative expenses may be high as well.", "Arizona\u2019s experience illustrates these points. Arizona spends on Medicaid administration an amount equal to over 7 percent of its program\u2019s acute care medical costs. This is more than comparable states spend on administering their traditional fee-for-service Medicaid programs. This suggests that the effective use of managed care may require strong administrative structures to adequately oversee and efficiently manage program resources. Even so, Arizona\u2019s experiment with competitive bidding has succeeded in providing health care to beneficiaries while saving the state money.", "Other strategies besides competitive bidding could introduce market forces. These include strategies to encourage Medicare enrollees to be more price sensitive. Such strategies range from requiring newly eligible Medicare beneficiaries who choose a fee-for-service plan to pay slightly more than beneficiaries who choose a managed care plan to approaches that would allow beneficiaries to \u201cprice shop\u201d from a list of approved HMOs and share a portion of any cost savings with the government. Because these strategies are so far untried, the extent to which they would increase beneficiaries\u2019 price sensitivity and help control Medicare costs is unknown. As with competitive bidding, a wide variety of approaches may be used to implement these strategies. A fuller discussion of such approaches, however, is beyond the scope of this report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving Risk Adjusters", "paragraphs": ["In earlier reports, we noted that researchers have proposed several alternative risk adjustment methods to reduce HMOs\u2019 incentives to enroll only relatively healthy Medicare beneficiaries. Each of these alternative methods attempts to measure the health status of enrollees more fully than HCFA\u2019s method and can be judged according to several generally accepted operational criteria. For example, a good risk adjuster would be inexpensive to administer, reduce favorable selection, create incentives for HMOs to provide appropriate care, and not be subject to manipulation by participating HMOs. No single risk adjuster is likely to exhibit all these positive traits, however, because these criteria have trade-offs. For example, a more complex risk adjuster may better succeed in reducing favorable selection but may do so only at a high administrative cost.", "Recently, we evaluated 10 possible risk adjusters. None emerged as the definitive solution to the current method\u2019s problem. However, 4 of the 10 adjusters we examined were potentially superior to the current method and seemed to entail less administrative burden than the most sophisticated risk adjusters. One of these adjusters\u2014clinical indicators\u2014would adjust capitation rates for the presence or absence of a particular chronic health condition (such as heart disease, stroke, or cancer). Two other promising clinically based risk adjusters include information not only on a beneficiary\u2019s specific condition but also on its severity. In the fourth approach, HMO capitation payments would be linked to beneficiaries\u2019 own views of their physical and emotional health."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Improving the AAPCC Capitation Rate", "paragraphs": ["With new legislative authority, HCFA could require steeper discounts from HMOs than the present 5-percent discount off the estimated local fee-for-service cost. Although this would lower payments to HMOs, it may not necessarily have a large impact on their participation in Medicare risk contracts. Previous research indicates that enrollment of healthier than average beneficiaries, combined with an imperfect method of risk adjustment, results in excessive payments to HMOs\u2014even after factoring in the 5-percent discount. Recent evidence suggests that HMOs find participation in the risk contract program to be lucrative under current payment rates. Specifically, the number of HMOs obtaining risk contracts has increased from 109 to 164 in less than a year and a half, and the percentage of risk contract HMOs charging Medicare beneficiaries a zero premium has increased from 28 (23 plans) in 1993 to 49 (77 plans) in 1995.Thus, HMOs may continue to find Medicare risk contracts attractive\u2014even at a somewhat larger discount. However, if health plans react by offering less generous benefit packages, fewer seniors may be attracted to HMOs, and some current enrollees may disenroll.", "The method used for calculating the AAPCC could also be improved by assigning a greater weight to the influence of local medical prices and a lesser weight to the influence of local service utilization patterns in the fee-for-service sector. Modifications could also be made so that the AAPCC would reflect HMO market areas rather than artificial political boundaries. For example, defining a single capitation rate for a metropolitan area would eliminate the possibility that an HMO would receive more for serving a senior in one county than it would for serving an otherwise identical senior in an adjacent county. These changes would also tend to reduce the volatility of the AAPCC over time and consequently increase HMO participation in the risk contract program."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HCFA Plans Tests of HMO Payment Reforms", "paragraphs": ["HCFA is planning to conduct demonstration projects to examine several proposals for modifying or replacing the current method of determining payment rates to HMOs. Early results from some demonstrations could emerge during fiscal year 1996, but we believe that a thorough assessment of the demonstrations is, at best, several years away. The projects are at various stages, from solicitation of proposals from private contractors to implementation of the demonstration. Table 2 summarizes information about the demonstration projects.", "While hopeful that these demonstrations will provide valuable information on alterative payment approaches, HCFA officials believe that the design and results for some projects could be improved if the legislative authority to conduct demonstrations were expanded. HCFA\u2019s legislative authority, established in 1967 and modified in 1972, does not discuss Medicare managed care options explicitly. This limits HCFA\u2019s ability, for example, to mandate that HMOs remaining in the Medicare program participate in a demonstration.", "In our view, these demonstration projects are steps in the right direction. Nonetheless, in light of Medicare\u2019s current losses due to the risk contract program\u2014estimated at between $0.8 billion and $4.0 billion per year\u2014HCFA might take other, more immediate steps to stem losses. For example, the Congress could grant HCFA authority to increase the HMO discount from its current 5 percent in certain areas. These might be areas where Medicare HMO enrollment is growing rapidly or where most HMOs do not currently charge beneficiaries a premium for expensive extra benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["HMOs appear to provide care to Medicare beneficiaries at lower cost than traditional fee-for-service care, but Medicare\u2019s method of paying HMOs has limited the program\u2019s ability to save money for the federal budget and the taxpayer. The potential savings from fixing Medicare\u2019s payment method have grown along with the number of Medicare HMO enrollees, which has risen rapidly in certain urban areas.", "To realize these savings requires redesigning Medicare\u2019s HMO payment method by correcting three flaws. First, the rigidity of the forumula-based fixed payment rate does not allow Medicare to capitalize on the competition among HMOs that, in the private market, leads to lower rates. Second, rate adjustment for differences in beneficiaries\u2019 health status are so imprecise that Medicare overpays HMOs that enroll beneficiaries in good health. Third, the method\u2019s reliance on a county\u2019s fee-for-service health care costs to establish a payment rate produces rates that vary considerably within market areas. The government does not benefit from the low rates because they deter HMOs from enrolling Medicare beneficiaries. Moreover, the government incurs excess costs because high rates overcompensate HMOs that do participate.", "With respect to pricing capitated health plans in Medicare, we believe that one size does not fit all. Market conditions vary too much and in important ways, even among metropolitan areas.", "A sensible approach would be to pursue three promising strategies concurrently\u2014foster price competition among HMOs, improve risk adjusters\u2019 accuracy, and allow for adjustments in the current formula to reflect market competition and HMOs\u2019 local health care costs.", "Recently, HCFA initiated two steps to correct the current payment method. First, it solicited proposals from private contractors to plan a demonstration project on competitive bidding. Second, it began work on two demonstration projects on improved risk adjustment\u2014one soon to be implemented, the other to begin in 1996.", "These HCFA projects are steps in the right direction, but considerable time will elapse before the results are fully evaluated. Consequently, HCFA needs to complement longer term improvements with quick action to mitigate Medicare losses as risk contract HMO enrollment grows. For example, HCFA needs to implement a better risk adjuster quickly. HCFA can select from four risk adjusters that we identified last year as showing promise in accuracy and administrative feasibility. Furthermore, in implementing a new risk adjuster, or testing any new rate-setting approach, HCFA could adopt a strategy to reduce its response time to lessons learned from project results. This would entail developing information on the design and implementation of the new approach while testing is under way, without waiting for comprehensive evaluation results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matters for Consideration", "paragraphs": ["In light of the increasingly urgent need to realize savings from the Medicare HMO program and to develop viable new methods of paying HMOs, Congress may wish to consider giving the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services authority to selectively reduce Medicare HMO payment rates (the AAPCC rate) in areas where market data indicate that the Medicare rates are too high and expand HCFA\u2019s authority to mandate HMO participation in demonstration projects in order to conduct more meaningful studies of alternative payment methods."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Health and Human Services reviewed a draft of this report and provided written comments.
