An important component of managing forests on a sustained-yield basis is each forest\u2019s \u201callowable sale quantity,\u201d or ASQ. As defined by the Forest Service, the allowable sale quantity is an estimate of the maximum volume of timber that can be sold from each forest over a 10-year period without impairing other uses of that forest, such as recreation or protection of wildlife habitat.", "The exact role of the allowable sale quantity in setting timber sale volumes has been a source of controversy. The Forest Service, which is not required by statute or regulation to prepare the entire allowable sale quantity for harvest, views it as an upper limit on timber sales, not as a specific goal. The timber industry, however, often regards it as the volume that should be provided for sale. Meanwhile, some environmental groups maintain that the allowable sale quantity overstates the ability of some forests to produce timber on a sustained-yield basis.", "The quantity of timber sold from a national forest is sometimes substantially below the allowable sale quantity. You asked us to identify the reasons for this difference. As agreed with your office, we reviewed the allowable sale quantities and the timber sales at five national forests\u2014three in the Forest Service\u2019s Pacific Northwest Region and two in the Southern Region. The five forests were the Deschutes and Mt. Hood in Oregon, Gifford Pinchot in Washington, Ouachita in Arkansas, and Chattahoochee-Oconee in Georgia. We chose forests in these two regions primarily because these regions sold more timber in fiscal year 1993 than the Forest Service\u2019s other seven regions."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The Forest Service, within the Department of Agriculture, manages for multiple uses 191 million acres of national forests and grasslands under a wide and complex set of laws and regulations. For fiscal year 1993, the Forest Service reported selling 4.5 billion board feet of timber from the lands for a total bid value of $774.9 million.", "Developing ASQs is part of a legislatively required process specified in the Forest and Rangeland Renewable Resources Planning Act (RPA) of 1974 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614), as amended by the National Forest Management Act (NFMA) of 1976 (16 U.S.C. 1600-1614). RPA requires the Forest Service to develop long-range planning goals for activities on rangelands and in national forests, and NFMA directs the Forest Service to develop detailed management plans for national forests and to regulate timber harvests to ensure the protection of other resources. The Forest Service has supplemented this guidance with regulations, first issued in 1979 and revised in 1982, and with a manual and handbooks for forest-level use. (See apps. I and II for further discussion of these laws, regulations, and policy guidance.)", "The Forest Service also has management responsibilities that extend beyond timber production, including such other activities as protecting natural resources like air, water, soils, plants, and animals for current and future generations. The Multiple Use-Sustained Yield Act of 1960 (16 U.S.C. 528-531) gives the Forest Service authority to manage lands for multiple uses and to sustain in perpetuity the outputs of various renewable natural resources. In carrying out its responsibilities, the Forest Service must also comply with other requirements for identifying and considering the effects that activities may have on natural resources. For example, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) requires the preparation of environmental impact statements for major actions that may significantly affect the quality of the human environment.", "National forest management can be divided into three main processes\u2014planning, budgeting, and (for timber resources) preparing timber sales.

The planning process is complex, involving extensive surveys of forest resources, the use of computer models, the development of management alternatives, and substantial public participation. The process is also lengthy, taking generally 3 to 10 years to complete.", "Part of this process involves developing the ASQ, which is the Forest Service\u2019s estimate of the maximum harvest consistent with sustaining many other uses of the forest. Although the ASQ covers the first 10 years of the forest plan, it is usually expressed as an annual average (i.e., one-tenth of the total ASQ). Timber sales in any year may fluctuate above or below the average annual ASQ as long as the cumulative sales for the 10-year period do not exceed the total ASQ\u2014that is, the maximum amount to be sold over the 10-year period.

These requests are then aggregated at the national level, where they are subject to review and change by Forest Service headquarters, the Department of Agriculture, the Office of Management and Budget, and the Congress.

At four of these five forests, timber sales also decreased over the 3-year period. (See app. IV for forest-by-forest totals.) For example, at the Mt. Hood National Forest, which had an average annual ASQ of 189 million board feet, ASQ-related timber sales were approximately 51 million board feet in 1991 and 38 million board feet in 1993. The Ouachita National Forest was the only forest whose timber sales were higher in 1993 than in 1991. Its ASQ is approximately 147 million board feet, and it had ASQ-related timber sales of about 40 million board feet in 1991 and 131 million board feet in 1993.", "Factors contributing to differences between ASQs and timber sales at the five forests we reviewed included limitations in data and estimating techniques, the emergence of new forest management issues and changing priorities, and rising or unanticipated costs associated with preparing and administering timber sales."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Limitations in Data and Estimating Techniques", "paragraphs": ["At four of the five forests, officials said the preciseness of the ASQ was affected by limitations in data and estimating techniques. To develop the ASQ, officials said they had used the best information available at the time and a variety of estimating and computer modeling techniques. However, they noted that these estimating and computer modeling techniques carry an inherent risk of imprecision. For example, estimates of timber volumes may be based on analysis of aerial photographs and sample tracts within a forest. More detailed, on-the-ground analysis may later reveal that actual timber volumes differ somewhat from the estimated quantities, as the following examples show:", "After estimating ASQ volumes for planning purposes, officials at the Deschutes National Forest discovered that they had overestimated the size of the timber inventory in timber harvest areas. They had based their inventory on an average volume that might have been accurate for the forest as a whole but was not accurate within specific areas where sales were planned. To correct this weakness, they redesigned the inventory process and began implementing the changes in 1993.", "At the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, officials said that they had identified limitations in their original estimates of the timber yield. Forest officials had included all potentially saleable trees of all species (the forest has about 40 different species of trees) in their estimates of the timber yield during the planning process. However, as they began to implement their forest plan, they found that buyers desired only some of the species. In addition, the ASQ included yields from some forest land\u2014such as areas next to visually sensitive travelways\u2014that could not be fully harvested. Forest officials acknowledged that including these possible yields lowered the accuracy of their ASQ estimate. To correct these problems, forest officials plan to adjust their yield estimates to include only timber with established markets and to develop a more precise way to identify acres available for harvest.", "Officials at the Gifford Pinchot National Forest said they believe their ASQ could have been based on an overestimate of the number of acres available for timber production. In later analyzing timber management areas, forest officials found that fewer acres were available for harvest than originally estimated. The forestwide estimates used to develop the ASQ did not consider some factors\u2014such as wildlife habitat, sensitive plant species, or campground uses\u2014later encountered in on-the-ground examination while preparing timber for sale. To improve the accuracy of their estimates, forest officials have proposed collecting more information before determining the number of acres available for timber production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "New Forest Management Issues and Changing Priorities", "paragraphs": ["The forest plan, which incorporates the ASQ, reflects the Forest Service\u2019s determination at the time the plan is developed of how timber production and other uses of the forest will be managed over the next 10 to 15 years. After these decisions have been made and an ASQ has been established, however, new forest management issues and changing priorities often emerge that directly affect how the forest will be managed. These changes may also affect the amount of timber that can be sold.", "The most dramatic example of such changes for the forests we reviewed occurred in the Pacific Northwest Region. In mid-1990, when the forest plans containing the ASQs for the three Pacific Northwest forests were ready to be implemented, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service announced its decision to list the northern spotted owl as a threatened species under the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. Much of the land inhabited by the spotted owl is managed by the Forest Service. Several environmental groups challenged the process used to implement spotted owl management, and on May 23, 1991, many timber harvests in the three forests were halted by a court injunction. Forest Service officials said this injunction and similar legal challenges were primarily responsible for the difference between ASQs and timber sales in all Pacific Northwest forests.", "Sharp declines in the volume of timber sold from the Gifford Pinchot National Forest illustrate the effects of challenges and the court injunction on timber sales. This forest had an average annual ASQ of 334 million board feet. In fiscal year 1991, the forest sold 110.2 million board feet of timber that was chargeable to the ASQ and had been harvested outside the owl habitat. In fiscal year 1992, that total dropped to 19.8 million board feet, and in fiscal year 1993 it further declined to 14.8 million board feet. According to the forest\u2019s monitoring report for 1993, \u201cthe shortfall continues to be the result of the owl controversy and recent court decisions.\u201d", "While the Southern forests we reviewed were not affected by an event as sweeping as the spotted owl controversy, their harvests were likewise affected by events that reflected changes in the relative priorities assigned to timber sales and other uses of the forest. These changes generally did not result in court challenges but rather in appeals filed by individuals or groups during an administrative process established by the Forest Service to review challenges to its decisions on issues ranging from the size of a forest\u2019s ASQ to aspects of a particular timber sale. Under this process, Forest Service personnel review and decide on the appeals. At the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, for example, the majority of appeals challenged individual timber sales that were below cost or had been designed without proper environmental evaluations. According to a forest official, in fiscal year 1993 a total of 10 appeals challenged 8 proposed timber sales, and in fiscal year 1994 (through June 29), a total of 44 appeals challenged 22 proposed timber sales.", "The Forest Service is revising its policies to respond more effectively to changing priorities for uses of the nation\u2019s forests. On June 4, 1992, the Chief of the Forest Service announced a new policy of multiple-use ecosystem management for the national forests and grasslands. Four of the five forests in our review are included in pilot projects proposed for fiscal year 1995 as tests of ecosystem management\u2019s potential to better ensure the sustainable long-term use of natural resources. One project addresses common problems associated with air and water quality, conservation, biological diversity, and sustainable economic growth in the southern Appalachian highlands, a region that includes the Chattahoochee-Oconee forest. In an August 1994 report on ecosystem management, we concluded that such projects afford an opportunity to test this approach to land management.", "The three Pacific Northwest forests we reviewed are included in another ecosystem management pilot project that could affect the current process for developing ASQs. In response to the spotted owl controversy, the administration created an interagency team to develop alternatives that would \u201cattain the greatest economic and social contribution from the forests of the region and meet the requirements of the applicable laws and regulations.\u201d In April 1994, the interagency team produced a land management plan based on broad land areas, such as river basins and watersheds. Forest Service officials indicated that under the new plan, although an ASQ would still be developed in order to comply with the requirements of the National Forest Management Act of 1976, individual revised forest plans might also include a \u201cprobable sale quantity\u201d to reflect the uncertainty associated with selling timber at the ASQ. For example, for the three Pacific Northwest forests we reviewed, the new land management plan identifies an average annual probable sale quantity of 157 million board feet, as compared with the existing average annual ASQ of 621 million board feet. The difference is due primarily to the allocation of fewer acres for timber production."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Rising or Unanticipated Costs Associated With Preparing Timber Sales and Administering Harvests", "paragraphs": ["Forest Service officials cite the timing of the budget process, as well as new forest management issues and changing priorities, as contributing to the shortfall in the moneys available to prepare timber sales and administer harvests at ASQ levels. According to these officials, budget requests must be prepared 2 to 3 years before the funds are actually received, and emerging issues and changing priorities may render the original request insufficient, as in the following instances:", "At the Chattahoochee-Oconee National Forest, officials estimated that the costs per million board feet to prepare timber sales and administer harvests rose by approximately 36 percent between 1988 and 1993 when the Forest Service began to reduce its use of clearcutting and increase its use of other harvesting methods. These other harvesting methods, such as single-tree and group selection methods, require Forest Service personnel to mark each tree planned for harvest. Because this and other activities increase the cost and time associated with preparing each timber sale, available staff and funds cannot be spread over as many sales as originally planned.", "At the Mt. Hood National Forest, officials said that in recent years they had underestimated their costs to prepare timber sales and administer harvests when developing their annual budget requests. They noted that between fiscal years 1990 and 1991, preparation and administration costs rose by about 39 percent, and between fiscal years 1991 and 1992, these costs rose by an additional 147 percent. Factors contributing to these increases in costs included requirements for (1) conducting surveys of cultural and historical resources and of threatened and endangered species that took more time and resources than had been anticipated and (2) switching from clearcutting to other harvesting methods and shifting timber harvests out of owl habitat to comply with court injunctions. While preparation and administration costs increased by only 8 percent between fiscal years 1992 and 1993, forest officials believe that they will increase by another 51 percent between fiscal years 1993 and 1995 as the new Pacific Northwest forest plan is implemented."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Observations", "paragraphs": ["Given the uncertainties inherent in developing ASQs, shortfalls between ASQs and timber sales should be expected.

Once the regional forester approves the preferred alternative, the forest plan is completed, and the ASQ is established for the next 10 years.", "Although this process has clearly defined requirements, it is also open-ended in that the ASQ as well as other elements of the forest plan can be changed at any time during the 10-year period if the forest supervisor determines that a change is necessary. Changes are made through amendments or revisions to the forest plan to accommodate such things as shifts in land management policy or other significant changes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Budgeting Process", "paragraphs": ["Before forest officials develop their budget requests, they receive written instructions from Forest Service headquarters on what to include in their requests. These instructions communicate the agency\u2019s priorities in light of such factors as the administration\u2019s guidance on the agency\u2019s budget targets. The administration\u2019s guidance can be as specific as a letter from the President or as general as a forecasted budget total for the agency. The instructions are also formulated with input from regional foresters, who recommend to the Chief of the Forest Service which program goals should be emphasized\u2014for example, ecosystem management or the operation and maintenance of recreational facilities. Regional foresters also identify levels of data to be collected and (until fiscal year 1996) specific resource targets. For fiscal year 1996, specific resource targets were eliminated.", "After receiving these instructions, forest officials develop their budget requests. The budget process actually begins 2 to 3 years before the fiscal year in which the funds will be spent. For example, the process for developing a forest\u2019s fiscal year 1995 budget request probably began in fiscal year 1993 or earlier.", "Forest officials also develop their requests as a range of funding alternatives in accordance with headquarters guidance. For example, fiscal year 1995 budget submissions from Pacific Northwest forests included three funding levels: (1) a base level equal to the fiscal year 1992 appropriation, adjusted for inflation; (2) a reduced level, 5 percent lower than the base level; and (3) an increased level, 20 percent higher than the base level. Budgets prepared for fiscal years up to 1995 also included a funding level based on the amount the forest supervisor believed would be necessary to implement the forest plan\u2019s objectives.", "The budget request for each forest is subject to levels of internal Forest Service review. The request is first forwarded to the regional office, where it is reviewed for conformity with budget instructions and regional priorities. The regional office makes any changes it deems necessary, consolidates the request for the forest with those for other forests in the region, and adds the regional office\u2019s own estimated costs for supporting the forests and implementing the regional office\u2019s own actions and program initiatives. The completed request, which displays the request for each forest as well as the aggregated numbers, is forwarded to headquarters. There, a similar review of regional requests is conducted. The regional budgets approved by headquarters are aggregated, and headquarters adds the costs it expects to incur in carrying out its administrative and monitoring activities and in initiating any national programs. This process results in an overall Forest Service request.", "This request may be changed by the Department of Agriculture (the Forest Service\u2019s parent agency), the Office of Management and Budget, or the Congress through the appropriations process. However, budget reviewers at these levels do not have forest-level data to determine the funds needed to attain the goals for the individual forests; instead they review overall agency goals. For example, according to an official from the Department of Agriculture, the agency considers such things as the number of Forest Service employees, the agency\u2019s programs, and national goals like implementing ecosystem management in the Pacific Northwest. According to an official from the Office of Management and Budget, the agency considers whether, in areas such as timber production, the budget reflects policies that are consistent with the administration\u2019s broader policies and objectives. The Office of Management and Budget also reviews the cost-effectiveness of the Forest Service\u2019s production of timber for sale by comparing projected cost estimates with the most recent actual costs. At the congressional level, the administration\u2019s request is subject to change in the committee process and in floor debate.", "Once a funding level for the Forest Service is approved, the appropriations information is then passed in reverse, from the Congress down to headquarters, along with congressional directives specifying how some of the funds will be spent. Headquarters divides and allocates the funds to the regions, and, in turn, each region allocates funds to each forest, usually well into the fiscal year. Until the actual funding is received, forests will use the region\u2019s estimated appropriation level as a base, as well as the forest plan\u2019s priorities and historical trends.", "Before fiscal year 1993, in providing funds for preparing and administering timber sales, the Congress also specified the volume of timber it expected the Forest Service to offer for sale.

Basic decisions about whether to continue the sale occur both at gate 1 and gate 2. Gate 1 generally occurs in the first year; gate 2 usually occurs between the second and fifth year of sales that continue beyond gate 1. Public comments are actively sought by the Forest Service throughout gates 1 and 2. Comment after a decision has been made comes through the administrative appeal system, once a decision notice has been signed by the approving official at gate 2. According to a forest official, administrative appeals or lawsuits can add 4 months to 4 years to the entire process. Gate 3 usually occurs during the third to eighth year of the sale, depending on the complexity of the sale. The remaining gates generally take place during the last year of the sale process.

If the forest supervisor decides that an event\u2014such as a decrease in the forest\u2019s ability to produce the ASQ\u2014is significant, then forest officials must follow the same procedure as is required to develop and approve a forest plan. If the event is insignificant\u2014such as the acquisition of additional forest land\u2014then such an extensive effort is not required and the amendment can be implemented after the public has been properly notified and NEPA procedures have been satisfactorily completed.", "NFMA requires that a forest plan be revised at least every 15 years; however, the plan can be revised at any time. A forest supervisor can request a plan\u2019s revision when forest conditions or demands have changed significantly or when changes in RPA policies, goals, and objectives significantly affect the forest\u2019s programs.
