However, since the passage of the Act, many agencies have been preparing for its governmentwide implementation, beginning in the fall of 1997. In June 1997, under the Results Act requirement that we report on agencies\u2019 implementation of the Act, we concluded that governmentwide implementation would be uneven.

In doing so, these programs are typically expected to help achieve certain social and economic results, such as reaching underserved populations and neighborhoods and supporting investment that is important to the economy. As reported in the fiscal year 1998 budget, at the end of fiscal year 1996, the outstanding face value of credit programs had reached almost $1 trillion in direct loans and loan guarantees.", "For this report, our first objective was to identify goals and measures established by the selected credit programs that related to the programs\u2019 intended purposes and to determine whether the programs had set target levels of performance for assessing their progress in achieving their desired results. Under the Results Act, target levels of performance are to enable decisionmakers to compare planned versus actual results achieved for a given year. Our second objective was to identify the challenges agency officials cited in developing performance information, including goals and measures, for the selected programs and any approaches those programs were taking to address those challenges. Our third objective was to describe the status of the Working Group\u2019s effort to develop common performance measures for federal credit programs.", "We selected for our review credit programs that varied in terms of type of program (e.g., housing and education loans); mode of credit delivery (e.g., direct and guaranteed loans); and program size as measured by the amount of outstanding loans. These programs were the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) Loan Guaranty Program, which provides home loans for veterans and active duty personnel; the Department of Education\u2019s William D. Ford Direct Loan Program and its Federal Family Education Loan Program (referred to in this report as Education\u2019s direct and guaranteed student loan programs, respectively), which issue or guarantee loans, respectively, for students enrolled in postsecondary education; and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Single-Family Housing (SFH) direct loan program and guaranteed loan program, which make or guarantee loans to low- and moderate-income rural families, respectively, who are unable to obtain credit from other sources.", "According to data reported by OMB in the fiscal year 1998 budget and agency data, of the total amount of federal credit outstanding in fiscal year 1996 for guaranteed loans ($805 billion) and direct loans ($165 billion), these five programs represented about 32 and 18 percent, respectively."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In the 1990s, Congress put in place a statutory framework to address the long-standing weaknesses in federal operations, improve federal management practices, and provide greater accountability for achieving results. This framework included as its essential elements the Results Act and key financial management and information technology reform legislation: the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990 (CFO)\u2014as expanded by the Government Management Reform Act of 1994 (GMRA)\u2014and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 and the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, respectively. Taken together, these legislative initiatives seek to respond to a need for accurate, reliable, and integrated budget, financial, and program information for congressional and executive branch decisionmaking, information that much of our prior work has shown to be badly lacking.", "The goal-setting and performance measurement and improvement system envisioned by the Results Act is the centerpiece of this framework and starts with the requirement that each executive agency develop and periodically update a strategic plan to lay out its mission, long-term goals and objectives, and strategies for achieving those goals and objectives. Under the Results Act, the first of these plans were due by September 30, 1997. Next, each agency is to develop an annual performance plan, beginning with the agency\u2019s plan for fiscal year 1999, which covers each program activity set forth in the agency\u2019s budget. Agencies were to submit their fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans to OMB in the fall of 1997 with their fiscal year 1999 budget requests and are to submit those plans to Congress after the President\u2019s fiscal year 1999 budget is provided to Congress in February 1998. Among other things, agencies\u2019 annual performance plans are to contain their programs\u2019 goals and measures for fiscal year 1999. Finally, each agency is to report publicly on its programs\u2019 performance, specifically on the degree to which the goals that are laid out in the agency\u2019s annual performance plan are being met and on actions it plans to take to achieve unmet goals. The first of these reports, on programs\u2019 performance for fiscal year 1999, is due by March 31, 2000; subsequent reports are due by March 31 for the years that follow. (For a detailed description of the Results Act\u2019s requirements, see app. I.)", "The CFO Act and GMRA are intended to strengthen the reliability of agencies\u2019 financial and programmatic performance information and the reporting of such information by, among other things, having agencies develop better performance measures and cost information and design results-oriented reports that integrate budget, accounting, and program information.Finally, the Paperwork Reduction Act and Clinger-Cohen Act seek to help agencies address long-standing weaknesses in their use of information technology. Under this legislation, each agency is to better link its technology plan and information technology use to achieving the agency\u2019s desired results.", "In addition, long-standing concerns about the program and financial management of credit programs have prompted Congress to enact important budget and credit management reform initiatives over the last 15 years. These initiatives include the Debt Collection Act of 1982 (DCA) and amendments, the Debt Collection Improvement Act of 1996 (DCIA), and the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 (FCRA). DCA and DCIA are significant pieces of credit management legislation designed to, among other things, facilitate federal efforts to decrease delinquencies and increase collections. Under DCA, agencies were to annually report to the Director of OMB and the Secretary of the Treasury on the status of their debt collection activities. Under DCIA, agencies are now to annually report on those activities only to the Secretary of the Treasury, who in turn is to annually report to Congress, beginning no later than 1999, on such activities governmentwide. FCRA changed the budget treatment of direct loans and loan guarantees made on or after October 1, 1991, to (1) facilitate more accurate reporting by credit agencies on the full cost to the government in the budget for the year in which the programs made or guaranteed the loans so that executive branch and congressional decisionmakers might consider such costs when making budget decisions and (2) permit appropriate cost comparisons between direct and guaranteed credit programs and between credit and noncredit programs intended to achieve similar purposes.", "Guided by these legislative initiatives, since 1992, OMB has encouraged federal credit agencies to improve their credit programs\u2019 financial and programmatic performance measures and to adopt a set of common performance measures for those programs. According to OMB and the Federal Credit Policy Working Group, common measures should help credit program managers and other decisionmakers assess how similar functions are performed and promote an atmosphere of cooperation and a sharing of ideas among agency officials on how to improve the performance of credit programs.", "In response to the increasing importance being placed on agencies\u2019 integration of performance measurement with budgeting, management improvement, and overall agency accountability, the Working Group has focused since July 1995 on developing common performance measures for credit programs. To do so, the Working Group established a task force to develop measures for credit programs consistent with the Results Act and credit and financial management reform initiatives. In August 1997 we reported that agencies\u2019 annual planning under the Results Act could be used as a vehicle for developing, where appropriate, common performance measures for permitting future comparisons of similar programs\u2019 results and the methods those programs used to achieve those results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Scope and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To meet our first objective\u2014to identify goals and measures established by the selected credit programs that related to the programs\u2019 intended purposes and determine whether the programs had set target levels of performance for assessing their progress in achieving their desired results\u2014we compared the programs\u2019 goals and measures to their respective intended purposes, as identified by the programs or their respective agencies. We interviewed agency officials about the programs\u2019 intended purposes and asked those officials to comment on the relationships we identified between the programs\u2019 goals and measures and intended purposes. To determine whether the programs had set target levels of performance for assessing their progress in achieving their desired results, we identified those measures for which the programs had either (1) identified fiscal year 1998 targets or (2) reported prior year baseline data for those measures and indicated how performance on those measures was to change (i.e., increase or decrease) in fiscal year 1998 relative to the baseline.", "The programs\u2019 goals and performance measures that we used for our assessment were those established by the programs as of May 1, 1997, which, according to agency officials, were generally the same ones the programs submitted with their respective agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1998 budget presentations to OMB and Congress. The programs also were proposing to include these goals and measures for their agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans under the Results Act.

Examples of these activities included \u201cdetermining a realistic target level of performance for annual performance goals\u201d and \u201cdeveloping measures for assessing the net effect of the program compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the program.\u201d To identify these activities, we referred to key steps and practices identified in our Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act and other work that we had under way assessing the challenges agencies were facing in implementing performance measurement.", "We asked officials to use a five-point scale to rate the 49 activities, ranging from \u201clittle to no\u201d challenge to a \u201cvery great\u201d challenge for the selected credit programs in their agencies. For purposes of this report, we refer to activities that any of the agency officials rated as a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cvery great\u201d challenge as significantly challenging activities. We then interviewed agency officials about why they rated certain activities associated with developing performance information as significantly challenging. We analyzed their responses and related documentation to identify general challenges that led agency officials to report those activities as significantly challenging for the selected programs. To identify any approaches those programs were taking to address the challenges they have been facing, we talked with agency officials about such approaches and analyzed agency documentation. We also considered prior and ongoing work we have done on the efforts of VA, Education, USDA, and other credit agencies to implement various credit and financial management reforms.", "To meet our third objective\u2014to describe the status of the Working Group\u2019s effort to develop common performance measures for federal credit programs\u2014we reviewed various documentation from OMB and members of the Working Group that described this effort and agency officials\u2019 views about those measures. We also talked to OMB officials and members of the Working Group, including agency officials at those agencies administering the programs we selected for our review, to obtain their views of the common performance measures proposed. Our review did not address the reasonableness of the processes or methods the Working Group\u2019s task force used in determining how to assess progress for federal credit programs or determine whether other measures existed that may be more appropriate.

For example, to monitor its performance in achieving one of its intended purposes, namely helping veterans retain their homes, VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program established the Foreclosure Avoidance Through Servicing (FATS) Ratio measure. According to VA, the FATS ratio is to provide data on the extent to which foreclosures would have been greater had VA not pursued alternatives to foreclosure, such as intervening with the holder of the loan on behalf of the borrower to set up a repayment plan. For each of the selected credit programs, appendix III shows the intended purposes identified by those programs and their respective agencies and examples of related goals and performance measures the programs established in their fiscal year 1998 budget presentations.", "In some cases, the programs\u2019 goals or performance measures addressed intermediate results that the programs expected to lead to an intended purpose. For example, the performance measure that VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program established to monitor its performance in achieving its intended purpose of helping veterans purchase homes was the percentage of respondents to VA\u2019s Lender Customer Satisfaction Survey who say they are satisfied with their overall interaction with VA. According to VA, \u201cmaximizing lender satisfaction with their dealings with VA employees . . . will encourage lenders to participate in the program, expanding financing opportunities for veterans.\u201d In this way, the intermediate result of increasing lender satisfaction could be expected to contribute to helping veterans and active duty personnel purchase homes.", "Similarly, Education\u2019s direct student loan program established as performance measures the rate of (1) institutional (i.e., school) participation; (2) overall satisfaction of schools with the direct student loan program; and (3) institutional retention in the program. The program uses schools as the vehicles for providing loans to students and their families. By providing a streamlined loan delivery system, the program expects to attract schools to participate in the program. Further, by satisfying participating schools, the program expects to encourage those schools to stay as participants in the program. Thus, increases in schools\u2019 participation, satisfaction, and retention in the program are intermediate results that the program expects will lead to broader student access to capital for postsecondary education.", "Some of the selected programs established a range of measures to provide a more complete picture of particular aspects of their performance related to their intended purposes. For example, VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program established two performance measures for monitoring the timeliness of issuing a certificate of eligibility, which is related to its intended purpose of treating all veterans in a timely manner. These measures were (1) the percentage of veterans responding to a VA veteran survey who say they are satisfied with the time it takes VA to certify veterans\u2019 eligibility for a home loan; and (2) the average time VA calculated it took to issue a certificate of eligibility, which is to supplement the survey data. Similarly, Education established several performance measures for assessing its guaranteed and direct student loan programs\u2019 performance toward successfully managing the programs in a cost-effective manner. These measures included the programs\u2019 lifetime gross dollar default rates; lifetime net default rates (i.e., loss rate); annual delinquency rates; per unit administrative costs; and the annual collection rates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Credit Programs Set Fiscal Year 1998 Targets for Most of Their Measures", "paragraphs": ["The Results Act defines a performance goal as the target level of performance expressed as a tangible, measurable objective against which achievement is to be compared. Thus, annual performance goals should consist of two parts: (1) the performance measure that represents the specific characteristic of the program that the program uses to gauge its performance and (2) the annual target level of performance to be achieved during a given fiscal year for the measure. The Results Act also requires each agency to report to the President and Congress annually, beginning for fiscal year 1999, on the degree to which the agency is meeting its annual performance goals. Thus, under the Act, an agency is to monitor and report on its actual performance during the year compared to the targets it had established for its performance measures for that year.", "As shown in table 1, we found that the selected programs set fiscal year 1998 targets for most of their respective measures. These included measures for which the programs either (1) set fiscal year 1998 target levels of performance; or (2) reported prior year baseline data for those measures and indicated how performance on those measures was to change (i.e., increase or decrease) in fiscal year 1998 relative to their baselines. Thus, if the selected programs collect accurate corresponding data on their actual performance, they should be able to monitor their progress in achieving desired results on those measures and have fiscal year 1998 baseline data to use in setting future targets for those measures. For example, one of the fiscal year 1998 performance goals set by Education\u2019s guaranteed student loan program is that the \u201cLevel of [overall school] satisfaction will meet or exceed the level of school satisfaction measured last year,  67 percent of the schools reported satisfaction.\u201d However, for other measures, the program did not set targets that could be used to monitor their progress on those measures. For example, Education\u2019s guaranteed student loan program did not establish a fiscal year 1998 target for its annual delinquency rate measure. The program reported that this measure will provide information on the dollar amount of loans \u201cpast due\u201d as a percentage of dollars in repayment and that baseline data for the measure will be developed as the definition of \u201cpast due\u201d is finalized."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Credit Programs Have Been Facing Three General Challenges to Developing Performance Information", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of agency officials\u2019 responses to questions on developing performance information for the selected programs, we identified three general challenges those programs have been facing: (1) a struggle in reaching consensus among stakeholders on the programs\u2019 intended purposes, performance measures, and target levels of performance; (2) difficulty in separating the effects of external forces from program influences on results; and (3) a lack of relevant program performance and financial baseline data.

However, our past and current work also has shown that although it is difficult to get stakeholders to reach agreement, stakeholder involvement can help an agency identify results-oriented performance measures and set realistic target levels. For example, VA officials said that they had difficulty reaching consensus with internal program stakeholders at the agency\u2019s field offices. This difficulty concerned how the activities of the field offices would be linked to achieving the intended results of VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program as established by headquarters staff. To address this difficulty, VA headquarters and field office staff worked together to develop the program\u2019s performance measures. They said the program then brought together key VA headquarters and field managers to reach agreement on target performance levels for linking field office activities to the intended results of the program.", "VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program also struggled with trying to reach consensus with OMB. According to a VA official, OMB suggested that the program establish \u201coutcome-oriented\u201d performance measures, where feasible, which could provide data on the extent to which the program is helping veterans achieve a higher rate of homeownership. However, VA officials said that the program is an entitlement program (i.e., veterans receive the benefit regardless of need as a reward for their service); and it is not clear whether increasing homeownership among veterans is a primary intended purpose of the program. According to the officials, the more appropriate performance measures for assessing the program\u2019s performance and holding it accountable are those for monitoring how well VA is delivering the benefit (e.g., satisfying veterans and keeping program costs down).", "To address OMB\u2019s suggestion, the program established a homeownership assistance measure in its fiscal year 1998 budget presentation, which is to provide data on the percentage of veterans surveyed who said they would not have been able to purchase any home or would have had to purchase a less expensive home without a VA guaranteed loan. However, the program did not identify the homeownership assistance measure as a performance measure. Instead, the program identified this measure as a measure of workload and other program data, which a VA official said was to provide \u201ccontextual program information,\u201d rather than information for gauging the program\u2019s progress in achieving its intended purposes and holding the program accountable. The VA official added that the homeownership assistance measure is an \u201cimperfect measure\u201d because of its reliance on self-reporting by veterans.", "Similarly, at the time of our interviews with USDA officials, they said internal stakeholders were grappling with what the appropriate results for their SFH loan programs were. According to those officials, the struggle of trying to reach consensus among those stakeholders contributed to why they rated as a significantly challenging activity \u201cdeveloping measures for assessing the net effect of the program.\u201d One agency official said that the programs\u2019 intended purposes were \u201cputting people [who are unable to get credit from other sources] in homes\u201d; thus, to the extent that they put such borrowers in homes, the programs are having a net impact. However, another agency official suggested that the programs\u2019 intended purposes also should include \u201cimproving the quality of life among rural residents\u201d and \u201cimproving housing conditions and the economy in a given community or state.\u201d He said that measures for gauging the programs\u2019 progress toward such purposes would attempt to collect data on, for example, the extent to which putting people in homes is improving the quality of life among rural residents.", "USDA officials also said it is difficult to balance stakeholders\u2019 interests. They said that they are expected to increase program service while also reducing program costs and minimizing default rates. However, they said this is difficult because the SFH programs were designed to offer credit to a population that the private sector would consider high risk. Specifically, to be eligible for a SFH direct loan, a borrower must have a family income that is \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow\u201d (i.e., a family income under 80 percent of the median income in the area); and the borrower must be unable to get credit from any other source. Therefore, the program\u2019s target population may be more likely to default. At the time of our review, USDA, VA, and Education were working with stakeholders in and outside of the selected programs, including OMB and Congress, to reach consensus with those stakeholders on the most appropriate goals and measures for the programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Difficulty in Separating the Effects of External Forces From Program Influences on Results", "paragraphs": ["The efforts of federal agencies often are but one factor among many that may influence whether, and the degree to which, their programs achieve their intended results. Our past and current work has found that many agencies have been challenged to separate out the influence that their program activities have had on the achievement of program results when those results also could have been influenced by external forces.", "Agency officials from all five of the selected credit programs reported as a significantly challenging activity \u201cseparating the impact of the credit programs\u2019 activities from the impact of other factors external to those programs but contributing to the results achieved.\u201d They generally cited economic trends; the role of third parties in helping the programs provide loans; and the existence of other federal financial aid programs (e.g., grants) as examples of forces external to their programs that can affect program results.", "For example, the foreclosure rate could be viewed as a measure related to the VA Loan Guaranty Program\u2019s intended purpose of helping veterans and active duty personnel retain homes. However, VA reported that external forces, such as interest rates, unemployment, and the general state of the economy, can influence the foreclosure rate. A VA official said that because of such external forces, it has been difficult to confidently attribute a change in the foreclosure rate to the program\u2019s activities and thus view it as a valid measure of the program\u2019s performance.", "VA officials said that the program attempted to address this problem in 1993 but was not successful. Specifically, a VA program official said that at the encouragement of OMB, the program attempted to develop a model to help the program estimate its foreclosure rate and monitor its performance. However, he said when the program implemented the model, it significantly overestimated the number of VA foreclosures and thus was not an adequate model for determining the external forces that could affect the rate. The VA official said that because of the many external forces that could affect the number of foreclosures, it was unclear if the model could be adjusted to help it adequately predict foreclosures and whether\u2014given the cost of potentially making many adjustments to the model\u2014the value of doing this was worth the additional cost. Therefore, the program took another approach. The program established a surrogate measure, the FATS ratio (which, as mentioned earlier, is to provide data on the extent to which foreclosures would have been greater had VA not pursued alternatives to foreclosure), for monitoring its performance in assisting veterans to avoid foreclosures. The program views the FATS ratio as a more valid measure than the foreclosure rate for assessing the program\u2019s performance in helping veterans and active duty personnel retain homes.", "USDA officials also said that separating the impact of their SFH guaranteed and direct loan programs\u2019 activities from the impact of other external forces on, for example, the quality of life for rural residents is exceedingly difficult. These officials said that the quality of rural residents\u2019 lives could be affected negatively by other, unrelated events, such as borrowers\u2019 incurring health problems or financial hardship, or the closing of a military base eliminating jobs in the area. They said that although providing single-family housing loans may help to improve the quality of life among those rural residents, such improvement could also be due to other external forces, such as home loans being provided by other federal housing loan programs (e.g., programs administered by VA or the Department of Housing and Urban Development).", "Similarly, Education officials told us that loans that are issued or guaranteed through their agency\u2019s direct or guaranteed student loan programs are among several types of financial aid that Education offers to help ensure access to postsecondary education. They said that students\u2019 college participation and completion rates can be affected by borrowers\u2019 eligibility for loans through the direct or guaranteed loan programs as well as by such external forces as the eligibility of borrowers for the other types of financial aid assistance provided by Education (e.g., grants); the extent of parental support for the borrowers attending school; and the borrowers having to financially support a family. Although Education established student participation and completion rates as performance measures, it did so to monitor the combined performance of its financial aid programs instead of the specific performance of either the direct or guaranteed student loan programs on those results.", "Education officials said that an approach the agency was taking to better understand the determinants of college enrollment\u2014including financial aid obtained through direct loans, guaranteed loans, grants, or other financial aid programs\u2014was contracting for a study of the effects of financial aid, including aid provided by these programs, and various external forces on this result. According to an Education official, this study is expected to be completed in early 1998. We believe the findings from this study may help to inform any future program evaluations assessing the impact of Education\u2019s financial aid programs on results compared to the impact of external forces. In a prior report, we discussed how impact evaluations can help an agency confidently attribute the achievement of intended results to one or more of its programs by providing information on the extent to which those programs contributed to the results achieved relative to the impact of external forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Relevant Baseline Data", "paragraphs": ["As we reported in June 1997, our prior work has shown that baseline and trend data on past performance can help agencies set realistic target levels of performance for their programs given the past performance of those programs. However, we also noted that because agencies often did not focus on having results-oriented performance information in the past, they generally have not collected such data. Thus, they have not had all of the baseline and trend data they believed they needed to set goals. Further, credit agencies, including VA, USDA, and Education, generally have had difficulty producing reliable performance data, particularly financial data, which executive and legislative branch decisionmakers need to make well-informed decisions.", "Agency officials from all five of the credit programs said that a lack of baseline data was why they rated one or more of the following activities as significantly challenging: \u201cdeveloping objective, quantifiable, and measurable annual program performance goals\u201d; \u201cdetermining a realistic target level of performance\u201d; \u201cdeveloping unit cost information for the programs\u2019 outputs\u201d; and \u201cdeveloping unit cost information for the programs\u2019 outcomes.\u201d For example, VA officials said that some of their performance measures for their Loan Guaranty Program were new, and baseline data were thus not available on those measures. Consequently, VA did not have data on past performance to use in setting some of the program\u2019s fiscal year 1998 target levels of performance and reported that those targets were \u201cto be determined.\u201d", "Education officials also attributed the challenges they had in determining realistic target levels of performance for Education\u2019s direct student loan program to a lack of baseline data. According to those officials, the program had not been in existence long enough to have historical data on many of the program\u2019s measures to use in setting fiscal year 1998 targets. They said that a lack of historical data for the direct loan program was a particular problem in terms of predicting borrower repayment behavior, since few borrowers had yet entered the repayment phase. Thus, to set the target for the program\u2019s default rate measure, Education used historical data for the same measure established for Education\u2019s guaranteed student loan program.", "Similarly, USDA officials said the agency\u2019s SFH programs did not have information systems to collect data on some performance measures, such as the number of loans made in targeted geographic areas. Thus, according to those officials, the programs did not have an informed basis on which to set fiscal year 1998 target levels of performance for those measures and did not include them in their fiscal year 1998 budget submission to OMB. Rather, the program included substitute measures for which the programs had information systems in place to collect the data (e.g., the number of rural families with improved or more suitable housing conditions)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Lack of Reliable Financial Data", "paragraphs": ["Our prior and ongoing work and that of agencies\u2019 internal or independent auditors have found that some credit agencies still have difficulty, despite numerous years of experience, in producing reliable financial data, such as credit programs\u2019 subsidy rates\u2014the estimated cost to the government from direct loans and loan guarantees. For example, USDA and Education received a disclaimer of an opinion from internal and independent auditors, respectively, on their fiscal year 1996 financial statements. In part, this was due to those agencies not being able to provide the data needed to (1) accurately reflect the cost to the government and (2) permit appropriate cost comparisons between credit and noncredit programs.", "VA received an unqualified opinion on its fiscal year 1996 financial statements from VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General (OIG). However, the OIG audit, which included a review of the Loan Guaranty Program, found that the program did not reliably accumulate the financial information needed to comply with federal financial accounting standards, identified significant errors that required financial statement adjustments, and identified other errors where data compiled manually did not always reconcile with original source amounts.", "If successfully implemented, the CFO Act will help credit agencies resolve long-standing problems with data reliability. Further, in passing the Results Act, Congress emphasized that the usefulness of agencies\u2019 performance data depends, to a large degree, on the reliability of those data. Therefore, the Results Act requires agencies to describe in their annual performance plans the means to be used to verify and validate performance data. We have suggested in prior reports that such information, including information about the reliability of credit agencies\u2019 performance data, could be equally important for those agencies to disclose in their reports to ensure report users of the quality of that data.", "One area in particular need of attention is the development of reliable financial information on the full cost and unit cost of a program, which is an integral part of measuring that program\u2019s efficiency and cost effectiveness. An essential step in developing such information is the identification of individual program costs, such as direct labor. In that regard, unit cost information can be particularly useful in identifying trends and determining key cost drivers of the program. Agency officials from all five of the credit programs we reviewed said they have been challenged to develop unit cost information for the programs\u2019 outputs and outcomes. They generally cited difficulties in allocating basic cost data to specific programs as a reason for this challenge. For example, USDA officials explained that its field offices are involved in administering the SFH direct and guaranteed loan programs as well as other USDA programs. They said difficulties in separating data on labor costs for the various programs, for example, have contributed to the challenge they have faced in developing unit costs for the SFH programs.", "Similarly, VA officials said that developing meaningful unit cost information for the Loan Guaranty Program has been a significantly challenging activity due to the lack of an adequate methodology, including VA\u2019s inability to separate the data on the actual costs for the program, such as labor costs, from the costs for the several other programs that VA field offices administer. A VA official said that because of the difficulty it has had in isolating program cost data, the program uses a \u201cvery loose\u201d process to calculate unit costs, which involves dividing the various resource levels authorized for the program, such as staffing levels (i.e., authorized full-time equivalents) by the activity level during the year (e.g., number of loans guaranteed).", "New accounting standards developed by the Federal Accounting Standards Advisory Board (FASAB) require federal agencies subject to the CFO Act and Results Act to collect relevant and reliable data on the full costs of carrying out a mission or producing products or services. Although these standards were scheduled to be effective for all federal programs beginning with fiscal year 1997, because of serious shortfalls in agencies\u2019 cost accounting systems, FASAB extended the date by 1 year to fiscal year 1998. The standards took effect on October 1, 1997. Credit agency officials said their respective agencies were establishing information systems to collect needed cost data. Specifically, VA officials said their agency was looking at the use of activity-based costing (ABC) to develop more meaningful unit cost information. According to an Education official, his agency also is developing a system that should be able to provide at least some data on unit costs by 1999.

Measures in this area include total receivables; total delinquent debt; default rates; actual versus projected subsidy rates; and administrative costs, such as the costs of extending credit and servicing loans. (2) Program performance in achieving desired loan characteristics. Measures in this area include the percentage of loans going to borrowers who would otherwise not have access to private credit and the percentage of borrowers pleased with the timeliness and quality of credit program service.

Thus, these officials questioned whether a common programmatic measure proposed by the task force, \u201cpercent of loans or guarantees originated going to borrowers who would otherwise not have access to private credit,\u201d was meaningful for their programs. As mentioned earlier, to be eligible for a USDA SFH direct loan, a borrower must have a family income that is \u201cvery low\u201d to \u201clow,\u201d and the borrower must be unable to get credit from any other source. A USDA official said that the target and result for this proposed measure would always be 100 percent; thus, he also questioned whether the measure was meaningful for that program.", "In addition, for certain measures, officials in some credit agencies questioned whether the data collected would be appropriate to use in making comparisons among different credit programs\u2019 performance results, such as the programs\u2019 default rate, because the financial characteristics of borrowers for each program may be different. For example, USDA officials said that because the borrower must be unable to obtain private credit, the program\u2019s target population may be more likely to default. Thus, according to USDA officials, it may be inappropriate to compare, for example, the actual default rate of the SFH direct loan program with the actual default rate of the VA Loan Guaranty Program, which is an entitlement program.", "We agree that common measures need to be carefully explained to help ensure that significant program differences are properly interpreted. However, it is not clear that such differences outweigh the potential usefulness of common measures. Credit agencies have generally agreed with our suggestion that they provide explanatory information where necessary in agency reports to portray program differences more appropriately and help users of performance information understand the reported performance.", "Also related to the problem of comparable data, we recently reported that agencies\u2019 use of inconsistent definitions for their programs\u2019 measures could hamper decisionmakers\u2019 use of data collected from those measures in planning, comparing performance, and reporting on performance achieved. Our June 1997 report noted that some credit agencies differ in how they classify previously delinquent debt on which borrowers are currently making payments. Some reclassify such debt as \u201ccurrent,\u201d but others keep it in a delinquent category regardless of the current payment status. Although such classification practices may be suitable within an agency, they make it difficult to compare agency performance or aggregate data for similar programs. For example, VA loans maintain their delinquent status until the delinquency is repaid or written off. Conversely, a home loan program within HUD reclassified single-family delinquent loans to a current repayment status when borrowers complied with forbearance terms, which typically included making partial mortgage payments for up to 3 years. In our June report, we recommended that the Department of the Treasury\u2019s Financial Management Service work with major credit agencies and OMB to help those agencies consistently report on delinquent debt or disclose their inconsistencies. Treasury, OMB, and the major credit agencies generally agreed with that recommendation, and the agencies commented that consistent application of governmentwide debt collection reporting criteria is essential.", "Similarly, we observed that when consistent definitions do not exist among credit programs, it is difficult to know whether results reported would be readily comparable. For example, one of the common programmatic measures proposed by the task force for monitoring loan characteristics was the \u201cpercent of borrowers who are pleased with the timeliness and quality of credit program service.\u201d However, for this proposed task force measure, it is unclear what is meant by \u201ctimeliness\u201d and \u201cquality\u201d of service, because each credit program may have a different interpretation. Education\u2019s guaranteed and direct student loan programs, for example, established a broad measure of \u201coverall borrower satisfaction\u201d; VA\u2019s Loan Guaranty Program established more specific borrower satisfaction measures\u2014the percent of respondents surveyed who will say (1) they are satisfied with their contact with VA; (2) they are satisfied with the time it took to obtain a Certificate of Eligibility; and (3) their loan did not take longer to process than expected as a result of a delay blamed on VA (which is to help the program monitor when program staff may need to work with the lender in identifying reasons for the delay in loan processing time, toward improving performance on this measure). Thus, it is unclear whether the data collected would be comparable if this proposed measure of the task force were used by all credit programs.", "The Working Group anticipated that agencies that administer credit programs could include common financial and programmatic measures in their annual performance plans and reports under the Results Act.

A rural development official later provided minor technical suggestions, which we included in the report as appropriate. Similarly, on December 19, 1997, the liaison to GAO from the Department of Education also said the Department concurred with the draft report\u2019s general findings and later provided minor technical suggestions, which we included in the report as appropriate.", "On January 8, 1998, the VA liaison to GAO said the Department also generally agreed with the draft report\u2019s factual material, conclusions, and recommendations, except for that part of the recommendation requiring credit agencies to include a discussion about common measures in their fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans. This comment was consistent with the comment provided to us on January 6, 1998, by a representative of VA\u2019s Performance Analysis Service within VA\u2019s Office of Budget. Specifically, that representative told us that VA would not likely have time to provide a meaningful discussion about common measures in its fiscal year 1999 plan because VA (1) had yet to achieve consensus among major stakeholders on the common measures, (2) had not done the analysis necessary to provide the discussion about common performance measures that our draft report recommended, and (3) is to submit the agency\u2019s fiscal year 1999 performance plan to Congress within the next few weeks. OMB officials had a similar comment on the feasibility of requiring a discussion about common measures in credit agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance plans, which we discuss later in this section.", "In response to this comment from both VA and OMB officials, we removed from the recommendation our suggestion that such a discussion be included in credit agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans.

However, those officials cautioned that based on OMB\u2019s experiences in working with major credit agencies to draft their fiscal year 1999 performance plans and to identify appropriate, results-oriented common performance measures for credit programs, developing and reaching consensus on credit program performance measures will continue to be difficult, time-consuming, and iterative. They said that those experiences and OMB\u2019s review of major credit agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 performance plans suggested to them that the priority of those agencies at this point in the implementation of the Results Act needs to be on ensuring the quality of the performance goals and measures for their individual credit programs. According to these OMB officials, in developing program-specific as well as common performance measures for credit programs, major credit agencies need to continue working to reach consensus among the key stakeholders of the agencies\u2019 credit programs and to develop information systems for collecting needed performance data, which will be challenging. Moreover, the OMB officials said that agencies are concluding the preparation of their fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans that will accompany the President\u2019s budget submission to Congress in February 1998. The officials said that those plans reflect budget, policy, and programmatic decisions already made in the course of preparing the budget.

OMB\u2019s Senior Advisor for Cash and Credit Management suggested that as the Working Group\u2019s efforts advance, two common results-oriented performance measures that may be considered appropriate for agencies that administer credit programs are (1) the number of loans a program made that are repaid successfully and (2) the percentage of customers satisfied with the program. However, he said that developing measures that would help isolate a credit program\u2019s contribution to achieving a particular common result from the contribution of external factors may not be possible for all credit programs. The OMB officials also noted that performance information is just one key factor among many that will go into decisionmaking on management and budget policy issues.", "The OMB officials told us that OMB will ensure in calendar year 1998 that developing common results-oriented performance measures across credit programs is a priority agenda item for discussions among the Working Group members.

The first strategic plans that the Act required agencies to develop were to be completed by September 30, 1997.", "Also, the act requires each agency to submit to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), beginning for fiscal year 1999, an annual performance plan. The first annual performance plans were to be submitted to OMB in the fall of 1997. The annual performance plan is to provide the direct linkage between the strategic goals outlined in the agency\u2019s strategic plan and what managers and employees do day to day. In essence, this plan is to contain the annual performance goals the agency will use to gauge its progress toward accomplishing its strategic goals and identify the performance measures the agency will use to assess its progress. Also, OMB will use individual agencies\u2019 performance plans to develop an overall federal government performance plan that OMB is to submit annually to Congress with the president\u2019s budget, beginning for fiscal year 1999.", "The Results Act also requires that each agency submit an annual report to the president and to the appropriate authorization and appropriations committees of Congress on program performance for the previous fiscal year (copies are to be provided to other congressional committees and to the public upon request). The first of these reports, on program performance for fiscal year 1999, is due by March 31, 2000; and subsequent reports are due by March 31 for the years that follow. However, for fiscal years 2000 and 2001, agencies\u2019 reports are to include performance data beginning with fiscal year 1999. For each subsequent year, agencies are to include performance data for the year covered by the report and 3 prior years.", "Finally, in crafting the Results Act, Congress recognized that managerial accountability for results is linked to managers having sufficient flexibility, discretion, and authority to accomplish desired results. The Act authorizes agencies to apply for managerial flexibility waivers in their annual performance plans beginning with fiscal year 1999. The authority of agencies to request waivers of administrative procedural requirements and controls is intended to provide federal managers with more flexibility to structure agency systems to better support program goals. The nonstatutory requirements that OMB can waive under the Results Act generally involve the allocation and use of resources, such as restrictions on shifting funds among items within a budget account. Agencies must report in their annual performance reports on the use and effectiveness of any managerial flexibility waivers that they receive."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["Our first objective was to identify goals and measures established by the selected credit programs that related to the programs\u2019 intended purposes and determine whether the programs had set target levels of performance for assessing their progress in achieving their desired results. Under the Results Act, target levels of performance are to enable a comparison of planned versus actual results achieved for a given year. Our second objective was to identify the challenges agency officials cited in developing performance information, including goals and measures, for the selected programs and any approaches those programs were taking to address those challenges. Our third objective was to describe the status of the Working Group\u2019s effort to develop common performance measures for federal credit programs.", "For our review, we selected a nonrandom, purposive sample of five federal credit programs at three agencies. These programs were the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 Loan Guaranty Program; the Department of Education\u2019s William D. Ford Direct Loan Program and its Federal Family Education Loan Program (referred to in this report as Education\u2019s direct and guaranteed student loan programs, respectively); and the Department of Agriculture\u2019s Single-Family Housing (SFH) direct loan program and guaranteed loan program. We selected for our review credit programs that varied in terms of type of program (e.g., housing and education loans); mode of credit delivery (e.g., direct and guaranteed loans); and program size as measured by the amount of outstanding loans. According to data reported by OMB in the fiscal year 1998 budget and agency data, of the total amount of federal credit outstanding in fiscal year 1996 for guaranteed loans ($805 billion) and direct loans ($165 billion), these five programs represented about 32 and 18 percent, respectively. The smallest and largest of the guaranteed loan programs accounted for slightly less than 1/2 percent and 19 percent, respectively, of the fiscal year 1996 credit outstanding in loan guarantees governmentwide. Similarly, the smallest and largest of the direct loan programs held 7 percent and 11 percent, respectively, of the fiscal year 1996 credit outstanding in direct loans governmentwide. Because of the small and nonrandom nature of our sample, our observations and analyses are not generalizable to other federal credit programs.", "To address the first part of our first objective (i.e., to identify goals and measures established by the selected credit programs that related to the programs\u2019 intended purposes), we compared goals and measures established by the programs as of May 1, 1997, to the programs\u2019 intended purposes as identified by those programs or their respective agencies.", "According to agency officials, these goals and measures were generally the same ones the programs submitted to OMB and Congress with their respective agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1998 budget presentations. The programs also were proposing to include these goals and measures for their agencies\u2019 fiscal year 1999 annual performance plans under the Results Act.", "To determine whether a goal or measure was related to a program\u2019s intended purposes, we reviewed available agency and credit program documentation for (1) a description of the program\u2019s intended purposes and (2) a discussion that reasonably related that particular goal or measure to the program\u2019s intended purposes. When agency documentation did not contain such a discussion, we examined the wording and considered the meaning of each program\u2019s goals and measures and compared them to the program\u2019s intended purposes to identify relationships between them. We also interviewed agency officials about the programs\u2019 intended purposes and asked those officials to comment on the relationships we identified between the programs goals and measures and intended purposes.", "To address the second part of our first objective (i.e., to determine whether the selected programs set fiscal year 1998 target levels of performance for assessing their progress in achieving desired results), we identified those measures for which the programs had either (1) identified fiscal year 1998 targets or (2) reported prior year baseline data on those measures and indicated how performance on those measures was to change (i.e., increase or decrease) in fiscal year 1998 relative to the baseline. Our review did not address the reasonableness of the processes or methods the programs used to determine how to assess progress or establish target levels toward achieving the programs\u2019 intended purposes; determine whether other, more appropriate, measures existed; or evaluate the feasibility of the targets the programs established.", "To address the first part of our second objective (i.e., to identify the challenges agency officials cited facing in developing performance information for the selected programs), we developed a data collection instrument that listed 49 activities that we identified as being associated with developing performance information. Examples of these activities included \u201cdetermining a realistic target level of performance for annual performance goals\u201d and \u201cdeveloping measures for assessing the net effect of the program compared with what would have occurred in the absence of the program.\u201d To identify these activities, we referred to key steps and practices identified in our Executive Guide: Effectively Implementing the Government Performance and Results Act and other work that we had under way assessing the challenges agencies were facing in implementing performance measurement.", "We sent the instrument to agency officials responsible for and involved in the development of goals and measures for the selected programs and asked those officials to rate, using a five-point scale from \u201clittle or no\u201d challenge to a \u201cvery great\u201d challenge, how great a challenge each of the 49 activities was to perform for those programs. Officials also could indicate that they had not engaged in a particular activity. For purposes of this report, we refer to activities that any of the agency officials rated as a \u201cgreat\u201d or \u201cvery great\u201d challenge as significantly challenging activities. We then interviewed those officials to discuss why they rated certain activities as significantly challenging. We analyzed their responses and related documentation to identify general challenges that led officials to report those activities as significantly challenging for the selected programs.", "To address the second part of our second objective (i.e., to identify any approaches that the selected programs were taking to address the challenges they identified to developing performance information), we interviewed the agency officials who responded to our data collection instrument to obtain information on the approaches they were taking to address those activities they had identified as significantly challenging and analyzed agency documentation. We also asked these officials to comment on the way in which we described the approaches the programs were taking to address the challenges in developing performance information that they had identified. We also considered prior and ongoing work we have done on the efforts of VA, Education, USDA, and other credit agencies to implement various credit and financial management reforms.", "To address our third objective (i.e., to describe the status of the Working Group\u2019s effort to develop common performance measures for federal credit programs), we reviewed various documentation from OMB and members of the Working Group that described its effort to develop common performance measures for credit programs and the views of agency officials on those measures. We also talked to OMB officials and members of the Working Group, including agency officials at those agencies administering the programs we selected for our review, to obtain their views on the common performance measures proposed.
