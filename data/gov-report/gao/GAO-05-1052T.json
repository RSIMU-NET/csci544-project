Those who are seriously injured require comprehensive health care services and may be treated at either DOD or VA medical facilities. Because VA is expected to provide health care to many of the injured OIF and OEF servicemembers, concerns have been raised about the ease with which these individuals and their health care information transition from DOD's to VA's health care system. This statement is based on GAO's preliminary work on \"seamless transition\" and focuses on (1) the policies and outreach efforts that VA has instituted to provide timely access to health care to OIF and OEF servicemembers and (2) the extent to which individually identifiable health information is shared systematically between DOD and VA.

Most notably, VA assigned VA social workers to selected military treatment facilities in August 2003, directed VA facilities to designate combat case managers in October 2003, and directed the establishment of four VA polytrauma centers for OIF and OEF servicemembers in June 2005. In January 2005, VA established the Seamless Transition Office to further improve coordination within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the Veterans Health Administration as well as between DOD and VA. In addition, VA has increased outreach efforts by providing OIF and OEF servicemembers who have been discharged with personal letters and newsletters, a Web site for health information tailored to OIF and OEF servicemembers, counseling services, and briefings on available VA health care services. GAO is in the beginning stages of reviewing VA's efforts to provide a smooth transition from DOD health care and has not yet evaluated the effectiveness of VA's related policies, procedures, and outreach initiatives. An important issue associated with transitioning servicemembers to VA health care is the sharing of health care information between DOD and VA. The two departments have signed a memorandum of understanding for sharing individually identifiable health information, but the memorandum does not specify the particular types of individually identifiable health information that will be exchanged and when the information will be shared. The absence of specific procedures continues to hinder VA's efforts to obtain needed health information from DOD. Recently, DOD has begun to share certain health assessment information with VA on individuals who have been discharged from the military, and the transmitting of this information to VA on a routine basis is expected to occur in October 2005.

Of these, over 100,000 have sought health care  services from VA, including over 2,400 who received inpatient care at VA  medical centers. The Reserves and National Guard account for about  54,000 of those servicemembers who sought health care services from VA.  The three most common health problems have been musculoskeletal  ailments (primarily joint and back disorders), dental problems, and mental  health disorders.", "Servicemembers injured during OIF and OEF are surviving injuries that  would have been fatal in past conflicts. In World War II, 30 percent of  Americans injured in combat died; this proportion dropped to 24 percent  for those injured in the Vietnam War and further dropped to about   10 percent for those injured in OIF and OEF. Many of the injured OIF and  OEF servicemembers are returning with severe disabilities, including  traumatic brain injuries and missing limbs.", "About 65 percent of OIF and OEF combat injuries are from improvised  explosive devices, blasts, landmines, and fragments. Of those injured  personnel, about 60 percent have some degree of traumatic brain injury  and may require comprehensive inpatient rehabilitation services to  address complex cognitive, physical, and mental health issues resulting  from trauma. Traumatic brain injuries may cause problems with cognition  (concentration, memory, judgment, and mood), movement (strength,  coordination, and balance), sensation (tactile sensation and vision), and  emotion (instability and impulsivity). The Department of Health and  Human Services\u2019 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports that  an estimated 15 percent of persons who sustain a mild brain injury  continue to experience symptoms 1 year after injury.", "Initially, most severely injured servicemembers, including Reserve and  National Guard members, are brought to Landstuhl Regional Medical  Center in Germany for treatment. From there, they are transported to  appropriate U.S. military medical facilities, with most of the seriously  injured admitted to Walter Reed Army Medical Center or the National  Naval Medical Center, both located in the Washington, D.C., area. Once  these servicemembers are medically stabilized, many are relocated closer  to their homes or military commands and continue recovering either on an  inpatient or outpatient basis at a VA medical facility, a DOD military  treatment facility (MTF), or DOD civilian provider.", "Those who have served, or are now serving, in OIF and OEF may receive  care from VA for conditions that are or may be related to their combat  services for a 2-year period following the date of their separation from  active duty without copayment requirements. Following this 2-year period,  they may continue to receive VA care but may be subject to a copayment  for their health care.", "To ensure that servicemembers engaged in conflicts receive the health  care services they need, Congress passed legislation in May 1982 that  authorized VA to provide medical services to members of the armed forces  during and immediately following wartime or national emergencies  involving the armed forces in armed conflict. The law authorized the  Secretary of VA to give servicemembers responding to or involved in a war  or national emergency a higher priority for medical services than all  veterans, except those with a service-connected disability. VA has  established an enrollment system to manage veterans\u2019 access to care. This  system includes eight priority categories for enrollment, with higher  priority given to veterans with service-connected disabilities, lower  incomes, or other recognized statuses such as former prisoners of war.", "Separation from the military and return to civilian life may entail the  exchange of individually identifiable health information between DOD and  VA.

Under this directive, these veterans are enrolled in the  lowest priority category for service-connected veterans.  In April 2003, when the President declared a national emergency with  respect to the conflict in Iraq, the Secretary of VA issued a memorandum  authorizing VA to give priority health care to servicemembers who  sustained an injury, over veterans and others eligible for VA care, except  those with service-connected disabilities.", "An October 2003 directive (1) provided instructions to VA employees for  determining the eligibility of recent combat veterans to be enrolled for VA  health care; (2) required each VA medical facility to designate a clinically  trained combat case manager, usually a social worker or nurse, to  coordinate all of the medical care and services provided to recent combat  veterans by VA and non-VA agencies until the veterans no longer need  care; and (3) required VA medical facilities to designate a point of  contact\u2014administrative staff, social worker, or nurse\u2014to receive and  expedite transfers of servicemembers from MTFs to VA medical facilities  and coordinate with VA\u2019s combat case managers.", "A June 2005 directive specified the dates of service and combat locations  to determine whether recent combat veterans are eligible for health care  services.", "Another June 2005 directive expanded the scope of care at VA\u2019s four  regional traumatic brain injury rehabilitation centers and redefined these  facilities as polytrauma rehabilitation centers.

The directive  states that coordination of care, including intensive clinical and social  work case management services, is essential in these severe trauma  cases, as patients transition from acute hospitalization through acute  rehabilitation and ultimately to their home communities.", "In addition to VA\u2019s directives, a joint DOD and VA program was  established in August 2003 to assign VA social workers to selected MTFs  to coordinate patient transfers between MTFs and VA medical facilities.  The social workers make appointments for care, ensure continuity of  therapy and medications, and followup with patients to verify success of  the discharge. By mid-July 2005, the social workers had received 3,907  requests for transfer of care\u2014almost two-thirds of them had been  transferred to VA facilities; the rest were pending. Further, VA benefits  counselors work with the social workers to inform servicemembers about  VA benefits and to initiate paperwork for disability compensation claims,  vocational rehabilitation and employment assistance, and other VA  benefits.", "Also in August 2003, VA created the Taskforce for the Seamless Transition  of Returning Service Members. The taskforce, composed of senior VA  leadership, focused on developing and implementing VA policies to  improve the transition of injured servicemembers to civilian life. In  January 2005, VA established the Seamless Transition Office to further  improve coordination within the Veterans Benefits Administration and the  Veterans Health Administration as well as between DOD and VA. The  goals of the Seamless Transition Office include improving communication,  coordination, and collaboration within VA and with DOD with respect to  health care; educating VA staff about veteran\u2019s health care and other  needs; and ensuring that policies and procedures are in place to enhance  the transition from servicemember to veteran.

VA has sent three newsletters since  December 2003, with information on benefits and health issues specific to  OIF and OEF veterans. In addition, the Secretary of VA sends these new  veterans a letter thanking them for their service to the country and  informing them about VA health care services and assistance to aid in their  transition to civilian life. The letter includes a toll-free number for  obtaining information on VA health care and two brochures on VA health  care as well as benefit information, including disability compensation,  education and training, vocational rehabilitation and employment, home  loans, and life insurance. In addition, the Secretary of VA has sent letters  to all the Adjutants General and Chiefs of the Reserves to inform them of  VA services and benefits.", "VA has also sought to improve access to health care information. It  created a Web site that provides information specific to those who served  in OIF and OEF, such as information on VA health and medical services;  dependents\u2019 benefits and services; transition assistance; and benefits for  active duty military, Reserve, and National Guard personnel.

Vet Centers function as community points of  access by providing information and referrals to VA medical facilities.  Additionally, they offer counseling, employment services, and a range of  social services to assist individuals in readjusting from wartime military  service to civilian life. VA reported that during 2004, it hired 50 peer  counselors and placed them at Vet Centers where significant numbers of  servicemembers were returning from OIF and OEF.

According to VA officials, if a list of these  individuals were transmitted routinely to VA, it would enable VA to  contact the individuals to make the appropriate transfer of health care to a  VA medical facility before the individuals are discharged from the military.  Such information could reduce the potential for interruption to these  individuals\u2019 health care treatment plans. DOD officials told us that they are  in the process of developing a policy directive that would establish  procedures for sharing information with VA on servicemembers who are  entering the PEB process, but they could not determine when this policy  directive would become effective.", "Recent progress in VA and DOD data sharing involves a health assessment  questionnaire that DOD requires servicemembers to complete following  deployment. This document contains, among other things, self-reported  information about a servicemember\u2019s potential exposure to toxic  substances and includes four questions that can be used to identify  individuals at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder. In July  2005, DOD transmitted to VA postdeployment health assessment data for  those individuals who have been discharged from the military. According  to VA officials, DOD is expected to transmit these data monthly beginning  in October 2005. For these individuals, VA clinicians will be able to access  the data through VA\u2019s computerized medical record system when the  individuals seek VA health care services. However, according to VA  officials, DOD is not providing health assessment information to VA for  Reserve and National Guard members, who comprise 35 percent of the  OIF and OEF forces.", "In addition to individual health information from the postdeployment  questionnaire, VA officials state that the agency could use aggregate data  from the questionnaire to plan for the needs of current servicemembers  who may one day be eligible for health care and benefits from VA. This is  consistent with an observation made by the President\u2019s task force that  comprehensive servicemember health data are essential for forecasting  and preparing for changes in the demand for health care services.
