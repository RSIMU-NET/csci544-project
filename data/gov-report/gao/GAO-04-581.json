Most of the 121 mentoring grantees that Education funded shared many characteristics--most had 5 years or more of experience mentoring youth, had similar goals, and offered \"one-to-one\" mentoring. All mentoring grantees listed in their applications that they had some elements of successful programs, but established grantees GAO visited reported fewer implementation challenges, such as problems recruiting mentors, than did newer grantees. Most of the 11 grantees GAO visited said they would benefit from learning about other implementation strategies through information sharing. However, Education has not facilitated information sharing among mentoring grantees, although it is considering doing so. Education used multiple methods to monitor grantees, including expenditure tracking, but the office responsible for monitoring mentoring grants did not review single audit reports as required by its guidance. Education's Chief Financial Officer reviewed the audits but did not forward audits to the office overseeing the mentoring grants because findings did not pertain to these new grants. However, GAO found that 8 percent of the mentoring grantees had audit findings related to how well they handled other Education grants. Education is currently assessing whether it will conduct an overall evaluation of its mentoring program. Education required that all grantees have evaluation plans, and most plan to report on youth outcomes related to academic achievement and attendance. However, grantees plan to use different methodologies, making it difficult for Education to have a cohesive picture of its mentoring program as a whole."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Children who have mentors are more likely to earn higher grades in  school, develop healthier social relationships, and are less likely to miss  school and initiate the use of drugs and alcohol compared with similar  children who do not have mentors, according to a 1995 study on  mentoring. In passing the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) of 2001, the  Congress sought to improve the outcomes of our nation\u2019s school age  children by authorizing a broad range of programs and services for them.  As part of this effort, the Congress authorized mentoring grants for  children who have the \u201cgreatest need.\u201d In establishing the student  mentoring program, the Congress authorized grants to organizations to  achieve one or more goals for participating children, including improved  academic outcomes; reduced incidence of school dropout, juvenile  delinquency, and alcohol and drug use; and lower involvement in gangs.  The Department of Education\u2019s (Education) Office of Safe and Drug Free  Schools (OSDFS), which administers the mentoring grant, funded   122 grantees for a 3-year period ending in 2004, at $17 million a year. The  average grant amount is about $140,000 each year. As the current wave of  mentoring funding is set to end, Congress has appropriated funding for  additional mentoring efforts. The fiscal year 2004 appropriation of about  $50 million is expected to fund about 200 new grantees and the last year of  the current wave of mentoring grantees.", "As part of our ongoing work on NCLBA implementation, you asked us to  provide you with information on school-based mentoring. In response, we  answered the following questions: (1) What are the basic elements,  policies, and procedures associated with successful mentoring programs?  (2) What are the key characteristics of NCLBA-funded mentoring efforts,  including the extent to which they have the basic elements, policies, and  procedures associated with successful mentoring programs? (3) How does  Education monitor program implementation? (4) What are Education\u2019s  and grantees\u2019 plans to assess program outcomes?", "To answer these questions, we reviewed the literature on the elements,  policies, and procedures associated with successful mentoring. For this  report, we are defining successful mentoring as those efforts that have the  elements needed to establish, operate, and sustain mentoring. We relied  heavily on a 2003 publication developed by an expert panel that described  the elements of effective mentoring and reviewed several studies upon  which the publication was based. We found that these studies generally  supported the elements identified in the 2003 publication. However, the  rigor of these studies varied, ranging from studies that included random  assignment of participants to control groups, to more descriptive case  studies. See appendix I for a list of studies that discuss the elements of  successful mentoring. We also reviewed the grant applications of the   121 mentoring grantees Education currently funds to determine the extent  to which the program descriptions contained in applications aligned with  the elements, policies, and procedures associated with successful  programs.", "To better understand how grantees implemented such elements, we visited  11 grantees. We selected these grantees to reflect a diversity of mentoring  approaches and geographic areas. Our initial work led us to explore  whether established and new grantees approached implementation  differently and whether lessons could be learned from their experiences.  As a result, we ensured that the 11 grantees we visited also included a  mixture of relatively new mentoring efforts\u20146 grantees with fewer than   5 years of experience mentoring youth and 5 established grantees that had  been operating for 5 years or more. We visited one grantee in California,  Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Illinois, Nebraska, New Mexico,   New York, Ohio, and Wisconsin.", "During our visits with grantee staff, we covered a range of topics,  including mentor recruitment, screening, and training; mentoring  approach; goals for youth; plans for evaluation; and Education\u2019s  monitoring of its programs. In most instances, we spoke with mentors  about their mentoring experiences and the kinds of support and training  they received. We also observed mentoring, noting the nature of the  interaction between mentors and youth, including the kinds of activities  and discussions that occurred between them.", "In addition, we reviewed Education\u2019s monitoring policies and procedures  and interviewed Education officials about how they monitor the mentoring  grantees. We also reviewed the monitoring documentation that Education  maintains on grantees and discussed Education\u2019s monitoring with the  grantees that we visited. Using the online Single Audit Act database, we  compiled summary reports of audit findings on all mentoring grantees that  had fiscal years 2001 and 2002 audits. Such audits contain information on a  grantees use of federal funds. Finally, we interviewed Education officials  about their plans for evaluating the mentoring program, and we reviewed  the evaluation plans of individual grantees. We conducted our work  between June 2003 and May 2004 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["According to a 1995 effectiveness study of the Big Brothers Big Sisters  Program, children who participated in this mentoring program achieved  higher grades in school, skipped school less frequently, developed closer  relationships with parents and peers, and were less likely to initiate the  use of drugs and alcohol than were similar children who were not enrolled  in the program.", "Mentoring is often defined as a sustained relationship between a youth and  an older person, typically an adult, in which the adult provides the younger  person with support, guidance, and assistance. Mentoring is based on the  premise that if young people have access to caring, concerned adults, they  will be more likely to become successful adults themselves. Historically,  mentoring has meant that one volunteer commits to mentoring one child  at a time. More recently, mentoring has moved beyond this traditional  relationship to encompass other formats, including group and e-mail  mentoring.", "Mentoring programs are established in many communities. Programs like  the Big Brothers Big Sisters Program, a national program operating in  every state, have a long history of mentoring neighborhood youth. In  community-based programs, youth are often referred for mentoring by  family members. Potential mentors often submit to extensive background  checks and trained mentors are often allowed to engage in unsupervised  activities with the youth. School-based mentoring, as its name implies,  takes place on school grounds. Given their location in the school, program  staff in school-based mentoring programs can easily meet with teachers.  Often teachers refer youth for mentoring whom they believe could benefit  from additional attention and guidance. In school-based mentoring  programs, volunteers typically meet with the youth during or after school  and their interactions are typically supervised. Mentors and youth can  spend time on schoolwork, but also engage in other activities, including  playing sports, attending a concert, reading, eating lunch together, or just  \u201changing out together.\u201d", "To improve the outcomes of our nation\u2019s school age children, Congress  passed NCLBA. Among other things, this act authorized 3-year grants for  student mentoring programs. NCLBA required that selected programs  serve children with the greatest need, that is, children most at risk of  failing school, dropping out of school, or being involved in criminal or  delinquent activity, as well as those lacking strong positive role models.", "NCLBA also authorized grants to entities to achieve one or more goals for  participating children, including improved academic achievement and  reduced delinquent behavior and involvement in gangs. (See table 1.)", "A number of types of organizations are eligible to receive funding under  the program, including local educational agencies, nonprofit, community- based organizations, and partnerships between a local educational agency  and a nonprofit, community-based organization. NCLBA requires that  applicants demonstrate that they meet a number of criteria, which  Education in turn required be detailed in their grant applications.", "Specifically, Education required applicants to demonstrate that mentors  would receive training and support and would be screened using  appropriate references and background checks. The agency also required  applicants to meet criteria that are not specifically outlined in NCLBA.   For example, the agency required that applicants outline how they  intended to achieve performance goals, such as improved academic  achievement among participating children, or reduced incidences of  involvement in gangs, illegal drugs, and alcohol. Grant recipients can use  the funding for activities to establish or implement a mentoring program.  For example, grants may use funds to hire mentor coordinators and  support staff; recruit, screen and train mentors; and disseminate recruiting  materials.", "In fiscal year 2002, Education awarded competitive grants to 122 grantees  from a pool of nearly 1,300 applicants. Education funded at least one  grantee in every state, with grant amounts ranging from about $39,000 to  nearly $500,000 in both fiscal years 2002 and 2003. (See app. II for a list of  grantees by state.) Funding for these grantees ends in fiscal year   2004; funding for the mentoring program over the 3 years will total about  $50 million. Congress has increased funding for fiscal year 2004. According  to Education, these funds will be used to fund an additional 200 grantees  and the last year of the current wave of mentoring grantees.", "Education has a number of responsibilities regarding administration and  oversight of the mentoring program. The agency oversees program  implementation, provides technical assistance, and disseminates  information on best practices. With respect to monitoring, Education, like  other federal agencies, is required as part of its monitoring responsibilities  to review grantees\u2019 single audit reports if they contain findings. The Single  Audit Act requires state and local governments and nonprofit  organizations that expend $300,000 or more in federal awards in a fiscal  year to have either a single audit or program-specific audit conducted for  that year. Audit findings from such reports can include problems such as  internal control weaknesses; material noncompliance with the provisions  of laws, regulations, or grant agreements; and fraud affecting a federal  award. Education receives a copy of the audit report if it contains findings  relevant to an Education program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Elements of Successful Mentoring Programs Are Planning, Management, Sustainability, and Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature we reviewed, prior to implementation,  successful mentoring programs make key decisions about which youth  they will serve and expected outcomes, how they will recruit mentors, and  how the program will be funded; put in place management structures, such  as screening, training, and recruitment policies and procedures to ensure  that the program is well-managed on a daily basis; market their programs  and pursue strategies to ensure long-term program viability; and evaluate  program outcomes and disseminate outcome information to key  stakeholders to further garner and sustain support for their programs.   (See fig. 1.)"], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Successful Student Mentoring Programs Develop Initial Plans for How Their Programs Will Be Designed and Operated", "paragraphs": ["According to the literature that we reviewed, successful student mentoring  programs engage in considerable planning prior to launching their efforts.  Such planning enables them to assess the need for the services they plan  to offer and to determine whether their organizations have the assets they  need to be successful. Pre-implementation planning can also help  programs determine the extent to which individuals or corporations may  be willing to invest in the programs.", "Successful mentoring programs make many decisions pertaining to  program design and operations as part of their early planning processes.  For example, decisions regarding program design may include how many  youth a program will serve, what kinds of services it will offer, where and  when mentoring will take place, the types of individuals to be recruited as  mentors, and expected outcomes. In addition, successful programs often  decide whether mentors will meet with youth individually or in groups.  Successful programs also determine what function mentors will serve,  such as whether they will offer academic support or help to socialize  youth."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful Student Mentoring Programs Ensure Policies and Procedures Are in Place to Sustain Daily Operations", "paragraphs": ["Research suggests that having policies and procedures in place to sustain  and support mentors and youth are critical elements of successful  mentoring programs. According to the literature, three elements are  particularly critical to the success of a mentor program: (1) mentor  screening, (2) orientation and training, and (3) support and supervision.", "First, screening procedures provide programs a basis for selecting those  adults who are most likely to be successful as mentors. Screening enables  programs to better predict how a potential mentor may interact with a  mentored youth, such as whether the potential mentor understands the  importance of being a caring adult. In addition, screening can help  determine whether the volunteer can commit enough time to the youth to  build a meaningful relationship. Screening can also help ensure the safety  of participating youth and can protect the program\u2019s reputation. When  screening mentors, many programs interview the potential mentors,  review personal references, and check police records.", "Second, research indicates that mentor orientation and training  experiences are critical to program success, although research has not  identified how much training is ideal or what topics such training should  cover. Mentor orientation and training experiences can help student  mentoring programs succeed in several ways. For example, orientation  and training experiences can prepare volunteers to successfully become  mentors and can help ensure that both youth and mentors understand  what their roles entail. In addition, orientation and training experiences  can help mentors understand what they can reasonably expect to  accomplish. Moreover, given that mentors often have very different  backgrounds from the youth they mentor, training can help mentors better  understand the youth and more effectively work toward building  relationships.", "Third, while training can prepare mentors for potential challenges,  successful programs also provide mentors with ongoing support, either  from professional staff or through mentor support groups. Such ongoing  support can help mentors continue to invest in their relationships with  youth so these relationships can survive and thrive. By supervising and  supporting mentor and youth matches, program staff can help ensure that  pairs meet regularly over a substantial period of time; such regular  interaction is critical to developing positive relationships between mentors  and youth. Research suggests that programs in which professional staff  provide regular support to volunteers are more likely to have mentor- youth matches that meet regularly. In addition, participants of such  programs are more likely to report being satisfied with their mentoring  relationships. In contrast, programs in which staff do not regularly contact  mentors report more \u201cfailed matches\u201d\u2014those that do not meet  consistently and, thus, do not develop into relationships."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Successful Student Mentoring Programs Market Their Programs and Develop Strategies to Ensure Long-term Operation", "paragraphs": ["Successful mentoring programs market themselves and establish  strategies to ensure long-term program viability, according to the  literature. Marketing and sustainability strategies can take several forms.  For example, programs may design resource development plans. Such  plans may help programs diversify their fundraising by establishing how  the programs will seek in-kind gifts, solicit funding from individuals and  corporate donors, and apply for government funding. In addition,  programs may try to garner private-sector support for mentoring by  encouraging leaders in the private sector to make it easier for their  employees to mentor youth. For example, program staff may encourage  company leaders to allow employees to take time off from work to mentor  youth.", "Marketing and program sustainability also includes public relations  efforts. For example, mentoring programs may develop partnerships and  collaborations with other organizations that support similar efforts to  improve youth outcomes.

Specifically, 81 percent of the grantees were well- established\u2014with 5 years or more experience operating mentoring  programs. For example, one grantee in Florida had mentored youth for  over 40 years. Conversely, 19 percent (23) of the grantees Education  funded were relatively new, with less than 5 years of experience. (See   fig. 2.)", "In addition, most of the grantees Education funded cited similar goals for  youth, reflecting the criteria identified in the application guidance,  according to our review of grant applications. Nearly all grantees had  goals related to improving academic achievement of participating youth  (96 percent) and reducing their involvement in harmful behaviors, such as  drug use and violence (87 percent). These goals were consistent with  those identified in NCBLA as goals of the mentoring program. (See   table 2.)", "About three-quarters of all grantees paired each youth to his or her own  mentor, while 3 percent of all grantees (3) mentored children exclusively  in groups, with 3 or 4 youth meeting at one time with a mentor. (See fig. 3.)  Around one-fifth of all grantees provided both individual and group  mentoring.", "About 70 percent of grantees listed in their grant applications that they  asked prospective mentors to commit to spending at least 1 hour per week  with their youth, and over 60 percent required a commitment of at least   1 school year. Other programs asked prospective mentors for a longer  commitment. For example, a Nebraska grantee we visited asked  prospective mentors to continue the mentoring relationships until the  youth had graduated from high school. A few grantees asked mentors to  commit less time than 1 hour a week. For example, one grantee we visited  in Illinois asked mentors to meet with their youth for 1 hour a month.  However, the mentors told us that they wanted to increase the frequency  of the meetings.", "Although there were many similarities among grantees, they did differ in  some respects, such as the number of youth they planned to serve, how  much funding was available to them, and which specific at-risk youth they  planned to serve. The number of youth grantees planned to serve in total  over the 3-year grant period ranged from 18 in Nebraska to a high of   3,200 youth in New Mexico, according to grantee applications. Grantee  award amounts varied from about $39,000 to nearly $500,000, with the  average grant amount about $140,000. Although all grantees served at-risk  youth, some targeted a specific group of at-risk youth. For example, one  grantee in Virginia targeted children of Vietnamese refugees, another  grantee in California targeted youth in foster care and residential group  homes, and a New York grantee targeted court-involved youth.", "Grantees also differed on the types of activities mentors and youth  participated in. During our visits, we observed a range of activities, some  focused on academics, such as tutoring or playing a game that promoted  literacy or math skills\u2014while other activities focused on building  relationships. Such activities included playing chess, playing basketball, or  just simply talking. In addition, some mentors told us that they engage  youth in cultural activities, such as attending a concert. Mentors also  reported participating in activities with their youths that supported the  youths\u2019 communities, such as planting bulbs at a local retirement home or  decorating a Christmas tree to be auctioned off at a local charity event.  (See fig. 4.)", "Many of these mentoring activities were carried out inside of the school,  such as in classrooms, the library, the gym, or in resource centers. Less  frequently, mentors met with youth in their community settings, such as in  a neighborhood church, community center, or public library."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "All Grantees Had Some Elements of Successful Programs, though in General More Established Grantees Reported Fewer Implementation Challenges than Newer Grantees", "paragraphs": ["According to grantee applications, all grantees had some of the key  elements of successful programs: initial plans for the program design and  operations, including for example the number and characteristics of youth  served; policies and procedures for program management such as mentor  screening and training; and program evaluation activities that include an  assessment of program outcomes. However, during our site visits, we  found that established grantees already had fairly well-defined programs,  having generally completed most aspects of the first two elements\u2014 planning and program management. Thus, these more established grantees  encountered fewer implementation challenges, such as problems  recruiting mentors, than did newer grantees. However, these established  grantees noted the challenges they had faced in starting up their programs  initially and the benefits they derived from talking with other more  experienced program staff to help them along.", "Many of the established grantees we visited often required little additional  planning for their mentoring grants. These grantees often used plans and  strategies already in place, such as what youth to serve, the types of  services to provide, and how to conduct mentor recruitment and training  activities. For example, staff from a well-established Florida grantee that  we visited told us they used the Education grant to continue serving the  same youth they had served through a mentoring program whose funding  had expired. Staff from a California grantee told us they used the  Education grant to expand their existing school-based mentoring program  into additional schools.", "In contrast, some of the newer grantees we visited did not have an existing  base upon which to build their mentoring efforts, particularly those that  were using grant funds to start a new program. As a necessary step toward  implementing successful mentoring programs, these grantees had to take  time during the initial part of their grant period to engage in planning  activities. This planning involved determining key program design  features, such as establishing program outcomes and resolving operational  issues such as how to recruit mentors. Sometimes newer grantees had to  revise their original plans when they experienced unexpected  implementation difficulties. For example, a Delaware grantee new to  mentoring had planned to provide one-to-one mentoring at local churches,  but encountered difficulties transporting the children to the various  locations. Subsequently, the grantee switched to a small-group mentoring  approach where mentors met the children at school. Another new grantee  that we visited in Nebraska had difficulty recruiting enough mentors and  retaining enough youth for their mentoring effort. Moreover, during our  visit to a new grantee in Idaho, we observed that some youth did not have  mentors and were being randomly assigned to an available mentor on the  spot for a group activity.", "Our review of grantee applications showed that all grantees had some  policies and procedures in place to manage their ongoing operations, such  as policies pertaining to mentor recruitment, screening, and training, but  during our site visits we found that established and new grantees differed  in the extent to which they had been able to implement such policies and  procedures. Established grantees we visited already had in-place many of  the policies and procedures necessary to operate a mentoring program.  For example, these grantees generally had long-standing agreements with  organizations in their communities that helped them attract, screen, and  retain mentors. In addition, established grantees had a structure that  helped them to begin operations immediately after the grant award. For  example, two well-established grantees\u2014one in Florida and the other in  Ohio had either staff dedicated to recruiting or had advisory boards made  up of community leaders to help them recruit and promote their efforts. In  addition, more established grantees were able to retain their mentors by  providing appreciation gifts and having mentor appreciation dinners and  ceremonies. Some established grantees also gave mentors small gifts such  as pins and note pads with the program logo on it. (See fig. 5.)", "In contrast, as expected for organizations in the start-up phase of their  programs, the newer grantees we visited generally did not have as well- developed policies and procedures, such as those related to mentor  training, recruitment, and support, as the established grantees we visited.", "For example, a grantee we visited in Illinois had to borrow materials from  other programs to develop its training manual. Furthermore, some of the  newer grantees we visited had not completed making all of their matches  or the mentors and youth had only met a few times.", "Established grantees we visited were generally better positioned than  newer grantees to market and sustain their mentoring efforts at the end of  the Education grant. In particular, because many of the established  grantees we visited had secured funding from multiple sources or were  part of larger organizations, they were better positioned to sustain their  mentoring efforts when the grants ended. For example, an established  Florida grantee received funding from multiple sources, including its  national affiliate, private foundations, and the United Way. In contrast, the  Education mentoring grant was the only source of funding for a new  grantee in Georgia. Some established grantees also developed a wide  variety of materials to promote their program, including portable  presentation packages, colorful, professionally printed brochures and  pamphlets, magnets, and promotional videotapes. (See fig. 6.)", "Finally, established grantees often had more experience collecting youth  and program outcomes, our site visits showed. For example, some of the  established grantees that were affiliated with a national organization, such  as Big Brothers Big Sisters of America, already had a set evaluation  strategy, including standardized data collection forms and analysis tools.  Although new grantees\u2019 overall evaluation plans were outlined in their  grant applications, some of the newer grantees we visited did not have  established data collection processes or evaluation plans.

To facilitate their implementation, they found that  discussions with staff from other established mentoring organizations  helped them by providing information on program design, such as  strategies for recruiting and supporting mentors and program evaluation.  For example, staff from an established New York grantee we visited told  us they contacted other mentoring organizations for advice on mentor  screening, support, and recruitment. These established grantees noted the  time and effort it took to get a program operational and that key to their  successful efforts was assistance they received from other more  experienced programs.", "During our site visits, new grantees reported facing start-up difficulties,  such as recruiting and retaining potential mentors.

Many of the grantees we visited  acknowledged the need for information sharing on grantees\u2019 activities that  could provide valuable lessons. Three of the established grantees we  visited put processes in place to facilitate information sharing or presented  information about their organization at conferences. For example, one  grantee in Ohio that we visited developed a regional mentoring institute to  share its mentoring experiences and expertise to assist interested school  districts and nonprofits throughout a tristate area.

During these initial  telephone contacts, OSDFS staff communicated the specific outcomes the  agency expected grantees to achieve and answered grantees\u2019 questions.  They also discussed measures to assess the grantee\u2019s implementation  progress.", "Second, OSDFS\u2019s monitoring process has involved semiannual telephone  calls to grantees to ensure that grantees are on track and to provide  technical assistance as needed. During these telephone calls, OSDFS  monitoring staff asked a set of questions to determine the extent to which  grantees are implementing their programs as planned. Agency officials  also asked grantees questions to assess the extent to which grantees have  hired staff and how much staff turnover they have encountered.", "Third, OSDFS examined grantees\u2019 annual performance reports. Education  requires grantees to provide information in these reports that helps the  agency monitor grantees. Such information includes specific examples of  grantee accomplishments as well as any objectives the grantee did not  meet. For example, a Florida grantee provided information in the report  on the extent to which youth were meeting the program\u2019s outcome goals,  noted where desired outcomes had not been reached, and explained why.  In addition, if grantees have not implemented scheduled activities, OSDFS  asks that grantees explain why. OSDFS also asks grantees to describe any  corrective actions they have taken or plan to take in response to previous  problems OSDFS staff may have identified. Agency officials also used  performance reports to ensure that grantees reconciled their expenditures  with their budgets and described significant changes to their current or  future budgets.", "Fourth, OSDFS monitored expenditure rates on a continuous basis  through the Grants Accounts Payments System, according to agency staff.  Agency staff used such information to identify potential problems, such as  if a grantee was not expending funds at an appropriate rate. For example,  while monitoring expenditure rates, OSDFS found that one grantee had  spent funds, even though it had not yet begun operations. That grantee  later voluntarily relinquished its grant.", "Fifth, as part of its monitoring process, OSDFS staff has visited a small  number of grantees each year to observe how they are implementing their  programs. However, because of the limited number of grantees OSDFS   visited and the method by which grantees were selected, on-site  monitoring is of limited value as a monitoring tool. For example, in fiscal  year 2003, OSDFS officials visited three grantees. Two of them were  selected because of their proximity to another grantee funded by  Education under a different grant. The third program was chosen because  it had ties to the program director of the grantee that voluntarily  relinquished its grant. During an OSDFS visit with this grantee, agency  staff also reviewed the grantee\u2019s budget to ensure that proposed costs  were allowable. Staff also verified that the grantee was serving the target  population described in its application. For all three visits, OSDFS  prepared a brief description of the program and the status of program  implementation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Office Responsible for Monitoring Mentoring Grantees Did Not Review Grantees\u2019 Single Audit Act Reports, Creating the Potential for It to Miss Fiscal and Programmatic Weaknesses", "paragraphs": ["Education officials in OSDFS who were directly responsible for  monitoring the mentoring grants told us that they did not review grantees\u2019  single audit reports, even though the office\u2019s own monitoring guidance  requires them to do so. Specifically, OSDFS monitoring guidance states  that to decrease the likelihood of a grantee from being labeled as high risk,  OSDFS should review annual performance reports, evaluation reports, and  information from single audit reports, and other information readily  available to them. Education officials told us that the Office of the Chief  Financial Officer (CFO) within Education receives and reviews single  audit reports. According to Education officials, this office did not forward  information to the OSDFS officials responsible for monitoring mentoring  grants because none of the information in the single audit reports  pertained to the mentoring grants. Moreover, Education officials said that  CFO does not receive single audit reports in instances where Education  does not directly fund the program. For example, CFO would not receive a  single audit report for state-administered programs, such as Title I.", "Using information readily and easily accessible through the online Single  Audit Act database, we reviewed the mentoring grantees\u2019 single audit  summary reports. In reviewing these summary audit reports, we did not  expect to find information pertaining to grantees\u2019 handling of mentoring  grants, as these were relatively new.  Rather, we wanted to determine if  there were issues in these same grantees\u2019 handling of other Education  grant funds they received before or around the time Education awarded  them mentoring grants. How well these grantees handled other funds they  received from Education could suggest how well they would manage their  mentoring grant funds. We found that 8 percent of the mentoring grantees  had problems with respect to other Education grants they received that  were substantial enough to be reported as audit findings. For example,  we found that grantees\u2019 audit findings covered problems with cash  management, procurement and reporting on Education programs. By  using the online Single Audit Act database, we were also able to access  information about subgrantees\u2019 handling of Education funds."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Education Considering Conducting National Study of Mentoring Programs to Augment the Evaluations It Has Required Grantees to Submit", "paragraphs": ["Education is currently considering whether or not it will undertake a study  of its mentoring program. Although Education\u2019s plans for an evaluation are  not defined, it has required grantees to provide an evaluation of their  programs at the end of the 3-year grant period. Most grantees plan to do a  descriptive evaluation by reporting information on youth outcomes,  particularly those related to academic achievement, incidences of harmful  behavior, attendance, and drop out rates. However, the grantees varied  considerably with respect to how they plan to measure these outcomes.  This limits the extent to which Education can use information from the  grantees to provide a national perspective on grantee outcomes."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "While Education Plans for Mentoring Study Are Not Defined, It Has Required Each Grantee to Provide an Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["Currently, Education does not have plans to conduct a descriptive study to  report on mentoring program outcomes or an effectiveness study to  establish any linkages between outcomes and youth participation in  mentoring programs. Many researchers consider effectiveness studies to  be the best method for isolating the program\u2019s effect on participants, from  other factors, such as schooling, that could also influence participant  outcomes. Such studies, which must be carefully planned and executed,  are often multiyear, complex, and costly. Education officials said that  although discussions are underway on whether the department will  conduct a study evaluating the mentoring program, no final decision has  been made.", "Education has required that all grantees evaluate their programs at the end  of their 3-year grants and to describe their evaluation plans in the grant  applications. Our review of grantee evaluation plans showed that most  grantees plan to compare outcomes of participating youth at the beginning  of the programs to their outcomes at the end of the 3-year grant period. In  particular, grantees report plans to examine outcomes related to academic  achievement, attendance, and criminal and harmful behaviors.", "During our site visits, we found that established and new grantees\u2019  evaluation plans varied both in what they measured as well as  measurement strategies. Newer grantees more often planned to measure  program processes, such as the duration of the mentoring relationship, the  number of students matched, or the number of mentors recruited. In  contrast, established grantees more often had plans to report on student  outcomes, such as academic achievement. Moreover, established grantees  more often reported plans to use data, such as actual school grades and  attendance records to measure outcomes. Newer grantees, however, more  often reported plans to survey parents or teachers to gauge the extent to  which outcomes improved. For example, an established grantee in   New Mexico reported plans to use data from school records as well as  surveys of mentors, youth, and teachers to assess whether attendance,  homework completion, relationships with adults and peers, and attitudes  toward school had improved. In addition, this program established targets  for improvement, such as plans to decrease discipline referrals by   20 percent. In contrast, an Illinois grantee that recently began operating a  mentoring program, planned mainly to report how well it complied with its  process, rather than how well youth performed on outcome measures.  This grantee planned to measure the extent to which its recruitment  process generated participants each year and the number of children  matched with mentors. Moreover, a new grantee operating in Delaware  that we visited said it would report youth outcomes through self-reported  information from teachers and youth. Such self-reported information may  not be as accurate as that reflected in official school records. Moreover,  while these individual grantee evaluations will provide some information  about youth enrolled in mentoring, because of the different measures  used, Education cannot combine results to provide an overall national  picture."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 3 years, the Congress has invested funds in a mentoring  program aimed at helping children who face a significant risk of failing at  school or becoming involved in illegal drugs, gangs, or alcohol have a  better chance of succeeding. In funding the mentoring program in fiscal  year 2004, the Congress significantly expanded the mentoring program,  providing $50 million to support the last year of the existing grants as well  as about 200 additional grantees. Given the recent program expansion, it  will be especially important to address issues that arose during the first   2 years of the mentoring program, for example, challenges new grantees  face in starting programs; limited use of monitoring tools, and the absence  of a cohesive national picture of program outcomes.", "New mentoring grantees are faced with making many decisions about  program design and operation, whereas established grantees generally  have policies and procedures in place that facilitate implementation.  Established mentoring grantees have benefited from consultation with  other programs and from lessons learned through years of experience;  both helped them operate successful programs. Without a mechanism for  new grantees to access program design and implementation information,  they are more likely than established grantees to struggle with program  start-up and operational issues, such as recruiting and training mentors.", "Through its monitoring of grantees, Education has attempted to ensure  that programs are managed well. However, Office of Safe and Drug Free  Schools staff responsible for monitoring the mentoring grant have not  used all of the means available to help it more effectively oversee  programs. Findings from audit reports represent an additional monitoring  tool that could provide useful information about a grantee\u2019s stability and  fiscal capacity and that may influence ongoing funding decisions. By not  using single audit reports, the office responsible for monitoring the  mentoring grant may be lacking information that could help it effectively  assess whether programmatic and fiscal problems could weaken a  grantee\u2019s ability to successfully implement its mentoring program.", "Finally, Education will have some information about outcomes of youth  participating in mentoring because it has required grantees to provide  evaluations of their efforts. However, because these evaluations measure  different outcomes and use different methodologies, their results cannot  be meaningfully combined to provide a cohesive picture of program  outcomes nationally. Lacking such information, Education cannot gauge  the extent to which the youth outcomes NCLBA sought to affect through  the mentoring grants did indeed improve during the grant period.  Furthermore, because Education does not have plans for an effectiveness  study, it will not be positioned to determine whether participation in the  mentoring program contributes to improved youth outcomes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Education (1) explore ways to  facilitate the sharing of successful practices and lessons learned to help  new grantees more quickly and effectively implement their programs;   (2) ensure that the Office of Safe and Drug Free Schools uses grantees\u2019  single audit reports as part of its monitoring process to take advantage of  all monitoring tools that could improve the identification of fiscal and  programmatic weaknesses; and (3) undertake a national study of  mentoring program outcomes and in doing so, explore the feasibility of  examining the effectiveness of the mentoring program in improving youth  outcomes and consider collecting limited, uniform data on the next wave  of mentoring grantees that could be used as the basis for such study."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the Department of Education for  review and comment.
