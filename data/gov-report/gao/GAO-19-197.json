Stakeholders explained that when exchanging health information with other providers, they match patients' medical records using demographic information, such as the patient's name, date of birth, or sex. This record matching can be done manually or automatically. For example, several provider representatives said that they rely on software that automatically matches records based on the records' demographic information when receiving medical records electronically. Stakeholders said that software can also identify potential matches, which staff then manually review to determine whether the records correspond to the same patient. Stakeholders also said that inaccurate, incomplete, or inconsistently formatted demographic information in patients' records can pose challenges to accurate matching. They noted, for example, that records don't always contain correct information (e.g., a patient may provide a nickname rather than a legal name) and that health information technology (IT) systems and providers use different formats for key information such as names that contain hyphens.", "Stakeholders GAO interviewed identified recent or ongoing efforts to improve the data and methods used in patient record matching, such as the following:", "Several stakeholders told GAO they worked to improve the consistency with which they format demographic data in their electronic health records (EHR). In 2017, 23 providers in Texas implemented standards for how staff record patients' names, addresses, and other data. Representatives from three hospitals said this increased their ability to match patients' medical records automatically. For example, one hospital's representatives said they had seen a significant decrease in the need to manually review records that do not match automatically.", "Stakeholders also described efforts to assess and improve the effectiveness of methods used to match patient records.

For example, some said that implementing common standards for recording demographic data; sharing best practices and other resources; and developing a public-private collaboration effort could each improve matching. Stakeholders' views varied on the roles ONC and others should play in these efforts and the extent to which the efforts would improve matching. For example, some said that ONC could require demographic data standards as part of its responsibility for certifying EHR systems, while other stakeholders said that ONC could facilitate the voluntary adoption of such standards.

These tools generally use algorithms that compare  demographic data in a patient\u2019s separate electronic records. For  example, representatives from four of the six providers told us they used  a module offered by their EHR system vendor to match records and  exchange information with other providers that use the same vendor\u2019s  EHR systems. The module includes an algorithm that compares  patients\u2019 demographic information and, if the information in two or more  records is identical or very similar, can automatically link the records.  Automated matching can also involve some degree of manual review, as  algorithms can identify potential matches by providing information about  the likelihood that two records with similar information refer to the same  individual. Afterwards, provider staff manually review the demographic  information in the records and assess whether these potentially matching  records should be linked as belonging to the same patient.", "Representatives from the five HIE organizations we spoke with said they  use a range of automated and manual approaches to match patients\u2019  records when exchanging information. Representatives from all five of  the HIE organizations said that they use software with algorithms to  locate and match records using demographic information provided by the  providers in their networks. Though these HIE organizations\u2019 algorithms  vary, they all use name, sex, DOB, and address to match patients\u2019  records. Representatives said that when the patients\u2019 records contain  similar but not identical demographic information, the HIE organizations  rely on staff or additional software to review potential matches and  determine whether the records belong to the same patient. For example,  one HIE organization representative said that his organization leverages  third-party data, such as credit databases that store past names or  addresses, to update demographic information for records that cannot be  matched automatically.", "When describing their approaches to patient record matching when  exchanging information, six of the seven provider representatives said  that they sometimes used HIE organizations to exchange and match  records.

Three provider representatives said that medical records for  newborns often contain temporary names that are not updated with the  child\u2019s legal name after it is determined, which makes it difficult to locate  these records. Further, provider representatives and other stakeholders  said that multiple births (e.g., twins) result in record matching challenges,  as these children can have the same DOB and address, and may be  named similarly. A few provider representatives said that records can be  inaccurate across providers for patients from certain nationalities. For  example, according to stakeholders, some east-Asian cultures use the  \u201cfamily name\u201d as the first name, and some Hispanic cultures use multiple  last names.

It includes, for example,  questions that providers can use to identify any gaps in how they manage  their demographic data. In 2016, before ONC published the Framework,  the agency began a pilot study to assess how the Framework could work  in a clinical setting. As part of this pilot study, ONC provided training on  demographic data quality to staff from two community health centers,  during which it shared best practices for collecting these data.

However, stakeholders had differing views on how to reach  agreement on and implement common standards among providers, as  well as how feasible it would be to do so. Some said it would be helpful if  ONC established requirements regarding demographic data\u2014such as the  types of data collected, and how it is formatted\u2014potentially through the  EHR certification process. In contrast, other stakeholders saw an  opportunity for industry organizations to voluntarily agree to implement  standards for demographic data. Some stakeholders advocated for EHR  vendors to take steps to standardize the data their products allow  providers to collect. A representative with one hospital said that having  demographic data standards built into EHRs could minimize the amount  of time needed to train staff on how to format the data they collect\u2014and  then to monitor whether they format the data correctly. A number of  stakeholders said that ONC could play a role in getting industry groups to  agree on and implement common data standards.

While stakeholders  did not always specify who should develop such a data set, an official  from one stakeholder involved with patient record matching and data  sharing efforts said that the most useful thing ONC could do to address  patient record matching would be to develop a master data set to allow  testing in a uniform way.

ONC officials cited a number of challenges to developing one  test data set for assessing a range of patient matching algorithms. For  example, they said the data set would need to be very large; would  require an extensive and expensive effort to develop; could be difficult to  implement from a practical perspective; and that, because data varies  widely across patient populations and organizations, might have limited  application for assessing algorithms that are designed to match specific  data sets.
