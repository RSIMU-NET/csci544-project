GAO found no agreement between FERC, federal and state land resource agencies, licensees, environmental groups, and other participants in the licensing process on the need for further reforms to reduce process-related time and costs. Finally, available time and cost data are insufficient to allow informed decisions on the effectiveness of recent reforms. Without complete and accurate time and cost data and the ability to link time and costs to projects, processes, and outcomes, FERC cannot assess the extent to which the observations and suggestions--or any recommended administrative reforms or legislative changes--might reduce the process' length and costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 10 percent of all electricity production in the United States is generated by hydroelectric power (hydropower) projects. Federally owned and operated hydropower projects generate approximately half of this amount, while about 1,000 nonfederally owned and operated hydropower projects, which are licensed by the federal government, generate nearly all of the rest. Hydropower projects can include dams, reservoirs, stream diversion structures, powerhouses containing water- driven turbines, and transmission lines.", "Hydropower is an important part of the nation\u2019s energy mix. It offers the benefits of a comparatively inexpensive, emission-free, renewable energy source, the quantity of which can be increased quickly in periods of peak demand. In addition, the reservoirs behind hydropower dams often provide other benefits, including recreation, flood control, irrigation, and a municipal water supply. However, hydropower projects can also have adverse effects on ecosystems and resources, including fish and wildlife. They can change the fundamental chemical, physical, and biological processes of river ecosystems by (1) fluctuating river levels and altering the timing of flows, (2) blocking the downstream flow of nutrients and sediments, (3) changing water temperatures and oxygen levels, (4) impeding fish from migrating up and down streams or killing them as they pass through turbines used to generate power, and (5) drying out sections of streams.", "The Federal Power Act (FPA) authorizes the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to issue licenses to construct and to operate nonfederal hydropower projects. FERC\u2014an independent five-member commission appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate\u2014 issues licenses valid for periods up to 50 years, after which the projects must be relicensed in order to continue operations.", "FERC issued original licenses for most of the about 1,000 nonfederal hydropower projects decades ago. Between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2000, the licenses for 395 of these projects expired. Many of these were small projects that do not generate much power. According to FERC, over the next 15 years, the licenses for another 238 projects will expire. The 238 projects, many of which are large, combine to generate over half of the nation\u2019s nonfederal hydropower.", "In recent years, some licensees and other participants in the licensing process have expressed concern that obtaining a license now takes too long and costs too much. Responding to these concerns, FERC established an alternative licensing process, and other federal agencies have introduced reforms intended to make the licensing process more efficient and less costly. However, these reforms did not quell the concerns. As a result, in November 2000, the Congress directed FERC to conduct a comprehensive review of the policies, procedures, and regulations relating to the licensing of nonfederal hydropower projects to determine how to reduce the time and costs associated with obtaining a license. FERC is required to report its findings in 6 months, or by May 8, 2001.", "Prior to the enactment of the statute requiring FERC to review its licensing process, you asked us to identify and assess significant issues related to the process.

In addition, some licensees use a combination of the two processes\u2014informally referred to as a \u201chybrid\u201d process. All three processes begin between 5 and 5-\u00bd years before a project\u2019s license expires, when the licensee notifies FERC of its intent to seek relicensing. Each process ends when FERC either issues a new license or denies the license application. However, FPA provides for subsequent administrative and judicial reviews of a FERC license decision. If a license expires while a project is undergoing relicensing, FERC issues an annual license, allowing a project to continue to operate under the conditions found in the original license until the relicensing process is complete. Currently, more than 60 projects are operating under annual licenses, including several that have been operating under annual licenses for over a decade.", "FERC\u2019s newly issued licenses include a standard \u201creserved authority\u201d that allows FERC to \u201creopen\u201d a license to modify its terms and conditions to meet fish and wildlife needs. New licenses may also include \u201creopener articles\u201d that allow federal and state agencies, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals to petition FERC to reopen a license for other issues, including minimum streamflows and water quality.

For example, FERC requires at least 30 days to review a licensee\u2019s initial consultation package, and a meeting between the licensee and federal and state agencies typically takes place between 30 and 60 days after the initial consultation package is prepared.", "During the pre-application consultation phase, the licensee must consult with officials at federal and state land and resource agencies, as well as those representing affected Indian tribes, who identify studies the licensee should undertake to determine the project\u2019s impacts on fish and wildlife, recreation, water, and other resources. If the licensee disagrees with the need for a study, FERC may be asked to resolve the dispute. After completing the agreed-upon studies, the licensee prepares a draft application and obtains comments from, and attempts to resolve any disagreements on needed actions with, the relevant federal and state agencies.", "The post-application analysis phase begins when the licensee files a formal application to obtain a new license. This filing must occur at least 2 years before the license expires. The application is a comprehensive, detailed document specifying the project\u2019s proposed operations, its anticipated impact on resources and other land uses, and proposed actions to mitigate adverse effects. FERC reviews the application to ensure that it meets all requirements and then asks relevant federal and state land and resource agencies to formally comment on it.", "Depending on the comments and its own independent analysis of the application, FERC may ask the licensee to provide additional data and studies. When FERC is satisfied that these are sufficient, it conducts an environmental analysis under the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) and an economic analysis of the project\u2019s benefits and costs. In addition to using FERC\u2019s NEPA analysis, affected federal land and resource agencies frequently conduct separate environmental analyses under NEPA, or assessments under other laws, to determine the license terms and conditions to be prescribed or recommended to protect or enhance fish, wildlife, and other resources. FERC reviews these terms and conditions and, if necessary, negotiates with the relevant federal and state land and resource agencies or affected Indian tribes on the license\u2019s terms and conditions."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Alternative Licensing Process", "paragraphs": ["In October 1997, FERC issued an order codifying an alternative licensing process.

The licensee may choose the alternative licensing process, if it can demonstrate that all the participants agree on its use, subject to final approval by FERC.", "The alternative licensing process shortens the process by combining many of the earlier consultations and studies with the later analyses in the pre- application phase. For example, the licensee begins a preliminary NEPA analysis during the pre-application phase rather than having FERC begin the NEPA analysis during the post-application phase. The alternative licensing process also seeks to improve communication and collaboration among the participants in the process and often results in a \u201csettlement agreement\u201d at the end of the pre-application phase.

Balancing these interests and making the necessary tradeoffs lengthen the process and make it more costly.", "FPA remains the basic statutory authority governing the licensing of hydropower projects. However, the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 amended section 4(e) of FPA to require FERC to give \u201cequal consideration\u201d to water power development and other resource needs, including protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife, in deciding whether to issue an original or a renewed license.", "In addition, environmental and land management laws\u2014enacted primarily during the 1960s and 1970s\u2014require other participating federal and state agencies to address specific resource needs, including protecting endangered species, achieving clean water, and preserving wild and scenic rivers. For example, section 7 of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 represents a congressional design to give greater priority to the protection of endangered species than to the primary missions of FERC and other federal agencies. FERC, like all other federal agencies, must ensure that its actions, including licensing decisions, are not likely to jeopardize the existence of endangered and threatened species. Moreover, NEPA requires each federal agency, including FERC, to assess the environmental impact of proposed actions\u2014which can include licensing decisions\u2014that may significantly affect the environment. NEPA is designed to compel federal agencies to consider the environmental impacts of their actions and to inform the public that these impacts have been taken into account prior to reaching decisions.", "FPA authorizes federal and state agencies other than FERC to influence license terms and conditions, and in some instances, precludes FERC from altering license conditions imposed by other agencies. For instance, section 4(e) of FPA makes licenses for projects on federal lands reserved by the Congress for other purposes\u2014such as national forests\u2014or that use surplus water from federal dams subject to mandatory conditions imposed by the head of the federal agency responsible for managing the lands or facilities. Today, these agencies include the Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, Bureau of Indian Affairs, and Bureau of Reclamation.", "Similarly, section 18 of FPA requires FERC to include license conditions for fish passage prescribed by federal fish and wildlife agencies. These agencies now include Interior\u2019s Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service in the Department of Commerce. In addition, the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986 added section 10(j) to FPA. This section authorizes federal and state fish and wildlife agencies to recommend license conditions to benefit fish and wildlife that FERC must include in the license unless it (1) finds them to be inconsistent with law and (2) has already established license conditions that adequately protect fish and wildlife.", "Moreover, section 401 of the Clean Water Act\u2014added in 1972\u2014requires anyone seeking a license or permit for a project that may affect water quality to seek approval from the relevant state water quality agency. States have begun to use section 401 to influence license terms and conditions.", "The regulations adopted by FERC under FPA require FERC to involve the public in the licensing process. Members of the public may express their views on resource needs that they believe need to be addressed in an application to obtain a license. They may also submit comments and recommendations, request scientific studies, and formally intervene in the licensing process. As an intervenor, a member of the public is entitled, among other things, to request a rehearing of a license decision by FERC or to obtain judicial review of FERC\u2019s decision in the relevant federal appeals court.", "Public values have changed over the past 30 to 50 years and now reflect a growing concern about the environmental impacts of hydropower projects. Environmental groups and others view the licensing of a hydropower project as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have these values and concerns considered.", "Changing public values, coupled with requirements to give equal or greater consideration to environmental concerns than to hydropower generation, have resulted in new license conditions intended to protect and enhance fish, wildlife, and other resources. For example, in an effort to reduce the risk to fish resources, new licenses may include conditions that require licensees to change minimum streamflows, construct fish-passage facilities, install screens and other devices to prevent fish from being injured or killed, limit the amount or timing of reservoir drawdowns, or purchase or restore lands affected by a project."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Participants Cannot Agree on the Need for, and Type of, Reforms to the Licensing Process", "paragraphs": ["FERC, federal and state land and resource agencies, licensees, environmental groups, and other participants in the licensing process do not agree on whether further reforms are needed to reduce process- related time and costs.

Federal and state land and resource agencies, however, counter these claims, saying that licensings are sometimes delayed because, until FERC requires them to, licensees are unwilling to conduct studies or to provide additional information required for the agencies to fulfill their statutorily mandated missions and responsibilities.

Second, FERC needs to identify why certain projects or groups of projects displaying similar characteristics take longer and cost more to license than others and why the time and costs required to complete certain process steps vary by project or group of similar projects.

Moreover, FERC often could not link the costs to the various steps in the licensing process to identify which steps were the most costly.

As agreed, this report discusses (1) why the licensing process now takes longer and costs more than it did when FERC issued most original licenses several decades ago; (2) whether participants in the licensing process agree on the need for, and type of, further reforms to the process to reduce time and costs; and (3) whether available time and cost data are sufficient to reach informed decisions on the effectiveness of recent reforms and the need for further reforms to the process.", "To identify how the licensing process has changed since FERC issued most of its original licenses several decades ago, we reviewed relevant laws, regulations, court decisions, and guidance affecting hydropower licensing. We interviewed officials from FERC, federal land and resource agencies, states, industry, and nongovernmental organizations involved in the licensing process. We also reviewed pertinent documents from these sources as well as other independent analyses from academia and the private sector.", "To identify the extent of agreement among participants in the licensing process on the need for, and type of, reforms to the process, we (1) attended all six of the public meetings that FERC held in January 2001 and (2) reviewed the formal written comments provided to FERC by February 1, 2001, as part of its statutorily required review of the licensing process. We also met with and obtained data from federal and state agencies, licensees, industry, nongovernmental organizations, and academia. In addition, we reviewed pertinent documents, including congressional testimonies. We also visited two hydropower projects currently involved in the licensing process, and interviewed participants involved in several other recent or ongoing licensing processes.", "To identify the availability of time and cost data on which to base FERC\u2019s May 8, 2001, report on reducing process-related time and costs, we reviewed FERC databases as well as those of other federal agencies and nongovernmental organizations involved in the process. We also interviewed officials from FERC, federal and state land and resource agencies, industry, and nongovernmental organizations. We assessed the adequacy of FERC\u2019s data and information systems by examining the scope and content of its project files and databases. We then held interviews with FERC project managers, information specialists, and analysts to determine the availability of project and step-specific data on processing time and costs. In addition, we examined a survey instrument developed by FERC to gather information on licensing time and costs from participants at the public meetings. We also reviewed FERC\u2019s strategic plan for fiscal years 2000 through 2005 prepared under Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 as well as its plans to enhance its existing information and tracking systems.

However, nothing has changed during the intervening 3 months. FERC still does not have the data needed to reach informed decisions on the effectiveness of recent reforms to the licensing process or on the need for further reforms to the process. As reflected in their comments below, FERC\u2019s position has not changed. It does not believe that it needs to systematically collect complete and accurate data on process-related time and costs by participant, project, and process step to reach informed decisions on the effectiveness of recent reforms to the licensing process as well as the need for further reforms to the process. Rather, it thinks that it can address the salient issues by developing \u201ctargeted analyses\u201d to determine major factors affecting licensing time and costs based, in part, on its \u201cyears of experience\u201d with the licensing process. However, we continue to believe that good data are needed to reach good decisions. Moreover, without complete and accurate time and cost data and the ability to link time and costs to projects, processes, and outcomes, FERC increases the risk that any reforms that it recommends may not only not reduce process-related time and costs but also result in unintended consequences to the outcomes of the process.", "Comment 2: According to FERC, systematically collecting complete and accurate data on process-related time and costs by participant, project, and process step would \u201cdivert money and staff away from the licensing process.\u201d Conversely, we believe that the money would be well spent, if it resulted in informed decisions on the need for further reforms to the licensing process to reduce time and costs. In fact, FERC\u2019s comment seems inconsistent with its own strategic plan. In its Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2000-2005, FERC states that \u201caccurate and timely information is essential for external customers and staff alike.\u201d Therefore, we did not make any changes to the report on the basis of this comment.", "Comment 3: We disagree with this comment. FERC states that requiring or requesting that licensees, federal and state agencies, tribes, non- government organizations, and members of the public provide additional time and cost data would \u201cburden these entities unduly.\u201d FERC also asserts that it cannot compel federal agencies to submit additional time and cost data. We recognize that providing the data will take time and cost money. However, we fail to see how doing so would unduly burden participants in the licensing process. Obtaining a license is not a yearly event. Rather, it occurs once every 30 to 50 years. Moreover, we never recommended or suggested that FERC collect time and cost data from tribes, non-government organizations, and members of the public. In addition, while FERC cannot compel federal agencies to submit additional time and cost data, it is not prohibited from requesting that the agencies provide this information and federal agencies appear willing to do so. For instance, in responding to our June 2000 report on recovering federal hydropower licensing costs, federal agencies agreed to ensure that their financial management and reporting systems were capable of producing accurate, timely, and reliable information on hydropower-program-related administrative costs.", "Comment 4: We did not make any changes to the report on the basis of this comment. FERC observes that \u201cit has always been charged under FPA section 10(a)(1) with balancing all relevant public interest considerations.\u201d While this statement is true, congressional dissatisfaction with FERC\u2019s efforts to carry out this responsibility led to a 1986 amendment to FPA, which required FERC to give \u201cequal consideration\u201d to water power development and other resource needs, including protecting and enhancing fish and wildlife, when deciding whether to issue an original or a renewed license. This amendment was one of a series of statutes enacted subsequent to the passage of FPA that specifically required FERC and other federal agencies to consider resource needs in addition to water power development. We used the 1986 amendment to illustrate the increasing complexity of the licensing process.", "Comment 5: We agree that FERC is not charged with assuring that hydropower projects it licenses are economically viable. However, as stated in its September 2000 strategic plan, FERC does attempt to \u201coptimize hydropower benefits by improving the environmental performance of projects while preserving hydropower as an economically viable energy source.\u201d Since the language in our report is consistent with the language in FERC\u2019s strategic plan, we did not make any changes to the report on the basis of FERC\u2019s comment.", "Comment 6: We revised the report to state that FERC does not systematically collect much of the needed time and cost data.", "Comment 7: We revised the report to make clear that, if a license expires while a project is undergoing relicensing, FERC issues an annual license, allowing a project to continue to operate under the conditions found in the original license until the relicensing process is complete.", "Comment 8: We revised the report to add \u201caffected Indian tribes.\u201d", "Comment 9: We agree with FERC that only parties to the licensing process may (1) file an application for a rehearing with FERC within 30 days of FERC\u2019s licensing decision and (2) obtain a judicial review of FERC\u2019s decision in the relevant federal appeals court within 60 days after FERC\u2019s order on the application for a rehearing. Therefore, we revised the report accordingly.", "Comment 10: We revised the report to state that FPA authorizes federal and state agencies, other than FERC, to influence license terms and conditions, and in some instances, precludes FERC from altering license conditions imposed by other agencies.", "Comment 11: We revised the report to state that section 4(e) of FPA makes licenses for projects on federal lands reserved by the Congress for other purposes\u2014such as national forests\u2014or that use surplus water from federal dams subject to mandatory conditions imposed by the head of the federal agency responsible for managing the lands or facilities.", "Comment 12: We mentioned section 10(j) to emphasize the increased role of federal and state fish and wildlife agencies in the licensing process sine enactment of the Electric Consumers Protection Act of 1986. We revised the report to more clearly reflect this.", "Comment 13: We revised the report to delete \u201cadversely.\u201d", "Comment 14: We revised the report to state that participants who believe that further reforms are needed to reduce the time and costs to obtain a new license cannot agree on what further reforms are needed to shorten the process and make it less costly.", "Comment 15: FERC notes that our report states that many licensees, federal and state agencies, and environmental groups believe that FERC has not provided necessary leadership and direction; however, we do not cite what is lacking. FERC then provides examples of recent actions that it has taken that it believes provide leadership and direction. We recognize that FERC has taken actions intended to shorten the licensing process or make it less costly and provide examples of these actions under the subcaption \u201cSome Licensing Participants Are Satisfied With the Current Process.\u201d We also cite one of the most often mentioned concerns about FERC; that is, its lack of leadership and direction during the pre- application consultation phase when much of their process-related time and costs can be incurred. Moreover, FERC is aware of these concerns since they were raised at the public meetings that FERC held as part of its mandated review of its licensing process.", "Comment 16: We revised the report to state that, as of February 2001, FERC had compiled data on licensees\u2019 process-related licensing costs for 83\u2014or about 20 percent\u2014of the 395 projects with licenses pending or issued between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2000. FERC did not provide us with any new data subsequent to February 2001.", "Comment 17: We revised the report to make a clearer the link between data and outcomes. Specifically, we state that without complete and accurate time and cost data and the ability to link time and costs to projects, processes, and outcomes, FERC will not be able to assess the extent to which the observations and suggestions\u2014or any administrative reforms or legislative changes that it may recommend\u2014might (1) reduce the time and costs to obtain a license or (2) change the outcomes of the process.", "Comment 18: We did not make any changes to the report on the basis of this comment. Rather, FERC\u2019s comment, which does not identify any completion dates for either phase of its system development, supports our finding that it has not established a schedule with firm deadlines for developing a system to track process-related time and costs.", "Comment 19: We revised the report to delete the two sentences in question. The one-time difficulties incurred in shifting from an old tracking system to a new one are not germane to our finding that FERC has not established a schedule with firm deadlines for developing a system to track process-related time and costs.", "Comment 20: FERC states that it is not aware of its staff\u2019s refusal to share data with other agencies. However, documentation that we obtained from the Department of the Interior shows that Interior asked for, but was not provided, the process-related time and cost data that FERC had collected.", "As a result, Interior had to independently collect and analyze process- related time data from FERC\u2019s information and tracking systems.", "Comment 21: According to FERC, at a February 13, 2001, meeting, it requested that other federal agencies provide it with their process-related time and cost data. FERC states that it did not receive the data. However, as we reported in June 2000, FERC has not provided these agencies with guidance on what and how process-related costs should be reported and continues to decline to do so. Therefore, we did not make any changes to the report on the basis of this comment.", "Comment 22: Appendixes I and II correspond exactly to the sequence of steps in the handouts and viewgraphs presented by FERC at the public meetings held in six cities in January 2001 as part of its mandated review of the licensing process.
