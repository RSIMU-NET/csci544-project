Reclamation's data on water project construction cost repayments indicate that, of the $6.4 billion in costs allocated to irrigation as of the end of fiscal year 2012, $1.6 billion remains outstanding. The remaining $4.8 billion has been repaid by irrigation districts or through other revenue sources or will be provided in financial assistance to the districts. Reclamation's policy is to make the statements it prepares annually on repayment available to the public upon request, but the agency does not make it readily known to the public that it prepares these statements or that they are available. GAO interviewed individuals knowledgeable of Reclamation water projects who indicated that this information would be useful for their work, such as in considering funding arrangements for the expansion of water projects; some individuals were not aware that Reclamation prepares repayment statements annually, or that the agency would make them available upon request. By more widely disseminating information to the public that construction cost and repayment data are available, Reclamation may increase interested parties' opportunities to obtain cost and repayment information. This, in turn, could further enable Congress, water users, and the public to assess past funding arrangements and enhance their ability to make informed decisions for funding potential new work, such as to expand water storage capacity.", "The authority for irrigation districts\u2014or for landholders who own or lease land for agricultural purposes within those districts\u2014to repay their allocated share of construction costs early is limited to a small number of districts, and its use has various financial and other implications. Early repayment authority allows irrigation districts or landholders to repay their total outstanding repayment obligations in advance of the date specified in the districts' contracts. As of December 2013, 87 irrigation districts\u2014representing about 15 percent of all districts with contracts\u2014had authority for the district or its landholders to repay early. Of those authorized, 69 irrigation districts either repaid early, or had some landholders who repaid early, with those payments totaling more than $238.9 million. GAO found that early repayment's effect on the financial return to the federal government largely depends on whether a discount may be authorized, such as calculating the present value of the outstanding repayment obligation to determine the amount to be repaid early, and the size of that discount. If no discounts are authorized, any early repayments that occur would be worth more to the government because the repayments do not bear interest. In addition, early repayment accelerates the elimination of certain restrictions and requirements for landholders that are in place until their repayment obligation is fulfilled. For example, once landholders have fully repaid their construction cost obligations, they are no longer subject to acreage limits on the amount of land they can own or lease for agricultural purposes and irrigate with project water and may be able to receive project water on additional land."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that Reclamation better promote to the public that information on water projects' construction costs and repayment status is available. The Department of the Interior concurred with the recommendation."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1902, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Reclamation has  financed and built more than 180 water projects\u2014comprising dams,  reservoirs, canals, and other features to store and deliver water\u2014to  provide water to various users in 17 western states. Initially, water  projects were intended to make previously arid and semiarid land  productive and were built almost solely for irrigation. Over the years,  water projects grew in size and purpose, often providing water for  irrigation, as well as hydroelectric power generation, municipal and  industrial water supplies, recreation, flood control, and fish and wildlife  enhancement, among other uses. Today, Reclamation\u2019s water projects  vary substantially in size, ranging from a 5,000-acre water project in  southeastern Idaho consisting of a single canal, to the roughly 500-mile  long Central Valley Project in California consisting of 20 dams and  reservoirs, and hundreds of miles of canals. Collectively, Reclamation\u2019s  projects provide water for about 10 million acres of farmland and nearly  31 million people. The costs to construct the water projects including  irrigation as a project purpose\u2014a combined total of more than $20  billion\u2014were primarily financed by the federal government, but irrigation  districts, power users, and municipal and industrial users (collectively  called water users) that receive project water are obligated to repay the  federal government for their allocated share of construction costs. Water  users are also obligated to pay the government for ongoing operation and  maintenance performed by Reclamation.", "Reclamation typically enters into multiyear contracts with water users that  are agreements between the federal government and the user on the  delivery of water, the repayment of construction costs, and other terms  and conditions. Repayment requirements vary depending on the type of  water use and contract. For example, irrigation districts with repayment  contracts are generally required to repay their allocated construction  costs over a period of up to 40 years, and they do not pay interest on their  allocated construction costs. In contrast, power and municipal and  industrial users are required to repay their allocated share of construction  costs over a period of up to 40 years as well, but they are also required to  pay interest that accrues on those costs over time.", "As congressional authorization for new water projects slowed by the  1970s, Reclamation shifted its focus from constructing to managing water  projects, including providing maintenance, repair, and modernization of  existing infrastructure. Going forward, however, as population, agricultural  production, and development in the West are projected to continue to  increase, Reclamation may be called upon to expand existing capacity for  water storage or delivery or to support additional conservation measures  for fish and wildlife enhancement. For instance, severe drought conditions  in California in 2014 have led some Members of Congress to call for  increasing the water storage capabilities of water projects located in the  state and have highlighted the importance of effective water management  across the West. There has also been congressional interest in broadly  authorizing the early repayment of construction costs\u2014that is, allowing  irrigation districts to pay off their allocated construction costs before the  due date specified in their contracts. Unless expressly authorized in their  contracts or by statute, irrigation districts are not authorized to repay their  construction cost obligations early.", "In this context, you asked us to provide information on the status of  irrigation districts\u2019 repayments of their allocated water project construction  costs.

We also  reviewed our July 1996 report on the status of construction cost  allocations and repayments at that time. To determine the extent to  which Reclamation collects and reports information on water project  construction costs and the status of repayment by irrigation districts, we  reviewed data from Reclamation\u2019s Statements of Project Construction  Cost and Repayment for fiscal year 2012, the most current data available  at the time of our review. To examine the extent to which irrigation  districts can repay water project construction costs early and the  implications of early repayment, we collected data from Reclamation on  irrigation districts that have authority to repay early, districts that have  exercised such authority, and the amounts of early repayments through  December 2013. To assess the reliability of Reclamation repayment and  early repayment data, we took steps such as identifying the sources of  data included in the Statements of Project Construction Cost and  Repayment, which are generally tied to audited accounting records, and  the agency\u2019s review process. We found the data to be sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. In addition, for both objectives, we conducted interviews  with knowledgeable Reclamation officials at the agency\u2019s central office in  Denver, Colorado, and all five regional offices (Great Plains, Lower  Colorado, Mid-Pacific, Pacific Northwest, and Upper Colorado) about  issues related to the status of repayment and early repayment. We also  interviewed officials from a nonprobability sample of eight irrigation  districts and two landholders\u2014who own or lease land for agricultural  purposes\u2014from five water projects located in California, Nebraska,  Oregon, and Wyoming to collect information on the repayment of  construction costs and related issues. We selected these irrigation  districts and landholders using criteria such as the type of contracts the  districts held with Reclamation, the district\u2019s status of repayment, and  whether or not the districts had early repayment authority. We also  interviewed a nonprobability sample of nine individuals knowledgeable  about Reclamation water projects and the status of repayments, early  repayment authority, or both, including staff from the Congressional  Research Service, Congressional Budget Office, and attorneys who have  represented irrigation districts or environmental organizations.

The agency  has led or provided assistance in constructing most of the large dams and  water diversion structures in the West for the purpose of developing water  supplies for irrigation, as well as for other purposes, including  hydroelectric power generation, municipal and industrial water supplies,  recreation, flood control, and fish and wildlife enhancement. Reclamation  is organized into five regions, with technical and policy support provided  by its central office in Denver. Each regional office oversees the water  projects located within its regional boundaries (see fig. 1).", "The federal statutes authorizing individual water projects and the statutes  generally applicable to all water projects\u2014known collectively as  reclamation law\u2014govern Reclamation\u2019s water projects. Reclamation law  determines how the costs of constructing water projects are allocated and  how repayment responsibilities are assigned among the projects\u2019 users.  Cost allocation is the process of assigning an equitable share of the total  cost to each use in a multipurpose project. Under reclamation law,  Reclamation allocates a share of the project\u2019s total construction costs to  each of the authorized project purposes based on the proportion of  benefits each purpose receives from the project, and the costs allocated  to each purpose are deemed to be reimbursable or nonreimbursable.  Reimbursable costs are those that are to be repaid by certain water  users, including irrigation districts, power, and municipal and industrial  water suppliers. Nonreimbursable costs are those that are not repaid by  water users and are instead generally borne by the federal government  because certain project purposes are viewed by Congress as being  national in scope, such as costs allocated to flood control and navigation,  fish and wildlife enhancement, and recreation. At the time each water  project is authorized and designed, Reclamation estimates the total  construction costs and allocates these costs among the project uses.  Once project construction is completed, and the actual construction costs  are determined, Reclamation performs a final construction cost allocation.", "The cost allocation serves as a basis for the repayment terms in water  users\u2019 contracts. The amount of reimbursable costs that water users are  responsible for repaying is based on the type of project purpose (see fig.  2). Power and municipal and industrial users are responsible for repaying  their allocated share of the construction costs, plus the interest that  accrues on those costs during construction and the repayment period. For  irrigation districts, however, reclamation law does not require the districts  to pay interest on the construction costs allocated to irrigation, resulting in  federally subsidized financing for irrigation districts responsible for  repayment. In addition, irrigation districts may receive the following two  types of financial assistance in repaying their allocated construction costs:  Irrigation assistance. The amount of construction costs allocated to  irrigation that the Secretary of the Interior determines to be above the  irrigation districts\u2019 ability to pay for a given project is repaid from other  revenue sources, where available. These other revenues are primarily  earned from the sale of power generated by the project (or other  related projects), or from the sale of municipal and industrial water,  among other revenue sources. Ability-to-pay determinations are  based on Reclamation\u2019s financial analysis of a given geographic area,  and determinations generally occur before construction begins on a  project.", "Credits. Credits can relieve part or all of irrigation districts\u2019 repayment  obligations. Types of credits include congressionally authorized  repayment reductions, or \u201ccharge-offs,\u201d and construction expenses  determined to be nonreimbursable. Charge-offs are credits that are  often enacted through legislation in response to special  circumstances, such as a determination that the land is unproductive,  or the settlement of Indian water rights claims.", "To establish an agreement between the federal government and irrigation  districts on the delivery of water from a project and to collect payments,  Reclamation generally enters into one of the following two types of  contracts with irrigation districts:", "Repayment contracts: Section 9(d) of the Reclamation Project Act of  1939 authorizes permanent contracts for water delivery with  repayment of construction costs allocated to irrigation to be paid in  fixed dollar amounts in annual or other regular increments, over a  period of up to 40 years, by the irrigation district to Reclamation.", "Water service contracts: Section 9(e) of the Reclamation Project Act  of 1939 authorizes contracts to furnish water for irrigation purposes for  up to 40-year periods. Reclamation generally enters into water service  contracts with irrigation districts when construction of the water project  has not been completed, final construction costs are uncertain, or the  irrigation district does not want a permanent contract, among other  reasons. By law, Reclamation must charge rates for water delivered  under water service contracts that are at least sufficient to cover an  appropriate share of fixed charges the Secretary of the Interior deems  proper, taking into consideration the construction costs allocated to  irrigation, as well as an appropriate share of annual operation and  maintenance costs. A water service contract can contain a provision  providing for its renewal\u2014through negotiations between Reclamation  and the irrigation district\u2014once the contract\u2019s term ends, or the  contract may contain a provision allowing for its conversion to a  repayment contract.", "Depending on the size of the water project, which varies substantially  across projects, Reclamation may have contracts with a number of  irrigation districts within that project\u2019s service area.

Reclamation officials told us they had considered  publishing the repayment statements on the agency\u2019s website in the mid- 2000s as part of an internal management review, but they decided not to  do so.

Looked at another way, if the irrigation district were to continue  making annual repayments over time, rather than repay early, the value  to the government of $100,000 paid in full after annual installments  ending in 2030 would be approximately $74,220 in 2014 dollars.

In this example, the discount  may have incentivized the irrigation districts to repay early, but it also  reduced the financial return to the federal government compared with  early repayment without a discount. Specifically, Reclamation data  indicate that, if no discount had been applied, the early return to the  government would have been $236.7 million, rather than the $200.1  million that was repaid based on the discount.such a discount had not been provided, fewer irrigation districts may have  exercised their early repayment authority, and a larger discount would  have resulted in a smaller return to the government.", "On the other hand, if  Based on past early repayments, some irrigation districts and landholders  may be motivated to repay early without a discount, but Reclamation  officials told us that they believe some kind of discount would be needed  to incentivize many irrigation districts to consider early repayment, were it  to be authorized.

Once irrigation districts or  landholders have repaid their construction cost obligations in full\u2014 whether early, or as scheduled by the terms of their contract\u2014the  landholders are no longer subject to these acreage and pricing limitations.  As a result, landholders may be able to receive project water, to the  extent it is available, on additional land or at a subsidized rate once they  have fulfilled their repayment obligations.", "Reclamation officials told us that any foregone income in future years  from full-cost water rates would reduce the return to the federal  government associated with early repayment. According to Reclamation  officials, the agency collected approximately $146.8 million from January  1988 through December 2013 in full-cost water rates from landholders  who were irrigating land in excess of the amount subject to the statutory  pricing limitations. Thus, if early repayment authority were exercised by  those landholders, then the loss of full-cost water rate revenue in future  years would at least partially offset the return to the government from  early repayments. In addition, Reclamation officials and others we  interviewed stated that early repayment would allow for the possibility of  larger entities receiving project water at subsidized rates on larger  landholdings sooner than intended under reclamation law\u2014one of  Reclamation\u2019s early goals in developing water projects throughout the  western United States was to promote farming opportunities for small,  family-owned operations. Other irrigation district officials told us, however,  that even though their districts had landholders with excess acres who  may be interested in early repayment, the elimination of acreage and  pricing limitations would not likely serve as an incentive for the districts as  a whole to repay early. For example, one official stated that her district  would have to finance a loan to make early repayments on a lump-sum or  accelerated basis, which did not make sense compared with making  annual, interest-free repayments under the terms of the contract."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Repayment Eliminates Reporting Requirements for Landholders", "paragraphs": ["Early repayment also eliminates annual reporting requirements for  landholders earlier than if repayment was made by the due date specified  in the contract. Until their construction cost obligations are repaid,  landholders are subject to annual reporting requirements to ensure  landholders\u2019 compliance with acreage and pricing limitations. According to  irrigation district officials and landholders we interviewed, completing  these reports can be difficult and time-consuming for landholders and for  districts, which must complete a form for Reclamation summarizing the  reports submitted by landholders. For example, one landholder in Oregon  said that it repaid its construction cost obligation early, after receiving  statutory authority to do so in 2005, in part to eliminate the need to submit  the annual reports. On the other hand, some irrigation district officials told  us that while the reporting requirements were burdensome, eliminating  the reporting requirements would not be a sufficient reason for the district  to repay early, if granted the authority, without other incentives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Early Repayment Potentially Provides Irrigation Districts with Greater Assurance of Project Water in Perpetuity", "paragraphs": ["Early repayment potentially provides irrigation districts with a greater  assurance of receiving available project water on a permanent basis. The  right to water is generally determined by state law\u2014which varies by state  and can be complex\u2014so repayment and water service contracts do not  provide a right to water under state law. Under federal reclamation law,  however, these contracts give irrigation districts assurance of a specified  amount of water from the project\u2019s available water supply, which becomes  permanent upon completion of repayment of the construction costs   Securing a permanent right to project water in  allocated to the districts.a geographic area where water supply is uncertain was a key motivation  in the Central Valley Project irrigation districts\u2019 desire to convert their  contracts and repay their construction costs early, according to an  attorney who represented those districts in pursuing and receiving such  authority in 2009. In addition, for irrigation districts that receive and  exercise authority to convert their water service contracts to repayment  contracts and repay early, the need for Reclamation and the districts to  renegotiate water service contracts when they expire is eliminated,  according to agency officials. Reclamation officials and the attorney  representing the Central Valley Project irrigation districts told us that  renegotiating the terms of water service contracts can be time-consuming  and unpredictable for landholders and their agricultural businesses and,  therefore, repayment contracts may be preferable over water service  contracts. On the other hand, the agency\u2019s flexibility for responding to  water shortages, drought, and climate change-related issues could be  limited as a result of fixing the amount of water an irrigation district  receives under a repayment contract in perpetuity, according to a  statement made by Reclamation\u2019s Commissioner in 2011."], "subsections": []}]}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["With population, agricultural production, and development in the West  projected to continue to increase, Reclamation may be called upon to  modify or expand existing capacity for water storage or delivery.

In particular, Congress and  others may want to assess information on how costs were allocated and  how funding and repayment arrangements were established among  various water users in the past. Reclamation compiles such information in  the repayment statements it prepares annually for each water project with  outstanding repayment obligations.

We reviewed Reclamation policies and directives  and other Reclamation documents on water project construction cost  allocation, repayment, and early repayment of construction costs. We  also reviewed our July 1996 report on the status of construction cost  allocations and repayments. In addition, we conducted interviews with  knowledgeable Reclamation officials at the agency\u2019s central office in  Denver, Colorado, and all five regional offices (Great Plains, Lower  Colorado, Mid-Pacific, Pacific Northwest, and Upper Colorado) about  issues related to the status of repayment and early repayment. For our  interviews with officials from each of the regional offices, we developed a  set list of open-ended questions to obtain information and documentation  on information they maintain on water project construction cost allocation  and repayment information and the use and availability to the public of  this information, as well as the opportunities for and potential implications  of early repayment, among other things.", "To determine the extent to which Reclamation collects and reports  information on water project construction costs and the status of  repayment by irrigation districts, we analyzed Reclamation\u2019s Statements  of Project Construction Cost and Repayment (repayment statements) for  fiscal year 2012, the most current data available at the time of our review.  Reclamation provided repayment statements for 76 projects with  outstanding repayment obligations with irrigation districts, and provided  repayment statements for 43 of 54 projects with irrigation that no longer  had outstanding obligations with irrigation districts (Reclamation policy  calls for repayment statements to be prepared annually for all water  projects with construction cost repayments outstanding. This policy does  not apply to water projects where all water users, including irrigation  districts, have repaid their construction cost allocations, and per  Reclamation policy, preparing repayment statements for these projects is  optional). The data contained in repayment statements are generally tied   The repayment statements are prepared  to audited accounting records.annually by the regional offices for each water project that has  construction costs allocated to one or more water users with an  outstanding repayment obligation. The repayment statements contain  information on total costs for the water project, including construction  costs incurred as of the end of the fiscal year; estimated future  construction costs, and other costs that Reclamation includes in its  repayment analysis for construction costs, such as capitalized operation  and maintenance costs; the allocation of construction costs among  project purposes, including irrigation; and the status of repayment for  costs allocated to each project purpose, including repayment realized,  anticipated future repayment, and any financial assistance granted to  irrigation districts, such as credits, which relieve water users from a  portion of their allocated repayment obligations. To analyze and interpret  the data contained in the repayment statements, we relied, in part, on the  relevant financial standards section on repayment statements in the  Reclamation Manual, which provides guidance on the content and format  for repayment statements. When the data in a repayment statement  included estimated future construction costs, we subtracted these  estimated costs from the projects\u2019 total costs because such costs have  not yet been and, in some cases, may never be, incurred. To assess the  reliability of Reclamation repayment data, we took steps such as  reviewing the guidance for developing repayment statements in the  Reclamation Manual; interviewing Reclamation officials from all five  regional offices who were involved in preparing the repayment  statements, as well as officials from Reclamation\u2019s central finance office  in Denver; identifying the sources of data included in the repayment  statements and the agency\u2019s review process; and following up with  Reclamation officials to obtain clarifying information in instances where  we identified discrepancies in the data. On the basis of these steps, we  found the repayment statements to be sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of this report.", "We reviewed information from each of the five regional offices on the  number of repayment and water service contracts in their respective  regions where irrigation districts were making repayments on their  allocated construction cost obligations, as of July 2014, for the Lower  Colorado, Mid-Pacific, Pacific Northwest and Upper Colorado regions  and, as of November 2013, for the Great Plains region. To assess the  reliability of the data provided by the regions concerning the number of  contracts of each type, we asked Reclamation officials a standard set of  questions concerning the reliability of the data and reviewed  corresponding documentation, and we found the data sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of our report. We also reviewed Reclamation\u2019s policies  and practices on making cost allocation and repayment information\u2014 specifically, its repayment statements\u2014available to the public, as well as  the Office of Management and Budget\u2019s open government directive and  associated documentation related to ensuring the transparency of  government information to the public.", "To examine the extent to which irrigation districts can repay their  allocated water project construction costs early, and the implications of  early repayment, we reviewed applicable laws, policies, and other  relevant documents. We also collected data from Reclamation\u2019s regional  offices on irrigation districts that have contractual or statutory authority to  repay early, districts that have exercised such authority, and the dates  and amounts of early repayments through December 2013. To assess the  reliability of the data provided by Reclamation concerning early  repayment, we asked Reclamation officials a standard set of questions  concerning the reliability of the data and reviewed corresponding  documentation, and we found the data sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our report. In addition, we conducted legal research to  identify statutes that provide irrigation districts with the authority to repay  their construction cost obligations early. To help identify the implications  of early repayment, we reviewed the Reclamation Reform Act of 1982  and other laws and regulations that establish acreage and pricing  limitations and reporting requirements for landholders until their  repayment obligations are fulfilled. We also reviewed testimonies and a  statement for the record by Reclamation on draft legislation that would  have authorized early repayment for additional irrigation districts, and we  reviewed Congressional Budget Office cost estimates of various bills  since 2005 that proposed expanding early repayment authority to certain  irrigation districts.", "For both objectives, we conducted interviews with officials from a  nonprobability sample of eight irrigation districts and two landholders from  five water projects located in California, Nebraska, Oregon, and Wyoming  to collect information on the repayment of construction costs and related  issues. We selected these irrigation districts and landholders using  criteria such as the type of contracts the districts held with Reclamation  (repayment or water service contracts), their status of repayment, and  whether or not the districts had early repayment authority. We also  interviewed a nonprobability sample of nine individuals knowledgeable  about Reclamation water projects on the status of repayments, early  repayment authority, or both.
