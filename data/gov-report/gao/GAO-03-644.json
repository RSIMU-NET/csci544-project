Erratic weather reduced maize (corn) production. A poorly functioning agricultural sector caused food supply shortages. Government actions--including the sale of Malawi's grain reserve and Zimbabwe's land reform--further cut available food. Widespread poverty contributed to food insecurity and the HIV/AIDS epidemic exacerbated food shortages by reducing the labor force. Food aid averted famine, but the overall response did not prevent widespread hunger. About 93 percent of the total cereal gap--the difference between domestic needs and production--was met by the end of the April 2002-March 2003 crisis period. However, food aid deliveries fell short in several countries, and vulnerable households had limited ability to purchase commercial maize. Slow donations, poor infrastructure, and concerns about biotech food were major obstacles to an effective response. Excluding the United States, most donors did not make sufficient, timely donations to the World Food Program. Poor transportation systems and storage facilities hampered efficient food delivery. Zambia rejected food aid because of concerns regarding biotech food; other countries required milling maize for the same reason. This compromised the food aid pipeline given the United States was the region's key donor and its aid may contain biotech food. Declining investments in agriculture and the HIV/AIDS epidemic pose challenges to emerging from crisis into sustained recovery. U.N. and U.S. officials cite the need to reverse declining trends in agricultural investments by international financing organizations, national governments, and donors. Without a strategy that integrates, among other things, agricultural development, the impact of HIV/AIDS, and natural disaster management, food crises will recur."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The southern Africa region has been facing its worst food crisis in more  than a decade.

(See  fig. 7 for a map of the transportation network.) From these points of entry,  food is transported by truck or rail to intermediate storage facilities, or  transshipment points, which are strategically located in various districts  within the country to streamline the flow of deliveries. From these strategic  locations, food is then transported to extended delivery points\u2014storage  facilities generally located at the district level\u2014from which the food aid  allocations for each final distribution site are dispatched. WFP manages  this process, including transporting the food to the extended delivery  points. Wherever possible, nongovernmental organizations that are  designated as the implementing partners are responsible for the secondary  transport of food from the extended delivery points to the final distribution  points.", "Long-standing weaknesses in transportation infrastructure across the  region hampered timely delivery of food aid where it was needed. Much of  the transportation infrastructure (including ports, railways, and roads) had  deteriorated since the 1991/92 drought. For example, the port of Maputo,  which is ideally situated for moving food commodities to landlocked  countries, such as Swaziland and Zimbabwe, cannot be used optimally  because of the lack of adequate port warehouse and storage facilities.  However, even when ports are full, there is a limit to the amount of food  that can be transported over land to landlocked countries, like Zambia, due  to rail and trucking capacity and other logistical considerations.", "According to WFP officials, the port of Nacala was in better condition than  the port of Maputo. But its rail system\u2014the sole transport link between  Malawi and the nearest port in Mozambique and the shortest, cheapest  route into Malawi and eastern Zambia\u2014was in such poor condition it had  to be fixed during the crisis. In late 2002, the United Kingdom and Canada  gave WFP $6.4 million and $256,000, respectively, to rehabilitate a 48-mile- long track on the Nacala railway and to lease locomotives and wagons.  While these locomotives and ongoing repairs to the rail corridor  represented a major breakthrough, unexpected setbacks continued to mire  operations. For example, in Malawi, heavy rains in January 2003  completely destroyed one bridge on the Nacala rail line, thus impeding the  movement of commodities for at least 10 days. In late summer 2002, a  donation of 200 trucks from the government of Norway and the  International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies helped  ease access to places that are particularly hard to reach.

WFP estimates that when it has to mill the product in  South Africa, regional distribution costs could total up to $80 per metric  ton more than for unmilled U.S. maize.", "Logistics of the food aid effort were complicated. Logistics became  more complex because of (1) U.S. whole kernel maize piling up in ports  as governments debated whether to accept biotech maize and, if so,  under what conditions, (2) limited milling capacity, (3) added  transportation and storage requirements, and (4) the short shelf life of  maize milled regionally (3 months compared with 12 months for whole  maize).

Early concerns  about the progress of commercial imports stemmed from the large  amounts of cereal imports needed, the high regional prices for maize, and  the lack of sufficient foreign exchange resources for governments and  private sector entities to purchase the required imports.  Nonetheless, data  available in mid-May 2003 indicated that 1.72 million MT of commercial  cereal imports had been received in the six countries between April 1, 2002,  and March 31, 2003. However, the regional Vulnerability Assessment  Committee September 2002, December 2002, and January 2003 reports  indicated some serious problems with food availability during the year.  (See app. III for a detailed description of the VACs.)  Factors contributing  to the uncertainty over commercial cereal food supplies included the lack  of time frames indicating when imports needed to be purchased, data  reliability issues, problems between urban and rural distribution of food  supplies, and government policies that provided disincentives to the  private sector to import food or that, once imports were received in  country, discouraged the efficient supply of those goods to the local  market.", "In contrast to WFP\u2019s food aid effort, the CFSAMs did not identify the  monthly rate at which imports needed to occur, making it difficult to judge  the timeliness of commercial imports. The September VAC report for  Zambia indicated concern that it could be difficult for importers to find  maize in regional markets (as several countries in the region had large  deficits and would be competing to buy from the same suppliers), which in  turn could delay purchases. According to the December VAC report for  Lesotho, maize, wheat, and sorghum were generally not available for  purchase at the end of the year in communities across that country. In  Swaziland, maize was reported to be readily available in retail outlets  nationwide even though there had been no commercial imports between  July and November. However, there were fears that a shortfall in maize  imports would occur between December and March, causing another  round of price hikes.", "Once data on commercial cereal imports began to be available, data  reliability became an issue in some cases. For example, according to the  December Zimbabwe VAC report, figures on the combination of  commercial imports, food aid imports, and available national production  should have resulted in a surplus of 200,000 MT at the national level.  However, the report indicated there was something seriously wrong with  the numbers, since 41 percent of communities surveyed reported that  cereal grains were not or were rarely available from the government\u2019s grain  marketing board and the other 59 percent reported that the grains were  only occasionally available. U.S. government officials noted that there have  been numerous anecdotal reports of the government\u2019s politicizing food aid,  which may partly explain some of the discrepancy.", "While commercial cereal imports may have been provided to urban  markets, shortages were reported in many rural areas, indicating problems  with the distribution of commercial cereal supplies. The December VAC  report for Lesotho indicated that maize meal\uf8e7maize that has undergone  the milling process\uf8e7was said to be available, though very expensive, in the  various urban centers but generally not available in the rural areas, which  were characterized as experiencing a serious food crisis. The January VAC  report for Zambia said there was no commercial shortfall in urban areas  and millers did not expect one through February and beyond. However,  most of the maize that had been imported (officially or via cross-border  trade) was reportedly only servicing the urban markets, leaving the rural  areas with a severe commercial grain shortfall that drastically pushed up  prices. Of 48 villages surveyed, fewer than 10 percent said maize was  readily available and fewer than 30 percent said maize was occasionally  available.", "Finally, some national governments implemented subsidies and price  controls that raised concern about private sector imports and whether  imports received would be supplied to local markets efficiently. For  example, in response to the crisis, Malawi implemented a countrywide  subsidy on the consumer price of maize to make it more affordable to the  public. However, this policy, combined with high interest rates that  inhibited the private sector from borrowing to cover its purchases, meant  that the private sector could not profit from importing maize and selling it  at the subsidized price. In Zambia, the government encouraged a program  whereby a private sector group, the Millers Association, would import  300,000 MT of maize without having to pay import duties and the  government would import 155,000 MT of maize to begin a strategic reserve.  However, the Zambian government reportedly provided conflicting  information about the amount of food it was to import for relief versus  strategic reserves, thus causing confusion about planned imports,  uncertainty over market prices, and conditions favorable for market  speculation. In Zimbabwe, the government banned all private sector  imports and implemented price controls on maize.

We recognize that the United States is taking steps to help improve  long-term food security in the region that include, among others, the  Agricultural Initiative to Cut Hunger in Africa, which was introduced  early last year. However, as noted in figure 11, overall assistance to the  region's agricultural sector has declined between 1998 and 2003; and as  of April 2003, only one out of the six countries (Mozambique) was  proposed to receive funding under the new initiative. We also recognize  that U.S. bilateral assistance in several of the affected countries has  funded a number of programs related to food security over the years,  including ongoing programs on agricultural development, HIV/AIDS,  and disaster management. While all these programs do help to promote  food security, U.N. and U.S. officials told us that to have broad impact,  these programs need to be implemented on a much larger scale. Our  recommendation that U.S. agencies work with international  organizations, donors, and national governments to develop a  comprehensive, targeted strategy for sustained recovery would, if  implemented, help coordinate efforts, integrate approaches, and  leverage limited resources as necessary to achieve greater  effectiveness. 2. We modified the text on pages 3 and 23 to note that the United States  anticipated the crisis at the outset. Although the United States acted  early  so that food would arrive in a timely way, USAID officials advised  us that no food was prepositioned in any of the countries.
