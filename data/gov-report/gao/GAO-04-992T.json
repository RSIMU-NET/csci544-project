Since the 1950s, HUD has  subsidized about 1.7 million rental units in over 23,000 privately owned  properties that are generally affordable to low-income tenants\u2014those with  incomes 80 percent or less of area median income. HUD supported the  development of affordable housing by offering property owners favorable  mortgage financing, long-term rental assistance contracts, or both in  exchange for owners\u2019 commitment to house low-income tenants for at  least 20 years and, in some cases, up to 40 years. However, many of these  commitment periods will be completed in the next 10 years as the HUD  mortgages reach their scheduled maturity dates and long-term rental  assistance contracts expire. These subsidized properties represent a  significant source of housing that is affordable to low-income households.", "My statement today, which is based on our January 2004 report, discusses  (1) the numbers and selected characteristics of HUD-subsidized rental  properties that are scheduled to reach mortgage maturity through 2013\u2014 roughly the next 10 years; (2) the potential impact on tenants when  mortgages reach maturity; and (3) the tools and incentives that HUD, the  states, and localities offer owners to keep HUD properties affordable  when mortgages mature. In preparing the report, we analyzed HUD  databases to identify the characteristics of those properties with  mortgages that have already reached maturity as well as those that are  scheduled to reach maturity by December 31, 2013. We surveyed 327 state  and local housing and community development agencies to obtain  information on what tools and incentives they use to keep HUD-subsidized  properties affordable to low-income tenants. In addition, we reviewed  statutes and regulations and interviewed HUD officials to identify tenants\u2019  protections when mortgages on subsidized properties mature. We  performed our work from January through November 2003 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.", "Nationwide, 21 percent or 2,328 of the 11,267 subsidized properties with  HUD mortgages are scheduled to reach mortgage maturity through 2013,  but among states this percentage varies significantly: from 7 percent in  Alabama, to 53 percent in South Dakota. These properties contain 236,650  units. Nearly all of these 2,328 properties were financed under three  specific HUD programs, two of which operated only between 1961 and  1973. About three-quarters of the mortgages are scheduled to mature in the  last three years of the 10-year period.", "Impacts on tenants depend in part on tenant protections available under  program regulations and statutes, as well as on owners\u2019 decisions about  their properties.

Without tenant protection  requirements, tenants in over 101,000 units that do not receive rental  assistance may have to pay higher rents or move when the HUD mortgages  on these properties mature and rent restrictions are lifted. Further, owners  are not required to notify tenants when a property\u2019s mortgage is about to  mature. In contrast, owners are required to notify tenants up to 1 year in  advance of their intent to prepay mortgages or decline renewal of rental  assistance contracts. Property owners\u2019 decisions on whether they continue  to serve low-income tenants after their HUD mortgages mature depend on  many factors, such as neighborhood incomes, the condition of their  properties, and owners\u2019 missions.

Under production programs, the  subsidy is tied to the unit (project-based), and tenants benefit from  reduced rents while living in the subsidized unit. HUD\u2019s mortgage  financing programs include:    Section 202 Elderly and Disabled Housing Direct Loan, which provided  below-market interest rates on up to 40-year mortgages to developers of  rental housing for low-income elderly and persons with disabilities from  1959 to 1991. Congress changed Section 202 to a grant program in 1990.", "Section 221(d)(3) Below-Market Interest Rate (BMIR), which provided  subsidized financing on private 40-year mortgages to developers of rental  housing from 1961 to 1968.", "Section 236, which provided monthly subsidies to effectively reduce  interest rates on private 40-year mortgages for rental housing from 1968 to  1973.", "Sections 221(d)(3) and 221(d)(4), which insured private mortgages to  developers of rental housing from 1961.", "Section 231, which insured private mortgages to developers of rental  housing for the elderly from 1959.", "In order to reach lower-income tenants, a portion of the units in many  properties developed under these production programs were further  subsidized by provision of rental assistance, under programs such as Rent  Supplement, Rental Assistance Payments (RAP), and project-based  Section 8.", "In the early 1970s, questions about the production programs\u2019 effectiveness  led the Congress to explore options for using existing housing to shelter  low-income tenants. The Housing and Community Development Act of  1974 included both approaches\u2014a project-based new construction and  substantial rehabilitation program and a tenant-based rent certificate  program for use in existing housing (currently named the Housing Choice  Voucher program)\u2014all referred to as Section 8 housing. Project-based  and tenant-based Section 8 assistance is targeted to tenants with incomes  no greater than 80 percent of area median income, and tenants generally  pay rent equal to 30 percent of adjusted household income. The project- based Section 8 program also provides rental assistance to owners of  properties that were not financed with HUD mortgages.", "Beginning in the late 1980s, owners of some subsidized properties began  to be eligible to leave HUD programs by prepaying their mortgages or  opting out of their project-based Section 8 rental assistance contracts.  Once these owners removed their properties from HUD programs, they  were no longer obligated to maintain low rents or accept rental assistance  payments. In response, in 1996, Congress created a special type of  voucher, known as an enhanced voucher, to protect tenants from rent  increases in these properties.", "Not all property owners repay mortgages as originally scheduled. For  example, an owner may refinance the mortgage to pay for improvements  to the property. Other owners may experience financial difficulties and  default on their mortgages. From January 1993 through December 2002,  HUD data show that the agency terminated the insurance on 231  mortgages.

For a profit-motivated owner, the decision may be influenced by  the condition of the property and the income levels in the surrounding  neighborhood. If the property can be upgraded at a reasonable cost, it may  be more profitable to turn the building into condominiums or rental units  for higher income tenants. If repair costs are substantial or if high-income  residents are not present in the surrounding area, it may be more  profitable to leave the property in the affordable inventory. Tools and  incentives offered by state and local agencies may also influence this  decision. In addition, because most of these owners have had the right to  prepay their mortgages and opt out of their Section 8 contracts for a  number of years, the economic factors that drive a decision to convert to  market rate are not unique to mortgage maturity.", "HUD data show that nonprofit organizations own about 38 percent of the  properties with mortgages scheduled to mature in the next 10 years. For a  nonprofit owner, the decision would likely be motivated by cash flow  considerations since, in theory, these owners are not primarily motivated  by economic returns. Since mortgage maturity results in an improvement  in property cash flow, reaching mortgage maturity by itself would not  necessarily trigger removal from the affordable inventory. For example,  the property manager at one of the 16 properties (nonprofit ownership)  whose mortgage matured in the past 10 years and who does not currently  have project-based Section 8 assistance told us that no longer having to  pay the mortgage left money for repairs needed to keep the units  affordable for their low-income senior tenants. Additionally, a nonprofit  organization would be more likely to keep the property affordable to low- income tenants because to do otherwise could conflict with its basic  mission of providing affordable housing.", "Another factor is the loss of the interest rate subsidy that occurs when the  mortgage matures. When interest rate subsidies were first paid to  properties built in the 1960s and 1970s, they represented substantial  assistance to property owners. Over time, inflation has reduced the value  of this subsidy. For example, the average interest rate subsidy payment for  a Section 236 property with a mortgage maturing in the next 10 years is  $66 per unit per month. Price levels have roughly quadrupled since 1970,  so to have the same purchasing power would require about $260 in today\u2019s  dollars. Section 8 and similar project-based rental assistance now provide  the bulk of the assistance to these subsidized properties\u201475 percent of  the assistance versus about 25 percent that derives from the Section 236  interest-rate subsidy. Furthermore, inflation will continue to erode the  value of the interest-rate subsidy until mortgage maturity, while the rental  assistance subsidy is adjusted annually to account for increases in  operating costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Most Properties with HUD Mortgages That Reached Maturity Offer Rents Affordable to Low-Income Tenants", "paragraphs": ["Our review of HUD\u2019s data showed that HUD-insured mortgages at 32  properties matured between January 1, 1993, and December 31, 2002.
