GAO analyzed USPS's mail data for fiscal years 2012\u20132016; USPS's, the Postal Regulatory Commission's (PRC), and UPU's policies and documents; and applicable U.S. statutes. GAO interviewed USPS, PRC, and Department of State officials, and mail stakeholders, including U.S. companies, such as FedEx and UPS, and consultants.

As a result, USPS's net losses on this type of mail more than doubled between 2012 and 2016. In contrast, USPS analysis indicates that the rates for outbound international terminal dues mail has resulted in net positive revenues for USPS, which offset the losses from inbound terminal dues mail.", "U.S. businesses that send outbound terminal dues mail may benefit to the extent that their costs to mail items to certain countries through USPS may be lower than the actual mail delivery costs in those countries.", "U.S. consumers who receive imported products may pay lower mailing costs for products originating from low terminal dues rate countries.", "Express consignment operators such as FedEx and the United Parcel Service said the terminal dues system creates a competitive disadvantage for them. Representatives from these companies said that they have difficulty competing for some international mail business because they cannot offer pricing as low as the postage based on the terminal dues rates offered by designated postal operators.", "The UPU adopted increased terminal dues rates for member countries starting in 2018.

UPU member countries vote every 4 years  on the annual payment rates.", "The current terminal dues system was designed as a single rate structure  for the delivery of letter mail, regardless of shape (i.e., letters, flats or  packets). The system takes into account that this rate varies based on  UPU\u2019s estimation of each nation\u2019s postal cost structure and economic  development. As such, the UPU divides its member countries into country  groups based on the UPU\u2019s \u201cpostal development indicator,\u201d which is  largely based on gross national income per capita and attempts to factor  in the cost to deliver a letter based on statistics from the United Nations,  the World Bank, and the UPU. Designated postal operators from  transitional (formerly called \u201cdeveloping\u201d) countries generally pay a lower  terminal dues rate for their mail to be delivered by designated postal  operators in target (formerly called \u201cindustrialized\u201d) countries (see app. II  for a list of the countries in each UPU country group).

First,  State is required by statute to request PRC\u2019s views on terminal dues  proposals before they are adopted by the UPU every 4 years to ensure  that the U.S. positions on the relevant UPU proposals are consistent with  PRC\u2019s standards and criteria for regulating USPS rates (or if not  consistent, provide a foreign policy or national security interest  justification).

According to USPS, there has been an 86 percent increase in  all inbound terminal dues mail between fiscal year 2012 and 2016\u2014 including a 19 percent increase between fiscal year 2015 and 2016  alone\u2014with much of the increase attributable to international e- commerce. E-commerce mail consists mainly of packets that are  heavier and irregular (see fig. 4 for examples). Most inbound letter mail to  the United States in fiscal year 2016 was \u201cpackets,\u201d defined by the UPU  as small packages that weigh no more than 2 kilograms (about 4.4  pounds), often generated by e-commerce. USPS officials stated that  packets generate higher costs as USPS\u2019s delivery and processing costs  for packets are higher than they are for letters. The current terminal dues  system does not distinguish mail based on shape, and there is no  separate rate for packets. A recent report commissioned by PRC found  that the current terminal dues system, by reducing the price of  international packet mail below what it would be without the system, is  responsible for increasing the demand (and hence volume) of packets  sent through USPS. According to the report, this increase in terminal  dues packets reduces the demand for other types of international mail  and ECOs.", "As mentioned above, losses occur because USPS\u2019s costs to deliver  inbound terminal dues mail are higher than the terminal dues revenues  for that mail. Specifically, PRC has recognized that terminal dues have  not covered USPS\u2019s costs to deliver inbound letter mail since fiscal year  1998 and has reiterated this recently. USPS recently stated that the  failure to cover USPS\u2019s costs for inbound mail was caused by the terminal  dues system. For example, currently, USPS is paid between $1.13 and  $1.87 in terminal dues to deliver a 10-ounce packet from a developing  country, an amount that does not include any additional surcharges for  tracking and other features. Conversely, USPS officials told us that the  published domestic rates for a 10-ounce piece of mail range from $1.61 to  the highest commercial rate of $3.46. However, comparing these  products is complicated, because they offer different features. According  to USPS officials, packets sent under the terminal dues system do not  include any tracking and have a delivery time of up to 3 weeks from some  countries, while all USPS domestic mail products include tracking and  have delivery times from as short as one day to an average of 2 to 3  days. In addition, 85 percent of USPS domestic mail receives discounted  rates for mail that is entered in bulk and prepared in a way that reduces  USPS\u2019s costs, including barcoding, presorting, and being entered into  USPS\u2019s system closer to its final destination."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Net Revenue Increases for Outbound Terminal Dues Mail", "paragraphs": ["USPS reports show that net revenue for outbound terminal dues mail  increased from fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year 2016.

This is the case for mail sent to  many developed countries, such as in Europe, where most U.S.  outbound international mail is sent. In this case, the postage charged  by USPS to the business reflects the relatively low terminal dues rate  paid by USPS to those designated postal operators, rather than a  higher rate that better reflects the designated postal operator\u2019s  delivery costs.", "U.S. consumers also benefit from the current terminal dues system.", "As described above, U.S. consumers have spurred a significant  increase in inbound international mail, especially from Asia where  terminal dues rates are lower than USPS\u2019s costs, which contributes to  low shipping prices for U.S. consumers. For example, the USPS\u2019s  Office of Inspector General (OIG) conducted a case study in 2015 that  found that five low-cost items shipped from China cost about $1.60  per item in shipping charges, while equivalent published domestic  postage for the same items cost between $2.04 and $2.22 per item,  depending on their exact weight. Studies by the USPS OIG and  WIK-Consult GmbH (WIK Consultants) have found similar benefits for  consumers from the current terminal dues system. U.S. consumers  may also see the same kind of benefit from lower mailing prices as do  U.S. businesses that send terminal dues mail to certain outbound  countries, such as in Europe, that have higher delivery costs than the  terminal dues paid to them by USPS."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Current Terminal Dues System Results in Competitive Disadvantages for Some Stakeholders", "paragraphs": ["Despite creating some benefits for some U.S. stakeholders, the current  terminal dues system also creates competitive disadvantages for other  U.S. stakeholders (see table 2).", "The terminal dues system puts ECOs at a disadvantage because  according to representatives from ECOs we spoke with, their volume for  international items that are similar to those currently shipped at terminal  dues rates is low, and they cannot compete on price with designated  postal operators. Instead, they compete using other features such as  tracking and delivery speed. Businesses overseas, like e-commerce  companies such as Alibaba, can use the terminal dues system as a low- cost alternative to ECO service for items which have much slower  delivery standards than offered by ECOs. This disadvantage is especially  pronounced when ECOs compete with designated postal operators for  business from countries with relatively low terminal dues rates, such as  many countries in Asia.", "U.S. businesses that compete with foreign companies that use inbound  terminal dues mail are also disadvantaged by the current terminal dues  system. Foreign businesses that send products from countries with low  terminal dues to U.S. consumers through USPS may have a competitive  advantage over domestic businesses, which may have to pay a higher  domestic postage. Representatives from two small U.S. businesses we  spoke with stated that the disparity between postage charges available to  foreign mailers under the terminal dues system versus the domestic  postage available to them was a significant factor in reduced sales in  recent years, although the disparity between postage charges is not the  only disadvantage they faced from foreign competition. We found this  outcome may be less of a competitive disadvantage for larger  businesses, such as Amazon, which may be able to obtain discounts on  the domestic mailing prices from USPS based on volume, presorting, and  other worksharing arrangements while smaller domestic mailers may not  be able to secure such discounts. Even with discounting, the domestic- mailing price may still be higher than the foreign-mailing price charged by  a designated postal operator a price that is based on, in part, a lower  terminal dues rate. However, USPS officials cautioned that such  comparisons are complicated because:  1.  Terminal dues rates do not include other costs, such as the cost of  collection, international transportation, and other costs that may be  included in the price charged to the foreign mailer by the designated  postal operator.  2.  Significant amounts of international mail are sent in large quantities  from foreign designated postal operators to USPS, making this mail  not analogous to USPS\u2019s single-piece mail rates.  3.  U.S. commercial customers may pay non-published rates established  in negotiated service agreements that may be lower than USPS\u2019s  single-piece published rates.", "While we described above how different stakeholders are affected by the  terminal dues system, it is not possible to quantify the system\u2019s impacts.  For example, according to USPS officials, while the current system has a  single rate for three shapes of terminal dues mail, USPS has over 3,000  rates for domestic mail, making rate comparisons of terminal dues mail  products to domestic mail products imprecise. In addition, the terminal  dues rate is a payment between designated postal operators, not the  price paid by the foreign mailer. This price information may not be publicly  available as designated postal operators in other countries might also  have non-published prices."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Planned Changes to Terminal Dues Rates Should Reduce USPS\u2019s Losses and Could Affect Other Stakeholders", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Changes Should Reduce USPS\u2019s Losses from Terminal Dues System", "paragraphs": ["Based on our analysis of the changes to the terminal dues system  recently adopted by the UPU and of USPS\u2019s estimates of the financial  impact of those changes, increased terminal dues rates should help  reduce USPS\u2019s losses for inbound mail. All terminal dues rates will  increase for inbound mail starting on January 1, 2018\u2014especially for  certain countries, which will increase by 13 percent per year specifically  for packets. By 2021, all but the least developed countries will have the  same terminal dues rates for packets. As the majority of terminal dues  mail handled by USPS is inbound, the increase in revenue resulting from  higher terminal dues may likely more than offset the increase in USPS\u2019s  costs that will result from increases in terminal dues rates to the countries  where most USPS outbound terminal dues mail is sent.", "The UPU also created a new rate category for packets, in addition to a  new tracked-packet surcharge, which will increase USPS\u2019s revenue. As  described previously, the current terminal dues rates do not distinguish  between letters, flats, or packets\u2014even though packets are more  expensive to handle and deliver due to their irregular size and heavier  weight. This change should lead to higher terminal dues revenue for  USPS. In addition, the UPU adopted the Integrated Product Plan (IPP) at  the 2016 UPU congress; that, among other things, will require commercial  goods to be sent under the terminal dues system as packets. According  to USPS officials, this change could also increase terminal dues  revenues, as all commercial items will be sent via packets, which will  have higher terminal dues rates starting in 2018. However, decisions on  other aspects of the IPP are expected to be made at a special UPU  congress in 2018.", "According to USPS projections, USPS will start earning positive net  revenues for inbound terminal dues mail as a result of these changes. As  terminal dues rates increase, USPS projections show that USPS will  cover costs for inbound terminal dues mail from the 15 countries that sent  most of the inbound terminal dues mail to the United States in fiscal year  2015. The State Department official who coordinated the U.S.  delegation to the 2016 UPU congress stated that these changes will  achieve the government\u2019s goal of dramatically improving USPS\u2019s cost  coverage for the delivery of inbound terminal dues mail, such as packets,  from China and other developing countries, when the changes take effect  in 2018.", "However, other stakeholders we spoke with disagree on the extent of  improvement. While PRC staff officials stated that the UPU has made  some progress in closing the gap between terminal dues rates and  domestic rates for equivalent domestic mail, they also stated that there is  still a way to go to make the rates equivalent to each other. Similarly,  PRC\u2019s Chairman stated that while the changes will improve USPS\u2019s cost  coverage, they will not eliminate the negative impacts of the current  terminal dues system and may in fact exacerbate them over the 2018\u2013 2021 period. In addition, he stated that while USPS projected that  terminal dues proposals in 2008 and 2012 would increase USPS\u2019s cost  coverage for inbound terminal dues mail, the improvement was negligible,  casting doubt on the accuracy of USPS\u2019s projections for the planned  changes for the 2018\u20132021 period. A consultant who has experience in  international mail issues stated that, given some assumptions about  changes in international mail volume, the terminal dues increases will still  not be equal to the delivery costs for domestic postage for inbound  terminal dues mail to countries such as the United States. He estimated  that the difference between the new terminal dues rates and equivalent  domestic postage for packets will be reduced from about 57 to 73 percent  (depending on the sending country) in 2016 to about 50 percent by 2021."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Changes Could Affect U.S. Stakeholders Differently, but Effects Are Difficult to Quantify", "paragraphs": ["According to stakeholders we interviewed as well as our analysis of  UPU\u2019s terminal dues rates, the projected increase in terminal dues rates  caused by the planned changes to the terminal dues system may  negatively affect U.S. businesses that send outbound terminal dues mail  and U.S. consumers (see table 3). U.S. businesses and U.S. consumers  that send mail to other countries will pay higher postage rates for terminal  dues mail, to the extent that USPS increases its prices to reflect the  higher terminal dues USPS must pay to designated postal operators.  However, increased terminal dues rates may still be less than the cost to  deliver that mail for designated postal operators in relatively high cost  countries, such as Norway and Germany. U.S. businesses and  consumers benefit from this disparity as the postage they pay USPS to  send mail to those countries is based on the terminal dues rates to those  countries, not the delivery costs, which may be higher. U.S. consumers  may also see shipping prices increase for inbound terminal dues mail, for  example e-commerce packets, to the extent that any increases in postage  charged to foreign mailers resulting from increased terminal dues rates  are passed along to U.S. consumers.", "ECOs and U.S. businesses affected by inbound terminal dues mail  should become more cost-competitive due to the planned increased  terminal dues rates, although the planned changes may not eliminate all  of the existing competitive disadvantages (see table 4). A State  Department official stated that these new rates may still not fully cover the  cost of delivery in some countries with very high postal delivery costs,  potentially impacting ECOs\u2019 competitiveness in those countries. A  representative from a small business that competes with overseas e- commerce businesses for U.S. consumers stated that any increase in  terminal dues would make his business more price-competitive with  foreign competitors. However, a representative from one small business  affected by inbound terminal dues mail we spoke with stated that his  business had already suffered due to the terminal dues system. He added  that other factors also make it harder to compete and therefore it would  be harder to recover even with higher terminal dues rates.", "While these changes may have different effects on U.S. stakeholders, it is  difficult to quantify the future effects because of limited information and  forecasting variability. As a result, it remains to be seen what the effects  of these changes to this system will be on domestic stakeholders. USPS,  USPS OIG, PRC, and others have developed or adapted models and  analyses that try to show the economic impacts of the terminal dues  system on different stakeholders and estimate the impact of any changes  to that system. We analyzed six recent models and analyses\u2014including  the USPS\u2019s, USPS OIG\u2019s, and PRC\u2019s models\u2014that describe either  different effects of the terminal dues system on USPS, all designated  postal operators, or other stakeholders. Some of these studies also try  to measure how terminal dues rate increases may affect these  stakeholders. Our review determined that these models and analyses can  help inform stakeholders about the different overall effects of terminal  dues. However, we also found that the analyses are limited in how they  can predict or describe the effect of the terminal dues system, in part due  to a lack of complete information on the following issues:  the volume of mail, including its type and weight, that flows between  each UPU member country; equivalent domestic postage rates that would be charged to domestic  mailers for service equivalent to inbound terminal dues mail;  the presence of alternative international mail agreements, such as  bilateral and multilateral agreements;  the number of U.S. businesses and consumers that receive or send  international mail covered by terminal dues rates;  the number and market characteristics of U.S. businesses that  currently compete with imported products that are sent under terminal  dues; how terminal dues rates and changes in those rates would affect  supply chains between businesses in the U.S. and other countries;  and,  the share of postage costs of U.S. businesses for outbound mail that  is covered by the terminal dues system and the proportion of total  business costs; how important postage and shipping costs are to total  costs of doing business, domestically and globally.", "Our analysis also found that some of the models and analyses we  reviewed did not make adjustments to factor in some or all of these  potential mail-related changes, such as changes in:  volume of international mail reimbursed by terminal dues changes in  response to increases in terminal dues rates or changes in other  international mail products offered by USPS or express consignment  operators; monetary exchange rates, as all terminal dues are denominated in  Special Drawing Rights, a combination of five major currencies, which  all vary over time, introducing uncertainty to any projection of terminal  dues rates; and, other international trade issues, such as customs duties, tariffs, labor  costs, other shipping costs, and regulatory costs.", "In the absence of models or analyses that take these factors into account,  it is difficult to quantify the impact of terminal dues rate increases on other  domestic stakeholders."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to the Terminal Dues System Mainly Benefit USPS, While the Effects on Other Stakeholders Are Unclear", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USPS Offers Several Alternatives to the Terminal Dues System for International Mail", "paragraphs": ["Not all international mail is sent through the terminal dues system. USPS  officials and mail stakeholders told us and USPS data indicate that  mailers send a significant portion of U.S. inbound and outbound  international mail using the following alternatives: bilateral and multilateral  agreements, parcels, express mail service, and direct entry. USPS data  show that that while terminal dues as a percentage of inbound  international mail volume increased from about 50 percent in fiscal year  2012 to about 60 percent in fiscal year 2016, a significant portion of  international mail comes into the United States via these alternatives.", "Each of these alternatives is described in greater detail below.", "USPS negotiates bilateral and multilateral agreements for a  number of countries, wherein USPS and other designated postal  operators both pay higher rates for different mail products (inbound  and outbound) with desirable features not available for terminal dues  mail, such as tracking and faster delivery. For example, USPS is  party to the multilateral PRIME agreement, which gives priority  delivery and performance bonuses (paid in addition to terminal dues)  to mail from 31 countries. According to USPS officials, bilateral and  multilateral agreements have improved USPS\u2019s financial position. In  reviewing these agreements, PRC has found that they improve  USPS\u2019s financial position relative to what it would have been in the  absence of these agreements.", "USPS offers products that provide UPU parcel service for both  inbound and outbound mail, which includes tracking, liability  insurance, and signature confirmation at delivery. Parcels are sent  under UPU parcel rates, which are higher than what USPS would  receive under the terminal dues system for comparable letter mail.  USPS also offers \u201ce-Commerce Parcel,\u201d a new parcel service  established by the UPU in 2016. The e-Commerce Parcel product is  aimed at the e-commerce marketplace and provides tracking, but no  liability or signature confirmation. Under e-Commerce Parcel,  designated postal operators determine the inbound delivery rates,  which are expected to be lower than parcel service due to the service  limitations. USPS officials stated that they are implementing the e- Commerce parcel service and reviewing its pricing strategy.", "USPS also provides Express Mail Service (also referred to as EMS)  for both inbound and outbound international mail. Express Mail  Service products provide express delivery of documents and  merchandise, which take priority over other postal services and  include signature confirmation and liability insurance for damaged or  lost mail. Express Mail Service rates for inbound products can be set  by bilateral agreements or determined by the receiving designated  postal operator. During fiscal year 2016, inbound Express Mail  Service products included shipments from 149 countries, including  China, Japan, Korea, Canada, and France. Express Mail Service  products for outbound U.S. mail include Priority Mail Express  International service, a high-speed USPS mail service available to  certain countries and available at designated USPS facilities, and  Global Express Guaranteed service, a USPS international expedited  delivery service provided through an alliance with FedEx.", "Mailers use direct entry as a way of accessing USPS domestic mail  services from foreign countries without sending the item through a  foreign designated postal operator. Under USPS\u2019s Global Direct Entry  Wholesaler Program, third party companies, such as foreign e- commerce businesses selling products in the United States, send the  items to the United States as cargo that bypasses designated postal  operators, circumventing the terminal dues system entirely. Once the  items clear customs, they are entered to USPS\u2019s system at domestic  postage rates. Some of these items are entered into USPS\u2019s system  outside of USPS\u2019s Global Direct Entry Wholesaler Program. For  example, we spoke with a representative of a U.S. company that  provides direct entry services for foreign mailers, preparing items for  easier entry through customs, for example by labeling items with  barcodes that describe the product, and for USPS by applying U.S.  domestic postage. The company representative stated that once the  items clear customs, the company transports the items to one of 140  USPS distribution points (i.e. USPS\u2019s domestic mail processing  facilities) to facilitate timely and efficient delivery.", "As we discuss in more detail later, these alternatives may offer various  benefits and disadvantages to customers that may choose them based on  a combination of price, available features, and speed of delivery."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Alternatives to the Terminal Dues System Mainly Benefit USPS and U.S. Consumers, While the Effects on Other Stakeholders Are Unclear and Difficult to Quantify", "paragraphs": ["USPS officials stated that alternatives to the terminal dues system earn  increased net revenue for USPS, for example,", "Rates negotiated as part of bilateral and multilateral agreements, UPU  parcel rates, and Express Mail Service product rates set by USPS are  higher than terminal dues rates; this difference means negotiated  rates provide better cost coverage and generate higher net revenues  than terminal dues rates.", "Direct entry mail generates greater net revenue for USPS, because  shippers enter the mail directly into USPS\u2019s domestic mail stream at  domestic postal rates. USPS also realizes operational efficiencies  from these alternatives due to mail entry and preparation  requirements, leading to lower USPS costs. Direct entry mail is  subject to the same preparation requirements as domestic mail  entered in bulk quantities, such as being presorted and entered close  to its final destination.", "Although alternatives to the terminal dues system account for a significant  portion of international mail handled by USPS, terminal dues mail  continues to grow at a higher rate. From fiscal year 2012 to fiscal year  2016, the volumes of (1) USPS terminal dues mail, (2) mail covered by  bilateral and multilateral agreements, and (3) parcels increased, while  Express Mail Service volume decreased.", "U.S. consumers may also benefit from all four alternatives due to faster  delivery than under the terminal dues system and from special features  such as tracking, especially for higher-value items. However, U.S.  consumers may pay more to use these alternatives given the special  features they offer.", "The effects of the alternatives on ECOs are unclear. Representatives  from ECOs told us that USPS bilateral and multilateral agreement mail  products and Express Mail Service products enjoy certain advantages,  such as easier customs clearance, that make USPS\u2019s products more  attractive to customers. However, the representatives added that the  effects of USPS bilateral agreements on their business are unclear,  because USPS considers the rates to be proprietary information that is  not publicly available. The representatives also noted that they did not  believe their products are able to compete directly with USPS bilateral  and multilateral mail products because the rates for these products are  based on comparatively low terminal dues rates. A 2015 USPS OIG study  found that ECOs\u2019 rates are generally much higher than rates for USPS  bilateral agreement and direct entry products, therefore ECOs\u2019 products  are not price competitive with USPS\u2019s products. Express Mail Service  and parcel products are priced higher than terminal dues rates and offer  special features similar to those offered by ECOs, such as priority  shipping and tracking, making those products more attractive for higher  value and time sensitive items, and thus may compete with ECOs\u2019  products.", "The effects of the alternatives on other international mail stakeholders,  such as U.S. businesses that are affected by inbound or outbound  international mail, are also unclear. For example, USPS bilateral  agreements may increase mailer options by providing faster service and  more product features, all at a lower price that discourages competition  from ECOs. However, the full effects of bilateral agreements are unclear,  in part because these rates are not public. The extent that U.S.  businesses related to outbound mail have access to and use direct entry  options into other countries is also unclear. In addition, other non-postal  related factors such as monetary exchange rates and product prices  affect the competitiveness of U.S. businesses that are affected by  inbound or outbound mail could be more important than mailing prices to  their international competitiveness.", "It is also difficult to quantify the effects of alternatives to the terminal dues  system because of limited information. The information needed to  determine the effects on domestic stakeholders from Express Mail  Service products and bilateral agreements are not publicly available, as  USPS regards this information as business proprietary. Effects on  stakeholders from direct entry mail are also unclear, in part because this  type of inbound mail may be difficult to distinguish from other domestic  USPS mail, and information on direct entry mail is not collected by USPS.  Use of alternatives also depends on terminal dues rates and other  factors, such as overall mail volume trends, and the models and analyses  we reviewed do not take these alternatives into account when modeling  international mail trends. For example, none of the models and analyses  we reviewed took into account bilateral agreements due to the lack of  publicly available information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to USPS, PRC, and the Department of  State for their review and comment.

Relevant legal sources that we reviewed  include Title 39 of the U.S. Code and the 2006 Postal Accountability and  Enhancement Act. In addition, we reviewed the UPU constitution, UPU  general regulations, and UPU agreements reached at the 2016 UPU  congress, which define the terminal dues system. We reviewed  documents of State\u2019s Advisory Committee on International Postal and  Delivery Services under the Federal Advisory Committee Act, including  minutes and proposals, and USPS and USPS OIG reports on terminal  dues and international mail flows. We also reviewed related studies by  third parties, including PRC-sponsored reports by Copenhagen  Economics on the economic impacts of terminal dues and other terminal  dues related reports. In addition, we reviewed GAO reports on related  postal issues, as well as relevant academic literature, industry journals,  books, and other publications, including news articles. We analyzed  available USPS information for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 on  international mail to and from the United States and to and from UPU- designated target and transitional countries to determine the most  significant mail flows.

These models and analyses were taken from  the published academic literature, economic papers, government reports,  and government analyses. The studies used a range of methodologies  from simulation modeling to experimental methods, in part due to the  paucity of data on a number of variables such as trade flows or how  terminal dues affect certain stakeholders, such as consumers and  businesses. Our overall review of the studies was based on economic  criteria and GAO guidance which included: the purpose of the model, the  assumptions used, the data or lack of data, model validation methods,  transparency of the model and data, sensitivity analysis, and peer review.  Where appropriate, we also compared the results of the models or  analyses to other similar modeling results. The analyses we assessed  address different questions relating to various mail stakeholders. We  determined that these analyses appropriately include, though with certain  limitations, the key elements of an economic analysis.
