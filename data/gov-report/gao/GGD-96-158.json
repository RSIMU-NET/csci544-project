GAO believes that future comparative studies of public and private correctional facilities should: (1) focus on both operational costs and quality of service; (2) evaluate operational costs at existing comparable, not hypothetical, facilities; (3) employ multiple indicators or data sources to objectively measure quality of service issues; and (4) be based upon data collected over several years."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 1991, when we issued our earlier report on private prisons, various jurisdictions and levels of government have made or planned greater use of this alternative to publicly run correctional facilities. At the federal level, plans for privatization of correctional facilities have changed in recent years. For example, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 1996 budget proposal reflected a commitment to increase the use of privatized correctional facilities in the federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP). Specifically, under the BOP privatization initiative presented in the budget request, the bureau proposed to contract with private firms, where most appropriate, to operate the majority of all future federal pretrial detention facilities as well as the majority of all future federal minimum- and low-security correctional facilities. The Department of Justice\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget justification projected the activation of two privatized facilities in that year. However, in June 1996, the Justice Department reversed its plans for using private contractors to operate the facilities identified in the 1996 and 1997 budget proposals. In explaining its decision to staff these facilities with BOP employees, the Justice Department noted that it was \u201cunable contractually to reduce the risk of a strike or walk out\u201d of correctional officers employed by private firms.", "Proponents of privatization assert that the experiences of several states demonstrate that private contractors can operate prisons at less cost than the government, without reducing the levels or quality of service. In contrast, other observers say there is little or no valid evidence that privatization of corrections is a cost-effective alternative to publicly run facilities.", "To help frame the continuing deliberations of the Justice Department\u2019s privatization plans, we self-initiated this review to (1) identify studies (completed since 1991) comparing the operational costs and/or the quality of service of private and public correctional facilities; (2) determine, based on these studies, what could be concluded regarding the operational costs and/or quality of service of comparable private and public facilities; (3) assess whether the reported results are generalizable to correctional systems in other jurisdictions; and (4) identify lessons learned to help guide future comparative studies of private and public correctional facilities. Our work basically was a form of evaluation synthesis whereby we assessed existing studies, particularly with respect to the strength of evidence supporting the reported findings. Appendix I presents further details about our objectives, scope, and methodology. We are addressing this report to you because of your Subcommittee\u2019s interest in prison issues, as exemplified by the hearings you held on June 8, 1995.", "We conducted our work from June 1995 to June 1996 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. We received oral comments on a draft of this report from BOP and written comments from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs; the National Council on Crime and Delinquency; and a Northeastern University (Boston, MA) professor of criminal justice, who is a nationally recognized authority on corrections administration. These comments and our evaluation of them are discussed at the end of this letter."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["A generally accepted evaluation criterion is that any comparative study of private and public prisons should be based upon the selection and analysis of similar facilities. For example, the private and public prisons selected for comparison should be as similar as possible regarding design and capacity, security level, and types of inmates. Otherwise, any comparative analysis of operational costs or quality of service could be skewed. On a per-inmate basis, for instance, higher security prisons can be expected to have higher operating costs than lower security prisons because the former type of facilities generally have higher staff-to-inmate ratios.", "Even if similar private and public prisons are available for study, a comparison of operational costs can still present difficulties in ensuring that all costs, direct and indirect, are consistently and fully quantified. Possible difficulties can arise due, in part, to differences in budgeting and accounting practices between and even within the private and public sectors. Determining the appropriate allocation of corporate headquarters overhead and government agency overhead, for instance, can be particularly difficult.", "Comparing the quality of service at private and public prisons also presents challenges and, in fact, can be more difficult than comparing costs. The concept of \u201cquality\u201d is neither easily defined nor measured. For example, although the American Correctional Association (ACA) sets accreditation standards for prisons, accredited facilities can vary widely in terms of overall quality. According to ACA officials, such variances occur because ACA accreditation means that a facility has met minimum standards.", "Generally, however, assessments of quality can take several approaches. For example, one is a compliance approach, that is, assessing whether or to what extent the prisons being compared are in compliance with applicable ACA standards and/or other relevant policy and procedural guidelines and/or court orders and consent decrees. Another approach is to assess performance measures. For example, measures of safety could include assault statistics, safety inspection results, and accidental injury reports.", "The difficulties of comparatively assessing private and public prisons\u2014regarding operational costs and/or quality of service\u2014are further complicated if the prisons are not located in the same state. Each state and its correctional system have characteristics and conditions that must be recognized in conducting interstate analyses. For example, economic conditions and cost-of-living factors can vary by state and by regions of the nation. Similarly, each state\u2019s correctional system may be somewhat unique regarding the extent of overcrowding, the history of court intervention, the emphasis given to ACA accreditation, and the presence or influence of various other factors. As an illustration, with respect to the five studies we reviewed, appendix III presents state-specific details regarding some relevant factors that could affect interstate comparisons of prison costs and/or quality of service."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Five Comparative Studies Completed Since 1991", "paragraphs": ["On the basis of extensive literature searches and inquiries with knowledgeable corrections officials and criminal justice researchers (see app. I), we identified five studies completed since 1991 that compared private and public prisons in reference to operational costs and/or quality of service. The following is a brief overview of each study:", "Texas study (1991): Conducted by the Texas Sunset Advisory Commission, this study compared (1) the actual costs of operating four privately managed prerelease minimum-security facilities for male prisoners and (2) the estimated costs of operating similar but hypothetical public facilities in Texas. The study did not empirically assess quality of service.", "New Mexico study (1991): Funded by the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Prisons, and the National Institute of Corrections, this study compared the quality of service at three multicustody facilities (minimum- to maximum-security levels) for women, i.e., a private prison and a state-run prison in New Mexico and a federal prison in West Virginia. The study did not include a detailed analysis of operational costs.", "California study (1994): Conducted by California State University with funding from the California Department of Corrections, this study focused on three community correctional facilities for males. All three facilities were operated (under contracts with the state) as for-profit alternatives to state-operated prisons. One facility (medium-security) was operated by a private corporation, the second (high-security) by a local police department, and the third (low- to medium-security) by a city administration. The study compared operational and construction costs and quality of service. More specifically, regarding costs, the study compared the three facilities (1) with one another and (2) with other state correctional facilities. Both operational and construction costs were included in the comparison of the three facilities with one another. The statewide comparison did not include construction costs for the California Department of Corrections facilities. Regarding quality of service, the study compared the three facilities with two state facilities.", "Tennessee study (1995): Conducted in two parts, one for operational costs and one for quality of service, by the Tennessee state legislature, this study compared three of Tennessee\u2019s multicustody (minimum- to maximum-security) prisons for male inmates. One prison was privately managed, and the other two were state-run prisons.", "Washington study (1996): At the time of this study, the state of Washington had no privately run prisons but was considering the feasibility of such. Therefore, the study, conducted by the Washington State Legislative Budget Committee, analyzed pertinent information available in other states. Regarding operational costs, for, example, the study looked at the three Tennessee facilities (mentioned above) as well as three multicustody male prisons in Louisiana (two private and one public). Regarding quality of service, the study compared the three Tennessee facilities, the three Louisiana facilities, and two Washington facilities.", "In summary, the California, Tennessee, and Washington studies assessed operational costs and quality of service. The Texas study analyzed operational costs only, and the New Mexico study analyzed quality of service only."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Drawing Conclusions From the Five Studies", "paragraphs": ["While the five studies varied in terms of methodological rigor, they do, to differing degrees, offer some indication of comparative operational costs and/or quality of service in the specific settings they assessed. However, regarding operational costs, because the studies reported little difference and/or mixed results in comparing private and public facilities, we could not conclude whether privatization saved money. Similarly, regarding quality of service, of the two studies that made the most detailed comparative assessments, one study (New Mexico) reported equivocal findings, and the other study (Tennessee) reported no difference between the compared private and public facilities."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Comparisons of Operational Costs Indicated Little Difference And/or Mixed Results", "paragraphs": ["Four of the five studies (Texas, California, Tennessee, and Washington) assessed operational costs of private and public correctional facilities. In three of the studies (California, Tennessee, and Washington), comparisons of private and public facilities indicated little or some differences in operational costs. Only the Texas study reported finding substantially lower (14- to 15-percent) operational costs for private versus public correctional facilities.", "Using fiscal year 1990 data, the Texas study reported average daily operational costs of $36.76 per inmate for the private facilities, compared with estimates of $42.70 to $43.13 for the public facilities. However, the results of the Texas study are not fully based on actual experience. Rather, the study compared existing private facilities (prerelease institutions) to hypothetical public facilities. This type of hypothetical comparison does not allow for consideration of any unanticipated changes in components such as staffing levels, other expenses, rate of occupied bed space, or many other factors that could affect actual costs. Changes in any single assumption, or set of assumptions, for the hypothetical institutions could change the size or even the direction of the differences in the comparative operational costs.", "Based upon our experience in designing and assessing evaluation methodologies, we found the Tennessee study (of the studies we reviewed) to have the most sound and detailed comparison of operational costs of private and public correctional facilities. The study compared three mixed-population (minimum- to maximum-security) institutions (one private and two public). All three facilities were located in Tennessee, and all three had relatively comparable inmate populations, in terms of numbers and most demographics, except race. Also, direct and indirect costs were considered in the analysis, and representatives from both the private and the public facilities agreed on the cost components and relevant adjustments prior to data collection. The analysis showed very little difference in average inmate costs per day among the three facilities\u2014$35.39 for the private facility and $34.90 and $35.45, respectively, for the two public facilities.", "The Washington study, which made intrastate comparisons of correctional facilities (minimum- and maximum-security populations) in Tennessee and Louisiana, also found very little difference in the operational costs of private and public facilities. For Tennessee, the private facilities\u2019 average daily operational costs per inmate ($33.61) were lower (about 7 percent) than the comparable costs for the two public facilities studied ($35.82 and $35.28, respectively). It should be noted that the Tennessee facilities, which were analyzed and reported on in the 1996 Washington state study, were the same facilities that are discussed in the 1995 Tennessee study cited above. For Louisiana, the average inmate costs per day for the two private facilities studied were $23.75 and $23.34, respectively, and the comparable daily operational costs for the public facility studied were $23.55 per inmate.", "The 1994 California study compared three for-profit community correctional facilities located in that state\u2014one run by a private firm and two run by local governments. The study found that the private facility\u2019s average annual costs per inmate ($15,578) were higher than comparable costs for one of the government-run facilities ($13,195) but were lower than such costs for the other government-run facility ($16,627). The lower cost government-run facility had a disproportionate share of drug offenders, which could have affected overall costs. Further, the authors of the study noted that the results of this study must be viewed with some additional caution because of inconsistencies in the underlying or supporting cost figures obtained from different sources within the state."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comparisons of Quality Are Unclear", "paragraphs": ["Although comparative costs are very important, they are not the only factors considered by policymakers in deciding the direction or extent of corrections privatization. A principal concern is whether private contractors can operate at lower costs to the taxpayers, while providing the same or even a better level of service as the public sector, particularly with respect to safety and security issues.", "Of the studies we reviewed, two (New Mexico and Tennessee) assessed the comparative quality of service between private and public institutions in much greater detail than the other studies. Both studies used structured data-collection instruments to cover a variety of quality-related topics, including safety and security, management, personnel, health care, discipline reports, escapes, and inmate programs and activities. The New Mexico study reported equivocal findings, and the Tennessee study reported no difference in quality between the compared private and public institutions.", "The findings in the New Mexico study are difficult to interpret. On the basis of surveys of correctional staff and reviews of institutional records, the study reported that the private prison \u201coutperformed\u201d the public facilities on most of the measured quality dimensions. However, the author noted that the results from one of the data-collection instruments\u2014the inmate surveys\u2014showed an opposite result, with one of the public facilities \u201coutperforming\u201d the private facility on every dimension except inmate activities (e.g., work and training programs).", "The Tennessee study, in assessing the quality of service at one private and two public prisons, reported that \u201call three facilities were operated at essentially the same level of performance.\u201d This conclusion was largely based on the results of an operational audit conducted at each of the facilities by an inspection team. Composed of private and public sector members, the team used a structured survey instrument to conduct a detailed review of records, observe operations and practices, and conduct interviews.", "The Texas study did not empirically assess the quality of service at the private correctional facilities. Rather, the study noted that all four of the privately operated prerelease facilities were in general compliance with 11 of the 16 mandates of court rulings applicable to Texas prisons. Also, the study noted that two of the four private facilities had received ACA accreditation, and the other two were still involved in the accreditation process. ACA officials told us, however, that ACA accreditation means that a facility has met minimum standards and that accredited facilities can vary widely in terms of overall quality. To reiterate, because it was based on hypothetical public facilities, the Texas study made no attempt to comparatively assess the quality of service across private and public facilities in Texas.", "The California study, in assessing quality of service, used inmate and staff surveys to compare the three community correctional facilities with two state prisons. However, the results could not be generalized to the inmate or staff populations of the respective facilities because small, nonrandom samples were used.", "The California study also attempted to compare the three community correctional facilities with the state\u2019s other correctional institutions with respect to recidivism rates. The study reported that, of the three community correctional facilities, one of the publicly managed facilities was \u201cmost impressive\u201d in performance based on recidivism rates. Sufficient data were not available to adequately complete the analysis comparing the inmates released from the community correctional facilities with inmates released from other correctional institutions in the state.", "The Washington study assessed the quality of service at the three facilities (one private and two public) in Tennessee, three facilities (two private and one public) in Louisiana, and two facilities (both public) in Washington. While not as detailed as the New Mexico and the Tennessee studies, the Washington study concluded that the private and public prisons studied within the respective states (Tennessee and Louisiana) were generally similar in quality of service. However, the study noted that Washington\u2019s two state-run facilities had more counselors per inmate than the other states\u2019 facilities."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Generalizability of the Studies\u2019 Results", "paragraphs": ["The few studies that have compared the operational costs and/or the quality of service of private and public prisons provide little information that is widely applicable to various correctional settings. For example, while these studies compared private and public facilities that generally were similar (in terms of capacities, inmate demographics, etc.), the selected facilities were not necessarily typical or representative of prisons in either the state studied or other jurisdictions. Also, a variety of factors that relate to a given location or correctional system may render the experience of one jurisdiction with private prisons very different from that of another. Further, the passage of time could alter the relationship between private and public correctional facilities in terms of costs and quality. For these reasons, among others, the few studies that we reviewed do not permit drawing generalizable conclusions about the comparative operational costs and/or quality of service of private and public prisons.", "Jurisdictions, such as states, vary on several dimensions that could have an impact on the comparative costs of private versus public prisons and, in turn, affect the generalizability of a given study\u2019s results. First, other states\u2019 correctional philosophies could differ from that of the states studied. Some state correctional philosophies are more punitive in nature (as reflected, for example, by higher incarceration rates), whereas other states are less punitive and more inclined toward treatment. California, for example, which is one of the states discussed in the five studies we reviewed, generally has had incarceration rates above the national average. Also, the Washington study noted that the adjusted estimated per-bed costs for a state-run facility in Washington ($60,400) were almost double Florida\u2019s costs ($33,900) due, in part, to state differences in operating and programming approaches.", "Second, jurisdictions also vary in relation to a variety of economic factors that could affect the relationship between private and public prison costs. Differences in the costs of living could affect both private and public prison costs, but in some jurisdictions, one more than the other. For example, a labor shortage could result in higher operational costs for private and public prisons.", "Third, in some jurisdictions, the inmate population to be incarcerated in private facilities may be different from those inmate populations in the five studies. Three of the five studies focused on inmate populations that were not representative of the broader prison population\u2014prerelease prisoners (Texas study), female prisoners (New Mexico), and those housed in community correctional facilities (California). Only two studies (Tennessee and Washington) focused on costs in relation to facilities housing a more mainstream prisoner population.", "Finally, regarding both operational costs and quality of service, the comparative performance of private versus public correctional facilities is not likely to be static. Changes over time could alter the comparative performance. For example, the first year of a new prison\u2014either private or public\u2014could reflect expenses for training inexperienced staff as well as hiring replacements for those unsuited to the work. Inexperienced staff could also have a negative effect on some measures of quality. Also, in the initial years of managing a prison, a private firm may choose to bill for its services at rates below costs to obtain or extend a contract. As time goes by, however, to remain a viable business entity, the contractor\u2019s cost-recovery practices would have to change. Similarly, over time, public prisons could become more cost efficient in response to competition from the private sector. For instance, this conclusion was reached by the Washington study, which was commissioned to help the state determine the potential benefits of privatization."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lessons Learned for Future Comparative Studies", "paragraphs": ["The results of studies comparing private and public prisons obviously are of interest to any jurisdiction whose policymakers are deciding whether or to what extent corrections should be privatized. Ideally, to be most useful, such studies should be based upon representative samples of prisons, with sufficient statistical controls in place to measure and account for any differences. However, because the number of private correctional facilities is still relatively small (see app. IV)\u2014and, given the fact that each stand-alone facility (whether private or public) may have some unique characteristics\u2014conducting a truly optimal comparative evaluation may be impractical.", "Nonetheless, the five studies completed since 1991 offer several lessons learned to guide future studies, even if such studies focus on comparing only one private facility and one public facility. In reviewing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each study to formulate lessons learned, we largely relied on our extensive experience in designing and assessing evaluation methodologies\u2014that is, our experience with generally accepted methodological standards and practices. Specifically, on the basis of our review of the five studies, we identified the following lessons learned: In considering the extent to which corrections should be privatized, a key question is whether private contractors can operate at lower costs to taxpayers, while providing at least the same level of service as the public sector, particularly with respect to security and safety issues. Thus, it is important that any study focus on both operational costs and quality of service. Two of the studies we reviewed (Texas and New Mexico) did not have this dual focus.", "The best approach for evaluating operational costs is to study existing comparable facilities, not hypothetical facilities. One of the studies we reviewed (Texas) used hypothetical similar public facilities.", "Generally, there is more than one way to objectively measure or compare prison security, safety, order, and various other dimensions that constitute quality of service. In this regard, it is important to use multiple indicators or data sources to provide cross-checks. The New Mexico study, for example, illustrates that divergent results can be reached by using one data source (e.g., inmate surveys) versus another source (e.g., staff surveys).", "Comparative findings with respect to operational costs and/or quality of service in any given year may not hold true for other years. Similarly, because trends are not self-perpetuating, even findings based on multiyear comparisons must be carefully considered. Nonetheless, all other factors being equal, comparative evaluations based upon several years\u2019 data potentially have more value than evaluations based upon 1 or 2 years of data. Nearly all five of the studies we reviewed were based upon 1 or 2 years of data. \u201cI know that the Attorney General and . . .  are very interested in working carefully with us in the Bureau of Prisons to track, on these new contracts, very carefully, what the cost impact truly is, because there are a lot of hidden costs in privatization . . . here has never been, we don\u2019t believe, a real good cost analysis to determine, apples to apples, what is the cost of a traditional prison system and private contracting. The private contractors claim they can do it at great savings, and so we are very interested in monitoring the ones that we have projected for the next few years and determining . . . how well the taxpayers are being served on either side.\u201d", "The BOP Director noted that by contracting out the management of selected facilities incarcerating general inmate populations, BOP was moving to the \u201cnext level of privatization,\u201d which would provide a good basis for comparative evaluations focusing on \u201clike or similar institutions.\u201d In this regard, the lessons learned from previous comparative studies should be useful to BOP if the federal privatization initiative is revisited."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We obtained oral comments on a draft of this report from BOP and written comments from the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Justice Programs; the National Council on Crime and Delinquency; and a Northeastern University (Boston, MA) professor of criminal justice, who is a nationally recognized authority on corrections administration.", "BOP commented that the report was accurate, well done, and useful.", "The Office of the Assistant Attorney General, Office of Justice Programs, concurred with the report and noted that additional study of the privatization of correctional facilities is needed. The National Institute of Justice, a component agency of the Office of Justice Programs, commented that the report appeared \u201cto be as comprehensive as the available data permits.\u201d Also, the Institute commented that the report\u2019s discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the five studies \u201cis excellent.\u201d", "In commenting on the draft, the Executive Vice President, National Council on Crime and Delinquency, said that the report is accurate in concluding that few studies have been completed to date and that these studies have methodological problems that limit understanding the actual cost-benefits of privatization. He noted, however, that our report could place more emphasis on the Tennessee study, which is the most rigorous study to date. Although we concur with the reviewer\u2019s assessment of the study, our objective was to provide similar information for each of the studies reviewed. Further, he noted that the report could add more emphasis to evaluating the claims of private providers that they can construct new facilities faster and cheaper than public entities. Since the studies reviewed did not assess these claims, this issue was beyond the scope of our work.", "The Northeastern University reviewer commented that (1) our evaluation synthesis was an important contribution to the corrections field, (2) the report\u2019s conclusion that the five studies offer little generalizable guidance for other jurisdictions regarding the comparative cost and quality of service of private and public correctional facilities was \u201cright on point,\u201d and (3) our cautions concerning interstate comparisons were \u201cwell-founded.\u201d", "However, the reviewer underscored the need also to focus privatization research on crime reduction and various philosophical questions underpinning the privatization debate. These issues were beyond the scope of our work. In addition, the reviewer suggested that it would be valuable to the corrections field if the report included a short, concise statement describing the critical dependent and independent variables that should be considered in comparative analyses of private and public corrections facilities. Because of variations in available data and possible measurement adjustments required in specific research situations, we are hesitant to prescribe what variables should be studied. The studies reviewed, however, suggest possible variables. Furthermore, citing the difficulties researchers have in accessing data from private firms, the reviewer proposed that the report contain a recommendation that would facilitate researchers\u2019 access to proprietary information needed for evaluation of private corrections. In the case of federal corrections-related contracts, we would likely have access to data, but we have considerably less jurisdiction at the state level.", "We are providing copies of this report to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the House Judiciary Committee, the Attorney General; the Director, BOP; and other interested parties.

Based on requirements specified in state statute, the state estimated the costs of operating similar state-run prerelease facilities. Specifically, because similar state-run facilities did not exist, the state estimated the costs of operating hypothetical state-run prerelease facilities. Contract provisions stipulated that contractors would receive at least 10 percent less than the estimated costs for the state to operate each facility. Therefore, in a sense, 10-percent \u201csavings\u201d to the state was guaranteed. Cost data for fiscal year 1990 were analyzed. The state estimated that the privatized facilities achieved 14- to 15-percent cost savings (taking into consideration tax revenues paid to state and local authorities) compared with hypothetically equivalent state-run facilities. The average daily operational costs per inmate for the private facilities were $36.76. Because of staffing and construction differences between the contractors, separate costs were estimated for the hypothetical state operation of a facility for each contractor. The estimated average daily operational costs per inmate for the hypothetical state-run facilities were $42.70 for one contractor and $43.13 for the other. However, because the state did not operate any prerelease facilities nor did any of its existing facilities have prerelease components, the cost estimates for the state-run facilities were not based on actual state experience.

The inmates at the New Mexico facilities were nearly similar with respect to characteristics of age, race, and offense type. However, they differed from the federal inmates in race and offense type. The study indicated that one of the factors enhancing the comparability of the two New Mexico institutions was that both were applying for accreditation by the American Correctional Association (ACA).

First, the operational costs of the one private and the two public prisons in Tennessee (actual data for July 1993 through June 1994) were compared, as were the operational costs of the two private prisons and the one public prison in Louisiana (estimated data for July 1995 through June 1996). The unadjusted operational costs of the three Tennessee facilities were similar. However, after adjustments to equalize the numbers of inmates, the private facility\u2019s average daily operational costs per inmate ($33.61) were slightly lower than the comparable costs for the two public facilities ($35.82 and $35.28, respectively).

The study showed that the average daily operational costs per inmate for the Washington facility ($44.52) were higher than the costs for the Tennessee ($37.07) and the Louisiana ($24.04) facilities.", "The comparison of the Washington facility with the Tennessee and the Louisiana facilities was problematic. While the facilities were similar in capacity, there were differences in inmate demographics, such as race and offense type. Other factors (e.g., cost-of-living differences) served to complicate further the interstate comparisons. In any event, these interstate cost comparisons involved state-run facilities only and did not consider any private facilities.", "Further, the Washington study looked at construction costs by comparing the estimated costs for Washington state to construct a planned multicustody public prison for males with a private company that was constructing a similar facility in Florida. In making the interstate comparison, the study noted that it focused on the \u201cmajor elements contributing to capital costs,\u201d which included amounts and types of facility space, actual construction costs, and ancillary construction costs such as design and administration.", "Although the Washington study noted that the facilities were comparable in terms of size and inmate mix (e.g., \u201clarge multicustody\u201d), it made cost and space programming adjustments to the facilities to further equalize the comparison. For instance, land and site-related costs, taxes, and unique local costs were excluded from the comparison. For the Florida facility, the study made upward cost adjustments to account for differences between the two facilities in labor and material costs, the later completion (about 2 years of construction inflation) of the Washington facility, and state oversight of the construction. For the Washington facility, the study made downward cost adjustments to account for differences between the two facilities, such as budget reductions of 20 percent, and space reductions of 18 percent to account for differences in inmate security levels and other space allocations. In addition, the study made downward cost and space adjustments to reflect the Florida facility\u2019s lower mix of close custody beds.", "The study indicated that there were other differences in the space programming between the two facilities, for which no adjustments were made. For example, the Washington facility assumed single cells for \u201cClose Housing and Administrative Segregation,\u201d while the Florida facility assumed double cells for those beds. Also, the Washington facility\u2019s minimum-security beds had relatively high per-bed space allocations, reflecting the incorporation of service and program space in the housing calculation. The space allocations for the Florida facility, however, reflected medium-security beds with centralized program and service space.", "The study showed that the adjusted estimated per-bed cost for the Washington state facility ($60,400 per bed) was approximately double the estimated cost for the Florida facility ($33,900 per bed). The cost difference was explained largely as due to different operating and programming approaches or philosophies between the two states.", "The Washington study concluded that privatization per se would not result in cost savings to the state. Rather, the report noted that savings could be accomplished through privatization or through changes in the state\u2019s operational policies and practices. For example, savings directly related to privatization would be due primarily to a private company\u2019s flexibility to operate outside state rules and procedures, collective bargaining agreements, and the state\u2019s employee compensation system.", "Finally, the Washington study comparatively assessed the quality of service at the selected private and public prisons in Tennessee and Louisiana and two multicustody male facilities in Washington. While this portion of the study was not as detailed or as comprehensive as the portion involving costs, the quality assessment included visiting the prisons and reviewing institutional records for several topics, such as escapes, major disturbances, and inmate infractions.

Regional differences, such as cost of living, may affect comparisons with other states or regions. For example, the Washington state study adjusted Tennessee\u2019s operational costs upward by 20 percent to account for regional cost-of-living differences between the two states.", "By definition, prison overcrowding occurs when the number of inmates actually incarcerated exceeds the rated capacity of the correctional facility. As table III.1 shows, the extent of overcrowding (if any) varied among the five states studied\u2014at the time of initial privatization of selected correctional facilities within the respective state. For example, on January 1, 1991, California\u2019s prisons held 94,050 inmates, which was 41,352 inmates (or 78.5 percent) above the total rated capacity (52,698). In comparison, at that time, the average state correctional system was operating at 12.6 percent above rated capacity.", "Texas was not reporting overcrowding on January 1, 1989. However, most states, including Texas and the other states studied, have been involved, at some point, in litigation challenging various conditions of confinement, such as overcrowding, in their prisons. The following general descriptions are examples of prison litigation that have occurred in the states studied: In Texas, the Ruiz v. Estelle line of decisions includes a 1980 ruling, which found that various conditions (such as overcrowding and inadequate sanitation, recreational facilities, and health care) within the Texas Department of Corrections violated the U.S. Constitution. Thus, the court appointed special masters and monitors to supervise the implementation of and compliance with its decree. In New Mexico, the Duran v. Apodaca line of cases includes a 1980 consent decree that contained mandatory and prohibitive injunctions relating to conditions and practices at the state\u2019s penitentiary. Among other subjects, the consent decree addressed living conditions, medical and mental health care, and inmate discipline. In California, various court decisions in the 1980s addressed segregation procedures, double-celling, and other conditions of confinement at several prisons located in northern areas of the state. In Tennessee, the 1982 Grubbs v. Bradley decision found that certain practices and conditions of confinement at the state\u2019s adult penal institutions were unconstitutional. In Louisiana, in the 1977 Williams v. Edwards decision, the court held that conditions at the state penitentiary at Angola violated the U.S. Constitution and certain state laws.", "Another factor that could be considered in making interstate comparisons of correctional facilities is the extent of ACA accreditation. Obtaining ACA accreditation signifies that a facility has met minimum standards. ACA officials told us that, at the time of the respective state\u2019s initial privatization efforts, Texas and Louisiana had no ACA-accredited facilities; but New Mexico, California, and Tennessee had \u201csome\u201d accredited facilities. For these latter three states, the ACA officials were unable to specifically quantify the number of accredited facilities that existed when the respective state began its privatization efforts. However, the officials were able to tell us that, as of 1989, the state-run women\u2019s facility in New Mexico was not accredited by ACA.", "The degree of punitiveness of a corrections system, as reflected, for example, by the system\u2019s incarceration rate, may affect operating and programming approaches, and therefore, expectations of service. States with higher incarceration rates tend to be found in the west and south, although there is variation within regions. On December 31, 1988, Texas and New Mexico had incarceration rates of 240 and 180, respectively, while the national average rate for state institutions was 227. On December 31, 1990, the incarceration rates in California (311) and Louisiana (427) were higher than the national average rate for state institutions (227); Tennessee\u2019s incarceration rate, however, was lower (207).
