In response, the Command has transformed its headquarters to coordinate counterterrorism activities, and DOD has increased funding and the number of special operations forces positions. Given the expanded mission, it is critical that the Command has personnel with the right knowledge and skill sets. GAO was asked to assess: (1) whether the Command has determined all of the personnel requirements needed to meet its expanded role; (2) the progress and challenges in meeting growth goals; and (3) any effect of deployments on the Command's ability to provide trained forces, and the progress made in managing deployments. GAO performed its work at the Special Operations Command and its service components, analyzed personnel data against requirements, and examined policies and directives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD plans to significantly increase the number of special operations forces personnel, the Special Operations Command has not yet fully determined all of the personnel requirements needed to meet its expanded mission. While it has determined the number of personnel needed to increase its number of warfighter units, it has not completed analyses to determine (a) how many headquarters staff are needed to train and equip these additional warfighters or (b) how many headquarters staff are needed to plan and synchronize global actions against terrorist networks--a new mission for the Command. DOD plans to begin increasing the number of headquarters positions and has requested funds for these positions in its fiscal year 2007 budget request. Until these analyses are completed, the Special Operations Command cannot provide assurances to the Secretary of Defense and the Congress that currently planned growth in the number of personnel for the Command's headquarters will meet, exceed, or fall short of the requirements needed to address the Command's expanded mission. The military services and the Special Operations Command have made progress since fiscal year 2000 in recruiting, training, and retaining special operations forces personnel, but they must overcome persistently low personnel inventory levels and insufficient numbers of newly trained personnel, in certain specialties, to meet DOD's plan to increase the number of special operations forces. In addition, GAO's review of the service components' annual reports required by the Special Operations Command shows that the reports have not provided the information needed to determine whether they have enough personnel to meet current and future requirements. Without such information, the Command will be unable to determine whether the service components' human capital management approaches, including recruiting, training, and retention strategies, will be effective in meeting the planned growth targets. Since fiscal year 2000, the number of special operations forces personnel deployed for operations has greatly increased, and the number deployed for training has simultaneously decreased. The Special Operations Command has taken action to manage the challenge of increased deployments; in August 2005, it began requiring active duty personnel to remain at least an equal amount of time at home as deployed. But the Command's service components have not consistently or fully implemented this policy. This is because the policy lacks clear guidance on the length of time that the components must ensure that personnel remain within the deployment policy guidelines. In addition, officials with the Command's Army and Navy service components expressed concerns regarding the reliability of their information required to track the deployments of their personnel. Without consistent and reliable data, the Special Operations Command does not have the information it needs to effectively manage the personnel deployments of special operations forces, which affects its ability to maintain the readiness, retention, and training of these personnel."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) established the United States Special  The Department of Defense (DOD) established the United States Special  Operations Command (Command) in 1987 with the primary purpose to  Operations Command (Command) in 1987 with the primary purpose to  train and equip special operations forces and provide these forces to the  train and equip special operations forces and provide these forces to the  department\u2019s geographic combatant commands.

Similarly, the Air Force projects that the  additional active duty enlisted combat controller positions that have been  added in fiscal year 2006 will remain underfilled through at least fiscal  year 2008.", "Not only do current low personnel inventory levels suggest that the  military services and the Special Operations Command will be challenged  to meet planned growth goals, but officials told us that low personnel  levels in certain occupational specialties have created challenges at the  unit level as well. For example, officials from the U.S. Army Special  Operations Command told us that low personnel inventories of Special  Forces warrant officers and medical sergeants have resulted in their  having fewer numbers of these personnel per unit, which has limited the  manner in which some Special Forces units have deployed on the  battlefield. Similarly, the low personnel inventory levels in the Air Force  combat controller and pararescue occupational specialties have resulted  in the Air Force\u2019s special tactics squadrons being underfilled. According to  Air Force officials, the low personnel inventory levels in these units have  increased the frequency of personnel deployments, which has had an  impact on the amount of time available to conduct training and has  adversely affected retention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Insufficient Numbers of Some Special Operations Forces Personnel Graduates", "paragraphs": ["One reason that personnel inventory levels have been low in several  special operations forces occupational specialties is the schools that train  new special operations forces personnel have not graduated a sufficient  number of these personnel, in some cases, to meet authorized personnel  levels. Furthermore, the number of newly trained personnel in several  special operations forces specialties has been insufficient to meet planned  growth targets. For example:    The U.S. Army Special Operations Command is not graduating enough  new pilots for the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment to meet  future growth targets. In fiscal year 2005, the Command graduated only 58  percent of the MH-47 Chinook helicopter pilots and 47 percent of the MH- 60 Blackhawk helicopter pilots that the Army determined were needed to  meet planned growth for this unit. According to Army officials, the  capacity of the school that trains new pilots has been insufficient to meet  the requirements for future personnel levels. Officials stated that the  Special Operations Command has provided additional funding beginning  in fiscal year 2006 for the school to hire a greater number of instructors,  which will increase the capacity of the school to train these pilots.", "The Air Force has not produced a sufficient number of active duty enlisted  special tactics personnel, such as combat controllers and pararescue  personnel. For example, from fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, the  Air Force trained only 53 percent of the active duty enlisted combat  controllers and 40 percent of the active duty enlisted pararescue airmen  needed to meet authorized personnel levels. Air Force officials stated that  several constraints have limited the number of students who could attend  the schools that train these personnel. Officials explained the Air Force  has taken steps to increase the number of personnel that will graduate  from its special tactics training programs. For example, in August 2005, the  Air Force began construction on a new classroom and aquatic facility to  train greater numbers of combat controllers, and it recently opened a new  combat dive course to meet both combat controller and pararescue  training requirements. Such measures are intended to reduce the  constraints on the ability of the Air Force to train new special tactics  personnel.", "From fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, the Naval Special Warfare  Command did not produce an adequate number of enlisted SEALs to  sustain authorized personnel levels. While the Naval Special Warfare  Command needed to graduate 200 new enlisted SEALs each year to meet  authorized personnel levels, only about 150 new enlisted personnel  graduated each year during this period. In addition, Navy officials stated  that to meet the planned growth for SEALs, the Naval Special Warfare  Command must produce 250 enlisted SEALs annually. According to Navy  officials, it has recruited an insufficient number of enlisted candidates who  could successfully pass the physical test to qualify for SEAL training. As a  result, the Navy has not filled the SEAL school to capacity each year, and  this in turn has resulted in insufficient numbers of graduates to fill the  requirements for enlisted SEALs. According to officials, the Navy began to  implement several measures in January 2006 that, in part, are intended to  increase the quantity and quality of enlisted recruits entering SEAL  training, thereby improving the chances that more of these recruits will  successfully graduate from the training."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Special Operations Command Lacks Key Information Needed to Evaluate Human Capital Initiatives", "paragraphs": ["The Special Operations Command does not have complete information,  including measurable performance objectives and goals, to evaluate the  progress that the Command\u2019s service components have made in meeting  the human capital challenges that could impede the Command\u2019s ability to  achieve planned growth.", "The Special Operations Command has an established program through  which it monitors the status of its personnel. The goal of the program is to  ensure there are sufficient numbers of special operations forces personnel  to meet current and future mission requirements. The implementing  directive requires the special operations component commanders to  provide the Special Operations Command with annual reports that contain  data on several topics related to the human capital management of special  operations forces, including personnel inventory levels, accession plans,  reenlistments and loss management programs, and military education  opportunities for special operations forces officers. Command officials  told us they use these reports to monitor the status of special operations  forces.", "Our analysis of the service components\u2019 annual reports for fiscal years  2000 through 2005 shows that the reports provide some of the information  required by the directive, such as information on personnel inventory  levels and professional military education opportunities. However, the  reports have not provided information for several key requirements called  for by the directive that would provide information on the service  components\u2019 progress in meeting the planned growth targets. For  example, the service components are required to provide accession plans  for several of the special operations occupational specialties, including  Army Special Forces, Navy SEALs, and Air Force special tactics personnel.  The accession plans should provide detailed information on the number of  new accessions for initial training and projections for the following year.  Our review of the annual reports shows that since fiscal year 2003, none of  the service components\u2019 submissions contained this information.", "Additionally, the directive requires the service components to provide  detailed analyses to support each category discussed in the annual report,  including trends developed over recent years and predictions for the  future. Further, the annual reports should fully discuss any concerns by  describing the concern in context, providing past actions taken to resolve  the concern, and presenting recommendations to address the concern in  the future. However, our analysis of the components\u2019 annual submissions  shows that the reports have often failed to provide detailed analyses of  their human capital challenges and the corrective actions that should be  taken to address these challenges. For instance:    The U.S. Army Special Operations Command\u2019s annual report for fiscal year  2005 did not identify a 79 percent personnel fill rate for the Special Forces  medical sergeant occupational specialty as a challenge. However, officials  with whom we spoke indicated that insufficient numbers of these  personnel have limited both the operational capabilities of some deployed  Special Forces units and the ability to provide medical life-support to  personnel in these units. In other cases, the U.S. Army Special Operations  Command\u2019s annual reports identified challenges but did not propose  corrective actions. For example, the report for fiscal year 2005 states a  concern that, because the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment had  insufficient training resources, it produced only 50 percent of the  requirement for MH-47 Chinook helicopter pilots. However, the report did  not discuss in detail what actions should be taken to address this  challenge.", "Since its fiscal year 2000 annual report, the Air Force Special Operations  Command has identified a concern that the experience level of its rated  pilots has been decreasing. As a result, there have been an insufficient  number of aircraft commanders and instructor pilots within several of the  special operations squadrons. However, the Air Force Special Operations  Command\u2019s annual reports do not contain any information to support the  specific decrease in the number of experienced pilots in its special  operations forces units. Moreover, the reports do not specify how the  actions taken to address the issue have impacted the level of experience of  pilots, or what further actions are needed to address this challenge. In  addition, although the combat controller and pararescue occupational  specialties have been underfilled since at least fiscal year 2000, the Air  Force\u2019s annual reports have not provided detailed information on the  specific actions that should be taken to overcome the challenges of low  personnel inventory levels in these specialties.", "The Naval Special Warfare Command\u2019s annual reports have consistently  identified a critical challenge regarding the insufficient number of new  enlisted Navy SEALs who have graduated from the school each year.  Further, the reports provide some information on the actions taken in the  previous fiscal year to address this concern. However, the annual reports  have not included detailed information on the Naval Special Warfare  Command\u2019s accession plans, or the effects that recruit shortfalls have had  on personnel inventory levels, which are specifically required by the  directive.", "Furthermore, the service components\u2019 annual reports lack performance  objectives and goals that link key personnel data with future growth plans  and assessments of personnel needs. Our prior work has shown that high- performing organizations use relevant and reliable data to determine  performance objectives and goals that enable them to evaluate the success  of their human capital approaches. These organizations identify current  and future human capital needs, including the appropriate number of  employees, the key competencies and skills mix for mission  accomplishment, and the appropriate deployment of staff across the  organization, and then create strategies for identifying and filling gaps.  However, our analysis of the Command\u2019s Directive 600-7 shows that the  requirements for the annual reports do not include instructions for the  service components to develop performance objectives, goals, and  measures of progress for achieving planned growth. As an example, the  Command requires the service components to provide personnel  reenlistment data within these reports. Specifically, the Command requires  information and analysis on the number of eligible special operations  forces personnel who chose to reenlist and comparative information on  the number of personnel reenlistments in each military service. However,  the service components\u2019 annual reports do not clearly link the number of  experienced warfighters who have been retained with the number who are  needed to meet planned growth. This is particularly important because the  parent military services have not set goals for the reenlistments of their  special operations forces personnel in a way that is clearly linked with the  planned growth in these forces. Each of the active component military  services tracks retention according to years of service and whether a  servicemember is on a first, second, or subsequent enlistment.", "Moreover, the Special Operations Command has not established specific  performance objectives or goals for the special operations forces retention  initiative that DOD authorized in December 2004. As a result, it is difficult  to assess the progress that DOD has had with this initiative in retaining a  sufficient number of experienced personnel to meet planned growth\u2014a  key rationale for the initiative. Many of the special operations forces  servicemembers who were eligible for the bonuses offered as part of this  initiative did reenlist, as shown by information provided to us. However,  Special Operations Command officials were unable to provide specific  goals to measure the effectiveness of the retention initiatives because they  lacked clear performance objectives that are linked to comprehensive  analyses of personnel needs.", "Special Operations Command officials stated the Command had not fully  enforced the reporting requirements in its directive because it is outdated  and some of the information required in the annual reports is less relevant,  given the Command\u2019s expanded role in the Global War on Terrorism.  However, the Command most recently updated this directive in April 2003,  and at that time, it maintained the annual reporting requirements. In  addition, officials stated that data and information on the status of special  operations forces personnel are available to the Special Operations  Command through other processes, including monthly and quarterly  readiness reports, monthly personnel status summaries, and annual  conferences hosted by the Command to discuss personnel issues. The  Defense Manpower Data Center also provides the Command with analyses  on the trends in the continuation rates of special operations forces  personnel. While these processes may provide information on the status  of special operations forces, they do not provide detailed analyses and  discussions of concerns and corrective actions that are required by the  Command\u2019s directive. In addition, the annual reports are a means by which  the Command has provided information to stakeholders within the  department\u2014including the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the  military services\u2014on the status of special operations forces.

These reports include  information on the number of special operations forces personnel and  special operations forces units that are deployed around the world. In  addition, the components report the type of the deployment, such as  deployments for operations or for training. From these weekly updates,  the Special Operations Command develops a comprehensive deployed  forces report, which is presented to the Commander of the Special  Operations Command and included in updates for the Chairman of the  Joint Chiefs of Staff.", "Our review of Special Operations Command data shows that since fiscal  year 2000, deployments of special operations forces personnel have  substantially increased. Specifically, as shown in figure 2, the average  weekly number of deployed special operations forces personnel was 64  percent, or about 3,100 personnel, greater in fiscal year 2005 than in fiscal  year 2000.", "Our analysis also shows that the vast majority of recent deployments  outside of the United States were to the Central Command area of  responsibility, which accounted for 85 percent of deployed special  operations forces in fiscal year 2005. Significantly, more than 99 percent of  these deployments supported ongoing combat operations. In contrast, in  fiscal year 2000, only 20 percent of special operations forces deployments  were to the Central Command. As shown in figure 3, the percentage of  special operations forces personnel deployed to the European Command,  the Pacific Command, and the Southern Command decreased between  fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2005.", "While special operations forces have experienced a substantial increase in  deployments for operations, there has been a simultaneous decrease in  deployments for training. As shown in table 4, from fiscal year 2000  through fiscal year 2005, the percentage of special operations forces  personnel deployed for operations increased, while the percentage of  personnel deployed for training decreased.", "The decrease in deployments for training appears to have had at least two  effects. From fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, for example, the  amount of time for which special operations forces deployed for training  to maintain proficiency in battle skills decreased by 50 percent. Officials  with the Army, Navy, and Air Force service components told us that since  many of their units have been deployed to the Central Command area of  responsibility, they have had fewer opportunities to conduct proficiency  training for all mission tasks. As a result, special operations forces units  are focusing their training on the tasks that are required for operations in  the Central Command and are assuming some risk by not training for  other mission tasks. For example, officials with the U.S. Army Special  Operations Command told us that specialized training such as military free  fall and underwater combat operations have been reduced to a minimum,  since these skills are not required to support ongoing operations.", "Similarly, officials with the Air Force Special Operations Command stated  that increased deployments for operations had affected the ability of its air  crews and special tactics squadrons to achieve all required mission- essential training. However, officials stated that this has not degraded  overall readiness, because not all of these training tasks are currently  being performed in the Central Command. In addition, officials stated that  if mission priorities were to shift away from the Central Command and  different missions needed to be performed, not all of its special operations  forces personnel would be required to have achieved those training tasks  in order for a mission to be successfully carried out.", "Additionally, although our analysis shows that special operations forces  deployed less frequently for skills proficiency training from fiscal year  2000 through fiscal year 2005, we were told that the amount of training  that special operations forces accomplished may not have been greatly  affected. In particular, we were told that Army special operations forces  units do not necessarily have to deploy in order to accomplish training  that can be done at their home station. In addition, the fact that many  special operations forces units are deploying for combat operations results  in ample opportunities to maintain proficiency in essential skills. Officials  with the U.S. Army Special Operations Command explained that special  operations forces no longer train to fight because they are training as they  fight. However, not all special operations forces can accomplish training  tasks at their home station. According to Naval Special Warfare Command  officials, Naval Special Warfare units do not have adequate home station  training ranges and are required to deploy in order achieve most training  tasks. Yet, from fiscal year 2000 to fiscal year 2005, the amount of time that  Naval Special Warfare personnel deployed for skills proficiency training  decreased by more than 30 percent.", "Special operations forces have also deployed less frequently to train with  foreign military forces overseas. As we have previously reported, this type  of training is important because it enables special operations forces to  practice mission skills such as providing military instruction in a foreign  language and maintaining language proficiency and familiarity with local  geography and cultures, which are essential in the foreign internal defense  and unconventional warfare missions. These deployments of special  operations forces to train with the armed forces and other security forces  of friendly foreign countries are commonly referred to as joint combined  exchange training. Between fiscal year 2000 and fiscal year 2005, however,  the amount of time in which special operations forces personnel deployed  for joint combined exchange training decreased by 53 percent.", "Our analysis of DOD data reported to the Congress also shows the  participation of special operations forces in joint combined exchange  training events decreased since fiscal year 2000. As shown in figure 4, from  fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005, the number of these events that  special operations forces completed decreased by about 50 percent.  Further analysis shows that the number of events conducted in most of the  geographic combatant command areas of responsibility decreased from  fiscal year 2000 through fiscal year 2005. Specifically, joint combined  exchange training events conducted in the European Command decreased  by about 75 percent, while events conducted in the Southern Command  and Pacific Command also decreased during this time. Conversely, the  number of such training events conducted in the Central Command  increased from 7 exercises in fiscal year 2000 to 14 exercises in fiscal year  2005.", "The increase in the amount of time that special operations forces have  deployed to support operations in the Central Command has, to some  extent, resulted in an increase in the number of cancelled joint combined  exchange training events. Officials with the Special Operations Command,  European Command, Pacific Command, and Southern Command with  whom we spoke stated that joint combined exchange training can be  cancelled for various reasons, including the availability of funding for the  training, the availability of host nation forces, or the operations tempo of  U.S. special operations forces. Officials stated, however, that due to the  increased requirement for special operations forces deployments to  support operations in the Central Command, there has been a  corresponding increase in the number of cancelled joint combined  exchange training events. Our analysis shows that from fiscal year 2000  through fiscal year 2005, the percentage of cancelled training events due to  the operations tempo of special operations forces increased from 0  percent to more than 60 percent.", "While the primary purpose of joint combined exchange training is to train  U.S. forces, this training can also have an ancillary benefit in that it can be  used by the geographic combatant commanders and ambassadors to fulfill  regional and country engagement objectives. For instance, the geographic  combatant commands use joint combined exchange training to help  achieve foreign engagement objectives in their designated areas of  responsibility. DOD documents regarding the department\u2019s strategy for the  Global War on Terrorism identify combined training, such as joint  combined exchange training, as an important element to strengthen  partner nations\u2019 counterterrorism capabilities.

However, the Command\u2019s service components have not  consistently or fully implemented the deployment policy.", "One challenge lies in the fact that the policy\u2019s guidelines are not clear.  Officials with the Command\u2019s service components noted a lack of clear  guidance regarding how the components should implement the  deployment guidelines, and consequently they were implementing it  differently from one another. For example, the policy does not identify the  length of time for which the components must ensure that personnel  remain within the deployment guidelines. In addition, it does not state  whether a servicemember must remain at a home station immediately  following one deployment for an equal amount of time before a next  deployment. Because of the lack of clear guidance, the Special Operations  Command\u2019s service components have had to interpret the intent of the  policy\u2019s requirements to ensure that their personnel remain in compliance.", "A second challenge lies in the difficulty of achieving full implementation.  Officials with the Naval Special Warfare Command stated that they have  been unable to comply with the deployment guidelines because personnel  lack adequate home station training ranges. Specifically, Naval Special  Warfare personnel must deploy for both unit training and operations. This  combination of deployments has resulted in personnel having exceeded  the policy\u2019s requirement. Naval Special Warfare Command officials  indicated that they were working with the Special Operations Command  and the Navy to implement the deployment policy. According to Navy  officials, the Navy plans to provide the Naval Special Warfare Command  with additional funds to improve the home station ranges used to train the  SEAL force, which is anticipated to reduce the current pace of operations  tempo due to deployments for training. However, because these personnel  have been required to deploy for most unit training, they have been unable  to comply with the policy\u2019s requirement.", "To determine whether special operations forces are meeting the intent of  the policy requires the service components to maintain internal tracking  systems with complete, valid, and reliable data on their personnel  deployments. However, officials with the Command\u2019s Army and Navy  components expressed concerns regarding the reliability of the  information they use to track the individual deployments of their  personnel.", "While we did not independently validate the reliability of the data for  personnel deployments, an official with the U.S. Army Special Operations  Command stated the Army did not have a high level of confidence in the  data recorded by the U.S. Army Special Operations Command\u2019s units in  the Army\u2019s system on personnel deployments.

The reporting of this information was  suspended because the Naval Special Warfare Command could not meet  the Navy\u2019s personnel tempo standards due to an increase in the pace of  deployments in support of ongoing operations. As a result, the Naval  Special Warfare Command does not have comprehensive and reliable data  on Naval Special Warfare personnel deployments.

Given the Command\u2019s expanded  mission, however, it is critical that the Command complete its analyses of  personnel requirements and fully determine the number of personnel, who  possess the right knowledge and skill sets, for the Command to meet its  new role. Without this information, the Command cannot reasonably  assure the Secretary of Defense and the Congress that the currently  planned growth in the number of personnel for the Command will meet,  exceed, or fall short of the requirements necessary to carry out its  expanded mission.", "The military services and the Special Operations Command have faced  human capital challenges in recruiting, training, and retaining a sufficient  number of these forces, and many of these challenges continue. In large  part, these challenges are attributable to the rigorous selection and  training processes set for these personnel.

DOD stated that it will monitor the progress and validate the  results of this study, which we believe to be important steps. However, as  we noted in this report, DOD has already requested funding to  substantially increase the number of military and civilian positions at the  Command\u2019s headquarters beginning in fiscal year 2007, without the benefit  of the results from the Command\u2019s study of personnel needs. As a result,  we would expect DOD to re-evaluate its funding needs upon completion of  the Command\u2019s study, and adjust its requests accordingly.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation to require the Special  Operations Command to revise the Command\u2019s directive for its program to  monitor the status of special operations forces, to include performance  objectives, goals, and measures of progress for achieving planned growth,  and enforce all of the directive\u2019s reporting requirements. DOD stated that  the Special Operations Command is updating the directive for its program  to monitor the status of special operations forces, and that the department  and the Command are continuously developing new tools and metrics to  more accurately measure the actual health of special operations forces.  DOD further stated that it is difficult to compare personnel data across the  services because each of the Command\u2019s service components presents  data using the metrics of its parent service, adding that it is highly  desirable to have each component format its service-derived data in a  common database. While we recognize the military services have different  metrics, the intent of our recommendation is that the Special Operations  Command develop a set of reporting metrics that would give the  Command the data it needs to monitor progress in meeting growth goals.", "Finally, DOD partially concurred with our recommendation to require the  Special Operations Command to clarify the methodology that its service  components use for enforcing the Command\u2019s deployment policy, and  take steps to ensure that the service components have tracking systems in  place that utilize reliable data to meet the requirements of the policy. DOD  stated that the Special Operations Command leadership and all of its  service components have implemented the Command\u2019s deployment policy,  which is in compliance with the department\u2019s force deployment rules for  Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom. In addition, DOD stated  that the department will work toward developing a multi-service database  and metrics to standardize deployment and other metrics across the joint  community to overcome the challenge associated with the fact that each  service uses different metrics for calculating deployment time. While we  recognize the use of different metrics presents a challenge, our point, as  we state in this report, is that the Command\u2019s policy is unclear concerning  the length of time for which the components must ensure that personnel  remain within the deployment guidelines, and whether a servicemember  must remain at a home station immediately following one deployment for  an equal amount of time prior to a subsequent deployment. As a result, the  Command\u2019s service components have interpreted the intent of the policy\u2019s  requirements inconsistently. We continue to believe that additional  clarification to the Command\u2019s deployment policy is warranted to assist its  service components in ensuring that special operations forces personnel  remain in compliance with this policy. We also believe that the planned  actions to standardize deployment and other metrics should include  establishing procedures for recording reliable and relevant data on  personnel deployments since, as we reported, officials with two of the  Special Operations Command\u2019s service components did not have  confidence in the reliability of the information that was used to track the  individual deployments of their special operations forces personnel.

To assess the plans to increase the number of  special operations forces units and personnel requirements for the  Command\u2019s headquarters, we conducted site visits and interviewed  officials involved with determining personnel requirements with the  Special Operations Command, and the Army, Navy, and Air Force service  components. We also met with Marine Corps officials to discuss plans for  growth in Marine Corps special operations forces. We analyzed the plans  for growth in these personnel through fiscal year 2011. We reviewed  Department of Defense (DOD) documents identifying the increases in the  Special Operations Command\u2019s military authorizations and funding since  fiscal year 2000 and its plans for personnel growth through fiscal year  2011. We reviewed past reports prepared by GAO that discuss effective  strategies for workforce planning. However, we were unable to determine  whether all of the Special Operations Command\u2019s personnel requirements  had been identified because, at the time of our review, the Command had  not completed all of its analyses of the personnel requirements needed for  its expanded mission responsibilities.", "To assess the progress the military services and the Special Operations  Command have made since fiscal year 2000 in increasing the number of  special operations forces personnel, we discussed the processes used by  the military services and DOD to recruit, train, and retain these forces with  officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Special  Operations Command, and the military services. We focused on these  processes for the active components of the military services. To determine  what challenges the military services and the Special Operations  Command face to meet future growth, we analyzed personnel inventory  levels for special operations forces in the active component military  services for fiscal years 2000 through 2005. We collected and analyzed data  to determine whether the schools that train new special operations  personnel are producing enough newly trained personnel in order to meet  current authorized personnel levels or planned growth targets. We  reviewed relevant Special Operations Command directives and analyzed  annual reports prepared by the service components to determine the  extent to which the information in these reports met reporting  requirements.", "To assess the effect of increased special operations forces deployments,  we analyzed deployment data from the Special Operations Command for  fiscal years 2000 through 2005. We analyzed the trends in deployments for  operations, training, and administrative activities and the trends in  deployments by geographic region. We discussed the impact of decreased  deployments for training and increased deployments for operations with  officials from the military services and the Special Operations Command.  We reviewed the Special Operations Command\u2019s policy to manage special  operations forces personnel deployments and conducted interviews with  component command officials to determine their ability to implement and  fully comply with this policy. We reviewed available data for  inconsistencies. Our assessments of data reliability revealed some  concerns which are discussed in this report. Specifically, some of the  personnel inventory data provided by the military service headquarters  were incomplete. To overcome this challenge, we gathered additional  information from the Special Operations Command\u2019s service components.  In addition, we interviewed officials with the service headquarters and the  Special Operations Command\u2019s service components who were  knowledgeable about the data to discuss the validity of the information  provided to us. We concluded the data were sufficiently reliable to answer  our objectives. We conducted our review from April 2005 through June  2006 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.", "We interviewed officials and obtained documentation at the following  locations:    U.S. Army Headquarters, Washington, D.C.
