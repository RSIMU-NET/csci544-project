The nature and severity of the reported problems indicate that generally agency management lacked the full range of reliable, useful, and timely information needed for accountability, performance reporting, and decision making. Six main types of problems related to agencies' systems were consistently identified. As prescribed in OMB's reporting guidance, auditors for six agencies provided negative assurance on agency systems' FFMIA compliance for fiscal year 2003. This means that nothing came to their attention to indicate that financial management systems did not meet FFMIA requirements. GAO continues to believe that this type of reporting is not sufficient under the act and that report users may have the false impression that auditors have reported agency systems to be compliant. To address problems such as nonintegrated systems, inadequate reconciliations, and lack of SGL compliance, agencies are implementing or upgrading financial management systems. Agencies anticipate the new systems will provide reliable, useful, and timely data to support managerial decision making. However, our work at DOD, HHS, and NASA has shown significant problems exist in implementing financial management systems and that agencies are not following the necessary disciplined processes for efficient and effective implementation of these systems. Disciplined processes have been shown to reduce the risks associated with software development and acquisition efforts to acceptable levels and are fundamental to successful system acquisition and implementation.

To provide positive assurance of FFMIA  compliance, auditors would need to perform more comprehensive audit  procedures than those necessary to render an opinion for a financial  statement audit.  In performing financial statement audits, auditors  generally focus on the capability of the financial management systems to  process and summarize financial information that flows into financial  statements.  In contrast, FFMIA is much broader and requires auditors to  assess whether an agency\u2019s financial management systems substantially  comply with systems requirements.  To do this, auditors need to consider  whether agency systems provide complete, accurate, and timely  information for managing day-to-day operations.  We believe that providing  positive assurance of an agency\u2019s financial management system would  identify weaknesses and lead to systems improvements that result in  enhancing the performance, productivity, and efficiency of federal financial  management, which is a goal of the PMA.

While OMB agrees that  testing should occur, and its guidance on FFMIA calls for it, OMB officials  are concerned that the level of testing needed for positive assurance may  be too time-consuming and costly.  OMB officials stated that different,  more coordinated approaches toward assessing an agency\u2019s internal  controls and FFMIA compliance might provide sufficient assurance on an  agency\u2019s systems.  For example, in preparing the PMA scorecard  assessments, OMB officials meet with agencies to discuss a number of  financial management issues and have systems demonstrations.  Agencies  are asked to identify key business questions and related cost drivers.  Then,  the agencies must develop systems that can produce the information  needed on those cost drivers to help management at all levels focus on  results.  OMB officials stated they believed the PMA scorecard framework  offers an alternative route toward substantial compliance that is similar to  that offered by positive assurance.  In its written comments on a draft of  this report (see app. VI) OMB stated that the processes used in evaluating  agencies against the PMA standards can provide a corroborative  mechanism in evaluating compliance with FFMIA.  Our concern is that the  information provided by this approach does not come under audit scrutiny  and may not be reliable.  For example, the PMA scorecard does not  examine the nature and extent of adjustments that agencies make to their  year-end financial statements.  As long as extensive year-end adjustments  are needed, there is no assurance that the financial information being  provided by the systems is complete and accurate for day-to-day  operations.", "A joint CFO Council/PCIE group is also currently investigating how internal  control reporting similar to that required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of  2002 might be useful in the federal government.  OMB officials told us that  the results of this CFO Council/PCIE study might provide another method  of assessing and reporting on internal control and FFMIA compliance.   Auditor reporting on internal control is a critical component of monitoring  the effectiveness of an organization\u2019s accountability, especially for large,  complex, or challenged entities that use taxpayers\u2019 dollars.  Auditors can  better serve their clients and other financial statement users and better  protect the public interest by having a greater role in providing assurances  of the effectiveness of internal control in deterring fraudulent financial  reporting and protecting assets.  Financial systems are an important  element of an entity\u2019s internal control over financial reporting.  Although  enhanced internal control reporting would not necessarily address the full  capability of the financial management systems in place, such reporting  would include reportable internal control weaknesses caused by financial  systems problems.  However, the full value of independent auditors\u2019  assessments of FFMIA compliance will not be fully realized until auditors  perform a sufficient level of audit work to be able to provide positive  assurance that agencies are in compliance with FFMIA.  When reporting an  agency\u2019s financial management systems to be in substantial compliance,  positive assurance will provide users with confidence that the agency  systems provide the reliable, useful, and timely information envisioned by  the act.", "In addition, we also previously recommended that OMB explore clarifying  the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d to help ensure consistent  application of the term.

The Intragovernmental Transaction Exchange was piloted from October  2003 to April 2004, and provided information about the business processes  and technologies used to interact with it.  After evaluating the results of the  pilot, OMB expects to phase it into use at all agencies.", "Building upon the efforts of the Federal Enterprise Architecture program to  support the PMA for e-gov, OMB and designated agency task forces have  launched the line of business (LOB) initiative.  This initiative seeks to  develop business-driven, common solutions for five lines of business that  span across the federal government.  The five initiatives are financial  management, human resources management, grants management, federal  health architecture, and case management.  Each of the lines of business  shares similar business requirements and business processes.  OMB and  the LOB task forces plan to use either enterprise architecture-based  principles and best practices to identify common solutions for business  processes, technology-based shared services to be made available to  government agencies, or both.  Driven from a business perspective rather  than a technology focus, the solutions are expected to address distinct  business improvements to enhance government\u2019s performance and  services for citizens.  The results of LOB efforts are expected to save  taxpayer dollars, reduce administrative burden, and significantly improve  service delivery.", "The financial management LOB goals are to (1) achieve or enhance process  improvements and cost savings in the acquisition, development,  implementation, and operation of financial management systems through  shared services, joint procurements, consolidation, and other means;   (2) promote seamless data exchange between and among federal agencies;  (3) provide for the standardization of business processes and data  elements; and (4) strengthen internal controls through real-time integration  of core financial and subsidiary systems.  OMB has an ambitious time  frame, September 2004, for identifying a common solution and developing a  target architecture and a joint business case.  At the time of our review,  OMB had not completed this effort.  Agency business cases submitted as  part of the budget cycle are expected to reflect the proposed common  solutions.  GAO has long supported and called for such initiatives to  standardize and streamline common systems, which cannot only reduce  costs but, if done correctly, can improve accountability.", "The problems we have seen related to requirements, testing, interfaces, and  data conversion at the agency level indicate that attention to these  disciplined processes will continue to be important as OMB and the LOB  task forces move forward.  These initiatives and the intragovernmental  transaction exchange will be required to address broader sets of  requirements, interfaces, and data conversion issues than those at an  individual agency level, thus amplifying the complexity of the task.", "Disciplined process can play an important role in helping governmentwide  systems initiatives reduce the risk of these projects to acceptable levels.", "In addition, with many new financial management systems being  implemented in the federal government, it is crucial that the federal  government have a qualified workforce with the right mix of skills to  implement financial systems successfully.  Our report on effective  strategic workforce planning highlighted five principles that such a process  should address irrespective of the context in which planning is done.   Among the principles are determining the critical skills and competencies  that will be needed to achieve current and future results, and developing  strategies tailored to address gaps in the number, deployment, and  alignment of human capital approaches.  At a JFMIP-sponsored forum on  successful integration and interoperability of business management  systems held in May 2004, the participants noted that agencies are losing  experienced people for a variety of reasons and relying excessively on  outside contractors because they have no other choice.  Participants  expressed concern that internally, staff lack the technical expertise needed.   Agency officials overseeing implementations have expertise on the  functional requirements, such as government accounting standards, but  vendors and integrators have little expertise in these areas.  This is  extremely high risk and costly, and greater oversight and close monitoring  of contractors is needed.  Further, our executive guide emphasizes the  need for developing a financial management team with the right mix of  skills and competencies.  A changing financial management business vision  requires shifting workforce capacities and providing a financial  management workforce that is more analytic and capable of providing  decision support."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Long-standing problems with agencies\u2019 financial systems continue to make  it difficult for agencies to routinely produce reliable, useful, and timely  financial information.  While a number of agencies are receiving  unqualified (\u201cclean\u201d) opinions on their financial statements, the continued  widespread noncompliance with FFMIA shows that agencies still have a  long way to go to having systems, processes, and controls that routinely  generate reliable, useful, and timely information.", "The FFMIA-related problems reported in agency audit reports indicate that  federal financial management systems are not currently providing federal  managers the financial data needed for day-to-day management of their  programs or for external reporting in an efficient or timely manner.  Yet we  remain concerned that the full nature and scope of the problems have not  been identified because auditors have only provided negative assurance in  their FFMIA reports.  We believe the law requires auditors to provide  positive assurance on FFMIA compliance.  Therefore, we reaffirm our  recommendation made in prior reports that OMB revise its current FFMIA  guidance to require agency auditors to provide a statement of positive  assurance when reporting an agency\u2019s systems to be in substantial  compliance, which entails a more thorough examination of the agency\u2019s  systems.  We also reaffirm our other prior recommendation for OMB to  explore further clarification of the definition of \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in  its FFMIA guidance to encourage consistent reporting among agency  auditors.  As we stated in our prior reports, auditors we interviewed had  concerns about providing positive assurance in reporting on agency  systems\u2019 FFMIA compliance because of a need for clarification regarding  the meaning of substantial compliance.", "Implementing new COTS core financial systems is a formidable challenge  since financial management systems are not only needed for external  reporting but, most importantly, are needed to provide the financial  information program managers need to manage operations on a day-to-day  basis.  Reliable, useful, and timely financial management information is key  to achieving the goals of the PMA and its related initiatives, such as PART.   As the federal government moves forward with agency implementations of  new financial management systems and for systems implemented to satisfy  governmentwide initiatives, adherence to proven disciplined processes to  minimize risks and improve management of these implementations is  critical.  Moreover, people with the right skill sets in the right places at the  right times are critical to efficiently and effectively implementing a  financial management system and operating it once it is in place.   Improvements in federal financial management systems are in some cases  a long-term goal, but with sustained attention from important decision  makers, including the Congress and OMB, the goals of the CFO Act and  FFMIA can be achieved."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments (reprinted in app. VI) on a draft of this report, OMB  agreed with our assessment that while federal agencies continue to make  progress in addressing financial management systems weaknesses, many  agencies still lack the ability to produce the data needed to efficiently and  effectively manage day-to-day operations.  As in previous years, OMB  disagreed with our recommendation that agency auditors be required to  provide a statement of positive assurance when reporting agency systems  to be in substantial compliance with FFMIA.  OMB said that the PMA and  FFMIA should be viewed as complementary methods for achieving  improvements in financial management systems.  OMB stated that the  framework of performance standards established under the PMA provides  a corroborative mechanism for evaluating FFMIA compliance, which  together with existing audit processes can provide an accurate assessment  of substantial compliance.  Therefore, OMB does not believe that the  addition of a statement of positive assurance on FFMIA compliance would  be beneficial.  While we agree that the initiatives of the PMA are stimulating  improvements, auditors need to consider other aspects of financial  management systems when assessing FFMIA compliance that are not fully  addressed through the current reporting structure.  Our concern is that  some of the information provided by this approach, such as monthly  financial performance metrics for managing activities, does not come  under audit scrutiny and may not be reliable.  In contrast, an opinion by an  independent auditor of FFMIA compliance would confirm that an agency\u2019s  systems substantially met the requirements of FFMIA and provide  additional confidence in the information provided by the PMA.  Finally, as  we have stated in previous reports, a statement of positive assurance is a  statutory requirement under the act.", "With regard to our prior recommendation, which we reaffirmed in this  report, for revised guidance that clarifies the definition of substantial  compliance, OMB said that the performance results obtained from the PMA  initiatives will allow a further refinement of the existing substantial  compliance indicators.  OMB agreed to consider clarifying the definition of  \u201csubstantial compliance\u201d in future policy and guidance updates.
