For the three additional requirements, 15 agencies had provided online access to government information, such as frequently requested records, 12 agencies had designated chief FOIA officers, and 12 agencies had published and updated their FOIA regulations on time to inform the public of their operations. Until these agencies address all of the requirements, they increase the risk that the public will lack information that ensures transparency and accountability in government operations.", "The 18 selected agencies had backlogs of varying sizes, with 4 agencies having backlogs of 1,000 or more requests during fiscal years 2012 through 2016. These 4 agencies reported using best practices identified by the Department of Justice, such as routinely reviewing metrics, as well as other methods, to help reduce their backlogs. Nevertheless, these agencies' backlogs fluctuated over the 5-year period (see figure). The 4 agencies with the largest backlogs attributed challenges in reducing their backlogs to factors such as increases in the number and complexity of FOIA requests. However, these agencies lacked plans that described how they intend to implement best practices to reduce backlogs. Until agencies develop such plans, they will likely continue to struggle to reduce backlogs to a manageable level.", "Agencies used various types of statutory exemptions to withhold information when processing FOIA requests during fiscal years 2010 to 2016.

These topics have included, among others, the disclosure of  waste, fraud, and abuse; conditions such as unsafe consumer products  and harmful drugs; as well as information related to the government\u2019s  assistance to corporations during the U.S. financial crisis of 2008. In the  last 9 fiscal years, agencies subject to FOIA have reported receiving  about 6 million requests.", "Given the significance of FOIA, Congress has had a longstanding interest  in the manner in which the act is being implemented, including the extent  to which federal agencies respond to FOIA requests, the timeliness of the  responses, and the number and nature of exemptions claimed by  agencies in withholding requested information. Since 1978, we have  issued a number of reports that have addressed various aspects of  federal agencies\u2019 efforts to implement the act.", "At your request, we reviewed federal agencies\u2019 compliance with FOIA  requirements, backlogs, use of exemptions, and FOIA requests related to  the 2008 financial crisis.

We identified  these agencies by considering: the number of FOIA requests received,  the sizes of FOIA backlogs, and the average time for processing FOIA  requests for fiscal years 2012 through 2016. We also chose the agencies  to represent a range of sizes (by number of employees)\u2014large (10,000 or  more), medium (1,000 to 9,999), and small (999 or fewer). Table 1 lists  the selected agencies by size.", "For the first objective, we reviewed six FOIA requirements outlined in the  FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and the OPEN Government Act of 2007.

The findings from our second objective are not  generalizable to the 117 FOIA reporting agencies.", "To address the third objective, determining the exemptions that have  been used by agencies as the basis for withholding (redacting)  information, we developed a catalog of (b)(3) statutes that agencies  previously have used, or reasonably could have used, to withhold  information in FOIA records under the (b)(3) exemption. To develop the  catalog, we compiled a list of (b)(3) exemptions, along with the number of  times each exemption was used by at least 1 of 117 agencies for which  annual FOIA report data covering fiscal years 2010 through 2016 were  available on Justice\u2019s FOIA.gov website. We refined our list of agencies  that used (b)(3) exemptions by standardizing the statutes\u2019 citations to  ensure they consistently referred to existing U.S. Code sections.", "Further, to create our catalog we (1) categorized each (b)(3) statute  based on the general subject matter (2) identified the number of times  each exemption was used by agencies, and (3) determined the date of  the most recent legislative action for each statute to identify which  statutes were subject to a 2009 amendment to the (b)(3) exemption. To  assess the reliability of the data we retrieved from FOIA.gov, we  electronically tested the data for outliers, missing values, and syntactical  discrepancies. We also interviewed relevant agency officials at Justice to  discuss their actions to ensure the consistency of the data presented in  FOIA.gov on agencies\u2019 uses of FOIA (b)(3) exemptions.

Our work focused on identifying  those entities in which Treasury held 50 percent or more of the entity\u2019s  common stock and the dates during which Treasury held that stock. As a  result of this review, we identified three corporations in which Treasury  held 50 percent or more of the entities\u2019 common stock during certain  periods between 2008 through 2014. These three corporations were the  American International Group (AIG), General Motors (GM), and General  Motors Acceptance Corporation (Ally).

In this  regard, we reviewed the requests to determine (1) the number of requests  received, (2) the resolution of the requests, and (3) the length of time it  took the agency to respond. Lastly, we interviewed relevant agency  officials at each of the four selected agencies to better understand if and  how FOIA requests were received and processed.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 to June 2018 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.

Further, the department stated that the chief privacy officer position  meets the senior executive service standard under 5 U.S.C \u00a7  3132(a)(2) and, accordingly, is comparable to a senior executive level  position. Thus, the department believes it is already in compliance  with the requirement to designate a chief FOIA officer at the assistant  secretary level or equivalent.", "For the reasons that it cited, DHS requested that GAO consider this  recommendation to be resolved and closed. Based on our analysis of  the additional information that the department provided to explain the  senior executive level position of the chief privacy officer, we are in  agreement with DHS regarding the position\u2019s equivalency to an  assistant secretary within the department. Accordingly, we have  removed this recommendation from our report.", "Concerning the second recommendation, to develop and document a  plan that fully addresses practices with regard to the reduction of  backlogged requests, DHS stated that it plans to initiate a department- wide compliance assessment of FOIA operations to identify the  components with the most significant backlog problems and the \u201croot  causes\u201d for these problems.

We also chose the agencies to represent  a range of sizes (by number of employees)\u2014large (10,000 or more),  medium (1,000 to 9,999), and small (999 or fewer). Large agencies  selected were the Departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State, and  the Interior; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the  Tennessee Valley Authority. Medium agencies were the National  Archives and Records Administration, the Federal Deposit Insurance  Corporation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the  Broadcasting Board of Governors, the U.S. Agency for International  Development, and the Federal Trade Commission. Small agencies were  the National Transportation Safety Board, the American Battle  Monuments Commission, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the  U.S. African Development Foundation, the Office of Management and  Budget, and the Administrative Conference of the United States.", "For our first objective, to determine the extent to which agencies had  implemented FOIA requirements, we examined six FOIA requirements  outlined in the FOIA Improvement Act of 2016 and the OPEN  Government Act of 2007. These requirements were for agencies to (1)  update response letters, (2) implement tracking systems, (3) provide  FOIA training, (4), provide records online, (5) designate chief FOIA  officers, and (6) update and publish timely and comprehensive  regulations. For these six requirements, we reviewed (1) agencies\u2019 FOIA  regulations to determine if they included updates from the 2016 FOIA  amendments and 2007 OPEN Government Act; and if they were updated  by the required deadline; (2) agencies\u2019 FOIA systems to determine if the  systems provided individualized tracking numbers for requests that will  take longer than 10 days to process, if agencies\u2019 established telephone or  Internet service to allow requesters to track the status of their requests;  (3) if agencies\u2019 had designated a chief FOIA officer and what position they  held within the agency; (4) if agencies chief FOIA officers provided annual  FOIA training opportunities to agency staff; (5) if agencies had  appropriately updated response letters in compliance with the 2016 FOIA  amendments; and (6) if agencies were providing electronic documents  publicly available online and posting frequently requested documents as  required by the 2016 FOIA amendments. Since we selected a  nonprobability sample of FOIA reporting agencies, the results of this  analysis are not generalizable to all FOIA reporting agencies.", "In addition, we also reviewed the requirement for the development of a  government-wide FOIA request portal and met with Office of  Management and Budget (OMB) officials, and Department of Justice  (Justice) officials in the Office of Information Policy (OIP) to the discuss  the status of development. Further, we met the Chief FOIA Officers  Council, OIP, and National Archives and Records Administration\u2019s  (NARA) Office of Government Information Services (OGIS) to determine  what, if any, actions they have taken to assist agencies with not violating  the provisions of FOIA.", "For our second objective, to determine the methods established by  agencies to reduce backlogged requests and the effect of those methods,  we reviewed agency documentation to evaluate if the selected agencies  had developed methods for reducing backlogged FOIA requests. We  identified requirements for agencies to produce backlog reduction plans  and determined if agencies developed such plans as required. We  analyzed agencies\u2019 FOIA.gov data to determine if there was a correlation  between the presence of a backlog reduction plan and a reduction in  backlog numbers. We compared a set of identified best practices for  reducing backlogs with agency procedures to determine the extent to  which the best practices are used. In addition, we interviewed agency  officials to determine the reasons for changes in agency backlog numbers  and what actions they are taking to reduce backlogs or implement  reduction plans. The results of this analysis are not generalizable to all  FOIA reporting agencies.", "For our third objective, to identify statutory (b)(3) exemptions that have  been used by agencies as the basis for withholding information, we  developed a catalog of (b)(3) statutes that agencies previously have used  to withhold information in FOIA records. To do that, we retrieved all data  on agency use of (b)(3) statutes that were readily accessible on Justice\u2019s  FOIA.gov website. The data on FOIA.gov are for fiscal years 2008 to  2016; however, Justice acknowledged that data prior to 2010 were not  available on FOIA.gov for all agencies. Therefore, we reviewed data for  fiscal years 2010 to 2016. In total, there were 117 distinct agencies that  provided annual report data for at least 1 fiscal year, and that were  represented in fiscal years 2010 through 2016. We developed a catalog  by extracting information from the aggregate of agency annual FOIA  reports that report, among other things, usage of (b)(3) statute, including  the statute\u2019s citation and the number of times the statute was to used  withhold information in a fiscal year.", "To assess the reliability of the data we retrieved from FOIA.gov, we  supplemented our analysis with interviews of FOIA officials in Justice\u2019s  OIP on steps they have taken to ensure the consistency of data in  FOIA.gov on agencies\u2019 use of (b)(3) statutes. Our analysis did not include  assessing the reliability of (b)(3) statute data submitted by agencies\u2014 Justice guidance states it is the responsibility of each agency to ensure  quality data in their reports. We also electronically tested the data by  identifying outliers, missing values, and syntactical discrepancies. We  found the data to be sufficiently reliable for purposes of our reporting  objective.", "To facilitate our analysis, we refined our catalog listing of agencies\u2019 use of  (b)(3) statutes by developing a standardized statute notation assigned to  each agency-used statute in our list. Specifically, our standardization of  agency-used statutes consisted of removing any typographical errors,  ensuring statutes were noted in a consistent U.S. Code format and  referred to existing U.S. Code section, and verifying the existence of  each statute through legal research, as well as standardizing any current  notations of the statute such as those transferred within the U.S. Code by  later legislation. If no current notation existed, then that statute was listed  as is, such as \u201c15 U.S.C. \u00a7 80a-30(c)\u201d, which was used by an agency,  and repealed during our review period. No replacement notation could be  found.", "For some U.S. Code statutes, we standardized statutes to an entire  section or subsection to reference nondisclosure provisions that contain a  description of the type of information withheld by that statute. Further, for  some U.S. Code statutes that agencies used as a range of statutes, such  as 7 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7411-7425, we determined whether the range contained a  single or multiple (b)(3) statute section(s) and developed a standardized  statute for each (b)(3) section to assign the original agency statute. In  some cases, where agencies used a smaller ranger of statutes, such as  21 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1903-1905, we retained the notation and assigned a  standardized version of the range to the original agency-used statute  range. Additionally, for some U.S. Code statutes that agencies used that  contained two (b)(3) statutes, such as 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 6105, we  developed a standardized statute for each (b)(3) section to assign the  original agency statute.", "For those agency-used statutes that could not be immediately  standardized or seemed to be noted in error, we either assigned that  statute to a related section (or sections) containing a nondisclosure  provision, retained the notation and assigned a standardized version of  the statute to the original agency-used statute, or removed that statute  from our catalog. For example, an agency claimed 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7301 as a  (b)(3) statue; however, the statute was a purpose section and 15 U.S.C. \u00a7  7306 was the only related nondisclosure provision in that chapter or  subchapter of the Code. Therefore, \u00a7 7301 was assigned to the  standardized citation \u00a7 7306. Each standardized statute was counted as  one single statute, regardless of the number of sections it represented,  resulting in a total of 237 statutes.", "Following our standardization exercise, we developed descriptions of  each statute\u2019s subject matter. We also compared our standardized  statutes list to Justice\u2019s list of qualified statutes to identify those statutes  that qualified if a court has approved of the statute as being a (b)(3)  statute. Next, we classified these statutes into 10 general categories  based on their descriptions.", "To determine usage of (b)(3) statutes by agencies, we calculated the  number of times an agency used original agency-used statutes and  assigned those numbers to its associated standardized statute in our  catalog. In cases where an agency appeared to cite multiple statutes,  such as 26 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 6105, we counted the statutes separately  if we determined they were different. For example, if an agency used 26  U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6103 and 6105 500 times during fiscal years 2010 to 2016, we  would assign that number to each standardized statute in our catalog to  ensure that 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6103 and 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6105 each received 500 as  the number of times used. We compiled and sorted these data to obtain  information on which agencies were using the statute, which agency used  it the most, and the approximate number of times the statute was used by  an agency.", "To identify which statutes qualified as a (b)(3) exemption under the OPEN  FOIA Act of 2009, we determined the date of the most recent legislative  action for each standardized statute by identifying the dates of enactment  and the most recent amendments of the statutes. We then identified  those statutes enacted or amended after 2009 and we determined if they  cited FOIA\u2019s paragraph (b)(3) by including a citation to 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(3)  or \u201cparagraph (b)(3) of section 552 of title 5, United States Code,\u201d or a  similar citation that includes a reference to paragraph (b)(3).", "To identify any additional statutes that the reviewed agencies did not  claim during fiscal years 2010 to 2016, we developed another catalog of  statutes that have similar provisions as other (b)(3) statutes that authorize  an agency to withhold information from the public. Specifically, we utilized  various sources to compile our list of statutes, including annual Justice  reports on statutes determined by courts to constitute a (b)(3) statute, the  National Institute of Standards and Technology\u2019s Guide for Mapping  Types of Information and Information Systems to Security Categories,  and two external nongovernmental organizations (American University  Washington College of Law and ProPublica). In addition, we separately  searched the U.S. Code for the keyword \u201c552(b)(3)\u201d using Lexis Nexis, to  identify any additional statutes for our catalog. However, this additional  catalog does not serve as an definitive or comprehensive list of (b)(3)  statutes available for agencies to claim. Specifically, FOIA gives agencies  broad discretion in deciding whether they can withhold information on the  basis of a statute. For example, FOIA allows for agencies to assert a  federal statute under the (b)(3) exemption if that statute establishes  particular criteria or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld.  Therefore, the statutes we identified may undercount the total number of  exemptions available to agencies.", "For our fourth objective, to determine the number and types of FOIA  requests related to private corporations that received funds under the  Troubled Assess Relief program (TARP), we reviewed the Department of  Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) Monthly Reports to Congress (October 2008 and  November 2014) and prior GAO reports relating to TARP. We  identified the corporations that received TARP funds and the federal  agencies that received FOIA requests related to these corporations by  reviewing Treasury\u2019s monthly reports for the time period in which  Treasury held 50 percent or more common stock in corporations that  were under the TARP agreement. We also reviewed prior GAO reports on  TARP to verify the corporations and time period. In addition, we met with  Treasury officials to verify the entities and time period.", "The three corporations that received TARP funds were American  International Group, General Motors, and Ally. The agencies that received  FOIA requests about these corporations were Treasury, the Federal  Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Federal Reserve Board, and  the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. We met with these agencies  to identify their involvement in providing assistance to companies related  to TARP.", "Next, we reviewed FOIA requests received by these four agencies during  the period in which Treasury owned at least 50 percent or more common  shares in the corporations. We reviewed the FOIA requests to determine  the resolution of the request and the length of time it took the agency to  respond. Lastly, we interviewed agency officials to better understand if  and how FOIA requests were received and processed.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2017 through June  2018 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
