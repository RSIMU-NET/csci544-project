The delay\u2014from October 2018 to a launch window between March and June 2019\u2014was primarily caused by components of JWST's spacecraft taking longer to integrate than planned. JWST made considerable progress toward the completion of integration and test activities in the past year. However, the project used all remaining schedule reserve\u2014or extra time set aside in the schedule in the event of delays or unforeseen risks\u2014to address technical issues, including an anomaly on the telescope found during vibration testing. Extending the launch window provided the project up to 4 months of schedule reserve. However, shortly after requesting the new launch window in September 2017, the project determined that several months of schedule reserve would be needed to address lessons learned from the initial folding and deployment of the observatory's sunshield (see image). Given remaining integration and test work ahead\u2014the phase in development where problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip\u2014coupled with only 1.5 months of schedule reserves remaining to the end of the launch window, additional launch delays are likely. The project's Standing Review Board will conduct an independent review of JWST's schedule status in early 2018 to determine if the June 2019 launch window can be met.", "JWST will also have limited cost reserves to address future challenges, such as further launch delays, and is at risk of breaching its $8 billion cost cap for formulation and development set by Congress in 2011. For several years, the prime contractor has overestimated workforce reductions, and technical challenges have prevented these planned reductions, necessitating the use of cost reserves. Program officials said that existing program resources will accommodate the new launch window\u2014provided remaining integration and testing proceeds as planned without any long delays. However, JWST is still resolving technical challenges and work continues to take longer than planned to complete.

JWST is intended  to operate in an orbit approximately 1.5 million kilometers\u2014or 1 million  miles\u2014from the Earth. With a 6.5-meter primary mirror, JWST is  expected to operate at about 100 times the sensitivity of the Hubble  Space Telescope. JWST\u2019s science instruments are designed to observe  very faint infrared sources and therefore are required to operate at  extremely cold temperatures.

When complete,  the observatory segment of JWST is to include several elements (Optical  Telescope Element (OTE), Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM),  and spacecraft) and major subsystems (sunshield and cryocooler). The  hardware configuration created when the Optical Telescope Element and  the Integrated Science Instrument Module were integrated, referred to as OTIS, is not considered an element by NASA, but we categorize it as  such for ease of discussion. Additionally, JWST is dependent on software  to deploy and control various components of the telescope, and to collect  and transmit data back to Earth.

Each  JWST element and major subsystem has been allocated schedule  reserve. When an element or major subsystem exhausts schedule  reserve, it may begin to affect schedule reserve on other elements or  major subsystems whose progress is dependent on prior work being  finished for its activities to proceed. The element or major subsystem with  the least amount of schedule reserve determines the critical path for the  project.

According to program officials,  the contractor has increased its daily work shifts from two to three and is  now working 24 hours per day on spacecraft integration, which further  limits schedule flexibility. In early 2018, the project\u2019s independent  Standing Review Board will review the latest schedule inputs based on  updated knowledge about spacecraft integration and test activity  durations. For example, according to project officials, by early 2018, the  contractor is expected to have completed the second of four planned fold  and stow sequences on the sunshield, which will provide more insight into  whether the current planned schedule is realistic. The Standing Review  Board will also examine the project\u2019s plans for schedule efficiencies and  potential integration and test adjustments to determine if the June 2019  launch window can be met. Project officials stated that following this  review, NASA senior management will be briefed on the Standing Review  Board\u2019s findings and will then formally identify a new launch readiness  window.", "Our prior work has shown that integration and testing is the phase in  which problems are most likely to be found and schedules tend to slip.  For a uniquely complex project such as JWST, this risk is magnified. Now  that the project is well into its complex integration and test efforts, events  are sequential in nature and there are fewer opportunities to mitigate  issues in parallel. Since the replan, the project has used about 2.5  months of schedule reserve per year to address technical issues, but, as  discussed above, it now has only approximately 1.5 months of schedule  reserve to last until the end of the revised launch window in June 2019.  Thus, past experience with technical issues in earlier integration phases  suggests that this amount of reserve will not be adequate for the  challenging work ahead, and further delays to launch readiness are likely.  We will continue to monitor the project\u2019s progress in meeting its revised  schedule as more information is available during this critical integration  and test phase."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Higher Contractor Workforce Levels to Address Continuing Technical Challenges Places JWST at Risk of Exceeding Cost Commitments", "paragraphs": ["Northrop Grumman continued to maintain higher than planned workforce  levels in the past year and, as a result, NASA will have limited cost  reserves to address future challenges. Northrop Grumman\u2019s ability to  control costs and decrease its workforce is central to JWST\u2019s capacity to  meet its long-term cost commitments. For the past 44 months, Northrop  Grumman\u2019s actual workforce has exceeded its projections and the  company is not expected to significantly reduce its workforce until the  spring of 2019, when NASA plans to ship the completed observatory to  the launch site. Northrop Grumman had planned to reduce its workforce  in fiscal years 2016 and 2017 as work was planned to be completed, but  has needed to maintain higher workforce levels due to technical  challenges and the work taking longer than expected. Figure 6 illustrates  the difference between the workforce levels that Northrop Grumman  projected for fiscal years 2016 and 2017, and its actual workforce levels  during that period.", "As shown in figure 6, Northrop Grumman has slightly reduced its  workforce since the beginning of fiscal year 2016. However, staffing  levels remain higher than projected as a result of previously noted  technical challenges including spacecraft and sunshield integration and  test challenges, to keep specialized engineers available when needed  during final assembly, and to complete required testing activities.  Projections made at the beginning of fiscal year 2017\u2014when the  expected launch readiness date was October 2018\u2014expected workforce  levels to begin at 472 full-time equivalent staff and drop to 109 at the end  of the fiscal year. However, technical challenges and delays in completing  scheduled work did not allow for the planned workforce reduction and  Northrop Grumman reported 496 full-time equivalent staff in September  2017, or 387 more than planned. According to JWST project officials and  similar to previous years, Northrop Grumman\u2019s priority for fiscal year 2018  is to maintain schedule in order to ensure that the new launch window set  from March to June 2019 can be met. As a result, Northrop Grumman\u2019s  contractor workforce levels are expected to continue to be elevated  through JWST\u2019s final integration and test phase in fiscal year 2019 where  the spacecraft and OTIS will be integrated before shipment to the launch  site.", "Northrop Grumman submitted a cost overrun proposal to NASA in July  2016, primarily to address costs associated with sustaining its workforce  at higher levels than planned in fiscal year 2017. An overrun proposal  seeks to increase the value of a cost-reimbursement contract when the  total estimated cost is less than the contract\u2019s estimated cost to complete  the performance of the contract. In addition to higher workforce levels,  the overrun proposal replenished contractor management reserves that  had been used to address technical issues, and addressed projected  growth in the contractor\u2019s cost to complete work. NASA and the  contractor completed negotiations in September 2017 and executed a  contract modification that added $179.9 million to the value of the contract  to cover Northrop Grumman\u2019s cost overrun and additional negotiated  items, such as particle dampers. This amount was intended to cover the  cost of the remaining work through the expected launch date of October  2018. However, by September 2017 Northrop Grumman had no  remaining schedule reserves and a limited amount of cost reserves with  which to address future costs.", "Furthermore, the project determined\u2014as discussed above\u2014that the  October 2018 launch window was not feasible and established a new  launch window. According to JWST project officials, the project expects to  issue a request for proposal in early 2018 to cover the costs for the  remaining work through the new launch window. The project plans to use  a significant portion of fiscal years 2018 and 2019 program cost reserves  to address Northrop Grumman costs and unanticipated technical  challenges. According to JWST program officials, if the contractor does  not improve its schedule efficiency, the remaining reserves will be used to  offset increased cost resulting from taking longer to complete the work.", "For the sixth consecutive year, the JWST project managed spending  within its allocated budget in fiscal year 2017. However, JWST is still  resolving technical challenges and planned work continues to take longer  to complete. Prudent management of its resources allowed the project to  carry into fiscal year 2018 about a third more carry over funding than it  had projected at the beginning of the fiscal year. Program officials said  that assuming the remaining integration and tests proceed as planned  and no long delays are encountered, the existing program resources  accommodate the new launch window of March to June 2019. The project  continues to identify funding options in the event of a delay of beyond the  end of the launch window. Under the 2011 replan, Congress placed an $8  billion cap on formulation and development costs, but any long delays  beyond the new launch window\u2014which, as noted above, are likely\u2014 place the project at risk of exceeding this cap."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments from NASA, but agency officials determined that  no formal comments were necessary.
