Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) are a range of technologies that can reduce congestion at less cost than some other approaches. The U.S. Department of Transportation\u0092s (DOT) Research and Innovative Technology Administration (RITA) is responsible for promoting and supporting the use of ITS in coordination with other modal administrations, including the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). Since 1994, DOT has overseen the allocation and expenditure of more than $3 billion for deploying and researching ITS. GAO was asked to address (1) the current and emerging uses of ITS technologies by state and local governments, (2) the challenges these governments face in using ITS, and (3) the extent to which DOT\u0092s efforts to promote and support ITS address these challenges and follow leading practices. To conduct this work GAO visited four sites, and interviewed and analyzed documents and data from DOT and state and local transportation officials, ITS experts, and other stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State and local governments currently use ITS technologies in various ways to monitor and control traffic and inform travelers. For example, transportation agencies use cameras to monitor traffic conditions, signal technologies to control traffic flow, and dynamic message signs to inform travelers about travel conditions. By interviewing experts, GAO identified several emerging uses of ITS that have significant potential to reduce traffic congestion. For example, integrating traffic and emergency services data can allow for enhanced detection of and response to roadway incidents. However, some cities use ITS and the emerging uses to a much greater extent than others.", "State and local governments face multiple challenges in using ITS technologies to manage traffic congestion. For example, some agencies do not fully integrate ITS into their planning processes. Funding the deployment and maintenance of ITS technologies is also an issue, because of funding constraints and competition with other needed infrastructure projects. Further, agencies struggle to attract and retain staff with the skills necessary to manage and maintain ITS systems and may not have leaders who support ITS. Finally, coordination among agencies can enhance the effectiveness of ITS through such activities as synchronized traffic signals along a corridor, but such coordination can be difficult given agencies\u0092 differing perspectives and priorities.", "RITA\u0092s and FHWA\u0092s activities to promote and support the use of ITS technologies help address these challenges. Both offer ITS-related training and technical assistance and provide guidance and information on their websites. FHWA estimates that states used about $800 million to $1.3 billion of their eligible 2010 federal aid highway funds and $798 million to $1.3 billion of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds on ITS. Further adoption of leading practices could improve these efforts. RITA\u0092s and FHWA\u0092s respective roles in these efforts are not clearly defined, potentially inhibiting their ability to effectively leverage resources. Some experts and transportation agencies noted that ITS-related information on RITA\u0092s and FHWA\u0092s websites is not always presented in a way that is useful and some agencies lack awareness of some ITS activities sponsored by DOT. Several options have been proposed to improve communication about ITS-related activities and facilitate the sharing of ITS information among state and local officials. While RITA intends to develop a new strategy in 2012 for promoting the use of ITS, it has not yet determined whether it will incorporate any of these proposals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that the Secretary of Transportation clearly define the roles of RITA and FHWA in promoting the use of ITS, improve the usefulness of ITS information on the agencies\u0092 websites, and include in its strategy plans to further enhance communication on ITS activities.

We  excluded technologies with primary applications outside roadway traffic  management, such as transit ITS, except when they had bearing on  roadway traffic management. We conducted site visits to four cities:  Washington, D.C.; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania; Austin, Texas; and Los  Angeles, California. We selected these sites based on criteria that  included high congestion levels and varying levels of deployment of ITS  technologies. At each site, we obtained documentation and interviewed  officials from one or more state departments of transportation; one or  more local government transportation agencies; the metropolitan planning  organization; one FHWA division office responsible for the area; and, if  applicable, any academics, researchers, or coalitions focused on ITS in  that metropolitan area.", "We also identified 15 experts from a list of individuals recommended by  officials at RITA, FHWA, AASHTO, and ITS America.

The remaining 60  percent of congestion results from other causes, which, according to  FHWA, can be addressed by management and operations strategies.", "ITS encompasses a broad range of wireless and wire line  communications-based information and electronic technologies, including  technologies for collecting, processing, disseminating, or acting on  information in real time to improve the operation and safety of the  transportation system. When integrated into the transportation system\u2019s  infrastructure and in vehicles themselves, these technologies can relieve  congestion, improve safety, and enhance productivity.", "Using ITS strategies may require officials to make capital improvements  by installing equipment, such as traffic control systems and incident  management systems. In highly congested metropolitan areas, ITS  infrastructure tends to be complex because it typically consists of a set of  systems deployed by multiple agencies. For example, the state  government typically manages and operates freeway facilities, and city or  county governments manage and operate smaller arterial roadways. In a  given metropolitan area, the state transportation department, city traffic  department, transit agency, and toll authority may each deploy different  ITS technologies that address their transportation needs. Metropolitan  planning organizations serve a key role in planning, as they have  responsibility for the regional transportation planning processes in  urbanized areas.", "Congress established the ITS program in 1991 in the Intermodal Surface  Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA),  and DOT created the ITS  Joint Program Office in 1994. Since its creation, the ITS Joint Program  Office has overseen allocation and expenditure of more than $3 billion for  deploying ITS applications and researching new technologies. Under  ISTEA and continuing under the Transportation Equity Act for the 21st  Century (TEA-21), enacted in 1998, Congress authorized funds  specifically for state and local governments to deploy ITS technologies.  The Safe, Accountable, Flexible, and Efficient Transportation Equity Act:  A Legacy for Users (SAFETEA-LU), enacted in 2005, did not directly  reauthorize the ITS deployment program. Although DOT no longer  provides dedicated funding for ITS deployment, states can use their  federal aid highway program funds for improving traffic operations,  including deploying ITS. In addition, state and local governments may  use their own funds to finance ITS projects. State funding mainly comes  from highway user charges, while local funding primarily comes from  general funding allocations, property taxes, sales taxes, and various other  taxes and fees. Although DOT does not track state or local spending on  ITS, a market research company has estimated that states spent a  combined $1.4 billion on ITS in 2010.", "The ITS Joint Program Office, within RITA, leads research of new ITS  technologies and also carries out several activities to promote the use of  existing technologies.

The use of these technologies has also grown on arterial roadways,  with the percentage of signalized intersections covered by electronic data  collection technologies growing from approximately 20 percent in 2000 to  48 percent in 2010. In addition, private companies are expanding the use  of vehicle probes that collect real-time data on travel time and speed,  allowing for greater geographic coverage. Partnering with private  companies to gain vehicle probe data expands the data that state DOTs  use.

It allows faster responses to traffic  conditions caused by special events or traffic incidents. For example,  Los Angeles has developed one of the first fully operating adaptive  signal control systems in North America. Despite benefits of adaptive  signals, according to DOT, only 3 percent of traffic signals in the  country\u2019s largest metropolitan areas are controlled by adaptive signal  control. According to DOT, agencies have not deployed adaptive  signals because of the costs of deploying, operating, and maintaining  them, as well as uncertainty about their benefits.", "Transportation agencies communicate information gathered from traffic  monitoring to the traveling public in various ways, including via dynamic  message signs, television, websites, e-mail, telephone, and devices used  in vehicles such as cell phones.

The number of dynamic message signs deployed on  freeways increased from fewer than 2,000 signs in the year 2000 to over  4,000 in 2010, greatly expanding agencies\u2019 capabilities to communicate  directly with freeway travelers. Arterial agencies also increasingly adopted  dynamic message signs, nearly tripling from 10 percent of responding  agencies in 2000 to 26 percent in 2010.", "The 511 Traveler Information Services are another method of informing  travelers. DOT initiated the development of these services and seeks to  have states deploy them nationwide. These 511 services provide  information via the telephone (using an interactive voice response  automated system) and the Internet. State DOTs generally run these  services and they operate independently of one another. Currently, 14  states lack 511 service coverage or provide service for only a portion of  the state. Additionally, these services vary in the ways they provide  information (phone or Internet), the types of information they provide  (travel times, roadway weather conditions, construction), and areas they  cover (statewide or citywide). To fulfill requirements in SAFETEA-LU,  FHWA issued a Final Rule in November 2010 to establish the Real-Time  System Management Information Program. The rule contains minimum  requirements for states to make information on traffic and travel  conditions available through real-time information programs and to share  this information.

Because of  these gaps, travelers using 511 systems have to contact different  systems while they are traveling and may receive different types of  information.", "In general, the level of ITS deployment varies by state and locality. For  example, the deployment of ITS technologies across the four metropolitan  areas we visited greatly varies (see table 1). ITS is also used more on  freeways than on arterial roads. For example, in response to DOT\u2019s 2010  deployment survey, agencies in 21 metropolitan areas reported deploying  real-time traffic data collection technologies such as loop detectors on  arterial roadways, compared with agencies in 71 metropolitan areas that  reported deploying the same types of technologies on freeways. Several  experts we interviewed described the deployment of ITS nationwide as  \u201cspotty\u201d or having uneven geographical coverage.

Effectively using ITS is dependent upon  agencies having the staff and funding resources needed to maintain and  operate the technologies. We identified four key challenges agencies face  in using ITS: strategic planning, funding deployment and maintenance,  having staff with the knowledge needed to use and maintain ITS, and  coordinating ITS approaches."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Strategic Planning Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Planning for ITS is a key component of strategically using ITS to address  transportation issues and reduce congestion. Transportation planning for  metropolitan areas has traditionally focused on building and maintaining  basic infrastructure to ensure adequate roadway capacity. ITS, in  contrast, focuses on managing already-existing capacity to use it more  effectively. Strategically using ITS requires agencies to shift focus from  planning construction and maintenance of roadways to planning the  operations of the surface transportation system, a shift that, according to  DOT, some states and local transportation agencies have not yet fully  made.", "A RITA official told us that planning is a major challenge that affects  agencies\u2019 ability to make effective use of ITS. The federal ITS program,  as mentioned previously, initially included a DOT program that provided  grants to transportation agencies specifically to deploy ITS. As a result,  many agencies have deployed ITS based on the availability of funding  rather than systematic planning, according to two stakeholders, a national  transportation organization representative, a DOT official, and four  transportation agencies we interviewed. According to FHWA officials, ITS  deployment has not always been clearly connected to a transportation  problem or need, or well integrated with other transportation strategies  and programs. If state and local governments do not consider the range  of available ITS options in developing their congestion management  strategies, they may miss opportunities to better manage traffic and make  the best use of scarce funds to address congestion.", "Most experts we spoke to believed that limitations of planning processes,  as well as the availability of information to support sound decision  making, were challenges faced by state and local governments in using  ITS. Furthermore, six experts, two stakeholders, and officials from five  transportation agencies we contacted noted that there is a need for more  planning and analysis information such as cost-benefit information and  performance measures. Some of these officials noted that it is currently  difficult to calculate and measure the benefits of ITS. For example, in its  2010 deployment survey, DOT found that 25 percent of agencies  responsible for managing arterial roadways reported that they had not  deployed adaptive traffic signal control technology because of uncertainty  about benefits. Lack of quantifiable information about benefits can put ITS  projects at a disadvantage compared with other types of transportation  projects such as road improvements or bridge replacements, which have  more easily quantified benefits. While some studies show that various  types of ITS technologies can be cost-effective, conducting such studies  can be challenging.", "FHWA has emphasized the importance of incorporating transportation  operations (including ITS) into transportation planning, along with related  objectives and performance measures. Despite FHWA\u2019s promotion of the  use of such an approach, many metropolitan planning organizations do  not fully consider operations in the planning process. A recent FHWA  assessment found that metropolitan planning organizations increasingly  address traffic operations (including ITS) in their plans, but only 36  percent include specific, measurable objectives related to operations that  meet DOT\u2019s recommended criteria. Despite challenges, DOT reports  that some regions have effectively incorporated ITS into their planning  efforts, including Hampton Roads, Virginia. The Hampton Roads  Transportation Planning Organization, the metropolitan planning  organization for the area, scores ITS projects for their capacity to support  planning objectives and has been able to acquire federal funding for  several ITS plans and projects through this process. These include a  centralized traveler information system and signal system upgrades."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Funding Challenges", "paragraphs": ["Funding constraints pose a significant challenge to transportation  agencies in their efforts to deploy ITS technologies because of competing  priorities and an overall constrained funding situation. ITS projects must  compete for funding with other surface transportation needs, including  construction and maintenance of roads, which often take priority,  according to officials from transportation and stakeholder agencies we  interviewed. As we reported in 2005, transportation officials often view  adding a new lane to a highway more favorably than ITS when deciding  how to spend their limited transportation funds. DOT has noted that  funding constraints might explain why the rate of adoption of arterial  management technologies over the past decade has been flat. In  addition, the 2010 deployment survey found that 55 percent of agencies  responsible for managing freeways, compared with 36 percent of  agencies responsible for managing arterial roadways, plan to invest in  new ITS in 2010 to 2013. Transportation agencies face difficult decisions  regarding the allocation of their transportation funding, and many have  faced severe revenue declines in recent years, restricting the availability  of funds for transportation improvements. For example, a county  transportation official we interviewed reported that the funds for deploying  and maintaining ITS have been reduced annually over the last 3 to 4  years because of reduced county revenues, which has led to the county  suspending almost all deployment of ITS field devices.", "Transportation officials must identify priorities and make trade-offs  between funding projects that preserve or add new infrastructure and  those that improve operations, such as ITS projects. Preserving  infrastructure is a high priority for state and regional decision makers.  Traffic growth has outpaced highway construction, particularly in major  metropolitan areas, which puts enormous pressure on roads. According  to FHWA\u2019s most recent projections (using 2006 data), less than half of the  vehicle miles traveled in urban areas are on good-quality pavements and  about one-third of urban bridges are in deficient condition.stakeholders and officials from four transportation agencies we spoke  with noted, ITS projects have difficulty competing for funding with other  needs, such as road and bridge maintenance projects. For example, one  city transportation official told us the city must devote most of its  resources to highway and bridge projects rather than new technology,  and in some cases the city has resorted to demolishing unsafe bridges  because of lack of funds rather than repairing or replacing them.", "These funding issues exist within the context of an overall large funding  gap for maintaining and improving the nation\u2019s surface transportation  infrastructure. The Highway Trust Fund has been undergoing a  solvency crisis in recent years. Its expenditures have exceeded its  revenues, which derive mainly from motor fuel taxes. According to 2006  National Surface Transportation Infrastructure Financing Commission  estimates, combined revenues at all levels of government, under current  policies, will meet only 58 percent of the capital investment requirements  for U.S. highway maintenance and only 41 percent of the costs for  highway improvement for the period 2008-2035.", "Agencies that are able to deploy ITS often face additional challenges in  funding the operations and maintenance of these technologies. Eight  experts we interviewed noted that funding operations and maintenance of  ITS is more challenging than funding the initial deployment.  Two experts  we interviewed noted that ITS is often installed and then not fully utilized  or maintained. Additionally, in response to FHWA\u2019s 2009 proposed  requirement for states to make travel information available as part of a  Real-Time System Management Information Program, several states  identified operation and maintenance costs as a barrier to the  implementation of such a program.some systems may exceed those of deployment. For example, in 2003,  investments for signal control hardware had initial costs of $21,000 to  $30,000 and yearly maintenance costs of $9,000 to $10,500 over a 5- year time frame.", "Ongoing costs of operations for  FHWA officials told us that it is often difficult for state and local agencies  to sustain the operations of ITS technologies because of funding  constraints and the higher priority agencies place on basic infrastructure.  For example, a county transportation agency official we interviewed  reported that the agency\u2019s operating budget has been reduced by about  30 percent over the past 2 years, which has led to reduced maintenance  of ITS devices. Officials from one local agency told us that one of its big  challenges is identifying operations and maintenance funding to support  newer systems. Advanced traffic signal systems are one area in which  operations and maintenance funding challenges can limit effectiveness  and impede greater expansion. According to FHWA, over 50 deployments  of these signal systems have occurred over the last two decades.  However, over half of the deployments were deactivated because of  insufficient resources or lack of maintenance or operations capabilities.  Additionally, a 2010 study on adaptive traffic control systems found that  funding\u2014including the high cost of deployments and the lack of funding  for operations\u2014was the main factor in why these systems are not more  widely deployed. Transportation officials in one metropolitan area we  visited told us that it was common for smaller cities to fund the  deployment of advanced traffic signals but be unable to fund, maintain,  and repair them after deployment, causing signal failures that can impair  coordination with neighboring cities and operation of the larger network.", "The lack of funding availability for operations and maintenance is  compounded by other challenges such as insufficient staffing resources,  difficulty in planning maintenance costs, and the fast pace of  technological change. RITA officials noted that some local governments  will not install ITS because they do not have the staff to do the continual  maintenance that the systems require. Three stakeholders and officials  from six transportation agencies told us that funding the operations and  maintenance of ITS is difficult to plan for, because of challenges  accounting for maintenance costs and the fast pace of technology. The  life cycle of ITS technologies is short, between 5 and 7 years, according  to one ITS researcher, meaning that equipment or software will become  obsolete or require retooling within that time frame.", "Some states and localities have developed alternative methods for  financing congestion reduction efforts, including ITS projects. These  supplement traditional funding sources and have included imposing  additional tolls, local taxes, or fees; developing partnerships with private  industry; and designating separate funding. For example,", "Half of the budget of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority of Los  Angeles County comes from a 1.5 percent sales tax dedicated to  transportation. This allows the agency to fund and deploy ITS  improvements countywide, on arterials, highways, and the transit  system.", "The Virginia DOT is constructing High Occupancy Toll lanes on I-495  through a public-private partnership. This agreement provided Virginia  with needed construction funds, as the project would otherwise  consume more than a year of the state\u2019s construction funds.", "Some state and local governments have purchased traffic data from  private companies because they can avoid the costs of data  collection, including sensor deployment and operations and  maintenance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "ITS Knowledge Challenges", "paragraphs": ["ITS is a rapidly developing field that requires a specialized workforce  familiar with emerging technologies.

Workforce demographic changes, the competitive  labor market, new technologies, and new expectations in the  transportation industry combine to make attracting and retaining a  capable workforce difficult for state and local transportation agencies. In  addition, a 2011 National Cooperative Highway Research Program study  found that U.S. universities produce too few skilled applicants for state  and local DOTs. These issues combine to affect the ability of state and  local agencies, especially smaller agencies, to manage ITS.", "Many state and local transportation agencies struggle to maintain in- house staff with the skills and knowledge needed to manage ITS projects.  Eight of the 15 experts we spoke with noted that agencies face  challenges in maintaining staff with the expertise and skills needed for  ITS. For example, 1 expert noted that ITS requires skills that civil  engineers\u2014with whom transportation agencies are generally well  staffed\u2014are not specifically trained in, such as understanding electrical  systems, communication networks, and interagency relationship building.  Another expert noted difficulty finding staff with other skills necessary to  ITS management, such as contract management, systems integration,  and information technology troubleshooting skills. In addition, the fast  pace of technological change and resource limitations put more demands  on transportation officials and limit training opportunities. RITA officials  told us that transportation agencies need systems engineers to manage  ITS deployment and operations but do not have them in sufficient  numbers. For example, a local government official told us he has been  unable to fill a vacant ITS-related engineering position because of a hiring  freeze that has been in effect for over 3 years. According to this official,  this makes it difficult to complete ITS projects even when funds for  projects are available.", "Once ITS professionals have needed skills, agencies find it difficult to  retain them. Eight of the 15 experts we spoke with noted that retention of  qualified staff is a challenge for agencies. Limitations in salary and career  opportunities can limit the ability of state and local governments to retain  staff. One expert noted that the ITS staff at his state DOT could double  their salary by going elsewhere, and another mentioned a state DOT  employee who had multiple job offers from the private sector and whom  the state DOT could no longer afford. Additionally, officials from 10  transportation and stakeholder agencies we interviewed noted that  retaining staff was a challenge. For example, officials from several  transportation and stakeholder agencies noted that, because of budget  restrictions, they have been unable to hire ITS staff to replace those who  have retired.", "This is a particular issue for small agencies, according to two FHWA  division office ITS engineers. The agencies controlling arterial roadways  and intersections, including traffic signals, are typically county and city  governments and are smaller in terms of funding and personnel, on  average, than agencies controlling freeways, which are typically state  governments. For example, the National Transportation Operations  Coalition\u2019s 2007 National Traffic Signal Report Card Technical Report  found that agencies operating very small signal systems scored markedly  lower on signal operations than all other agencies, likely because of staff  not having specialized knowledge of signal systems operations and  maintenance. Additionally, the report found almost one-half of all 417  survey respondents did not have staff or resources committed to monitor  or manage traffic signal operations on a regular basis. According to a  paper by two FHWA division office ITS engineers in California, small to  medium-size agencies in the state lack qualified staff and, as a result, find  it difficult to implement complex ITS projects successfully. The engineers  noted that these agencies are not able to maintain staff with project  management and systems engineering expertise because of insufficient  ITS activity to justify a full-time staff position, high turnover of staff, and  difficulty in obtaining ITS training. In the paper, the FHWA engineers  proposed several potential solutions for these agencies, such as sharing  technical staff within the same agency, sharing ITS staff between  agencies, hiring consultants, or hiring another agency to perform some of  the needed functions.", "Seven experts, six stakeholders, and officials from nine transportation  agencies we spoke with noted that agencies often address these issues  by hiring consultants for ITS support. State and local agency officials  reported hiring consultants to perform a range of ITS tasks, such as  maintaining ITS equipment, developing the regional architecture needed  to meet federal requirements, and conducting the systems engineering to  develop project requirements.", "Of the 15 experts we spoke to, 12 rated institutional leadership and support as a  challenge facing state and local governments in deploying, operating, and maintaining  ITS. Five identified it as a major challenge, 3 as between a major and a minor challenge, 4  as a minor challenge, 2 as not a challenge, and 1 had no basis to judge. elected and appointed officials lack good understanding of potential ITS  benefits, and require reeducation when there is a change in leadership,  which can lead to variations in funding and other support.

Transportation networks include freeways, arterial roadways, and transit  systems that cross state and jurisdictional boundaries; and ITS may be  implemented by numerous agencies, such as state DOTs, counties,  cities, and transit agencies. For example, in the Pittsburgh metropolitan  area, approximately 260 townships manage their own traffic signals, and  in the Los Angeles metropolitan area, approximately 120 cities manage  their own traffic signals, according to metropolitan planning organization  officials. As noted previously, better integration of data across  jurisdictions can improve traffic operations and traveler information.  According to FHWA, better coordination has the potential to improve a  region\u2019s integration of ITS approaches, permitting agencies to leverage  resources, avoid duplication, and enhance ITS effectiveness. However,  we found coordination of various ITS elements and technologies is a  challenge for agencies. Fourteen experts, seven stakeholders, and  officials from five transportation agencies we interviewed noted that   In addition, the DOT 2010  coordination across agencies is a challenge.deployment survey found that about 39 percent of freeway management  agencies employ coordinated traffic incident management and only about  16 percent of freeway agencies and 28 percent of arterial agencies  engage in cross-jurisdictional traffic signal coordination.", "Agencies face difficulty coordinating for many reasons, including differing  priorities and perspectives. In 2007, we reported that common challenges  transportation agencies face in coordinating include difficulties aligning  perspectives when working on regional projects and addressing  competing ideas of which jurisdictions should be responsible for the  management and funding of ITS projects that cross boundaries. FHWA  officials noted that some communities may have priorities that are  contrary to the goal of creating free-flowing traffic, such as slowing down  traffic through the town. Additionally, officials from six transportation  agencies we interviewed discussed differing jurisdictional priorities as  obstacles to regional goals. For example, in regard to traffic signals,  officials in one metropolitan area we visited told us some cities work  together to manage their signals with the purpose of expediting traffic  through a corridor, while other cities want to independently manage their  signals to slow traffic or discourage additional traffic. In another  metropolitan area we visited, metropolitan planning organization officials  reported challenges deciding who will bear the financial responsibility for  bus priority signals that would allow buses to have priority through traffic  signals. While the transit agency that operated the buses wanted a single  equipment system to enable buses to move freely at signals in the  region\u2019s various jurisdictions, cities operating the traffic lights could not  afford to modify their systems.", "In some cases, agencies are able to work together to achieve common  goals to reduce congestion. For example, three jurisdictions outside of  Pittsburgh\u2014Cranberry Township, Seven Fields Borough, and Adams  Township\u2014worked together in 2008 to implement a signal coordination  project along Route 228, a congested arterial corridor. These jurisdictions  were able to secure a mix of local and state funding to implement the  project and established an agreement to govern the maintenance of the  signals. According to an evaluation, the project could yield total benefits  of up to approximately $2 million in reduced delay, reduced fuel  consumption, and reduced emissions over a 5-year period.

FHWA sponsors a program called Planning for  Operations aimed at incorporating traffic operations strategies, supported  by ITS technologies, into mainstream transportation planning. For  example, this approach advocates using operations-based objectives and  performance measures, such as reducing delays as a result of incidents,  as a basis for choosing congestion management strategies, such as  traffic incident management strategies that make use of ITS technologies  to identify and respond to incidents more quickly. As part of this effort,  FHWA sponsors workshops for metropolitan planning organizations and  has written guidance that provides examples of operations objectives,  performance measures, and a sample transportation plan that includes  different operational strategies.

SAFETEA-LU authorizes states to use their federal aid  highway funding for developing and implementing ITS systems. For  example, funds from the Highway Trust Fund\u2019s National Highway System,  Surface Transportation, and Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality  Improvement programs are eligible to be used for the deployment and  operations of ITS technologies. Although funding of ITS technologies is  not specifically tracked, FHWA officials estimate that approximately 3 to 5  percent, or between $800 million and $1.3 billion for fiscal year 2010, of  federal aid highway program funds have been used for ITS  technologies. For the most part, this funding is not for pure ITS projects  but rather for ITS technologies that are incorporated into larger road and  bridge improvement projects. According to FHWA officials, an internal  analysis found that a similar percentage of funds, or between about $800  million and $1.3 billion, of FHWA\u2019s American Recovery and Reinvestment  Act funds were used for ITS deployments, with the majority of the total  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds being obligated between  early 2009 and March 2011. In fiscal year 2010, RITA obligated  approximately $28.2 million for research on emerging uses of ITS  technologies and obligated an additional $12.3 million to programs  supporting the deployment of ITS, including the Professional Capacity  Building program.", "DOT also provides funding for limited trial deployments of ITS. Since  2005, FHWA has provided about $26.6 million and managed about  $150.9 million of RITA\u2019s funds for demonstration projects that support the  use of ITS technologies in managing traffic congestion, including four  Urban Partnership Agreement projects, two Congestion Reduction  program projects, and two Integrated Corridor Management projects.

According to a RITA official, this  effort is currently on hold, awaiting the results of a National Cooperative  Highway Research Program study. This study, which is being conducted  by the Transportation Research Board, is focusing on designing an  Operations Center of Excellence that would facilitate implementation of  best practices for traffic operations, including ITS, and promote  collaboration among state and local government officials in developing  best practices. The study will assess the needs of state and local  transportation agencies, inventory the available resources, and analyze  alternative methods to implement and fund such a center. The study is   DOT has not yet defined its  expected to be completed in early 2012.role in establishing, supporting, and implementing such a center. A RITA  official said that the organization would need extra funds if it was tasked  with operating such a center and will wait for the outcome of the study to  determine the role it can play. FHWA officials told us that they envision  that they would be heavily involved in setting up the Operations Center of  Excellence, but would prefer that it not be funded by DOT. Participation in  this effort, if and when it is implemented, could allow both RITA and  FHWA to identify and potentially take advantage of opportunities to  leverage their ITS promotion and support activities with those of external  organizations. Such leveraging is particularly important given federal  fiscal constraints. As RITA develops its strategy for ensuring that the  results of its ITS research become commercially viable and are adopted  by the transportation community, it could benefit from working with FHWA  to consider this range of options for improving communication about ITS  resources related to traffic management, thereby enhancing access to  and awareness of these resources, and facilitating learning exchanges  among state and local governments, while leveraging its resources.", "Both RITA and FHWA collect information to monitor the adoption of ITS  technologies and use this information to understand the level of  deployment and make decisions on how to encourage the future  deployment of ITS technologies, according to officials from both agencies.", "Nearly every year since 1997, RITA has conducted a national survey of  state and local government agencies on the deployment of various ITS  technologies and reported the results on its website. The deployment  survey also gauges the factors affecting decisions to purchase ITS, views  on benefits associated with ITS, and plans for continued investment.  According to a RITA official, the agency uses the information on the level  of current ITS deployments to help make decisions about future research.  In addition, the survey provides feedback to RITA officials on the level of  stakeholder interest in deploying specific ITS technologies and  operational strategies. For example, the survey results assist the  Professional Capacity Building program in determining the locations  where ITS technologies are deployed and any gaps in deployment that  merit attention.", "FHWA also uses the deployment survey to understand ITS deployment  trends. FHWA officials said they use the deployment statistics when  developing operations-based initiatives, such as selecting the states to  include in a program aimed at accelerating the integration of ITS and  operational strategies into mainstream transportation planning. In  addition, FHWA recently used the 2010 survey results when issuing a  Final Rule for the Real-Time System Management Information Program,  which requires states to establish programs to collect traffic and travel  information. The survey was used to establish a baseline for the  deployment of 511 traveler information services and determine the effect  this rule would have on the expansion of 511 services, according to a  RITA official. FHWA\u2019s Office of Operations\u2019 plan also incorporates  deployment assessments for specific operations programs, such as the  Road Weather Management program. This program tracks the rate of  adoption of road weather technologies, such as a decision support  system that helps winter maintenance managers make road treatment  decisions."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As traffic congestion is projected to grow and state and local governments  face fiscal constraints, ITS technologies and operational strategies  supported by ITS provide opportunities for state and local governments to  manage traffic congestion on the nation\u2019s existing roadways.  Furthermore, emerging uses of ITS technologies have the potential to  build upon existing investments in ITS by integrating real-time traffic  information and instituting proactive management techniques. However,  the challenges that state and local governments face in planning and  funding ITS use, ensuring that staff and leaders have adequate  knowledge of ITS, and coordinating ITS approaches impede their ability  to make the most effective use of ITS technologies in addressing  congestion.", "While DOT\u2019s efforts to promote and support the use of ITS technologies  help state and local agencies address these challenges, the department  could improve the effectiveness of these efforts through greater use of  leading practices for promoting technology use. The lack of clearly  defined respective roles and responsibilities of RITA and FHWA in  promoting and supporting ITS raises questions about whether DOT could  better leverage its resources and provide a more specific, cohesive  strategy for ITS as it evolves. In addition, DOT\u2019s activities may not be  achieving maximum results, as state and local officials may have difficulty  identifying the most relevant information or may not be aware of all of the  ITS-related activities sponsored by RITA and FHWA. Taking steps to  more effectively target efforts and leverage resources by further exploring  internal and external opportunities to promote and support ITS  technologies could better ensure that DOT\u2019s activities achieve their  intended purposes. Some options currently under consideration hold  promise for facilitating the exchange of ITS information among state and  local governments as well as for enhancing communication to improve  access to and awareness of ITS-related resources. It will be important for  DOT to work with its external partners and determine its role in these  efforts to ensure it is fully leveraging its resources in promoting the use of  ITS and maximizing its reach.

On the basis of interviews with DOT officials and  analysis of the data, we determined that the data were sufficiently reliable  for our purposes. We also analyzed pertinent legislation, documents, and  studies of traffic management approaches and ITS deployment in the  United States. We synthesized information from interviews with officials  from DOT, including the Research and Innovative Technology  Administration (RITA) and Federal Highway Administration (FHWA). We  also interviewed officials from related associations such as the American  Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) and  the Intelligent Transportation Society of America (ITS America).", "We conducted site visits to Washington, D.C.; Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania;  Austin, Texas; and Los Angeles, California. At each site, we obtained  documentation and interviewed officials from one or more state  departments of transportation; one or more local government  transportation agencies; the metropolitan planning organization; one  FHWA division office responsible for the area; and, if applicable, any  academics, researchers, or coalitions focused on ITS in that metropolitan  area. We selected these locations from those with high congestion levels  as determined by the Texas Transportation Institute\u2019s 2010 Urban  Mobility Report and varied ITS deployment levels as determined by  DOT\u2019s 2007 deployment survey database. We made a final selection of  sites that included cities of different sizes and geographical  representation, and one metropolitan area that spans more than one state  (Washington, D.C.). We are not able to generalize our findings in these  site visits to the whole country but used the other sources mentioned  above to gain a more general perspective.", "We also conducted a literature search to identify background materials on  emerging ITS technologies, published research by prospective ITS experts,  and leading practices in promoting and supporting the adoption of new  transportation technologies. The literature search focused on databases  with transportation and engineering journal articles and conference  proceedings (e.g., ProQuest and Transport Research International  Documentation) as well as government reports (e.g., National Technical  Information Service). The search terms used were related to using ITS for  managing traffic congestion (e.g., incident response management).", "We conducted semistructured interviews with 15 experts, whom we  selected based on recommendations from officials at RITA, FHWA,  AASHTO, and ITS America using several criteria. The primary  requirement was that each individual have expertise in at least one of the  following ITS fields that are important for traffic management: freeway  management, arterial management, traffic incident management,  roadway operations and maintenance, traveler information, and road  weather management. In addition, we selected individuals with  experience in the operations or deployment of ITS; planning,  development, or evaluation of ITS projects; or experience with DOT\u2019s  efforts to promote and support the use of ITS technologies. In making our  final selection, we considered publications and ITS experience and aimed  to include a mix of individuals from state and local government,  transportation associations, academia, and private industry. We selected  experts based on how frequently they were recommended, a proxy for  their standing within the ITS community, and to obtain a representative  mix of officials from state and local government, academia, transportation  associations, and private industry (such as consultants and ITS service or  equipment providers). Through this representative mix, we believe that  we have obtained a balanced set of perspectives.", "We identified emerging uses of ITS technologies, which we defined as  approaches that have begun to be used over the last 5-10 years,  including approaches being researched or promoted by DOT, through  interviews with DOT officials, experts, and a literature search. We  excluded technologies with primary applications outside roadway traffic  management, such as transit ITS, except when it had bearing on roadway  traffic management. The scope of our work did not include connected  vehicle technology or uses of ITS primarily aimed at other than managing  and reducing traffic congestion, such as rural safety. To determine what  emerging uses of ITS technologies have the greatest potential to reduce  congestion, we presented the experts with a list of emerging uses of ITS  technologies that we identified. This list consisted of (1) real-time data  capture, sharing, and management; (2) real-time traveler information; (3)  integrated corridor management; (4) active transportation and demand  management; (5) enhanced incident response management; (6) weather  responsive traffic management; and (7) work zone management. We  asked the experts if there were other emerging uses of ITS technologies  that they believe have significant potential to reduce traffic congestion,  and asked them to rate these and the above ITS uses on their potential to  reduce traffic congestion. On the basis of the expert ratings, we selected  the four emerging uses that all experts ranked as having at least medium  potential to reduce traffic congestion, and which the most experts (at least  9 of the 15) rated as having high potential to reduce traffic congestion.", "To determine what types of challenges state and local governments face  in using ITS technologies to manage traffic congestion, we conducted  interviews with and obtained documents from RITA and FHWA officials,  and AASHTO and ITS America representatives; conducted interviews  with identified experts; reviewed published research on ITS challenges  identified through a literature search; gathered information through  interviews and documents collected during the site visits described  above; and analyzed these various interviews and documents to identify  the most frequently cited challenges. We did not otherwise assess the  extent of these challenges in the locations visited, such as determining  actual funding or staffing levels.", "To determine the extent to which DOT\u2019s promotion and support of state  and local governments\u2019 use of ITS technologies responded to challenges  they face and met leading practices, we collected information on DOT\u2019s ITS  promotion and support through interviews with RITA and FHWA officials  and reviews of RITA\u2019s and FHWA\u2019s program and strategic planning  documents, including documents related to the professional capacity- building program and traffic operations improvement efforts.

We limited our  work to DOT\u2019s activities and information relevant to the promotion and  support of state and local governments\u2019 use of ITS, not including DOT\u2019s  efforts aimed at bringing new technologies to market. We determined how  DOT is required to promote and support the use of ITS technologies  through reviews of pertinent laws. To determine the extent to which DOT\u2019s  efforts are meeting the challenges and leading practices, we reviewed  literature on promoting and supporting the use of new technologies,  including prior GAO reports, Transportation Research Board publications,  and other academic publications, particularly focusing on leading practices  that encourage the adoption of transportation technologies by state and  local governments.
