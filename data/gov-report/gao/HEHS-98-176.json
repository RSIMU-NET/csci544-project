Today, the military health care system provides coverage for about 8.2 million people; more than half of those covered are retirees and their dependents and survivors. Under the terms of its authority (10 U.S.C. 1074 and 1076), DOD may provide health care to the families of active duty military and retirees of any age in its medical facilities as long as space and resources are available. Beneficiaries receive such space-available care at little or no cost. The statute, however, does not entitle these beneficiaries to that care."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Military Health Care System and Its Pharmacy Benefit", "paragraphs": ["Pharmacy programs represent about 9 percent of the $14.7 billion Defense Health Program budget\u2014about $1.3 billion. Among the health care services, the pharmacy benefit is most in demand by military beneficiaries. DOD currently provides prescription drug benefits through three programs: military treatment facility (MTF) outpatient pharmacies, TRICARE contractors\u2019 retail pharmacies, and a national contractor\u2019s mail order service. The largest DOD pharmacy program is the outpatient pharmacies operated in the direct care system of 587 Air Force, Army, and Navy MTFs. The program spent an estimated $741 million for prescription drugs in fiscal year 1997. About 4,000 military and civilian pharmacists and technicians run the pharmacies, and in 1997 they dispensed about 55 million prescriptions.", "MTFs get most of their prescription drug supplies through the Defense Supply Center in Philadelphia (DSCP). DSCP provides over $3.4 billion in food, clothing, medicines, and medical supplies to military personnel worldwide and other federal customers. DSCP\u2019s pharmaceuticals group, the single manager for DOD purchases and supplies, had fiscal year 1996 sales of over $700 million. DSCP uses its prime vendor program to deliver medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to MTFs. A prime vendor is a distributor that has been awarded a contract to store and distribute pharmaceutical products to individual MTFs, reducing the need for DOD wholesale and retail systems. Under this concept, DSCP negotiates prices for pharmaceutical products directly with manufacturers. DSCP then contracts with the prime vendor to buy the products at these prices and distribute them directly to the MTF within 24 hours of receiving an order.DSCP negotiates discounted drug prices through distribution and pricing agreements (DAPA) with over 200 drug manufacturers. According to DSCP, DAPA prices have been between 24 and 70 percent less than average wholesale prices.", "The direct care system is supplemented by DOD\u2019s TRICARE managed care support contracts, under which retail pharmacy benefits are provided to eligible military beneficiaries. TRICARE contractors offer both network and nonnetwork retail pharmacy services. A network pharmacy contracts to fill prescriptions at the same discounted retail price to anyone covered by TRICARE. If beneficiaries have no other health insurance, network pharmacies file claims on beneficiaries\u2019 behalf for prescriptions filled. Beneficiaries using nonnetwork pharmacies pay full retail costs and submit claims to get reimbursed. DOD\u2019s national mail-order pharmacy program contractor is another way DOD augments MTF pharmacy services. This program delivers 30- to 90-day supplies of medications taken for longer-term, chronic health problems to eligible beneficiaries\u2019 homes.", "In the private sector, pharmacy benefit managers (PBM) administer prescription drug coverage on behalf of health plan sponsors. Their objective is to provide high-quality pharmaceutical care at the lowest possible cost. PBMs, a relatively new type of firm, became a major market force only during the late 1980s. Their precursors were firms that provided prescription claims processing or mail-order pharmacy service on behalf of insurers. While PBMs continue to provide these services, many provide additional services, such as formulary development and management, development of pharmacy networks to serve health plan enrollees, drug rebate negotiation with manufacturers, generic substitution, therapeutic interchange, and drug utilization review. Many PBMs are also developing products called \u201cdisease management\u201d programs, which will attempt to provide the most cost-effective treatments for specific diseases.", "Like a growing number of health insurers who have experienced rapidly rising prescription drug costs, the military health care system has experienced prescription drug demand and cost increases. DOD pharmacy costs increased 13 percent between 1995 and 1997, compared with DOD\u2019s overall health care cost increase of 2 percent for that period. While DOD pharmacy costs are estimated at less than 10 percent of health program spending, drug therapy can affect a larger share of the total $14.7 billion defense health care costs. That is, drug treatment can sometimes help avoid the use of more costly medical treatments involving hospitalizations and surgeries or reduce other outpatient medical costs associated with chronic diseases. Accordingly, DOD has taken steps to improve pharmacy program management. In 1993, for example, DOD Health Affairs established the DOD Pharmacoeconomic Center (at Fort Sam Houston, San Antonio) to improve the overall use of pharmaceuticals. In 1995, Health Affairs increased the Center\u2019s responsibilities and created a Pharmacy Board of Directors to provide guidance to the Center. Since October 1997 the Board has been looking at ways to improve the formulation of DOD pharmacy policies.", "Before February 1998, no single DOD organization had overall responsibility for all MTF and contractor-supported pharmacy programs and operations (see fig. 1 for organization chart as of January 1998). However, since January, Health Affairs has undergone leadership changes and reorganized its TRICARE management group into the new TRICARE Management Activity (TMA).

The act also requires the Secretary of Defense to report to the Congress no later than 90 days after our report is issued on the feasibility and advisability of implementing changes to DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs, based on our findings and conclusions.", "To do our work, we reviewed laws, regulations, and policies applicable to DOD pharmacy programs and obtained cost and workload data from relevant DOD sources and databases. We interviewed and obtained documents from DOD officials at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) and at TMA offices in Washington, D.C.; Aurora, Colorado; and San Antonio, Texas; the Deputy General Counsel (Personnel and Health Policy), Washington, D.C.; DSCP; and TRICARE lead agent offices in San Antonio; Fairfield, California; and Colorado Springs. We also interviewed and obtained documents from pharmacy consultants at the Army\u2019s Surgeon General\u2019s Office, the Navy\u2019s Bureau of Medicine and Surgery, and the Air Force Surgeon General\u2019s Office and from head pharmacists at 15 MTFs in California, Colorado, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Missouri, Texas, and Washington, D.C. We interviewed and obtained documents from three TRICARE managed care support contractors: Foundation Health Federal Services, Inc.

But DOD and its contractors lack such data, largely because their computerized pharmacy patient databases are not integrated. Thus, their ability to manage the MTF, TRICARE retail, and national mail-order pharmacy programs is significantly impaired. In the private sector, where PBMs manage more than 2.4 billion prescriptions per year, computer databases connect thousands of retail and mail-order pharmacies electronically. Such on-line capabilities enable PBMs to achieve cost-efficiencies and enhance patient care. Currently, higher priority plans to upgrade DOD\u2019s Composite Health Care System (CHCS)\u2014with planned fiscal year 2003 implementation\u2014have kept DOD from installing a readily available automated drug utilization review system known as the Universal Pharmacy Patient Profile (UP3)."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Overall Pharmacy Cost and Use Data Are Not Readily Available", "paragraphs": ["DOD cannot readily access information on basics such as MTFs\u2019 and contractors\u2019 drug costs and use, dispensing costs, MTF or civilian physicians who frequently prescribe high-cost drugs, or beneficiaries with large prescription drug expenses. MTF pharmacy cost and use data are generally unreliable, and the types of pharmacy data DOD requires TRICARE contractors to report are not useful for management purposes. To estimate DOD\u2019s systemwide pharmacy program costs, we pieced together data from several DOD entities. In so doing, we found conflicting pharmacy cost reports differing by millions of dollars for the same activity. For example, while the TMA Resource Management Office reported to us that fiscal year 1996 Army pharmacy program costs were about $198 million, the Army Pharmacy Consultant (who is also a member of DOD\u2019s Pharmacy Board of Directors) reported that such costs were about $249 million. Also, some sources were and others were not trying to account for MTFs\u2019 drug-dispensing costs, including pharmacy personnel and other direct and indirect costs to provide pharmacy services.", "On the basis of fiscal year 1997 data provided by five separate DOD pharmacy and budget management entities, we estimated that MTF pharmacies spent between about $741 million and about $776 million for drugs alone, and about $305 million on drug-dispensing costs\u2014for a fiscal year 1997 total of about $1 billion. We obtained contractor pharmacy costs from two other DOD organizations, which, when added to estimated MTF costs, amounted to a systemwide fiscal year cost estimate of about $1.3 billion. Cost data are not available on matters such as (1) over-the-counter drugs, (2) MTF prescriptions for Medicare retirees, and (3) the top 50 drugs, in terms of DOD expenditures or numbers of prescriptions dispensed. Such information could be used to make policy and managed care decisions needed to address cost savings and service quality. Table 2.1 contains our estimates of DOD\u2019s pharmacy costs for fiscal years 1995 through 1997.", "While DOD requires the TRICARE contractors to report monthly prescription drug volume and claims costs for their retail pharmacy programs, DOD uses the reports primarily to oversee \u201ccash disbursements\u201d at the completion of the claims adjudication process. Contractor officials told us, however, they would not recommend such reports to their commercial clients for use in controlling pharmacy costs. For example, the reports do not include national drug codes, physician identification numbers, or patient-level drug use. Such information is needed to target high-cost drugs, in terms of DOD expenditures, that should be subject to utilization management restrictions; prepare doctor \u201creport cards\u201d used to educate or provide incentives to those who prescribe too many or nonformulary drugs; and identify patients who are getting too many or the wrong mix of medications. One contractor\u2019s (Humana) officials told us they successfully worked with regional DOD pharmacy managers to expand the required reports\u2019 scope and detail. But, they told us, those reports were of far less management value than reports they provide their commercial customers."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lack of Integrated Pharmacy Databases Increases Prescription Drug Costs and Risks", "paragraphs": ["Although most military beneficiaries regularly obtain prescription drugs from multiple dispensing outlets across DOD\u2019s three programs, no centralized computer database exists with each patient\u2019s complete medication history. The hundreds of MTF pharmacy databases are not linked, nor are the TRICARE contractors\u2019 retail pharmacies\u2019 and the national mail-order pharmacy patient medication records linked together or with the MTF databases. Contractor and DOD pharmacy officials told us that millions of dollars in unnecessary costs from overutilization and patient safety problems from adverse reactions to prescription drugs are likely occurring because DOD lacks the databases needed to support automated prospective drug utilization review (PRODUR) systems to review DOD prescriptions before they are dispensed. Such systems are widely used to reduce inappropriate prescription drug use that can cause adverse reactions leading to illness, hospitalization, and even death. In addition to promoting patient safety, PRODUR systems can be used to better identify patterns of fraud, abuse (including overuse), or other inappropriate or medically unnecessary care.", "Such systems, moreover, are now used in some Medicaid programs and the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). For example, between 1994 and 1995, five state Medicaid programs saved $5 million by appropriately canceling early refill prescriptions. Also, three FEHBP plans, with about 4.5 million beneficiaries, estimated combined savings of about $19 million in 1995 by using automated PRODUR systems. Another PBM told us that, for the FEHBP plans it represents, 1997 savings from using PRODUR were $46 million. While those savings were significant, other major dollar savings may be achieved, in all likelihood, by avoiding hospitalizations resulting from inappropriate drug therapy. (App. I provides details on how PRODUR systems work.)", "DOD\u2019s lack of integrated pharmacy patient databases, and thus its inability to use PRODUR systemwide, are the most significant cost-effectiveness and patient safety obstacles in its pharmacy system. Now, DOD\u2019s ability to use a PRODUR system is limited to local systems at specific MTF pharmacies that do not have the patient\u2019s complete history. PRODUR would enable DOD, as is done in FEHBP, the Medicaid program, and the private sector, to perform cost-saving and safety-enhancing drug reviews with consistency throughout the drug distribution system (MTFs, TRICARE retail, and national mail order). For example, each of these pharmacies, when presented with a new or refill prescription by a DOD beneficiary, could check the patient\u2019s complete medication profile to ensure that the new drug will not adversely react with the patient\u2019s other drugs. The review could also disclose whether the prescription is being refilled too soon. DOD pharmacy officials told us that integrated program databases would allow MTFs to convert from an inefficient manual third-party billing process to an electronic billing system, annually saving an estimated $25 million.", "Several DOD pharmacy officials told us that the lack of PRODUR has allowed beneficiary prescription drug stockpiling to become so pervasive among patients using MTF pharmacies that pharmacists commonly refer to the problem as \u201cpolypharmacy\u201d\u2014or the practice of visiting multiple pharmacies to accumulate more prescription drugs than needed. To illustrate, they provided the following examples:", "During a 10-week period, a sickle cell anemia patient being treated at an Army base for chronic pain obtained 14 prescriptions (a 1-year supply) of potentially addictive narcotics. Several civilian and two Army and Navy doctors wrote the prescriptions, which were filled at the Army medical center pharmacy, a Navy hospital pharmacy, and several of the TRICARE contractor\u2019s regional retail pharmacies. The lack of a common, computerized patient drug profile and PRODUR prevented the Army, the Navy, and the TRICARE contractor\u2019s PBM company from detecting the prescription abuse and drug stockpiling. By happenstance, an Army medical center pharmacist came upon the problem during an unrelated regional pharmacy cost review.", "At an Air Force base, a young patient\u2019s mother obtained 260 prescriptions in 15 months from several on-base doctors. The prescriptions were filled at the base hospital and clinic pharmacies. In effect, she amassed a 5-year supply of inhalant asthma drugs (Proventil and Ventolin) and inhalation devices. When an investigation was conducted as a result of the mother\u2019s aggressive behavior toward pharmacy staff, the base hospital pharmacy staff had to manually compile the patient\u2019s medication profile from the hospital and clinic pharmacies to determine the extent of the mother\u2019s drug stockpiling.", "At another Air Force base, the clinic pharmacy collected old and unused prescription drugs from beneficiaries\u2019 houses as part of a poisonous waste cleanup project. The pharmacy recovered several unopened drug packages, which suggested that these MTF prescriptions were not needed. In three instances, for example, they recovered 12 packages of Proventil asthma inhalers; 7 tubes of Cyclocort anti-inflammatory ointment; and a 6-month supply of Norvasc (a drug used to treat high blood pressure). All the drug packages were past their printed expiration dates.", "Upon her husband\u2019s death from chronic lung disease, a widow returned several boxes of inhalant drugs and supplies to an Army base\u2019s pharmacy. Obtained from several MTF pharmacies over a 2-year period, the drugs were valued at about $5,000. In responding to why she and her husband obtained drugs that were not used, the widow pointed out that her husband was entitled to them, he feared his benefits might be curtailed, and so they stocked up.", "On a Monday afternoon, a patient and his wife tried to fill prescriptions worth $400 at an Air Force base pharmacy. Somewhat suspicious, the pharmacist called the out-of-state base that wrote the prescriptions. He found that the couple had gotten a 90-day supply of each drug from that out-of-state base pharmacy the previous Friday, and, checking further, that they had gotten 90-day supplies of the drugs at another base pharmacy that same Monday morning. The pharmacist refused to fill the prescriptions and alerted the other pharmacies. The couple left, threatening to formally complain that the Air Force had denied them their duly prescribed and needed medications.", "The dollar and safety consequences of DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs\u2019 lack of integrated computer databases and PRODUR are likely significant. DOD and contractor officials told us they believe that systemwide drug use costs alone are a likely 10 to 20 percent higher than they should be because of inappropriate drug therapy and stockpiling. Applying similar percentages to the estimated 1997 total DOD drug costs would mean that some $99 million to $197 million may be unnecessary. The officials also told us that inappropriate drug therapy causes about 10 percent of hospitalization, emergency room, and doctor visit costs. According to a May 1998 Pharmacoeconomic Center analysis, 55,000 MTF hospitalizations per year may be caused by inappropriate drug therapy. This means that at a $1,500 average daily cost, about $83 million in MTF hospitalization expenses may be preventable. More importantly, patient safety is in jeopardy without PRODUR. Other studies likewise estimated that hospitalizations caused by inappropriate drug therapy range from 3 percent of the general population to as high as 28 percent for the elderly.", "In November 1995, some DOD pharmacy officials proposed networking all MTF pharmacies to create a centralized patient medication record database so PRODUR could be applied. This system was estimated within DOD to save more than $100 million over a 10-year period\u2014more than offsetting the system\u2019s estimated $21 million cost\u2014and to markedly improve patient health care and safety. The proposed UP3 system would create for every patient a single electronic record of all inpatient and outpatient drugs that would be accessible by all pharmacies through a centralized database. The UP3 system would support automated functions such as prospective drug utilization reviews, drug recalls, third-party claims adjudication, and inventory control. The DOD pharmacy officials\u2019 1995 proposal focuses on first integrating MTF pharmacies, but suggests eventual integration with contractor-supported retail and mail-order pharmacy databases. In May 1998, Pharmacoeconomic Center staff incorporated new information that substantially changes these earlier estimates: $424 million in savings over 10 years, about 10 times greater than the revised $43 million estimate of the system\u2019s cost over the same period.", "The headquarters office responsible for finally approving all DOD health information technology investments, however, has declined to further fund the project. TMA Office of Information, Technology, and Reengineering officials told us that their aim is to avoid investing in redundant and \u201cstovepipe\u201d technologies. These officials told us that the planned acquisition of the CHCS II system in fiscal year 2003 and alternative improvements to the current CHCS system before 2003 will meet the same needs identified in the UP3 proposal. But DOD pharmacy officials disagreed and told us that UP3 would amount to a low-cost, high-return investment in readily available commercial software. They further asserted that such software will be compatible with and required in capturing the pharmacy data component of the future CHCS II computer-based patient record. We agree with the pharmacy officials\u2019 assessment and believe the software application could also be immediately interfaced with existing DOD health information systems used to purchase and distribute pharmaceutical supplies\u2014further ensuring future compatibility with the planned CHCS II upgrade.", "TRICARE retail pharmacy contractors told us that they were eager to integrate their databases with MTF pharmacy databases. Although they routinely use PRODUR to manage their commercial health plan pharmacy benefits, they are unable to do so with TRICARE or the national mail-order programs because of the lack of automated linkage to MTF pharmacy patient databases. They told us that they supported the DOD pharmacists\u2019 proposal to use PRODUR and would welcome collaborating with DOD as they have done on other TRICARE matters.

DOD\u2019s goal likewise is to provide a uniform, consistent drug benefit to the 8 million active duty personnel, retirees, and their families, regardless of residence. Despite DOD\u2019s intentions, however, this is not taking place.

In contrast, DOD has not adopted such a systems view of its pharmacy operations. Rather, DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs are structured in a way that creates benefit inconsistencies among the programs and the various categories of military beneficiaries.", "Lessons can be learned by contrasting DOD\u2019s requirements with those provided under the world\u2019s largest employer-sponsored health insurance program\u2014FEHBP. FEHBP provided voluntary health insurance coverage for about 9 million federal civilian employees, retirees, and dependents in 1997. During that year, it spent about $16.3 billion to cover its members.To differing degrees, all FEHBP plans cover prescription drugs. In 1995, pharmacy benefit payments for five of the largest FEHBP plans were about $2 billion. The standard FEHBP plan brochure includes a prescription drug benefit section reflecting various benefit design decisions that balance the plan\u2019s need for cost control with employees\u2019 need for the widest drug service selection. Since the brochure\u2019s drug benefit section is highly detailed, enrollees have a full explanation of benefits and what to expect in gaining access to pharmacy care and in filing a claim\u2014no matter where they live.", "In contrast, DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs operate under a complicated and confusing array of policies, regulations, and contractual requirements governing key benefit design elements such as eligibility, drug coverage, and cost-sharing. Understanding the full DOD pharmacy benefit requires a complex matrix displaying the eight beneficiary eligibility categories across the three pharmacy programs, as shown in table 3.1. One special population\u2014the 1.2 million Medicare-eligible retirees\u2014is about to be redivided into three eligibility categories\u2014space available, Medicare BRACs, and TRICARE Seniors. With the rollout of the Medicare subvention demonstration program later this year, an eighth category for TRICARE Seniors will be added to the DOD matrix. The Medicare program does not provide coverage for prescription drugs, a major expense for older people, who tend to use more prescriptions as they age. Thus, the lack of a DOD systemwide prescription drug benefit for most Medicare-eligible retirees opens a major gap in their health care coverage between Medicare and DOD.", "As shown in table 3.1, all beneficiaries are eligible for the no-cost MTF pharmacy program at any MTF, regardless of where they live. Since 1994, however, DOD Health Affairs has issued several policies governing MTF pharmacy services. These policy changes affected how each MTF determined its priorities in providing space-available prescription drug services to families of military personnel as well as to retired military beneficiaries. For example, a June 1994 DOD policy permitted MTF commanders, if necessary on the basis of available resources, to limit pharmaceuticals to non-active duty beneficiary classes in accordance with their priority for care (first, active duty family members, followed by retirees and their family members). In July 1995, the Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) changed the MTF pharmacy support policy and required MTFs to honor all prescriptions for formulary drugs regardless of beneficiary category.", "In April 1997, the Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense (Health Affairs) issued a more explicit directive that MTF pharmacies not give preference to active duty and TRICARE prime beneficiaries over all other categories. Instead, the still current April 1997 policy requires that whatever prescription drugs are on the MTFs\u2019 formularies must be made available to all beneficiaries. Today, the only basis for turning beneficiaries away from the MTF pharmacy is when the medication is not on its formulary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Formularies Create Benefit Uncertainties and Increase Costs", "paragraphs": ["A key strategy private health plans and PBMs use to provide quality pharmacy care and control costs is consistent, coordinated formulary development. A formulary is a list of prescription drugs, grouped by therapeutic class, that the health plan prefers its physicians to prescribe for its beneficiaries. Drugs are chosen for a formulary on the basis of medical value and price. Formularies are used to help control prescription drug costs by (1) limiting the number of drugs a plan will cover; (2) encouraging the use of preferred drugs when coupled, for example, with programs to inform doctors and beneficiaries about the formulary drugs; or (3) developing financial incentives to encourage formulary drug use.", "Formularies can be categorized in three ways: open, incentive-based, or closed. Open formularies are most used by fee-for-service health plans and are often referred to as \u201cvoluntary\u201d because neither beneficiaries nor doctors are penalized if nonformulary drugs are prescribed.Incentive-based (also referred to as managed) formularies are becoming increasingly popular because they combine flexibility and greater cost-control features than open formularies. Generally, incentive-based formularies offer beneficiaries lower copayments (if any) when their doctors prescribe the preferred formulary or generic drugs. A closed formulary limits coverage to formulary drugs only. In private health plans and FEHBP, closed formularies are uncommon. Recent studies have shown that such formularies, which are thought by some health plans to provide greater prescription drug cost control, may actually drive up other health care costs. For example, denying needed drugs could lead to illness and cause higher dissatisfaction levels among patients and doctors.", "DOD\u2019s formularies vary depending on where the beneficiary gets his or her prescription drugs. This situation occurs because DOD\u2019s many policies and requirements create different formularies for its programs: closed formularies for MTF pharmacies and the national mail-order pharmacies, and open formularies for TRICARE retail. As a result, beneficiaries experience drug coverage and availability uncertainties and they, DOD, and the TRICARE contractors experience unnecessary costs. Each of DOD\u2019s 587 MTF pharmacies devises and maintains its own closed formulary. Since 1993, in an effort to improve pharmacy benefit uniformity across MTFs, DOD has required all MTFs to include on their formularies at least those 120 products on the Tri-Service Formulary (TSF). However, there are no restrictions or incentives for physicians, pharmacists, or beneficiaries to prescribe, dispense, or use TSF products.", "Since 1997, DOD has considered more restrictive policies and centralized control over formulary decisions in response to congressional and beneficiary complaints about the lack of a consistent systemwide pharmacy benefit and nonstandardized MTF formulary management. However, DOD has not taken a systemwide approach to proposed policy changes. Instead, it has focused only on policies governing the MTF and national mail-order programs, not the TRICARE contractors\u2019 programs.In July 1998, DOD will replace the TSF policy with a more restrictive basic core formulary (BCF) policy (see app. II for the products included on the BCF). Like the TSF policy, the BCF would become the minimum list of products on each MTF outpatient pharmacy formulary. The policy calls for a DOD national P&T committee to decide which drug products to add to or drop from the BCF. The BCF policy calls for potentially reducing the number of drugs available in certain high-cost therapeutic classes. These therapeutic classes will be designated on the BCF as \u201cclosed\u201d (see app. III for a list of prescription drugs currently available in therapeutic classes thus far targeted for closure). Under the policy, MTFs would not be allowed to dispense nonformulary products in those BCF therapeutic classes, although case-by-case exceptions would be allowed for medical necessity.", "In this way, DOD seeks to ensure that more doctors, pharmacists, and beneficiaries actually use these formulary items.", "The lack of a uniform formulary across MTF, TRICARE retail, and national mail-order pharmacy programs has unintended consequences for beneficiary costs and access as well as DOD and contractor costs. Effects include the following:", "Different closed formularies in the MTF pharmacies cause unpredictable cost-shifting among MTFs and allegedly may be causing cost-shifting from MTF pharmacies to TRICARE contractors\u2019 retail pharmacy programs. Both situations can create uncertain financial effects within the pharmacy programs and for beneficiaries, as well as cause overall program cost increases.", "TRICARE contractors\u2019 bid prices are unnecessarily inflated because, under their contract, they must use open formularies and thus have only limited influence over beneficiary prescription drug use. As a result, the TRICARE contractors told us, they are less able to negotiate deeper price discounts from drug companies without the ability to provide preferred or favorable status on a closed or incentive-based drug formulary. If they could, one contractor estimated, their retail pharmacy drug costs could be reduced between 10 percent and 20 percent ($23 million to $47 million on the basis of 1997 retail drug costs of $233 million).", "Overall costs are higher than necessary for DOD because of its inability to share the TRICARE contractors\u2019 formulary savings through the applicable bid-price adjustment provisions of the contracts.", "Despite the flexibility and cost-control advantages of incentive-based formularies, such an approach faces various policy, statutory, regulatory, and contractual barriers. For example, DOD believes it lacks authority to charge non-active duty beneficiaries copayments for MTF outpatient prescription drugs. Copayments at MTFs would create incentives for physicians to prescribe and beneficiaries to accept the formulary drugs. At the same time, beneficiaries could elect to make a copayment to obtain the nonformulary drugs at an MTF rather than shop at the contractor\u2019s outlets or the mail-order pharmacy with their copayments. An example of a contractual barrier is DOD\u2019s position on the formulary types to be used in the TRICARE retail and mail-order pharmacy programs. While DOD required that the new national mail-order pharmacy program contractor use a closed formulary, DOD\u2019s contracts with TRICARE contractors prohibit the use of closed formularies, although they are apparently permitted under TRICARE regulations.", "DOD and contractor officials told us that a uniform, incentive-based formulary for all pharmacy programs would be a significant \u201cdemand management\u201d and cost-control improvement over the current approaches. The added revenue from MTF copayments, if retained by the affected MTF, could be used to pay for more prescription drug services. Copayments could be designed to create incentives for physicians to prescribe and beneficiaries to use more cost-effective formulary drugs. Pharmacoeconomic Center officials told us that MTFs could save an estimated $60 million each year in prescription drug costs using, for example, a $15 MTF copayment for nonformulary products. One of Foundation\u2019s TRICARE program officials estimated that MTF prescription drug costs could drop about 5 percent under an incentive-based formulary\u2014a savings of $37 million based on 1997 MTF drug costs of $741 million.

Such strategies, referred to as physician and pharmacist interventions, cannot be fully and systematically applied in MTF, TRICARE retail, and national mail-order pharmacy programs (see table 3.2 for a description). DOD and contractor officials cited barriers such as a lack of policies or contract provisions permitting therapeutic interchange, along with the need to integrate each program\u2019s pharmacy patient records into a shared database to make managed pharmacy care decisions. Along with improving the quality of drug therapy, these strategies are routinely used in private health plans to control costs and achieve large direct and indirect cost-savings. For example, three FEHBP plans, covering 4.5 million beneficiaries, estimated saving about $60 million in 1995 using such strategies. Another PBM told us that, in the FEHBP plans it represents, 1997 savings resulting from prior authorization alone were $66 million.", "The consequences of not using these commercial best practices more extensively in DOD pharmacy programs are likely significant. For example, higher costs are caused by using more expensive drug therapies instead of less costly generic or therapeutic alternatives and by not having doctor \u201creport cards\u201d that could be used to encourage physicians to prescribe less costly prescription drugs. According to DOD and contractor officials, systemwide costs likely are 10 to 20 percent higher than necessary.

These officials predicted that drug companies may be motivated to raise DAPA prices to avoid losses from an expanded DOD discounted market. Although these marketplace adjustments are difficult to project because of the many factors that influence drug prices, expanding the size of the market that could have access to DAPA prices could put upward pressure on DAPA prices.It is unclear how the proposal would affect beneficiary cost-sharing under TRICARE Extra. Currently, cost shares range from 15 to 20 percent of negotiated retail drug prices (see table 3.1). Like DOD, beneficiaries could potentially experience 50 to 60 percent savings if their cost shares were based on DAPA prices rather than on higher commercial prices. However, DOD\u2019s proposal does not address that aspect. It is also unclear whether the proposal would end beneficiary access to nonnetwork retail pharmacies, which is currently allowed under TRICARE contracts, or lead to a more fragmented subsystem managed by separate contractors. Under TRICARE Standard, beneficiaries who choose to use nonnetwork retail pharmacies must pay higher out-of-pocket costs and submit paper claims to TRICARE contractors for reimbursement of covered benefits. DOD\u2019s proposal does not address which contractors, if any, would be required to accommodate claims for nonnetwork retail pharmacy services.", "We asked DOD officials why they had not considered allowing TRICARE contractors to provide the information needed for DAPA prices paid directly to DOD. In April 1997, Foundation\u2019s Senior Vice President for TRICARE Program Management proposed a method for TRICARE contractors to provide DOD with the data it needs to obtain DAPA prices from drug companies. Foundation estimated that the proposal would save $250 million throughout the lives of its three TRICARE contracts. Such an approach, if permissible under the Veterans Health Care Act, would avoid the various issues that would be created if a separate national PBM retail pharmacy contractor took over and might offer savings in addition to those that could be achieved from integrating patient databases and implementing other commercial best practices in existing programs, including TRICARE retail. TMA headquarters officials told us this approach was not considered because in 1997 they believed the only way to extend DAPA pricing to a retail pharmacy program was through a separate contract. Another official told us that under the TRICARE contractor approach, other conflicts likely would arise, such as that between TMA\u2019s Office of Acquisition Management and Support overseeing TRICARE contracts and DSCP, which administers DAPA prices. DSCP, which developed the subject proposal and is its chief sponsor, has a somewhat competing mission with TMA.

Such actions, particularly at smaller MTF pharmacies, have resulted in certain drugs becoming unavailable at some MTFs. The consequent shifting of affected beneficiaries to larger MTF pharmacies has caused inconvenience and driven up systemwide costs. Recognizing these outcomes, in July 1998 DOD will impose a standardized BCF for all MTFs to control such ad hoc formulary adjustments. Since late 1996, both DOD and the TRICARE contractors have been examining why the contractors\u2019 drug costs have increased at higher-than-expected rates, allegedly causing significant losses for the contractors. The contractors cited MTF formulary restrictions as the cause and told us they plan to seek additional compensation from DOD. DOD disagrees, and the matter is currently being studied."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "MTF Funding and Formularies Affect Beneficiaries\u2019 Access", "paragraphs": ["According to DOD pharmacy officials, the closing of one-third of MTFs since 1988 has significantly increased pharmacy workload and costs at the remaining 587 MTFs. Meanwhile, according to DOD pharmacy officials, pharmacy costs are the largest discretionary cost in the MTF budget. As such, MTFs closely monitor and frequently change\u2014usually monthly\u2014their formularies to balance prescription drug demand and volume against costs and funds available. The MTFs define space-available care, for pharmacy purposes, by the drugs carried on the formulary. If a patient\u2019s drug is carried there, in effect, space for the patient is deemed to be available. Also, formulary drugs must be equally available to all beneficiary categories. As a result of the budget limitations, MTF commanders have to manage their formularies in a way that limits access to some beneficial medications. However, neither DOD Health Affairs nor the service medical commands centrally oversee MTF formulary decisions. Our discussions with pharmacy officials and review of 15 MTFs\u2019 frequent formulary management decisions between 1995 and 1998 indicated that cost was the prevailing reason for adding or dropping drugs. The following are some examples: In 1995, the MacDill Air Force hospital near Tampa, Florida, decided to add to its formulary the newly available pill form of Imitrex, which is used to treat migraine headaches. However, to limit utilization and thus beneficiaries\u2019 access to this high-cost drug in pill form, the pharmacy would accept prescriptions only for patients who had previously responded well to Imitrex injections. Although the pharmacy no longer applies this particular restriction, it applies an Imitrex dispensing restriction to control utilization and costs. Under this restriction, MacDill will dispense only one package per prescription containing nine Imitrex tablets. In the past, physicians would prescribe, and MacDill would dispense, 30 to 60 tablets per prescription. In 1997, at $12 to $15 a pill, Imitrex cost the MacDill pharmacy $103,000. In 1996, the Pensacola, Florida, Navy hospital decided not to add Zyrtec (a new allergy drug for upper respiratory symptoms) to the formulary. While recognizing Zyrtec\u2019s therapeutic edge over other formulary drugs in the same therapeutic class, MTF officials decided that the high demand for Zyrtec at other Navy MTFs made it cost-prohibitive. In 1997, to include Allegra, a widely advertised, nonsedating antihistamine, on their formularies, the McConnell Air Force clinic (Wichita, Kans.) and Eglin Air Force hospital (Fort Walton Beach, Fla.) imposed dispensing restrictions. Both facilities cut the amount in half by dispensing 30 tablets instead of the full 60 tablets for a 1-month supply. Eglin\u2019s pharmacy chief told us this should save about $60,000 each year. Both facilities justified restricting Allegra, estimated by MTF officials to cost 25 to 50 times more than other antihistamines with major sedative side effects, on the basis that it was unwarranted for overnight use. In 1997, the Lackland Air Force medical center in San Antonio, Texas, dropped Allegra from its formulary because too much of its $28 million pharmacy budget was spent to make Allegra available for all beneficiaries. Instead, the MTF pharmacy carries Allegra as a nonformulary drug obtainable only under special order, primarily for military pilots. In 1997, to save $98,000 annually, the Sheppard Air Force hospital in Wichita Falls, Texas, dropped Zocor, a cholesterol-lowering drug, from its formulary. Sheppard patients on Zocor at that time were switched to the cheaper formulary brand, Pravachol.", "The Fort Carson Army hospital in Colorado Springs, Colorado, regularly reviews for reduction the 50 formulary drugs on which it expends the most money. In 1997, the pharmacy spent more than $350,000 dispensing Prilosec (a widely prescribed ulcer drug). To cut costs, the pharmacy now (1) urges use of the less costly formulary drug Prevacid, (2) requires that physicians justify Prilosec prescriptions in writing (saving about 5 percent), and (3) is developing physician guidance on the best use of Prilosec and Prevacid.", "These unilateral formulary decisions represent MTF commanders\u2019 attempts to exercise prudent fiscal management and control their rising pharmacy costs. Such actions, particularly at smaller MTF pharmacies, have resulted in certain drugs becoming unavailable at some MTFs and the consequent shifting of affected beneficiaries to larger MTF pharmacies\u2014causing inconvenience and driving up costs elsewhere in the system. DOD pharmacy officials told us that reduced MTF pharmacy funding and downsizing, coupled with increased demand spurred by the availability of free drugs to the beneficiary whether enrolled in the MTF or not, have created a nearly unmanageable situation for MTF pharmacy personnel. These officials told us that current policy should be changed to limit space-available care to active duty and MTF prime enrollees (that is, the beneficiaries who have selected an MTF military doctor as their primary care physician under the TRICARE Prime option). They acknowledged that this \u201clock out\u201d may shift many unenrolled beneficiaries to the contractors\u2019 retail and mail-order programs, or shift Medicare-eligible retirees out of DOD\u2019s system altogether. DOD officials agreed that under the current nonintegrated program structure, such a policy would enable MTF pharmacy costs to stabilize and potentially decline, but it would drive up contractors\u2019 and beneficiaries\u2019 costs. In our view, MTF formulary decisions under the existing space-available policy may be having the same consequences. These include decreased beneficiary access, and hence greater inconvenience, and the potential shifting of beneficiaries to other system sources such that costs can be driven up systemwide.

We believe that if our recommendations are implemented promptly and strategically, the resulting savings would help to defray such added costs. As our report points out, implementing automated PRODUR systems; a uniform, incentive-based formulary; and other PBM best practices could save DOD and its contractors hundreds of millions of dollars annually by substantially lowering prescription drug costs. Also, collecting copayments for nonformulary drugs from all non-active duty beneficiaries would yield millions more, as would applying safer drug therapies to reduce general health care costs. Likewise, extending the systemwide drug benefit to Medicare-eligible retirees will result in better management of their care and in controls to help avoid excessive use and adverse drug reactions that can cause illness, hospitalization, and even death. In short, the financial and other health benefits to be derived from overhauling the system can be applied against the costs of a military retirees\u2019 systemwide drug benefit. DOD\u2019s comments in their entirety are included in appendix IV.", "We also obtained comments on a draft of the report from the TRICARE contractors\u2014Foundation, TriWest, and Humana. Each agreed with the report and its recommendations. Foundation also stated that the DOD pharmacy system should not be fragmented further by carving out the contractors\u2019 retail pharmacy services because pharmacy is an integral part of a patient\u2019s total care. TriWest stated that the recommended top-to-bottom redesign of the prescription drug benefit should focus on improving patient access to appropriate pharmaceutical care and containing and better managing DOD and the TRICARE contractors\u2019 costs. TriWest affirmed our report\u2019s position that unless immediate, collaborative action is taken to fix the problems we identified, DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs will likely worsen and costs will continue to hemorrhage. Foundation\u2019s and TriWest\u2019s comments appear in appendixes V and VI, respectively.", "Finally, Merck-Medco, the national mail-order pharmacy contractor, stated that DOD should contract with such PBMs as Merck-Medco rather than seeking to develop its proficiency at MTFs in applying best pharmacy practices. We disagree. The TRICARE contractors and Merck-Medco already provide commercial PBM services that supplement DOD\u2019s direct care system\u2019s capacity. Moreover, we do not have enough evidence that PBMs would cost less than the MTFs. Thus, we believe DOD needs a system-oriented pharmacy management structure in place and operational experience with best practices before further \u201cmake or buy\u201d decisions can prudently be made. Furthermore, Merck-Medco, citing the legislative provision requiring us to study DOD\u2019s pharmacy programs, stated that the report does not review the cost impacts of TRICARE contractors\u2019 using PBM best practices to provide pharmacy benefits. We disagree. The report identifies barriers preventing TRICARE contractors from fully applying PBM best practices, and provides estimates of the cost and service quality effects on TRICARE contractors, DOD, and beneficiaries. The report also discusses systemwide problems with using PBMs to carve out TRICARE mail-order and retail pharmacy services to extend DAPA pricing to these programs. As a result, the report recommends that DOD postpone action on the retail pharmacy DAPA-pricing proposal and makes several other recommendations aimed at removing barriers to the contractors\u2019 fully applying best PBM practices. Merck-Medco\u2019s comments appear in appendix VII.", "DOD and the contractors also provided technical comments, which we incorporated as appropriate."], "subsections": []}]}]}], "fastfact": []}
