Over the past several years, IFMP's life-cycle cost estimates have fluctuated, and NASA's current estimate is 14 percent greater than the previous estimate. The reliability of these estimates is uncertain because disciplined costestimating processes required by NASA and recognized as best practices were not used in preparing them. For example, IFMP's current life-cycle cost estimate did not include the full cost likely to be incurred during the life of the program, including certain operations costs and costs to retire the system. In addition, NASA did not consistently use breakdowns of work in preparing the cost estimate, as recommended by NASA guidance. In cases where work breakdowns were used, the agency did not always show the connection between the work breakdown estimates and the official program cost estimate. This has been a weakness since the inception. Although more than half of the IFMP modules have been implemented--including the Core Financial module, which is considered the backbone of IFMP--the system may not be fully implemented by the end of fiscal year 2006 as planned. Efforts to complete the integrated system as quickly as possible might have resulted in schedule margins that are insufficient to manage program challenges--such as personnel shortages, uncertainties about software availability, and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) initiatives to implement electronic systems for agency business processes governmentwide. These OMB initiatives have put IFMP in a reactive mode and are already affecting planning for the payroll, procurement, and travel components of the integrated system, which could result in additional schedule delays and cost growth. Finally, reserve funding for IFMP contingencies may be insufficient, which is particularly problematic, given the program's unreliable cost estimates and optimistic schedule. One module--Budget Formulation--is already experiencing potential shortfalls in its reserves, and project officials expressed concerns that the module's functionality may have to be reduced. Yet the program continues to establish funding reserves based on reserve levels set by other high-risk NASA programs, such as NASA's space flight program--not on analyses of the potential cost impact of risks and unknowns specific to IFMP, as required by NASA guidance. Moreover, the program did not quantify the cost impact of high-criticality risks--also required by NASA--or link its risks to funding reserves to help IFMP develop realistic budget estimates."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["About 90 percent of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s  (NASA) annual budget is spent on contractors.

As agreed, we continued our review in three areas:  (1) whether NASA is acquiring and implementing IFMP in the context of  an enterprise architecture, (2) the extent to which the Core Financial  module will address NASA\u2019s external reporting requirements, and  (3) NASA\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and schedule for IFMP. We are  responding to the first two issues in separate reports. This report  addresses the third issue\u2014IFMP\u2019s life-cycle cost estimate and schedule.  Specifically, you asked that we (1) assess the reliability of NASA\u2019s  methodology for preparing the current cost estimate for implementing  IFMP, (2) determine whether NASA\u2019s current schedule is reasonable in  terms of progress to date and available resources, and (3) evaluate NASA\u2019s  processes for ensuring the adequacy of reserve funding for contingencies  to mitigate the potential impact of identified program risks and unknowns.

In 1990 NASA\u2019s lack of  effective systems and processes for overseeing contractor\u2019s activities  prompted us to identify NASA\u2019s contract management as a high-risk area.  In July 2002 we reported that the accuracy of NASA\u2019s $5 billion cost  growth estimate for the International Space Station was questionable and  that the agency might have difficulty preparing a reliable life-cycle cost  estimate because a modern integrated financial management system  was not available to track and maintain the data needed for estimating and  controlling costs.  NASA\u2019s lack of a fully integrated financial management  system has also hurt the agency\u2019s ability to collect, maintain, and report  the full cost of its projects and programs. For example, in March 2002 we  testified that NASA was unable to provide us with detailed support for the  amounts that it reported to the Congress as obligated against space station  and related shuttle program cost limits as required by the National  Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2000.", "IFMP is designed as an integrated system to replace the separate  and incompatible financial management systems used by NASA\u2019s  10 centers. According to the IFMP Program Director, the new system  will provide better decision data, consistent information across centers,  and improved functionality.", "Unlike NASA\u2019s previous efforts to modernize its financial management  system, IFMP does not rely on a single contractor. NASA selected System  Applications and Products (SAP) to provide its \u201cbest of suite\u201d software  and contracted for implementation services under a separate contract.  NASA has also broken the project into modules that will be implemented  individually\u2014instead of all at once\u2014on the basis of the availability of  proven commercial-off-the-shelf software products. IFMP initially  segmented implementation into 14 modules but has since reorganized the  program into 9. Some of these modules may be further broken out and  others added, depending on the scope of OMB\u2019s e-Government initiatives  and other considerations. Table 1 describes the modules that currently  comprise the system and their status.", "When NASA announced in June 2003 that the Core Financial module had  been implemented at all of its centers, only about two-thirds of the  financial events needed for day-to-day financial operations and external  reporting had been implemented. In addition, we found that NASA  deferred implementation of other key core financial module capabilities  and created new problems in recording certain financial transactions.  Thus, full functionality of the system has been deferred, increasing the risk  of additional costs and potentially affecting the implementation of future  modules.", "As we reported in April 2003, NASA is not following key best practices for  acquiring and implementing IFMP. For example, NASA has not analyzed  the interdependencies between selected and proposed IFMP components,  and it does not have a methodology for doing so. By acquiring IFMP  components without first understanding system component relationships,  NASA has increased its risk of implementing a system that will not  optimize mission performance and will cost more and take longer to  implement than necessary. In addition, in implementing the Core Financial  module, NASA faces risks in the areas of user needs and requirements  management because the agency did not consider the information needs  of key system users and is relying on a requirements management process  that does not require the documentation of detailed system requirements  prior to system implementation and testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reliability of IFMP\u2019s Current Life-Cycle Cost Estimate Is Uncertain Owing to a Lack of Disciplined Processes", "paragraphs": ["The reliability of the current life-cycle cost estimate\u2014which has fluctuated  since the initial estimate and is 14 percent greater than the previous  estimate established in February 2002\u2014is uncertain because disciplined  cost-estimating processes required by NASA and recognized as best  practices were not used in preparing the estimate.

OMB guidance calls for a disciplined budget process to  ensure that performance goals are met with the least risk and the lowest  life-cycle cost, which includes direct and indirect costs, operations and  maintenance, and disposal. The Software Engineering Institute (SEI)  echoes the need for reliable cost-estimating processes in managing  software implementations\u2014identifying tasks to be estimated, mapping the  estimates to the breakdown of work to be performed, and having a clear  audit trail are among SEI\u2019s requisites for producing reliable cost estimates.", "Despite NASA requirements and OMB and SEI guidance, IFMP did not  prepare a full life-cycle cost estimate\u2014that is, all direct and indirect costs  for planning, procurement, operations and maintenance, and disposal  were not included. For example, the life-cycle cost estimate does not  include the following:  the cost to operate and maintain the system beyond 2010;  the cost of retiring the system;    enterprise travel costs, which are provided monthly by the NASA centers;  and  the cost of nonleased NASA facilities for housing IFMP.", "In addition, IFMP did not prepare WBS estimates for active modules\u2014that  is, those currently being implemented. According to NASA guidance,  breaking down work into smaller units helps facilitate cost estimating  and project and contract management, and helps ensure that relevant  costs are not omitted. The guidance also states that the WBS should  encompass both in-house and contractor efforts. According to the IFMP  Deputy Program Director, WBS estimates are not prepared for active  modules because information such as contract task orders can be used to  prepare the cost estimates. However, there is not one overriding contract  where each module is considered a deliverable at a fixed price. Rather,   numerous contracts at both the project and center level for a module\u2019s  implementation\u2014many of which can be awarded for a level of effort at  agreed-upon fixed rates at various phases in the implementation. Without  a WBS estimate for the project as a whole, NASA cannot ensure that all  relevant contractor costs are included in the cost estimate. In addition,  using contract task orders to prepare the cost estimate would not ensure  that government in-house costs are included in the life-cycle cost estimate.", "Finally, for modules in the planning phase, the program utilized NASA\u2019s  subject matter experts and professional cost estimators to prepare  business case analyses. However, although these analyses contained WBS  cost estimates, the audit trail from the WBS estimate to the program\u2019s life- cycle cost estimate was not always clear. Without a clear audit trail, it is  difficult to determine whether the differences between the detailed  WBS estimates and the official program cost estimate are appropriate.  The lack of a clear audit trail has been a weakness since the inception of  the program. For example, IFMP was unable to provide us with traceable  support for its baseline cost estimate for direct program costs.", "NASA has made some improvements that should help the program prepare  better cost estimates. In May 2002 the NASA Administrator appointed an  executive to provide leadership and accountability in the direction and  operation of the system.

OMB\u2019s e-Government initiatives\u2014which aim to streamline agency  business processes and eliminate redundant systems governmentwide\u2014 could also provide challenges for NASA\u2019s IFMP planning.  As a result, the  program schedule may be optimistic.", "While implementing the Core Financial module (see table 1), IFMP has  faced human resource challenges, and the program continues to face these  challenges with other modules. For example, personnel shortages at  Marshall Space Flight Center for several months affected the Core  Financial project and other projects. In this case, a schedule slip was  avoided, but during fiscal year 2002, the shortages resulted in nearly  $400,000 for extra hours worked by center employees. Human resource  challenges are also affecting the Budget Formulation module. The  simultaneous implementation of this module with the Core Financial  module\u2014an action advised against by a contractor conducting a  lessons-learned study\u2014placed heavy demand on already scarce resources  and added complexity to the program. As a result the schedule for  implementing the Budget Formulation module has already slipped.  Sometimes, relying more on contractor personnel can alleviate  shortfalls in civil service personnel, but a recent Budget Formulation  project status report indicated that the implementation contractor might  also have difficulties acquiring and/or retaining qualified personnel. The  implementation schedules for the remaining modules overlap, putting the  program at further risk of schedule slippages.", "Uncertainty regarding software availability also puts the program at risk  for completing the integrated system on schedule. For example, complete  software solutions and requirements for IFMP\u2019s Contract Administration  module have not yet been determined.

NASA faces the same challenge with IFMP\u2019s Human Resources  Management module. NASA\u2019s monthly status reports show that the  program is working with SAP to develop a software solution for the  Human Resources Management module that will meet federal government  requirements, but the outcome is uncertain.

E-Government initiatives are already affecting  NASA\u2019s planning for the payroll, procurement, and travel modules in  the integrated system. For example, the payroll function, which was  once part of the Human Resources Management module, will likely  become a separate module under e-Government. Similarly, the Contract  Administration module has been split into two components: one for  procurement document generation, for which software is available  although requirements are not finalized, and one for the remainder of  NASA\u2019s Contract Administration requirements, for which requirements  and software are currently unknown. Furthermore, e-Travel could replace  the Travel Management module, which has already been implemented.", "According to the program\u2019s fiscal year 2002 Independent Annual Review,  e-Government initiatives are forcing the program into a reactionary mode,  thus increasing risk to the program\u2019s success.
