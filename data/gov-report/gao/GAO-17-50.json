This report examines (1) VHA's strategic planning process and (2) the extent to which VHA operationalizes its strategic goals and objectives. GAO reviewed VHA strategic planning documents; and interviewed officials from VA and VHA central office, three VISNs selected to provide variation in geographic location, and nine VAMCs within these VISNs selected to provide variation in factors such as geographic location and facility complexity. GAO evaluated VHA's actions against federal standards for internal control and leading practices for strategic planning."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) Veterans Health Administration (VHA) uses a multi-step strategic planning process to develop its strategic goals and objectives, which includes two key steps\u2014(1) identifying and assessing factors that may affect health care delivery, which is referred to as environmental scanning, and (2) holding the annual National Leadership Council (NLC) Strategic Planning Summit\u2014according to officials. VHA officials told GAO that they leverage VA's environmental scanning results in making decisions regarding VHA's strategic goals and objectives and that VA's central office has historically had a role in aspects of VHA's strategic planning process\u2014such as participating in the NLC summit.", "VHA relies on the VA medical centers (VAMC) that directly provide care to veterans and the Veterans Integrated Service Networks (VISN), regional entities to which the VAMCs report, to operationalize its strategic goals and objectives. However, certain limitations in VHA's processes hinder VISNs' and VAMCs' efforts in operationalizing these goals and objectives. Specifically,", "VHA has not specified VAMCs' role and responsibilities in its strategic planning guidance, as it has for VISNs. For example, VHA's directive for VISNs clearly states how VISN directors are to operationalize VHA's operational plans; no such directive exists for VAMC officials. Similarly, VHA provided VISNs a strategic planning guide for operationalizing its current strategic plan, but did not provide a similar guide to the VAMCs.", "VHA has not developed detailed strategies for VISNs and VAMCs to use in operationalizing all of its strategic goals and objectives. According to leading practices for strategic planning, strategies should describe how strategic goals and objectives are to be achieved, including a description of the operational processes, staff skills, technology and other resources required. In September 2014, VHA published the Blueprint for Excellence to provide strategies for transforming VHA health care service delivery in response to concerns regarding the VHA wait-time crisis that year. However, it did not develop similar strategy documents for other years or for the other goals and objectives in its strategic plan.", "VHA does not have an effective oversight process for ensuring and assessing the progress of VISNs and VAMCs in meeting VHA's strategic goals and objectives. According to VHA officials, VHA relies on two methods for assessing performance towards meeting selected strategic goals and objectives. Specifically, VHA uses VISN and VAMC directors' individual annual performance plans, as well as veteran survey information, to assess VHA's performance towards meeting certain metrics, such as improving veterans' access. However, it is unclear how these specific metrics are linked to assessing overall progress towards VHA's strategic goals and objectives. As a result, VHA may not know to what extent VISNs' and VAMCs' efforts to operationalize its goals and objectives are adequately addressing top management concerns or department-wide strategic goals."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that VHA (1) specify VAMCs' roles and responsibilities in operationalizing its strategic goals and objectives, (2) develop detailed strategies to operationalize its goals and objectives, and (3) develop an oversight process to assess progress made.

VHA provided care to about 6.7 million veterans in FY 2015, and the  demand for its services is expected to grow in the coming years.", "Due to changes in the veteran population, including increases in the  number of women and those between the ages of 65 and 84, the health  care needs of veterans may also change. These and other changes, such  as innovations in technology and health care delivery, may affect VHA\u2019s  current strategies for accomplishing its mission to provide care to the  nation\u2019s veterans. Strategic planning\u2014including identifying mission,  vision, goals, and objectives, and operationalizing strategies to achieve  those goals and objectives\u2014is key to VHA\u2019s ability to establish its  strategic direction and can help VHA anticipate and respond to this  demand and provide care in a dynamic environment.", "We and others have expressed significant concerns about VHA\u2019s  management of its health care system, including VHA\u2019s ability to  effectively provide and oversee timely access to health care for veterans.  These concerns have contributed to our conclusion that VA health care is  a high-risk area, and we added it to our High-Risk List in 2015. To  improve access to veterans\u2019 health care, among other things, Congress  enacted and the President signed into law the Veterans Access, Choice,  and Accountability Act of 2014 (Choice Act). The Choice Act required VA  to contract with a private entity to conduct an independent assessment of  12 areas of its health care delivery system and management processes,  including VHA\u2019s leadership. The independent assessment report, which  VHA reported cost $68 million, was released in September 2015. It made  recommendations across each of the 12 areas that support the report\u2019s  four systemic findings of (1) a disconnect in the alignment of demand,  resources, and authorities; (2) uneven bureaucratic operations and  processes; (3) non-integrated variations in clinical and business data and  tools; and (4) leaders not fully empowered due to a lack of clear authority,  priorities, and goals. For example, to address a disconnect in the  alignment of demand, resources, and authorities, the report includes a  recommendation to develop a governance board to define the strategic  direction for VHA and to ensure accountability for the achievement of  established performance measures.", "In addition to requiring the independent assessment, the Choice Act  established the Commission on Care to examine veterans\u2019 access to VA  health care and to examine how best to organize VHA, locate health  resources, and deliver health care to veterans during the next 20 years.  The Commission on Care\u2019s interim report was published on December 4,  2015, and a final report with 18 recommendations was submitted to the  President on June 30, 2016. These reports and their findings have  identified not only the need for VHA to modify a significant number of its  processes and procedures in the short term, but also the need for VHA to  implement long-term system-wide changes to help it meet its mission. For  example, the Commission on Care reported that VHA lacks a long-term  vision and continuity in the development and execution of plans and  programs. To address these issues, the commission recommended  establishing a board of directors to provide VHA overall governance, set  long-term strategy, and direct and oversee the long-term transformation  of VHA.", "Based on concerns about VHA\u2019s ability to manage its health care system  and provide timely care, you asked us to conduct a management review  of VHA that encompasses several key organizational components,  including its strategic planning. This report examines  1.  VHA\u2019s strategic planning process and  2.  the extent to which VHA operationalizes its strategic goals and  objectives.", "To examine VHA\u2019s strategic planning process, we reviewed relevant  documentation from VHA, such as policies and procedures describing the  process and its alignment with VA\u2019s strategic planning process. We  reviewed external assessments of VHA, such as the independent  assessment report, to identify potential factors that may hinder the  delivery of health care services, including recommendations for  addressing these concerns. We also reviewed documentation and  interviewed officials from three Veterans Integrated Service Networks  (VISN)\u2014VISNs 2, 20, and 23\u2014and nine VAMCs within these VISNs\u2014 located in (1) Albany, New York; (2) Anchorage, Alaska; (3) Batavia, New  York; (4) Bath, New York; (5) Boise, Idaho; (6) Fargo, North Dakota; (7)  Hot Springs, South Dakota; (8) Minneapolis, Minnesota; and (9) Portland,  Oregon\u2014to gain insights into the role of VISNs and VAMCs in VHA\u2019s  strategic planning process. We selected the three VISNs to provide  variation in geographic location, including one VISN that was also among  those selected by VHA for realignment. We then selected three VAMCs  within each of these VISNs to reflect a range of geography, such as rural  vs. urban locations, and facility complexity levels, as well as if the VAMC  had any strategic planning best practices as identified by the VISNs.  The information we collected on strategic planning processes at the  VISNs and VAMCs in our review is not generalizable system-wide. We  also interviewed VHA and VA officials to discuss relevant roles and  responsibilities in VHA\u2019s strategic planning process\u2014including officials  from VHA\u2019s Office of the Under Secretary for Health, Office of the  Assistant Deputy Under Secretary for Health for Policy and Planning, and  National Leadership Council (NLC); and VA\u2019s Office of Policy.

The plan also outlines VHA\u2019s three goals and 17  objectives that are to be used to guide planning, budgeting, performance  management, and service alignment across VHA; those three goals are  to: (1) provide veterans personalized, proactive, patient-driven health  care, (2) achieve measurable improvements in health outcomes, and (3)  align resources to deliver sustained value to veterans. VHA Directive  1075: Strategic Planning Process is VHA\u2019s most current strategic  planning guidance, and it outlines how VHA will identify its strategic  priorities and establish and execute its strategic plan, as well as identifies  roles and responsibilities in this process.", "In recent years, VA and VHA have established several new initiatives,  activities, and priorities in response to changes in internal and external  factors\u2014including VHA leadership changes, congressional concerns  regarding veterans\u2019 access to care, and the placement of VHA on our  High-Risk List. Specifically, VA and VHA have developed the following  new initiatives and priorities in the last 2 years:", "MyVA: This VA-wide initiative was launched in July 2015 and is aimed  towards transforming the veterans\u2019 experience. VA has developed five  priorities for this initiative: (1) improving the veteran\u2019s experience, (2)  improving the employee experience, (3) improving internal support  services, (4) establishing a culture of continuous improvement, and  (5) enhancing strategic partnerships.  \u201cThe Under Secretary for Health\u2019s Five Priorities:\u201d VHA\u2019s Under  Secretary for Health established these priorities after being appointed  to his position in July 2015.

These steps are consistent with leading practices in  strategic planning. VHA conducts environmental scanning to identify  and assess factors that may affect its future health care delivery.  According to VHA policy, data from VHA\u2019s environmental scan, such as  the projected number of veterans to be served, are to be used by VHA in  developing its goals and objectives. In addition, the results from VHA\u2019s  environmental scanning are to be used by VHA\u2019s Office of Policy and  Planning and VHA program offices, in strategic decision making.", "In addition to environmental scanning, the NLC Strategic Planning  Summit is also key to VHA\u2019s strategic planning process, in that it is the  primary forum through which VHA leadership identifies and discusses the  strategic goals and objectives for the next year. The NLC is responsible  for recommending new or revised strategic goals and objectives and for  formulating strategies to achieve them.

Veterans Benefits Administration and National Cemetery  Administration officials indicated that they have varied levels of  participation. Veterans Benefits Administration officials told us that they  have historically attended several days of the summit, and National  Cemetery Administration officials indicated that they may listen to the  VHA\u2019s general body sessions during the summit. Even though officials  from both administrations indicated they believe their input and  coordination with VHA regarding its strategic planning was sufficient,  Veterans Benefits Administration officials noted that increased  engagement in VHA\u2019s strategic planning process would be beneficial,  given the direct correlation between veterans\u2019 disability compensation  ratings assigned by them and the subsequent care delivered from VHA.", "During the course of the summit, the NLC determines if changes to VHA\u2019s  strategic goals and objectives are needed.

For example, according to VA and VHA officials, VHA\u2019s  environmental scanning process is, and has historically been, health-care  focused, and is adjunct to the broad environmental scanning process  conducted by VA. Officials noted that though distinct processes, VA\u2019s and  VHA\u2019s environmental scanning processes are interrelated. VHA officials  told us that they leverage VA\u2019s environmental scanning results in making  decisions regarding VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives.

First, VHA has not  clearly identified VAMCs\u2019 responsibilities in operationalizing its strategic  goals and objectives as it has for VISNs. For example, VHA Directive  1075 states that VISN directors are to be responsible for: developing  operational plans; annually tracking and reporting accomplishments in  support of the VHA strategic plan; regularly updating plans to address  local issues, such as geographic-specific needs; and providing input to  inform future VHA goals, objectives, and strategies. However, there are  no such stated responsibilities for VAMCs. According to federal internal  control standards, successful organizations should assign responsibility to  discrete units, and delegate authority to achieve organizational objectives.  VHA and VISN officials told us that it is inferred that the VAMCs are part  of the overall process even though there is no specific policy or guidance  for VAMCs. All three VISNs in our review reported developing operational  plans or strategies to operationalize VHA\u2019s goals and objectives at the  VISN level, but two of the nine VAMCs in our review had not developed  such strategies.", "Second, in FY 2013, VHA provided VISNs with a strategic planning guide  for operationalizing the current strategic plan, but did not provide a similar  guide for VAMCs. According to the guide, its purpose was to assist VISNs  in outlining a multi-year plan that aligned with VHA\u2019s current strategic plan  and provide relevant information regarding the development of strategies,  the process for conducting a strategic analysis, and the time frame for  providing strategic planning information, such as strategies, to VHA  central office.", "The lack of guidance for VAMCs may hinder them from effectively  operationalizing VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives, and may lead to  inconsistencies in time frames, documentation, and data used for the  strategic planning process. For those VAMCs in our review that  developed strategies to operationalize VHA\u2019s strategic goals and  objectives, for example, almost all developed local strategies on a fiscal- year cycle, which aligns with VHA\u2019s budgeting and strategic planning  processes, but one VAMC developed strategies on a calendar-year cycle.  Although there is no requirement for VAMCs to conduct strategic planning  on a specific timeline, per leading practices for strategic planning,  organizations should align their activities, core processes, and resources  to ensure achievement of the agency\u2019s objectives.

Among other  things, our previous work has shown that strategies should have  clearly defined milestones, outline how an organization will hold  managers and staff accountable for achieving its goals, and be linked  to the day-to-day activities of the organization. In addition, individual  strategies should be linked to a specific goal or objective. In  September 2014, VHA published the Blueprint for Excellence to  provide strategies for transforming VHA health care service delivery in  response to concerns regarding the VHA wait-time crisis that year.

As our previous work has  shown, assessments can provide feedback to an organization on how  well day-to-day activities and programs developed to operationalize  strategic goals and objectives contribute to the achievement of those  goals and objectives. Specifically, formal assessments are to be  objective and measure the results, impact, or effects of a program or  policy, as well as the implementation and results of programs,  operating policies, and practices; they can also help in determining  the appropriateness of goals or the effectiveness of strategies.   However, VHA does not have effective oversight process for ensuring  that VISNs and VAMCs are meeting all of its strategic goals and  objectives.", "According to VHA officials, there are currently two methods for  assessing VHA\u2019s performance towards meeting selected strategic  goals and objectives. One method is VISN and VAMC directors\u2019  individual annual performance plans. For FY 2016, these plans  present VHA\u2019s strategies for providing a successful health care  delivery system, including those outlined in its Blueprint for  Excellence. The directors\u2019 plans include performance metrics, which  VHA, as well as VISNs and VAMCs, can use to measure  demonstrated progress of a VISN or VAMC in meeting these  strategies. However, multiple strategic goals and objectives have  been communicated to the field, such as the Under Secretary for  Health\u2019s five priorities, and it is not clear how these goals align with  the strategies in the current directors\u2019 performance plans or how  progress towards them can be assessed. A VHA official, who is a  member of the workgroup reviewing VHA\u2019s performance metrics, told  us that over the years, performance metrics were added to the  director performance plans as problems or needs arose without  considering the overall purpose of the metric. VHA officials reported  that they have reviewed the current plans and have revised them.  According to a VHA official, the new plans will have fewer metrics,  and will be more strategically focused on VA\u2019s and VHA\u2019s strategic  priorities, such as the Under Secretary for Health\u2019s five priorities.  According to VHA officials, implementation is planned for October 1,  2016. However, it is not clear how these metrics will be linked to the  strategic goals and objectives in VHA\u2019s current strategic plan.", "Veterans\u2019 satisfaction with VA\u2019s health care system is the second  method for assessing VHA\u2019s performance towards meeting strategic  goals and objectives, according to VHA officials. VHA currently  collects information from a survey of veterans that addresses two of  VA\u2019s priority goals, including improving access to health care, as  experienced by the veteran. According to VHA officials, for the  veterans\u2019 access goal, there is a large degree of alignment between  the department-wide goal and how VHA measures its progress  towards meeting some of its access goals and objectives in its  strategic plan. However, it is not clear how VAMCs and VISNs are to  use veterans\u2019 satisfaction to assess progress toward meeting other  goals and objectives that have been communicated to them\u2014such as  the Under Secretary for Health\u2019s five priorities that are not focused on  access. VHA officials told us that no additional VHA-level  assessments had been conducted to measure progress towards  meeting strategic goals and objectives. Though VHA has performance  information from VISN and VAMC directors\u2019 performance plans and  veteran satisfaction surveys, the performance of the agency toward  meeting VA\u2019s and VHA\u2019s other strategic goals and objectives may  help provide a more complete picture of overall effectiveness.", "In addition to a lack of adequate strategies and an effective oversight  process, a large number of vacant, acting, and interim positions at some  of the VISNs and VAMCs in our review have also created challenges for  VHA in operationalizing its strategic goals and objectives. For example,  officials from one VISN reported that acting and interim senior leadership  positions within a facility in their region have had an effect on the  operations of the VAMC, including the operationalization of VHA\u2019s  strategic goals and objectives. They added that the acting and interim  senior leaders did not feel empowered to make long-term decisions  regarding the operations of the medical center because they did not know  how long they would hold the position. The Under Secretary for Health  told us that one of VHA\u2019s top priorities for 2016 is to fill 90 percent of  VAMC director positions with permanent appointments by the end of the  year.

However, VHA has not delineated a role for VAMCs in this process as it  has for VISNs. Moreover, the lack of adequate strategies to  operationalize VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives, as well as the lack of  an effective oversight process for assessing progress, may hinder the  achievement of VHA\u2019s goals and objectives. Without consistently  developed strategies, the day-to-day activities and initiatives that are  developed to operationalize VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives may not  appropriately align with those goals and objectives. This may result in  VHA not being able to determine if it is adequately addressing top  management concerns or department-wide strategic goals. Further,  because VHA does not have an effective process to assess progress in  meeting its strategic goals and objectives, it does not have needed  information on how well the day-to-day activities and programs of VISNs  and VAMCs are contributing to their achievement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Secretary of Veterans Affairs direct the Under  Secretary for Health to take the following three actions:  1.  Define the roles and responsibilities of VAMCs in operationalizing  VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives; this could be accomplished by  establishing roles and responsibilities for VAMCs similar to how VHA  defines roles and responsibilities for VISNs in VHA Directive 1075 and  by developing guidance for VAMCs similar to guidance developed for  VISNs.  2.  Consistently develop strategies that can be used by VISNs and  VAMCs to operationalize VHA\u2019s goals and objectives, ensuring that  they clearly link directly to VHA\u2019s goals and objectives.  3.  Develop an oversight process to assess progress made in meeting  VHA\u2019s strategic goals and objectives, including feedback on how well  activities and programs are contributing to achieving these goals and  objectives."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided VA with a draft of this report for its review and comment. In  its written comments, reproduced in appendix II, VA concurred with our  three recommendations, and described the actions it is taking to  implement them by September 2017.

While our report draft noted the role of  community-based outpatient clinics and health care centers in VA\u2019s  service delivery system, we clarified that these facilities are components  of VAMCs. VA also commented that our report draft does not mention the  essential role that VHA program offices play in contributing to and  implementing the VHA strategic plan.
