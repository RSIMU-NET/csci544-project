When these mortgages reach the end of their terms (mature), property owners may exit the program; current law does not allow RHS to continue providing rental assistance when such exiting occurs. As a result, tenants in properties with mortgages that are maturing may face rent increases or lose their housing altogether.", "GAO was asked to examine how RHS is addressing the risks posed by maturing mortgages. This report examines RHS's efforts to (1) estimate rural housing property exit dates and (2) preserve the affordability of rural rental properties with maturing mortgages. GAO reviewed RHS mortgage loan data and preservation documents, and interviewed RHS officials and industry stakeholders."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Housing Service (RHS) implemented an automated tool to estimate when properties could exit the rural rental housing program, but RHS lacked sufficient controls to ensure the accuracy, completeness, and timeliness of those estimates. In 2016, RHS developed its Multi-Family Housing Property Preservation Tool to replace a manual process of estimating exit dates. RHS data suggest that a smaller number of properties could exit RHS's program in the near term, but between 2028 and 2050, over 90 percent of RHS's properties and units could exit the program (about 13,000 properties with 407,000 units). However, RHS lacked controls that would better ensure the accuracy and completeness of these estimated exit dates, such as the verification of key data input at mortgage origination. In addition, RHS had not established a regular process to update the preservation tool's underlying data due to staff turnover and data system challenges. Without these controls, RHS may lack assurance that is has reliable data for calculating exit dates and initiating preservation efforts.", "While RHS has taken actions to address properties with maturing mortgages, such as offering property owners options designed to prevent property exits, about 60 percent of properties with maturing mortgages exited the program between 2014 through 2017. The agency's planning efforts lacked key steps such as (1) establishing preservation goals, (2) developing metrics for evaluating preservation efforts, and (3) analyzing and responding to risks facing its portfolio such as resource limits and growing capital rehabilitation needs. Without taking these actions, RHS is not well positioned to preserve affordable housing in the near term or when much larger numbers of properties and units could exit the program starting in 2028. Although taking the steps above would help RHS's preservation efforts, some tenants may still be at risk of losing rental assistance when mortgages mature. Accordingly, allowing RHS to renew rental assistance after mortgage maturity could protect assisted low-income tenants from increased rents or displacement from their units. When the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) faced a similar loss of affordable housing subsidies, Congress authorized the department in 2011 to continue providing rental assistance at properties after contracts expired."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["Congress should consider granting RHS authority to continue providing rental assistance to tenants in properties with maturing mortgages.

To assess the accuracy and completeness of data used to determine  property exit dates, we reviewed and analyzed two different types of data.  First, we analyzed a stratified random sample of RHS mortgage loan  documents in five selected states\u2014California, Illinois, Minnesota,  Pennsylvania, and Virginia. We selected these states based on their  geographic diversity and number of rural rental properties, and because  they had a high number of mortgages nearing maturity. Second, we  reviewed and assessed the underlying data the agency uses to estimate  property exit dates. To assess the reliability of these data, we reviewed  RHS documentation, tested the data for missing or erroneous values, and  interviewed RHS officials. As discussed later in this report, we identified a  selected number of errors in the data for the sample of RHS mortgage  documents and underlying data that we reviewed.

Eligible tenants pay no more than 30 percent of their  income toward the rent, and RHS pays the balance to the property owner.  Tenants must be low-income (incomes above 50 percent of area median  income but not more than 80 percent of area median income) or very-low- income (with incomes not more than 50 percent of area median income)  to be eligible for rental assistance. The agreements with the owners  expire when the original dollar amount obligated is fully expended.  Agreements specify that owners will receive payments on behalf of  tenants in a designated number of units at the property. In addition,  property owners must certify tenants\u2019 incomes annually or when a tenant  experiences a substantial change in income.

When an owner defaults on loan payments and the property is  foreclosed, it may exit RHS\u2019s program. Properties can also exit the  program when loans mature naturally, meaning the loan is paid off as  scheduled by the original loan term. Loans can also be prepaid, meaning  payments are made ahead of schedule, which ends the loan term early.  Only those loans made on or after December 15, 1989, are ineligible to  prepay. As previously noted, once a property exits RHS\u2019s program,  owners are generally no longer required to provide housing for low- income tenants and properties are no longer eligible to receive rental  assistance that is used to keep rents affordable for tenants.", "Some owners that are reaching the end of their RHS mortgage terms may  wish to exit the program. Other owners may wish to remain in the  program and continue renting to low-income tenants.

Although RHS staff reviews some loan information  through the agency\u2019s State Internal Review process, officials noted that  the review of mortgage data entered into AMAS and MFIS only occurs for  each field office at least once every 5 years and includes a step for staff  to review and reconcile AMAS information with loan documents to help  ensure the accuracy of RHS debt instruments. RHS officials added that  they improved the guidance in October 2017 by adding specific data  checks intended to help ensure that loan amount, interest rate, and  amortization period information were correct. In addition, during our  review of RHS\u2019s rural rental housing loan documents, we identified  mismatches between loan document information and the data in AMAS  and MFIS used by the preservation tool. We found errors in the data on  mortgage amounts, closing dates, and repayment periods in an estimated  3 percent to 5 percent of the properties in five states we examined.  While the data we reviewed had limited errors, without appropriate  internal controls, RHS cannot be assured that the data that is used by the  preservation tool will be reliable in the future, and the mismatches  suggest that RHS could improve how data are entered into AMAS and  MFIS.", "According to RHS officials, these systems were not designed to estimate  the expected maturity of rural rental housing mortgages.

Without these controls, mortgage information  used by the preservation tool to estimate property exit dates may be  inaccurate and could affect the reliability of exit date estimates needed to  identify properties for possible preservation.", "Second, RHS lacked controls to check the accuracy and completeness of  underlying data used by the preservation tool. When we examined the  underlying data the preservation tool uses to estimate property exit dates,  we observed missing (blank) values for some property address; property  state; borrower address; and management company name information.

Officials said they  hoped the two studies would help the agency prepare for maturing  mortgages. In September 2016, the Housing Assistance Council  completed its first study for RHS, which identified the characteristics of  RHS\u2019s rural housing program and the impact that maturing mortgages  may have on tenants and geographic regions. The report noted that  understanding these characteristics and effects is important for planning  and implementing strategies to preserve the properties. According to  officials, the second study, which was under review by the agency as of  December 2017, was intended to outline issues facing RHS\u2019s multifamily  housing program, such as the estimated $5.6 billion needed to  rehabilitate properties program-wide, and possible policy solutions for  addressing potential property exits.", "RHS has offered property owners several options to prevent property  exits and preserve the access to and affordability of housing for low- income tenants (see fig. 4).", "Reamortization: Loan reamortization and a shortened reamortization  process (known as \u201cRe-Am Lite\u201d) allow borrowers to repay  outstanding loan balances over new, longer repayment periods. By  extending the term of the loan, officials said that the agency can  continue providing rental assistance to that property. Re-Am Lite does  not require borrowers to have their properties appraised, which  officials said can shorten the reamortization application process by 60  to 90 days.", "Deferral: Borrowers can defer repayment of direct loans for up to 20  years. This prevents property exits and preserves affordability for low- income tenants by continuing the payment of rental assistance to  property owners. Loan deferrals can be offered under the Multi- Family Housing Preservation and Revitalization program. This 12- year-old demonstration program offers a combination of property  rehabilitation funding and the opportunity for owners to reamortize or  defer loan payments to help keep rents affordable. Officials said the  program can also be used to attract new owners who wish to stay in  the affordable housing program by offering a funding source for  property rehabilitation.", "Prepayment Offer: If borrowers decline RHS\u2019s options that extend  loan terms (reamortization, Re-Am Lite, and deferral), but wish to  remain in the RHS portfolio, the agency encourages property owners  to submit a request to prepay their mortgage, if eligible to do so and if  their mortgages are 12 or more months from maturity. After an owner  submits a prepayment request, RHS is authorized to offer owners  incentives to avert prepayment. These incentives include increased  returns on investment to for-profit owners, additional rental assistance  units, and equity loans.", "Prepayment: If borrowers decline RHS\u2019s options, the agency  encourages property owners to prepay their loans. While owners who  prepay would no longer have rural rental housing loans with RHS or  be eligible to receive rental assistance from the agency, prepayment  of a loan allows RHS to provide vouchers to tenants affected by the  loss of affordable housing. According to RHS data, only about 5,000  of the 14,000 properties within RHS\u2019s multifamily housing program are  eligible to prepay loans.", "Transfer: RHS has taken steps to facilitate the sale (transfer) of  properties to new owners to prevent property exits. Officials described  this as a key preservation tool because new RHS mortgage terms  typically accompany the sale and allow for rental assistance to  continue at properties where applicable. First, the agency  established a more centralized and standardized transfer process  based on input from developers, owners, and other stakeholders,  which officials say reduced the average property transfer time from  156 to 112 days. Second, RHS maintains a spreadsheet available on  the agency\u2019s website, called the Preliminary Assessment Tool, which  officials said streamlines and provides greater transparency to the  property transfer process for potential buyers and sellers. The agency  also hosted three conferences in 2016 designed to help find new  buyers for RHS properties whose owners were seeking to sell their  properties. Finally, in September 2016, RHS announced a 2-year  pilot program to encourage nonprofit organizations to purchase rural  rental properties with maturing mortgages, which could create new  loan terms that would extend the repayment period and continue the  properties\u2019 affordability. Prior to the pilot, nonprofit owners were not  required to make an initial equity contribution to projects and therefore  could not earn any return on investment. Under the pilot, loan  transfers to nonprofits would allow nonprofits to earn returns on their  own resources initially invested in the property.", "Despite the preservation options and incentives identified by RHS, 61  percent (148 of 244) of the properties with mortgages that matured  between January 2014 and December 2017 exited the agency\u2019s rural  rental housing program (see table 1). Some industry stakeholders said  that options and incentives did not adequately or broadly appeal to  property owners. They added that existing options and incentives would  be used primarily by owners who have no other choice but to stay in the  program. Stakeholders explained that owner choice might be limited  because of the condition of their property or because their property is  located in a market that would not accommodate the sale of a property or  rent increases to market levels.

To help respond to  this risk, the agency directed staff to notify owners 3 years in advance  that their loan is maturing and that options are available for preserving  the property within the program. While this window could provide RHS  with the time to plan for property exits, RHS is not collecting  information from owners on why they may choose to exit rather than  stay in the affordable housing portfolio. The agency\u2019s effort to predict  owner behavior would be aided by collecting and analyzing data on  how many owners choose to leave the program and why.", "Resource constraints\u2014During a May 2017 conference, a senior RHS  official highlighted the issue of agency resource constraints for  addressing maturing mortgages, saying that the agency does not  have the ability or the financial resources to preserve all of the  properties that could leave the program once the loans mature. RHS  has also acknowledged that, even at lower levels of about 80  maturing mortgages each year, the agency does not have the  resources to provide all preservation options to every owner who  wishes to use them. RHS has also not analyzed or planned for how it  would prioritize the use of limited resources. RHS national office  officials said there is some guidance that could be used by state  offices to prioritize the use of resources, but this guidance was not  specific to addressing maturing mortgages and was in the process of  being updated to include information that could be used to help  prioritize limited resources for preserving properties. That update is  expected by January 2019.", "Management of maturing mortgages\u2014RHS has not analyzed or  responded to risks involving staff management of maturing  mortgages. For example, the agency\u2019s national office said that staff  attrition and turnover in the national, state, and field offices that  manage mortgages have resulted in fewer staff managing its program  in general and that they were not sure what the effect of maturing  mortgages would have on staff workloads. RHS staff in some of the  states we visited expressed concern that workloads are already heavy  and that any increase caused by maturing mortgages, including  smaller numbers occurring now, might affect their ability to be  responsive to program needs. Similarly, some state office staff  expressed concerns that they were not trained for managing and  responding to properties with maturing mortgages and needed  additional guidance from the national office. RHS national office  officials said that while the agency does not provide training specific to  maturing mortgages, it does provide training on loan servicing, which  includes the use of preservation options, and the national office  conducts monthly conference calls that all state offices participate in,  which have included maturing mortgages as a topic and which can be  used to answer staff questions about maturing mortgages.", "Rehabilitation Costs\u2014RHS has commissioned two studies on the  risks that program-wide rehabilitation costs pose to its ability to  preserve its program, but has not analyzed or planned for how it  would address the estimated $5.6 billion needed to rehabilitate its  aging portfolio of properties. Officials said that they have met with  industry stakeholders and Congress about capital needs estimates,  but no additional steps such as requesting additional funding were  taken. Officials added that federal budget uncertainties caused by  years of continuing resolutions and a sequestration have made  planning for maturing mortgages and program-wide rehabilitation  more difficult. However, RHS has been aware of growing rehabilitation  needs since at least 2004, when the agency released a commissioned  study that said capital needs program-wide would continue to  increase and cost more if not addressed.", "Federal internal control standards call for agencies to define objectives in  specific and measurable terms to enable management to identify,  analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving those objectives.  Specifically, these standards call for agencies to establish goals and performance measures for tracking progress toward achieving goals;  establish activities that monitor performance and assess results so that  appropriate action is taken; and identify, analyze, and respond to risks  related to achieving their goals.", "RHS officials said that, as of December 2017, they had not taken steps to  develop goals and measures, perform key monitoring and assessments,  and analyze and respond to risks because the larger number of potential  property exits is not expected to begin for another 10 years (2028). RHS  officials said that they were using this time to see how their existing  options and resources perform, and that the agency would make resource  and other adjustments over time as they gained experience with  preservation. However, as discussed above, mortgages have already  begun to mature and the majority of properties with maturing mortgages  between 2014 and 2017 exited the agency\u2019s rural rental housing program.  Some property owners may have chosen to exit the program regardless  of additional actions or incentives. For example RHS officials noted that  many of the property owners whose mortgages are currently maturing are  nearing retirement or prefer market returns to RHS\u2019s options and  incentives. However, the percentage of exits (61 percent) suggests that  RHS\u2019s current planning efforts have not proven sufficient to prevent the  majority of properties with mortgages that have matured from exiting its  rural housing program.", "By not having taken the planning steps identified above, RHS is not well  positioned to respond to properties that currently have maturing  mortgages and require action, nor is the agency prepared for the future  larger number of potential property exits that starts in 2028. In particular,  without developing goals and measures, conducting sound monitoring  and assessments of rural rental housing program developments, and  analyzing and responding to risks, RHS may not have the key  information, staff, tools, and resources in place to effectively preserve  properties and prevent the financial hardship that increasing housing  costs could cause rural low-income tenants or the loss of their housing  altogether."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Law Limits RHS\u2019s Ability to Offer Rental Assistance and Vouchers to Low- income Tenants", "paragraphs": ["RHS has options to extend loan terms in order to continue rental  assistance at properties but cannot continue providing rental assistance  to tenants once the loan is paid off and the property exits RHS\u2019s  affordable housing program. Some owners of properties with maturing  mortgages may be open to continue offering rental assistance and agree  to restrict the units to eligible low-income tenants after mortgage maturity.  Further, some industry stakeholders cited that having the ability to extend  existing rental assistance contracts after mortgage maturity would be  useful in protecting tenants from rent increases or displacement.", "However, in some cases, property owners may not want to extend rental  assistance contracts after mortgage maturity. Tenants living in these  properties could be subject to rent increases or the risk of displacement.  RHS lacks the authority to provide vouchers to tenants in these situations.  Voucher assistance would allow RHS to provide assistance to the tenants  to help pay for rent in their existing unit or at other rental housing in the  private market without requiring the owner to serve low-income tenants  exclusively.", "In 2016, legislation was introduced that would have allowed RHS to  continue providing rental assistance to properties through new contracts  with owners after their loans matured or to provide vouchers to tenants  under different circumstances, including mortgage maturity. In exchange  for accepting rental assistance payments on behalf of eligible tenants, the  legislation would have required the property owners to enter into an  agreement with RHS to ensure that the property remained subject to low- income use restrictions for an additional period of time. In cases where a  new rental assistance contract is not possible, RHS would offer vouchers  to tenants after mortgage maturity. The proposed legislation was  introduced on April 12, 2016, but no further action on the bill was taken.", "In the past, Congress has taken legislative action to continue rental  assistance to low-income tenants and protect them from the impact of  terminated assistance. For example, beginning in fiscal year 2006,  Congress has authorized RHS to provide vouchers to tenants affected by  loan prepayments, which leads to the property owners\u2019 exit of the RHS\u2019s housing program. Tenants receiving vouchers after the prepayment of a  loan could use them to remain in the property after it exits RHS\u2019s program  or to find other suitable housing in the private market. Congress has  limited the amount that RHS paid in subsidies. The amount of a voucher  is limited to the difference between the comparable fair market rent for the  housing unit occupied by a tenant and the rent paid by the tenant on the  date of prepayment or foreclosure.", "In addition, when the Department of Housing and Urban Development  (HUD) faced a similar loss of affordable housing, Congress gave the  department authority in 2011 to further protect tenants through the  creation of the Rental Assistance Demonstration (RAD). Before the  RAD program, HUD had limited authority to extend rental assistance at  these properties when contracts expired or owners terminated  contracts. However, this demonstration, among other things, allowed  HUD to continue providing rental assistance to property owners after the  original contracts expired. In 2014, we reported that the conversion of  rental assistance should not have an effect on voucher program costs  because HUD uses the same calculation for providing budget authority for  the project-based vouchers converted under RAD as it does for  calculating budget authority for tenant-protection vouchers.", "Without the authority to continue providing rental assistance or to provide  vouchers to tenants at existing properties whose mortgages have  matured, RHS is not well positioned to protect tenants from potential  increased rents or displacement from their units. The agency could lose  important sources of low-income housing, which for some communities  may be the only source of affordable housing. Further, without the  authority to offer vouchers to tenants living in units that received rental  assistance at mortgage maturity, tenants may also face rent increases  and not be able to afford their rents in properties where the owners  choose not to extend their rental assistance contracts. Continued  provision of rental assistance could be limited to units or tenants that  were receiving rental assistance at mortgage maturity and would not  represent an expansion of the number of units or tenants assisted.  Furthermore, Congress could structure this to have no or limited  budgetary impact, similar to what was done under HUD\u2019s RAD program.  For example, subsidies could be kept at a level that is similar to what was  provided at mortgage maturity."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["RHS\u2019s preservation tool is a positive first step to help the agency estimate  property exit dates, alert stakeholders to properties with maturing  mortgages, and begin to preserve their affordability. However, the lack of  data controls for information on RHS rural rental properties raises  concerns about data used by the preservation tool, especially as RHS  applies preservation options that extend mortgages and result in new exit  dates. The lack of controls for underlying data used by the preservation  tool, and missing information on some properties, demonstrate that RHS  has opportunities to improve rural housing program data as properties  continue to have maturing mortgages. RHS has not been able to update  the preservation tool\u2019s data on a regular basis. Developing controls with  clear guidance on the frequency and process for routinely updating data  on RHS\u2019s website could help ensure that preservation efforts are based  on the most current information available. Regular updated information  would also help ensure that industry and other stakeholders have the  most recent information available on RHS\u2019s rural rental housing program.", "While RHS has taken steps to better understand maturing mortgage  challenges and preserve properties, RHS\u2019s strategy to use the next  several years to plan for the larger number of expected future maturations  and test available preservation options does not address the significant  number of mortgages that will mature before then. The agency has also  not taken important planning steps required by federal internal control  standards to establish goals and performance measures for tracking  progress toward achieving goals; establish activities that monitor  performance and assess results so that appropriate action is taken; and  identify, analyze, and respond to risks related to achieving their goals.  Actions to enhance the agency\u2019s data and controls, and strengthen its  comprehensive planning and program evaluation processes, would better  position RHS to respond to maturing mortgages, preserve its rural rental  housing program, and maintain affordable housing for low-income  tenants.", "Further, the agency lacks the authority to continue rental assistance to  properties with matured mortgages and is limited in its ability to issue  vouchers to tenants affected by property exits. Even if the agency takes  additional steps to plan for maturing mortgages or increases options and  incentives for preserving housing, these limits to rental assistance and  vouchers restrict RHS\u2019s ability to protect tenants. These limits also effect  RHS\u2019s ability to meet the agency\u2019s objective of providing decent, safe,  and sanitary housing to low-income rural residents. Expanding RHS\u2019s  ability to protect existing tenants would give the agency tools that are  available to other affordable rental housing programs, and could be  implemented in a way to maintain, rather than increase, program size and  costs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Matter for Congressional Consideration", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following matter for congressional consideration:", "For RHS properties whose mortgages have matured, Congress  should consider granting RHS the authority to renew annual rental  assistance payments to owners who wish to continue to receive them  and provide vouchers to tenants living in rental assistance units in  properties whose owners choose to no longer receive rental  assistance."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We are making the following five recommendations to RHS:", "The RHS Administrator should establish additional controls to check  the accuracy of all loan information entered into RHS information  technology systems, to help ensure complete, accurate, and reliable  data for estimating rural rental housing property exit dates.

To determine what steps RHS has taken to help ensure the accuracy and  reliability of RHS\u2019s Multi-Family Housing Property Preservation Tool  (preservation tool), we reviewed documentation that included the  preservation tool\u2019s user guide, and the capabilities it offered the agency  and the public. We also conducted interviews with RHS national and state  office officials about the preservation tool and about how the agency\u2019s  Automated Multi-Family Housing Accounting System (AMAS) and the  Multi-Family Housing Information System (MFIS) operate. AMAS contains  data on loans and rental assistance contracts and MFIS tracks monthly  loan and rental assistance payments and contains data on the location of  RHS\u2019s rural rental properties. Both systems provide data used by the  preservation tool to calculate mortgage maturity and exit dates for rural  rental housing properties. To determine how the preservation tool was  built and the main information it uses to determine mortgage maturity and  property exit dates, and the information it calculates for users, we  interviewed the contractor hired by the agency to create and populate the  preservation tool.", "To analyze the accuracy of AMAS and MFIS data used by the  preservation tool to calculate mortgage maturity and property exit dates,  we reviewed mortgage documents that RHS uses to populate those  systems. We reviewed loan documents for a generalizable stratified  random sample of 100 properties in five states\u2014California; Illinois;  Minnesota; Pennsylvania; and Virginia\u2014to determine if loan information  found within mortgage documents matched data contained in AMAS and  MFIS for selected variables relevant to mortgage maturity and property  exit date calculations. We stratified the population of 2,152 loan  documents in the five states by state, number of loans per property, and  age groups. We computed an initial sample size of 60 properties for a  simple random sample to achieve an upper bound of no more than 5  percentage points, an expected error (inaccurate data field) rate of 0  percent, and a 95 percent confidence level. We then proportionally  allocated the sample across the strata and increased sample sizes in  stratum within each state so that we selected at least 10 properties with  more than 1 loan and 10 properties older than 20 years old. States we  visited were selected based on their geographic diversity, diversity (age  and size of program) of rural rental housing properties, and their proximity  to GAO offices.", "To select properties\u2019 loan files for this review, we created a  nongeneralizable sample of 20 properties in each of the five states.

We  analyzed the data to determine the number of properties, units, and rental  assistance units with property exit dates by state and by year from 2017  to 2050. We also generated summary statistics on the number of  properties that were eligible to prepay their mortgages. In assessing  RHS\u2019s data we also conducted checks on the data for outliers and  missing information. Although we found a selected number of data  anomalies that point to the need for better data controls, we determined  the data we used were sufficiently reliable for purposes of describing the  estimated number of properties that could exit the RHS program between  2017 and 2050.", "To better understand the calculations used by the preservation tool, we  reviewed the logic or code it uses to calculate mortgage maturation dates.  For this analysis, we used documentation on the program used to  generate estimates and compared this documentation to the code to see  if there were any operational differences. Additionally, we reviewed each  of the functions within the logic and looked for inconsistencies in logic or  deviations from financial convention that might cause incorrect  predictions.", "To examine steps RHS has taken to preserve properties with maturing  mortgages, we reviewed documents that listed options available for  retaining properties with maturing mortgages. We gathered and analyzed  documentation on any comprehensive planning efforts by RHS to address  rural rental housing maturing mortgages, including documentation  showing preservation goals and measures, and any assessments of  RHS\u2019s plans, efforts, or resources needed to address maturing  mortgages. We also analyzed documentation and interviewed national  and state RHS officials about any training and guidance that was being  provided to staff on maturing mortgages. In addition, we interviewed RHS  national and state officials about what tools, resources, and plans were in  place for addressing maturing mortgages and their limits. Further, we  asked about ongoing efforts to address maturing mortgages, including  any plans to obtain additional resources for managing maturing  mortgages now and in the future when a larger number of properties are  expected to have loans mature. We reviewed and interviewed officials  about studies commissioned by RHS on the effects of maturing  mortgages on the rural affordable rental housing program and affected  communities and on program-wide rehabilitation needs and cost  estimates.

We took multiple steps to identify  these industry organizations. First, we met with an affordable housing  organization with a national membership that represents owners;  developers; housing advocates; and tenants. We asked this national  organization to identify industry organizations that work with RHS. From  that list, we focused on organizations that also had a multi-state or  national focus. Second, during interviews with these organizations, we  requested additional contacts. We interviewed organizations that were  named during multiple interviews. This selection process allowed us to  identify stakeholders that represented a diverse range of roles in the rural  housing industry including: developers, borrower and tenant advocacy  organizations, and organizations advocating for the retention or  expansion of affordable housing.", "To determine how other agencies approached expiring rental assistance  contracts and low-income housing preservation, we also interviewed  Department of Housing and Urban Development officials.
