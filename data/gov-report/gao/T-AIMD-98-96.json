USDA\u2019s size and complexity, however, make this far from simple. It has a diverse portfolio of over 200 federal programs throughout the nation and the world. The department delivers about $80 billion in programs, at a cost in federal outlays of an estimated $54 billion. The fourth largest federal agency, USDA employs over 100,000 individuals in 31 agencies and departmental offices having multiple and sometimes disparate missions. Its responsibilities range from forests and timber to food assistance for the needy and the safety of meat and poultry products for human consumption.", "In fiscal year 1998 alone, USDA plans to spend about $1.2 billion on information technology and related information resources management (IRM) activities. It has reported spending more than $8 billion on IT over the past decade. During this time, USDA has seen its annual IT expenditures nearly double."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Strong Leadership Essential to Overcoming Long-Standing Problems Managing Information Technology Investments", "paragraphs": ["As we testified before this Subcommittee last spring, USDA has a long history of problems in managing its substantial investments in IT. We chronicled many cases dating back to 1981 in which the department had not effectively planned major computer modernization activities or managed IT resources. Such ineffective IT planning and management have resulted in USDA\u2019s wasting millions of dollars.", "While many factors have contributed to these problems, a major cause was the lack of strong IRM leadership, accountability, and oversight of the acquisition and use of departmental IT investments. Over the years USDA\u2019s component agencies were allowed to independently acquire and manage IT investments solely on the basis of their own parochial needs or interests. Because of this, USDA agencies have continued to independently plan, acquire, and develop separate systems, without considering opportunities to integrate systems and share data.", "Consequently, over time, the department has invested hundreds of millions of dollars in hundreds of systems that are not interoperable with others in the agency and that actually inhibit the use and sharing of information. In fact, data are often inaccessible and underutilized outside of and even within USDA\u2019s individual agencies for identifying problems, analyzing trends, or assessing crosscutting programmatic and policy issues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Legislative Reforms Provide Framework for Improved Information Technology Acquisition, Management", "paragraphs": ["Unfortunately, USDA\u2019s experiences with information technology management are not atypical among government agencies. After more than a decade of poor IT planning and program management by federal agencies, as just described for USDA, the Congress enacted the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996, which, in part, seeks to strengthen executive leadership in information management and institute sound capital investment decision-making to maximize the return on information systems investments. It is important to note that just as technology is most effective when it supports defined business needs and objectives, the Clinger-Cohen Act is at its most powerful when integrated with the objectives of other, broader, governmentwide management reform legislation that USDA is also required to implement.", "One such reform is the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995, which emphasizes the need for an overall IRM strategic planning framework, with IT decisions linked directly to mission needs and practices. Another is the Chief Financial Officers Act of 1990, which requires that sound financial management practices and systems essential for tracking program costs and expenditures be in place. Still another is the 1993 Government Performance and Results Act, which focuses on defining mission goals and objectives, measuring and evaluating performance, and reporting results.

Moreover, the CIO is to promote improvements in work processes and develop and implement an integrated, agencywide technology architecture. The CIO is also required to monitor and evaluate the performance of IT programs, and advise the head of the agency whether to continue, modify, or terminate a program or project.

That same day, he announced the designation of the department\u2019s then-Deputy Assistant Secretary for Administration to serve as acting CIO, and has since appointed this individual as USDA\u2019s first departmental CIO.

Comprising senior-level managers, the board is also supposed to ensure that USDA technology investments are managed as strategic business resources supporting efficient and effective program delivery. Moreover, USDA\u2019s Fiscal Year 1998 Appropriations Act provides that all IT acquisitions for new systems or significant upgrades must be approved by the CIO, with the concurrence of USDA\u2019s Executive Information Technology Investment Review Board. The CIO told us that she had reviewed and approved the department\u2019s fiscal year 1998 and fiscal year 1999 IT investment package and submitted it to the board in September 1997, which then concurred with the investment package as submitted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Responsibilities of Chief Information Officer With Regard to Information Technology Architecture", "paragraphs": ["This section requires the CIO to be responsible for designing and implementing an information technology architecture for the department.

In this regard, the CIO already obtains appropriated funds to carry out responsibilities under Clinger-Cohen and other legislative mandates.

Such a management structure is particularly important in situations, such as at USDA, where the departmental components have large information technology budgets or are engaged in major modernization efforts that require substantial CIO attention and oversight. In the Conference Report on the Clinger-Cohen Act, the conferees recognized that agencies may wish to establish CIOs for major components and bureaus.", "We believe that where utilized, such component-level CIOs should have responsibilities, authority, and management structures that mirror those of the departmental CIO. However, USDA could not readily provide information to identify the current organizational structures across USDA, where each of its component agency CIOs was positioned, or a description of their roles and responsibilities. We were told by the department\u2019s CIO that the role of the CIO at the component level has not been defined consistently across USDA agencies.", "According to the CIO\u2019s office, USDA agencies and departmental offices have a total of 16 positions that are either CIOs or senior IT officials with equivalent leadership roles. We were told that the roles and responsibilities of these officials differ from one agency to the next; some control all IT staff resources and others do not. Additionally, we were told that in most cases these officials report to their component management; USDA\u2019s CIO then works with these individuals through the department\u2019s Information Resources Management Council.

It is worth noting, however, that because USDA\u2019s Inspector General is responsible for auditing the department\u2019s annual financial statements, it may be more efficient to have that office review and compile spending data on information resources pertaining to the annual transfer and use of funds."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Bill: GAO\u2019S Perspective", "paragraphs": ["Mr. Chairman, we support your effort and that of the Subcommittee and Mr. Latham to ensure strong and effective CIO leadership at USDA by providing for more accountability and responsibility over the substantial investments the department makes in information technology.

At that time we said that various approaches exist as to how the CIO position can best be utilized to implement legislative requirements under Clinger-Cohen and other federal laws. These laws, along with guidance from the Office of Management and Budget and our best practices experience with leading organizations, define common tenets for the CIO position. What is important is that the approach be consistent with these tenets. Specifically, agencies should appoint a CIO with expertise and practical experience in technology position the CIO as a senior partner reporting directly to the agency head; ensure that the CIO\u2019s primary responsibilities are for information have the CIO serve as a bridge between top management, line management, and information management support professionals, working with them to ensure the effective acquisition and management of information resources needed to support agency programs and missions; task the CIO with developing strategies and specific plans for the hiring, training, and professional development of staff in order to build the agency\u2019s capability to develop and manage its information resources; and support the CIO position with an effective CIO organization and management framework for implementing agencywide information technology initiatives.", "Having an effective CIO with the institutional capacity and structure needed to implement the management practices embodied in the broad set of reforms set out in Clinger-Cohen and other legislation is crucial for improved planning and management of IT investments.
