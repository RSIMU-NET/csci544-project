There are concerns that U.S. funds are being diverted to fund insurgent and criminal activity in Afghanistan. In light of these concerns, under the authority of the Comptroller General of the United States, we initiated a review to identify DOD, State, and USAID efforts to vet non-U.S. contractors and assistance recipients in Afghanistan. GAO examined (1) the extent to which DOD has established a process to vet non-U.S. vendors to ensure that resources are not used to support insurgents; (2) the extent to which State and USAID have established processes to vet vendors and assistance recipients; and (3) the extent to which vetting information is shared among DOD, State, and USAID. GAO reviewed documents and met with a variety of agency officials to address the report's objectives."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["While DOD's U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) has established a vetting cell to vet non-U.S. vendors in Afghanistan to minimize the risk of insurgents or criminal groups using contracts to fund their operations, its current approach for selecting vendors to vet has gaps. For example, vendors with contracts below $100,000 are not routinely vetted. In fiscal year 2010 around three-quarters of the command's new contracts with non-U.S. vendors were below $100,000. Subcontractors are also not routinely vetted. Command officials stated that CENTCOM uses other risk factors to prioritize vendors to vet, such as contracts performed in Taliban strongholds, but these factors have not been documented. While officials stated that the vetting cell was created to vet vendors prior to award, CENTCOM is largely vetting vendors with existing contracts, which means it is likely that there are a large number of new vendors that have not been vetted prior to award and may have to be vetted in the future. Also, the vetting effort now includes some U.S. Army Corps of Engineers vendors. However, the vetting cell was not staffed to accommodate this workload, so it is uncertain how its existing resources will be able to vet vendors in a timely manner. Without accurately defining the universe of contracts that may need to be vetted, adopting a formal risk-based approach that incorporates other risk factors to identify non-U.S. vendors that pose the highest risk, and identifying the resources needed to accomplish this, it is uncertain how the vetting cell will be able to meet the additional workload and achieve its goals. In January 2011, USAID created a process intended to vet non-U.S. implementing partners in Afghanistan; however, this process may face similar limitations as CENTCOM's. According to USAID officials, this decision was based on the urgent need to mitigate the risks of USAID funds being diverted to insurgent groups. While USAID's process is in the early stages, it proposes to vet non-U.S. implementing partners and at least first-tier subcontractors with contracts valued at $150,000 or more. USAID officials said that they are considering changing the dollar threshold or vetting other potential assistance recipients based on risk; however, the available documentation does not include other risk factors. As of March 2011, State had not developed a process to vet contractor firms in Afghanistan. Since 2008, State has required that a terrorist financing risk assessment be completed for any new program or activity prior to a request for or obligation of funding. However, it does not use the same information as the CENTCOM or USAID vetting cells. Additionally, its use of Afghan vendors may increase under the Afghan First policy. Absent a way to consider the risk posed by non-U.S. vendors, State may not be well prepared to assess the potential for its funds to be diverted to criminal or insurgent groups. DOD and USAID share vetting information informally, but without a formal mechanism to share vetting results the two agencies cannot ensure that their current practices will endure. Further, as State expands its use of local contractors, it will become imperative that it is part of the data sharing with DOD and USAID."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is making recommendations related to improving DOD's and USAID's vetting processes and information sharing. GAO is also recommending that State assess the need for and possible options to vet non-U.S. vendors. DOD and USAID concurred with GAO's recommendations. State generally concurred."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In fiscal year 2009 and the first half of fiscal year 2010, the Departments of  Defense (DOD) and State (State) and the United States Agency for  International Development (USAID) collectively reported obligations of at  least $17.2 billion on contracts and various assistance instruments to  support U.S. efforts in Afghanistan. The use of non-U.S. vendors\u2014and, in  particular, Afghan vendors\u2014is expected to increase, as the Afghan First  policy adopted by the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF),  United States Forces \u2013 Afghanistan (USFOR-A), and the U.S. Embassy in  Kabul, Afghanistan, encourages an increased use of local personnel and  vendors for goods and services as part of the U.S. counterinsurgency  (COIN) strategy. Additionally, in September 2010, the USFOR-A/ISAF  Commander released guidance encouraging the increased use of  contracting with Afghan vendors and hiring of Afghan personnel to  achieve U.S. COIN goals. Although DOD, State, and USAID have long used  contractors and implementing partners to conduct their work, the  agencies\u2019 current reliance on contractors to support U.S. efforts to  stabilize and rebuild Afghanistan is unprecedented. We have previously  reported on the contracting challenges agencies face in contingency  environments. For example, the contracting environment in Afghanistan  poses unique challenges, including the complexity of transporting supplies  and equipment, the limited availability of staff for the needed level of  oversight, the often limited capacity of local vendors, a lack of robust  accounting and record keeping in the country, and a high volume of  complex contracts and large-scale construction projects. Further,  according to DOD officials and officials from other U.S. government  agencies, and as suggested in congressional reports, U.S. contracting  efforts take place in an environment characterized by actual and perceived  widespread corruption in Afghan government and business and face the  risk that some U.S. funds may be used to finance terrorist or insurgent  groups.", "The U.S. government has taken a number of steps to prevent resources  from being used to support terrorist activities or organizations\u2014for  example, Executive Order 13,224 was aimed at blocking the financing of  terrorism. As the use of contractors and spending has grown in  Afghanistan, U.S. government agencies and congressional committees  have paid increasing attention to the risks of U.S. contracting and  reconstruction funds being diverted to criminal or insurgent groups. For  example, congressional legislation to address this issue has recently been  proposed, and there have been congressional hearings and recent reports  detailing examples of corruption and financing of insurgents in  Afghanistan. In September 2010 COIN contracting guidance, the  Commander of USFOR-A/ISAF directed contracting officials to establish  systems and standard databases to ensure that contracts are not awarded  to malign actors and funds are not diverted. Additionally, in 2010 DOD and  other agencies spearheaded the creation of interagency efforts in  Afghanistan intended to encourage transparency, prevent corruption, and  identify malign actors. For example, in June 2010 DOD created Task Force  2010, which works to develop greater visibility over contracting networks,  money flows, and the linkages to malign actors to better employ  contracting to support COIN goals. Earlier, in 2009, the Drug Enforcement  Agency, DOD, the Department of the Treasury, and other U.S. agencies  established the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, which aims to identify and  disrupt the funding of criminal and insurgent organizations.", "In light of these concerns, under the authority of the Comptroller General  of the United States, we initiated a review to identify DOD, State, and  USAID efforts to vet vendors and assistance recipients in Afghanistan. We  examined (1) the extent to which DOD has established a process to vet  non-U.S. vendors in Afghanistan, both to ensure that resources are not  used to support insurgent or criminal groups and to safeguard U.S.  personnel and assets against security risks; (2) the extent to which State  and USAID have established processes to vet non-U.S. vendors and  assistance recipients in Afghanistan; and (3) the extent to which vetting  information is shared among DOD, State, and USAID.", "To conduct this work, we reviewed recent DOD, including U.S. Central  Command (CENTCOM); State; and USAID policies and procedures. These  include the most recent (November 2010) CENTCOM Contracting  Command Acquisition Instruction as well as past versions, USAID\u2019s  Mission Order for Afghanistan 201.03, and an April 2010 memorandum of  understanding among DOD, State, and USAID relating to contracting in  Iraq and Afghanistan. Additionally, we reviewed the DOD contract that  establishes a vendor vetting cell in support of U.S. forces in Afghanistan  and Iraq at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, Florida, and the contract\u2019s  associated classified policies and procedures, as well as draft standard  operating procedures for USAID\u2019s vetting support unit in Afghanistan. We  interviewed cognizant DOD, State, and USAID officials in both Afghanistan  and the United States, including DOD policy, logistics, and acquisition  officials from the offices of the relevant Under Secretaries of Defense in  Washington, D.C.; CENTCOM officials in the planning, logistics, and  intelligence directorates, as well as representatives of the vendor vetting  cell in Tampa, Florida; and USAID and State officials in Washington, D.C.,  responsible for contracting, procurement, and security. We do not discuss  the mechanics of the vetting processes used by DOD and USAID in detail  because we did not evaluate the effectiveness of the methods used by the  agencies to conduct the vetting. In Afghanistan, we interviewed a variety  of DOD, USFOR-A, and CENTCOM Contracting Command officials in  Kabul, including the CENTCOM Senior Contracting Official-Afghanistan  and the commanders of Task Force 2010 and other groups. Additionally,  we put out data calls to USAID and State for their procurement data for  fiscal year 2010 in Afghanistan. We present procurement data for fiscal  year 2010 in Afghanistan, based on data calls to USAID and State, to give a  broad context for the scale of awards to U.S. vendors compared to those  to non-U.S. vendors and the amounts obligated and determined the  method used to gather these data to be sufficiently reliable for this  purpose. We also interviewed cognizant U.S. Embassy security and  contracting officials and USAID security and contracting officials, all in  Kabul. Additionally, we interviewed officials from regional contracting  centers in Kabul, Bagram, Camp Leatherneck, and Kandahar; U.S. Army  Corps of Engineers (USACE) officials in Kandahar and other locations;  and ISAF contracting and security officials in Kabul and Kandahar.", "We conducted this performance audit from May 2010 through June 2011 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. Details on our objectives, scope, and  methodology are contained in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["In Afghanistan, the use of local vendors by U.S. and international forces as  part of an effort to create economic development is considered to be one  of the key supporting elements of the U.S. COIN strategy. For example,  guidance issued in August 2010 and amplified in September 2010 by the  ISAF/USFOR-A Commander emphasizes the role of contracting in the  implementation of the COIN strategy. In Afghanistan, local personnel  make up a significant portion of DOD\u2019s contractor workforce. According  to CENTCOM\u2019s quarterly census data, in the first quarter of fiscal year  2011, there were more than 87,000 DOD contractor personnel in  Afghanistan. Of those personnel, Afghan nationals made up approximately  53 percent of the contracted workforce. According to DOD, recent  initiatives that have a direct influence on the hiring of local nationals in  Afghanistan include developing a more skilled workforce; increasing  business opportunities; increasing community cash flow; improving public  infrastructure, such as roads and utilities; and enhancing community  organizational capacity. In addition to its importance to DOD, local  contracting is integral to the efforts of other U.S. government agencies,  such as USAID, to rebuild and expand infrastructure and economic  capacity in Afghanistan.", "Assisting in this effort by providing contracting support are numerous  agencies, commands, and offices. For U.S. forces, the two primary DOD  contracting entities in Afghanistan based on fiscal year 2010 obligations  are CENTCOM Contracting Command and USACE. CENTCOM  Contracting Command\u2014whose structure includes the Senior Contracting  Officer-Afghanistan and the regional contracting centers\u2014obligated over  $2.7 billion in contracts in fiscal year 2010. Also in fiscal year 2010,  USACE obligated more than $1.8 billion, and it is expected to undertake  approximately $3.7 billion in projects in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2011.  Many of these reconstruction and infrastructure projects are expected to  be built by vendors, including the extensive use of subcontractors.  Further, in fiscal year 2010, USAID obligated over $2.7 billion in program  funds for projects in Afghanistan. According to USAID officials, the  agency is actively involved in using local vendors to provide goods and  services. Additionally, contracts that support forces in Afghanistan may be  awarded in the United States by contracting offices and commands, such  as the Army Materiel Command\u2019s Rock Island Contracting Center and U.S.  Transportation Command. According to State officials, most of the  agency\u2019s contracts in Afghanistan are awarded by contracting officials in  the United States. Further, given the NATO environment in Afghanistan,  contracts that directly or indirectly support U.S. forces may also be  awarded by the contracting offices of coalition partners, such as the  United Kingdom and Germany, and by NATO contracting entities, such as  the NATO Maintenance and Supply Agency.", "While the use of local vendors in Afghanistan is a key element of the COIN  strategy, it also brings about challenges. For example, the ISAF/USFOR-A  Commander\u2019s September 2010 guidance cautions that if large quantities of  international contracting funds are spent quickly and with insufficient  oversight, it is likely that some of those funds will unintentionally fuel  corruption, finance insurgent organizations, strengthen criminal patronage  networks, and undermine efforts in Afghanistan. Further, the guidance  suggests that extensive use of subcontractors in Afghanistan, as well as  the lack of visibility of subcontractors by contracting personnel, could  increase the risk of corruption. The September 2010 guidance directs  commanders and contracting officials to gain and maintain visibility of the  subcontractor network, and it warns that excessive subcontracting tiers  provide opportunities for criminal networks and insurgents to divert  contract money from its intended purpose. Additionally, USAID\u2019s Mission  Order for Afghanistan 201.03 seeks to prevent USAID programs and funds  from benefiting terrorists. To prevent resources from being used to  support terrorist activities or organizations, steps have been taken, such as  the issuance of Executive Order 13,224 in September 2001, which blocks  the property of individuals and entities designated as terrorists and  prohibits the support of these listed individuals or entities through dealing  in blocked property. Additionally, various implementing regulations,  found in the Federal Acquisition Regulation, prevent government agencies  from contracting with designated individuals and entities, or require  contracting officers to check potential contract awardees against lists  such as the Excluded Parties List System.", "As part of the acquisition process, the Federal Acquisition Regulation  indicates that contracts are to be awarded only to responsible prospective  vendors. A contracting officer must make an affirmative determination of  responsibility prior to awarding a contract. Guidance found in the  CENTCOM Contracting Command Acquisition Instruction, which is  intended to implement and supplement, among other regulations, the  Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement and to establish general contracting procedures,  states that its contracting officers \u201cshall take all practicable steps to  ensure the award of all contracts to responsible contractors.\u201d Both the  Federal Acquisition Regulation and the Defense Federal Acquisition  Regulation Supplement provide a number of elements to be considered in  the determination of responsibility. Several of these are elaborated upon  in the CENTCOM Contracting Command Acquisition Instruction, including  adequate financial resources to perform the contract, the ability to comply  with delivery or performance schedules, a satisfactory past performance  record (when part of the evaluation), and integrity and business ethics.  The integrity and business ethics element requires the contracting officer  to verify that a prospective awardee is not included in the Excluded  Parties List System.", "In response to continued congressional attention and concerns from DOD,  USAID, and other agencies about actual and perceived corruption in  Afghanistan and its impact on U.S. and ISAF activities, several DOD and  interagency (including State and USAID) efforts have been established in  Afghanistan to identify malign actors, encourage transparency, and  prevent corruption. These efforts include the establishment of several  interagency task forces, such as Task Force 2010, an interagency  anticorruption task force that aims to provide commanders and civilian  acquisition officials with an understanding of the flow of contract funds in  Afghanistan in order to limit illicit and fraudulent access to those funds by  criminal and insurgent groups, and the Afghan Threat Finance Cell, an  interagency organization that aims to identify and disrupt funding of  criminal and insurgent organizations. Additionally, ISAF and U.S. agencies  have established several other joint task forces, including the Combined  Joint Interagency Task Force Shafafiyat. Task Force Shafafiyat works to  integrate ISAF and U.S. anticorruption efforts, such as Task Force 2010  and Task Force Spotlight, which focuses on private security contracting,  with those of key Afghan government and civil society partners to foster a  common understanding of the corruption problem in Afghanistan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Has Recently Begun to Vet Non-U.S. Vendors in Afghanistan, but Its Efforts Could Be Strengthened by a Risk-Based Approach", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CENTCOM Contracting Command Has Recently Begun to Vet Vendors in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["In 2010, DOD began to vet non-U.S. vendors in Afghanistan by establishing  at CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, Florida, a vetting cell called the  Vendor Vetting Reachback Cell (vetting cell). The purpose of this vetting  process\u2014which includes the examination of available background and  intelligence information\u2014is to reduce the possibility that insurgents or  criminal groups could use U.S. contracting funds to finance their  operations. The vetting cell is staffed by 18 contractor employees  operating from CENTCOM headquarters and is supervised by DOD  officials. The contract used to establish the vetting cell for Afghanistan  was awarded in June 2010, and in August 2010 the cell began vetting non- U.S. vendors.", "According to the CENTCOM Contracting Command Acquisition  Instruction, all contract awards or options equal to or above $100,000 to all  non-U.S. vendors in Iraq and Afghanistan are subject to vetting by the  vetting cell. Additionally, all information technology contracts in  Afghanistan, regardless of dollar value, are subject to vetting. The  Acquisition Instruction suggests that although not required, all vendors  should be submitted for vetting\u2014which would include those with  contracts below $100,000. According to the Acquisition Instruction, to vet  a vendor, a contracting officer, generally located in Afghanistan, submits a  request using a Web-based database system known as the Joint  Contingency Contracting System. These requests are ultimately directed  to the vetting cell located at CENTCOM headquarters in Florida for  vetting. The cell vets the vendor and provides a recommendation either to  approve or disapprove it, which first goes to a DOD official in Tampa for  review and then is forwarded to a DOD entity in Afghanistan, which makes  the final determination. If the final determination calls for not contracting  with the vendor, the customer (e.g., the battlespace owner) can request an  exception to the policy proscribing DOD entities from awarding contracts  to rejected vendors. According to the Acquisition Instruction, contracting  officers should plan for the standard vetting process to take at least 14  calendar days. However, urgent vetting requests can be accomplished in 5  days. A request is considered urgent when the customer informs the  contracting officer in writing that a delay will cause an operational crisis  outweighing the risk of awarding to a potential rejected contractor. After  the final determination is made, the approval or disapproval status of the  vendor is entered and maintained within the Joint Contingency  Contracting System database. According to CENTCOM officials, the cell is  currently conducting periodic re-vettings of previously vetted vendors that  are under contract, which the cell will continue to do as part of its duties.  Additionally, while the vetting cell is structured to be able to vet any non- U.S. vendors, the current vetting emphasis is on Afghan vendors and those  from neighboring countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The CENTCOM Vetting Cell Has Recently Begun Vetting Vendors Used by USACE", "paragraphs": ["USACE obligated over $1.8 billion in Afghanistan in fiscal year 2010, but  until recently it did not have a process in place to routinely vet non-U.S.  vendors.

USACE officials told us that recognizing the  potential for overlap among vendors with which USACE and CENTCOM  Contracting Command are contracting in Afghanistan, CENTCOM  Contracting Command requested that USACE send a list of its most  frequently used prime vendors to be vetted, beginning in January 2011.  USACE officials told us that while CENTCOM Contracting Command has  asked for a list of the most frequently used prime vendors as well as major  subcontractors, it specifically asked USACE to stagger the submission of  vendor names so as not to overwhelm the vetting cell. While USACE  officials told us that some prime contractor names have been submitted, it  is unclear when any subcontractor vendor names will be submitted for  vetting. According to USACE officials, CENTCOM Contracting Command  made this request, in part, because at the time USACE did not use the Joint  Contingency Contracting System database, and as such CENTCOM  Contracting Command personnel bear the burden of entering all USACE  vendor data into the database. USACE officials told us that although  USACE has not previously used the Joint Contingency Contracting System  to track contracts and vendors, it has begun to train personnel, both in  Afghanistan and in the United States, to use the database.

In September 2010, ISAF/USFOR-A released additional  COIN contracting guidance that directs officials to gain more visibility  over the networks of subcontractors in Afghanistan.

Contracting officials have also indicated that the lack of visibility over  subcontractors impairs their ability to provide subcontractor names to the  vendor vetting cell.

Utilizing a risk-based  approach to identify high-risk vendors below the $100,000 threshold, as  well as subcontractors, could enable CENTCOM Contracting Command to  expand its ability to prevent contracts from going to criminal or insurgent  groups within existing resource constraints, particularly as CENTCOM  Contracting Command balances vetting existing contracts, those prior to  award, and vendors from other commands. For instance, while officials  have stated that the USACE\u2019s subcontractors pose a large risk because the  high value of their construction contracts, they stated that some of the  larger subcontractors are prime vendors for other projects, and many of  the USACE subcontractors are also used by CENTCOM Contracting  Command, either as prime contractors or subcontractors. USACE officials  also stated that as of February 2011, their hope is that their large  subcontractors that are not vetted through their roles as prime contractors  will be submitted to the CENTCOM vetting cell soon, and that USACE  aims to decrease the data entry burden on CENTCOM Contracting  Command by beginning to use its own personnel to enter information into  the Joint Contingency Contracting System. However, as of February 2011,  CENTCOM Contracting Command and USACE officials could not specify  when USACE will begin submitting subcontractors for vetting because of  CENTCOM Contracting Command\u2019s questions regarding the vetting cell\u2019s  capacity, and to date CENTCOM has no plans to begin routinely vetting its  subcontractors."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "USAID Has Begun to Develop a Vendor Vetting Process, but State Has Not", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "USAID Has Recently Established a Unit to Vet Non-U.S. Implementing Partners in Afghanistan, Though Details of the Process Have Not Been Finalized", "paragraphs": ["In January 2011, in order to counter potential risks of U.S. funds being  diverted to support criminal or insurgent activity, USAID created a process  for vetting prospective non-U.S. contract and assistance recipients (i.e.,  implementing partners) in Afghanistan, which is similar to a vetting  process it has used in the West Bank and Gaza since 2006. Previously, as  of October 2010, USAID officials indicated that they expected to use the  CENTCOM Contracting Command vetting cell to vet potential non-U.S.  implementing partners\u2014whether through a formal interagency agreement,  shared system or platform, or some other information-sharing  arrangement. At the time, officials expressed that they wanted to have one  consistent U.S. government approach for vetting non-U.S. vendors in  Afghanistan to ensure that no USAID implementing partners engage in or  support criminal or insurgent groups with contract or other assistance  funds. As illustrated in table 2, in fiscal year 2010 USAID reported 114 new  contracts and other awards to U.S. partners valued at over $285 million,  and 126 to non-U.S. partners valued at almost $46 million. While the  number of dollars USAID reported as obligated to non-U.S. partners is  substantially lower than that to U.S. partners, the numbers of awards given  is higher. In addition, as with DOD, USAID officials said the use of  subcontractors/subawardees is extensive, and the use of host-nation  partners is expected to increase.", "According to USAID officials, the agency had long been interested in  vetting its non-U.S. implementing partners in Afghanistan and, with the  establishment of the CENTCOM vetting cell, USAID had been working  with CENTCOM\u2019s Senior Contracting Official in Afghanistan to do so.  However, in late 2010 several factors emerged that led USAID to  immediately begin exploring whether the CENTCOM Contracting  Command vetting cell best met its needs or, alternatively, the agency  needed to establish its own vetting process. For example, USAID officials  said that in October 2010 they received a report by the Afghan Threat  Finance Cell that found that a certain percentage of USAID dollars were  being diverted in certain Afghan provinces and in some cases funneled to  insurgent groups. Additionally, in determining if CENTCOM\u2019s vetting cell  could meet its needs, officials stated that they sent a test vetting through  the cell and that it took nearly 3 months for the vetting cell to provide  results. Once USAID began looking into the possibility of setting up a  vetting unit, officials said they assessed that the agency had existing  capabilities from its vetting process used in the West Bank and Gaza with  which to implement a process similar to CENTCOM\u2019s without having to  establish a duplicative system. According to USAID officials, given the  urgent need to mitigate the issues reported by the Afghan Threat Finance  Cell, the timelines experienced with the CENTCOM vetting cell, and the  availability of existing vetting resources within USAID, the agency, in  consultation with the Coordinating Director for Development and  Economic Affairs for the U.S. Embassy in Kabul, decided that a Kabul- based USAID vetting support unit separate from CENTCOM\u2019s process  would most immediately and effectively meet the agency\u2019s needs.", "USAID officials stated that in preparation for standing up the vetting  support unit, the agency sent representatives from its Office of Security to  observe the CENTCOM vendor vetting cell\u2019s process. According to USAID  officials, after observing the CENTCOM process they concluded that  USAID had the existing resources and ability to similarly vet its  implementing partners within timelines that met the agency\u2019s needs. In  January 2011, USAID issued a cable outlining the initial structure of its  newly created vetting support unit in Afghanistan, and as of March 2011  USAID officials were in the process of drafting standard operating  procedures. According to USAID officials and the January 2011 cable, the  purpose of the vetting support unit is to help ensure that U.S. government  funds do not support malign actors, such as insurgents, corrupt power  brokers, and criminal patronage networks. The unit is to comprise an  intelligence analyst and two or more permanent support staff stationed in  Kabul, who would reach back to existing vetting analysts in USAID\u2019s  Office of Security in Washington, D.C., who would conduct the vetting. As  with the CENTCOM process, the actual vetting would take place in the  United States, while information identifying the prospective non-U.S.  partners would be forwarded from the support unit in Afghanistan to  USAID\u2019s vetting database. If USAID analysts find derogatory information,  the final decision about whether to use the partner would reside with  USAID officials in Afghanistan. Although the vetting unit is currently  situated within the Office of Acquisition and Assistance in Kabul, USAID  officials stated that the responsibilities of the unit are more closely aligned  with security-related functions rather than the formal acquisition process,  and that many details of the unit are still being determined. As of February  2011, USAID officials stated that the vetting support unit is currently  staffed with temporary personnel, and they expect the process of hiring  permanent staff to be complete in 3 to 6 months.", "The USAID vetting process, as it is described by officials and in  preliminary documentation, may have limitations that are similar to those  of CENTCOM. For example, USAID\u2019s January 2011 cable indicates that  there is a $150,000 award threshold for selecting potential implementing  partners to vet, and USAID is still finalizing the extent to which it will vet  subcontractors/subawardees. In addition, according to USAID officials, as  a first step while the unit hires permanent staff, it will focus first on host- nation partners when it plans to begin vetting in April 2011. However,  USAID officials indicated that the agency\u2019s vendor vetting process was still  in the early stages, and it is expected to be an iterative implementation  process\u2014aspects of which could change, such as the vetting threshold and  expanding vetting to other non-U.S. partners. Officials stated that  ultimately, the formalized vetting criteria will likely incorporate the  assessment of other risk factors, such as which province the activity is  located in and local knowledge of USAID officials; however, these criteria  have not yet been included in preliminary documents. In addition, in  March 2011 officials noted that the vetting support unit will vet at least  first-tier potential subcontractors/subawardees that have been identified  as apparent recipients of awards with a value of $150,000 or more, and will  likely go beyond first-tier subcontractors/subawardees for certain awards,  though this has also not been finalized. Further, officials pointed to their  experience developing and implementing USAID\u2019s vetting efforts in the  West Bank and Gaza\u2014which has included trying different monetary  thresholds, as well as vetting contract recipients whose cumulative awards  reach the threshold in order to capture frequently used partners\u2014and  indicated that they expect to include such considerations as they continue  to develop the vetting process. As previously discussed, we have  frequently reported the value of using a risk-based approach to effectively  achieve desired results. Incorporating such an approach into determining  what implementing partners to vet\u2014as USAID officials have indicated will  occur but has not yet been documented\u2014would increase USAID\u2019s ability  to address the greatest risk with existing resources."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "State Has Not Created a Vendor Vetting Process for Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["As of March 2011, State was not vetting vendors in Afghanistan. State  officials told us that currently many of their contracts are awarded to U.S.  prime contractors, and they award relatively few contracts to non-U.S.  vendors. However, table 3 shows that based on our analysis, State does  work with many non-U.S. vendors in Afghanistan, but embassy officials in  Kabul told us that they do not do any vetting or background checks on the  vendors other than for the security risks posed by individual personnel  with physical access to the embassy property or personnel. See table 3 for  a comparison between quantities of awards to U.S. vendors and those to  non-U.S. vendors.", "Further, State has endorsed the Afghan First policy, which will likely  result in increased contracting with Afghan vendors in the future, which  will in turn increase the potential for funds to be diverted to terrorist or  insurgent groups. Given this potential increase in local contracting, and  without a way to consider\u2014after specific vendors are known to be  candidates\u2014the risk posed by funding non-U.S. vendors to perform  particular activities in Afghanistan, the department may increasingly  expose itself to contracting with malign actors.", "While State does not have a vendor vetting program, in 2008 State issued a  cable that applies to both State and USAID, requiring personnel to  complete a terrorist financing risk assessment for any new program or  activity prior to requesting or obligating program funds. Periodic updates  to the risk assessment are also completed for ongoing programs and  activities, though these do not examine vendors against the same  information as the CENTCOM or USAID vetting cells. The risk assessment  is intended to ensure that projects and activities are not providing  benefits, even inadvertently, to terrorists or their supporters, including  people or organizations that are not specifically designated by the U.S.  government as such but that may, nevertheless, be linked to terrorist  activities. This risk assessment weighs the likelihood that a program or  activity will inadvertently be funding or benefiting terrorists against the  consequences of that occurring\u2014a risk that varies greatly depending on  the type and location of the program or activity. USAID and DOD\u2019s vendor  vetting processes are intended to be conducted once a potential vendor for  a specific contract or activity is known in order to determine whether  awarding to a particular entity will increase the likelihood of U.S. funds  being diverted to insurgent or other criminal actors, and additionally use  law enforcement and intelligence information."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "DOD, USAID, and State Have Not Developed a Formal Method of Sharing Vendor Vetting Information in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD, USAID, and State likely utilize many of the same vendors  in Afghanistan, the agencies have not developed a formalized process to  share vendor vetting information. Currently, DOD and USAID officials in  Afghanistan have established informal communication such as biweekly  meetings, ongoing correspondence, and mutual participation in working  groups. Further, DOD and USAID officials said that their vetting efforts are  integrally related and are complementary to the work of the various  interagency task forces, such as Task Force 2010 and the Afghan Threat  Finance Cell, and that their mutual participation in these task forces  contributes to interagency information sharing in general and vetting  results in particular. However, a formal arrangement for sharing  information such as would be included in a standard operating procedure  or memorandum of agreement between DOD and USAID has not been  developed. In addition, though the U.S. Embassy also participates in  various interagency task forces, such as Task Force 2010, there is no  ongoing information sharing of vendor vetting results, either ad hoc or  formal. According to CENTCOM Contracting Command officials, the  command is in the process of developing a standard operating procedure  for sharing the vendor vetting results specifically with USAID, but this  document has not yet been completed.", "Standards for internal control for the federal government highlight the  importance of establishing and documenting communication and  information-sharing capabilities to enable agencies to achieve their goals.", "In addition, prior GAO work has highlighted the importance of interagency  information sharing and collaboration to achieve common outcomes.  USAID and CENTCOM Contracting Command officials stated that  interagency information sharing is active and effective; that ISAF, USFOR- A, and USAID are in constant communication in order to establish a  common picture of ongoing vetting efforts and results; and that officials  have emphasized their strong working relationships. Further, according to  USAID officials, sharing vendor vetting results would greatly assist the  agency\u2019s efforts to ensure that it is not conducting business with known  malign actors in Afghanistan. However, in a workforce environment  characterized by frequent personnel rotations, maintaining continuity of  processes and procedures can be a challenge. Without documented,  formalized procedures, DOD and USAID cannot ensure that their current  information-sharing practices will endure. Further, sharing information on  vetting results could be especially beneficial for State, since it currently  has no plans to perform vetting of the type done by DOD and USAID for  any of its non-U.S. vendors in Afghanistan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In Afghanistan, the use of local vendors by U.S. government agencies such  as DOD, USAID, and State is a key component of the COIN strategy. But  awards to local vendors in Afghanistan pose particular challenges because  of the potential for fraud, corruption, or the siphoning of funds to  organizations hostile to U.S. forces. These concerns highlight the  importance of establishing processes for mitigating the risk that malign  actors could profit from U.S. government contracts. Both CENTCOM  Contracting Command and USAID have established processes to vet non- U.S. vendors in Afghanistan, but these processes are time- and resource-  intensive. Given these restraints, it is not feasible to vet every non-U.S.  vendor that contracts with the U.S. government in Afghanistan, and it is  important that vendors are selected for vetting based on a variety of  factors, including the risk level for the service being provided and the risk  estimate based on the geographic area in which the service is to be  performed. Understanding the capacity and resources available to  CENTCOM Contracting Command is also essential to devising an  appropriate risk-based approach to effectively use the vendor vetting cell  to achieve its goals with existing resources in the short term and  evaluating what resources will be needed to accommodate any further  increase in the workload in the future. Further, as USAID begins to finalize  its vetting process, the consideration of a risk-based approach may help  the agency to address limitations similar to those of the CENTCOM  process. While State has not yet developed a specific vendor vetting  process, given the number of non-U.S. vendors it currently uses, and as it  goes forward with implementing Afghan First, the need to vet these  vendors may become more acute in order to mitigate the risk of  contracting with these vendors. Given the multiagency operational  environment in Afghanistan, it is imperative that U.S. efforts be  coordinated and that information about malign actors be shared among all  contracting parties. This information sharing may be particularly  important for State because it does not currently vet its non-U.S. vendors.  Otherwise, agencies may unknowingly contract with vendors that have  been deemed a risk by other agencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To safeguard U.S. personnel against security risks and help ensure that  resources are not used to support insurgent or criminal groups, we  recommend that the Commander of U.S. Central Command direct  CENTCOM Contracting Command to    consider formalizing a risk-based approach to enable the department to  identify and vet the highest-risk vendors\u2014including those vendors with  contracts below the $100,000 threshold\u2014as well as subcontractors and    work with the vendor vetting cell to clearly identify the resources and  personnel needed to meet the demand for vendor vetting in Afghanistan  using a risk-based approach.", "To help ensure that resources are not used to support terrorist or criminal  groups, we recommend that the Director of the Office of Security and the  USAID Mission Director, Kabul, Afghanistan, consider formalizing a risk- based approach that would enable USAID to identify and vet the highest- risk vendors and partners, including those with contracts below the  $150,000 threshold.", "To help ensure that State resources are not diverted to insurgent or  criminal groups, we recommend that the Secretary of State direct the  appropriate bureau(s) to assess the need and develop possible options to  vet non-U.S. vendors, which could include leveraging existing vendor  vetting processes, such as USAID\u2019s, or developing a unique process.", "To promote interagency collaboration so as to better ensure that vendors  potentially posing a risk to U.S. forces are vetted, we also recommend that  the Commander of U.S. Central Command; USAID Mission Director,  Kabul, Afghanistan; and the Coordinating Director for Development and  Economic Affairs, U.S. Embassy, Kabul, Afghanistan, consider developing  formalized procedures, such as an interagency agreement or memorandum  of agreement, to ensure the continuity of communication of vetting results  and to support intelligence information, so that other contracting activities  may be informed by those results."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to DOD, USAID, and State.
