And, although remaining stocks provide some residual capability, many of the programs face significant inventory shortfalls and in some cases, maintenance problems. For example, the Army has drawn equipment from virtually all of its prepositioned stocks to support operations in Iraq. Some of its storage sites have shortfalls of equipment and sustainment items, like spare parts, and some stocks are in poor condition. Additionally, the Marine Corps has used a significant portion of the stocks downloaded from 5 of its 16 prepositioning ships to support operations in Iraq and it is unclear when this equipment will be refilled. The Air Force is also continuing to use a considerable amount of its prepositioned stocks to support combat operations in Iraq and it is unclear when these stocks will be refilled. The precise operational risk created by these shortfalls is difficult to assess. However, should a new conflict arise in the near term, the combatant commander would likely face difficult operational challenges. The department and the military services have provided insufficient oversight over DOD's prepositioning programs. This inattention has allowed long-standing problems with determining program requirements and managing inventory to persist. DOD has not enforced its directive that could provide centralized oversight over its prepositioning programs. Officials told us they did not enforce this directive because they were able to provide adequate oversight through other mechanisms. Even if the department had enforced its directive, however, the requirements underpinning some of DOD's prepositioning programs are questionable and the services do not have sufficient information on the inventory level and maintenance condition of some prepositioned stocks. Without reliable information on requirements, inventory levels, and maintenance condition, DOD cannot provide sufficient oversight over its programs, which potentially leaves war fighters at risk of not having needed stocks in the future. DOD has not developed a coordinated departmentwide plan or joint doctrine to guide the future of its prepositioning programs, despite the heavy use of prepositioned stocks in recent conflicts and the department's plans to rely on them in the future. DOD's recently published defense strategy indicates that prepositioning programs should be more innovative, flexible, and joint. In the absence of a departmentwide plan or joint doctrine to coordinate the reconstitution and future plans for these programs, the services have been recapitalizing stocks and developing future plans without an understanding of how the programs will fit together to meet the evolving defense strategy. Without a framework that establishes priorities for prepositioning among competing initiatives, DOD cannot provide assurances to Congress that the billions of dollars that will be required to recapitalize the stocks and develop future programs will produce programs that operate jointly, support the needs of the war fighter, and are affordable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["With fewer troops permanently stationed overseas, prepositioned stocks  of equipment and supplies have become an integral part of the Department  of Defense\u2019s (DOD) ability to project forces into conflict areas faster. The  importance of prepositioned stocks to the U.S. military was highlighted  during recent operations in Iraq. The military used equipment and supplies  stored at land sites in the region and offloaded much of the stocks from its  prepositioning ships. Perhaps more importantly, the availability of the  sites gave the United States the facilities it needed to assemble forces for  combat. Recognizing the importance of the department\u2019s prepositioning  programs, Congress has made significant investments in these programs.  In recent years, the services have collectively used over $1 billion each  year to operate and maintain their prepositioning programs; by fiscal year  2005 this amount had declined to about $724 million, since a large portion  of these stocks were used to support military operations in Iraq. However,  billions of dollars in future investments will be needed to recapitalize  equipment and develop future programs. The recently published National  Defense Strategy indicates that prepositioning will continue to be an  important aspect of DOD\u2019s defense posture in the future. The strategy  establishes several goals for the future of these programs, including the  need for the programs to be more flexible and increasingly joint in  character.", "Each of the military services prepositions combat or support equipment  and supplies in order to speed response times of U.S. forces to operating  locations and reduce the strain on scarce airlift or slower sealift assets.  For example, the Army stores sets of combat brigade equipment and  supporting supplies at land sites in several countries and aboard  prepositioning ships in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The Marine Corps  stores equipment and supplies for its forces aboard squadrons of maritime  prepositioning ships located around the world and at land sites in Norway.  The Navy stores equipment and supplies to support ship offloading,  deployable hospitals, and construction projects also aboard the maritime  prepositioning ships and at land sites around the world. The Air Force  stores ammunition at land sites and aboard prepositioning ships and  prepositions base support equipment, vehicles, and supporting supplies at  several land sites.", "In 1998, we reported on problems ranging from poor inventory visibility to  unreliable requirements-setting processes in the Army and Air Force  prepositioning programs. Similar problems were more recently identified  in numerous after-action assessments of the war in Iraq, and we testified  in March 2004 before the Subcommittee about the performance of the  Army and Marine Corps\u2019 prepositioning programs during Operation Iraqi  Freedom. We found that although the programs performed well in  general, some Army units faced equipment shortfalls and there were  instances where certain types of equipment were outdated or did not  match unit needs. We stated that DOD may need to rethink its  prepositioning programs to ensure that they are compatible with overall  transformation goals and the evolving military strategy. Following our  testimony, Congress directed the Secretary of Defense to submit a report  on its prepositioning plans by October 1, 2005. Inventory management  issues, and more recently supply chain management, have been  considered high-risk areas by GAO since 1990. To further assist the  Subcommittee in its oversight, you asked that we assess the status and  plans for DOD\u2019s prepositioning programs in advance of the department\u2019s  report. Specifically, you asked us to review the risks facing the  department\u2019s prepositioning programs, including an assessment of: (1) the  near-term operational risk given the continuing use of these stocks, (2) the  sufficiency of DOD and service-level oversight of these prepositioning  programs, and (3) whether DOD has developed a coordinated plan for the  future of the department\u2019s prepositioning programs that would meet the  goals of the recently published defense strategy.", "To assess the near-term operational risk given the continuing use of  prepositioned stocks, we obtained reports prepared by the military  services on the inventory levels of their prepositioned stocks compared to  program requirements and discussed the potential near-term operational  and long-term program risks associated with inventory shortfalls and  maintenance deficiencies. We visited selected prepositioning sites and  reviewed available maintenance reports or other data used by the services  to measure the condition of the prepositioned stocks. To assess the  sufficiency of DOD and the services\u2019 oversight of these programs, we  discussed the processes used by DOD to oversee its prepositioning  programs with officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Joint Staff, and the military services. To assess whether DOD has  developed a coordinated plan for the future of its prepositioning programs  that would meet the goals of the recently published defense strategy, we  reviewed the recently published National Defense Strategy and discussed  the future direction of the department\u2019s prepositioning programs with  officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the  military services. We also collected and analyzed information from the  military services on the future plans for their prepositioning programs. We  also discussed the time frames and costs needed to repair or replace  prepositioned stocks used in recent military operations. We conducted our  work from July 2004 through May 2005 in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards.

The U.S. military can deliver equipment and supplies in three  ways: by air, by sea, or by prepositioning. While airlift is fast, it is  expensive to use and impractical for moving all of the material needed for  a large-scale deployment. Although ships can carry large loads, they are  slower than airlift. Prepositioning lessens the strain of using expensive  airlift and reduces the reliance on slower sealift deliveries. Concerned  about the reduction in U.S. forces overseas and their ability to move forces  in the time required to resolve potential conflicts quickly, the services have  expanded prepositioning programs ashore and on ships in potential areas  of conflict.", "The military services have prepositioning programs to store combat or  support equipment and supplies near areas with a high potential for  conflict and to speed response times and reduce the strain on other  mobility assets.

For example, the Army used much of  the equipment and supplies associated with the combat brigade sets stored  at land sites in Kuwait and Qatar and aboard prepositioning ships afloat  near Diego Garcia to support operations in Iraq. In addition, the Army  used some equipment from its other prepositioned stocks in Europe,  South Korea, and from other prepositioning ships located near  Guam/Saipan.", "The Army is also reporting low inventory fill for its operational projects  and sustainment stocks. The Army has a total of 14 operational projects  that contain equipment and supplies needed for unique mission  requirements, such as special operations forces, mortuary operations, and  prisoner handling. Sustainment stocks provide replacement equipment  and supplies, such as repair parts, petroleum items, and tracked vehicles,  until normal resupply channels are established. The Army is reporting  inventory fills for operational projects and sustainment stocks\u2014 approximately 26 percent and 20 percent respectively\u2014that are  considerably lower than the program requirements. Some of the Army\u2019s  shortfalls have been long-standing, however, including shortfalls in critical  areas like spare parts, and are not attributable to the war in Iraq.

For example, the Army continues to use equipment  taken from prepositioned stocks to support its units in Iraq, delaying the  reconstitution and redistribution of the equipment. According to Army  officials, this equipment may not be returned to the prepositioned stocks  because the Army is giving priority to transforming its forces into more  deployable and expeditionary brigade-based formations and may use  formerly prepositioned equipment to fill additional equipment  requirements associated with the new formations. Importantly, this heavy  stress on equipment is a problem across much of the Army\u2019s equipment  that has been used in Iraq, not just the equipment taken from  prepositioned stocks.", "We also found that some other prepositioned stocks in storage were in  poor maintenance condition, even though they had not been used in  Operation Iraqi Freedom. For example, during a March 2005 visit to Camp  Carroll, South Korea, we found that some of the Army\u2019s prepositioned  stocks at this location were in poor maintenance condition and that much  of the equipment was overdue for periodic maintenance. Army officials  confirmed that required cyclic maintenance had not been performed on  the equipment in the brigade set, operational projects, and sustainment  stocks for several years. To address this, the Army has stepped up its  maintenance efforts by bringing in contractor support and setting up  temporary maintenance facilities to assist in repairing the equipment to  standard. Moreover, as shown in figure 2, certain stocks were stored  outside and had been for many years and corrosion was evident on some  pieces of equipment. Corrosion can significantly affect the readiness of  prepositioned equipment: DOD spends an estimated $20 billion each year  to repair the damage to military equipment and infrastructure caused by  this problem. In this regard, we have called for improvements to DOD\u2019s  long-term corrosion strategy, including better planning and establishment  of a long-term funding mechanism. Because of continuing concerns over  corrosion, we are currently conducting a congressionally directed review  of its impact on DOD\u2019s overall prepositioned assets.", "The Army also maintains European prepositioning storage sites in  Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.

The mission in Europe has  steadily declined since the European drawdown of the early 1990s, and the  remaining sites are the last remnants of the Army\u2019s large-scale  prepositioning program developed during the Cold War. Army officials  told us that they are currently using the local national workforce at these  locations to perform other maintenance workloads, including fixing  equipment from Iraq. In past reports, we have recommended that the Army  align its workforce and facilities to meet the reduced post-Cold War  mission in Europe. Officials told us that they have reduced infrastructure  in response to our recommendations, and are contemplating further  reductions. In Italy, however, the Army has requested about $55 million to  construct new storage and maintenance facilities that it has said will  become the centerpiece of its land prepositioning in the region.

These bladders are used to store fuel for Air Force aircraft at  austere operating locations. Air Force officials stated that to support  combat operations in Iraq, Central Command, Air Forces, has used a  considerable number of its prepositioned war reserve fuel bladders. As  combat operations continue, the Air Force is depleting its supply of these  bladders, and officials have characterized the impact of potential shortfalls  in these bladders as its \u201chighest operational risk.\u201d At the same time, the Air  Force is undergoing an initiative to modernize its fuel support equipment,  including its fuel bladders. As part of this initiative, the Air Force  requested that Central Command, Air Forces, officials not purchase the  type of fuel bladders that had previously been used.

Air Force maintenance personnel are  responsible for the war reserve stocks prepositioned at this location as an  additional duty to the maintenance of operating stocks also stored at the  base. The official told us that the quality of maintenance performed by Air  Force personnel on the war reserve bare base sets has been a long- standing problem at this location. Air Force officials told us that bare base  sets stored in Southwest Asia and South Korea did not have these same  maintenance problems because contractors have been hired to maintain  these sets.", "When we discussed these issues with Air Force officials, they told us that  they believed they could overcome shortfalls and any maintenance  problems in the event of a conflict by using supplemental funding or cross- leveling equipment from other theaters.

Prior to the onset of combat  operations in Iraq, the Army had significant shortages in its prepositioned  stocks, especially in spare parts. The Army overcame these shortfalls by  having the units that were drawing the prepositioned stocks bring their  own spare parts, in addition to obtaining spare parts from nondeploying  units. However, according to the Army\u2019s after-action assessments of the  war, the Army had shortages in these and other items, including food,  water, fuel, construction materials, and ammunition. The available stocks  of these supplies were insufficient to meet sustainment requirements at  the outset of the deployment and it took the supply chain months to  respond. At the time of our work, we found that many of the same  shortfalls that existed in the Army\u2019s program are still evident, and may be  getting worse. For example, as of mid-March 2005, the Army had only 21  percent of its authorized prepositioned repair parts on hand in South  Korea.

This is  because the Marine Corps has kept about two-thirds of its prepositioned  combat capability available for potential contingencies and that equipment  is reported to be in good condition. Moreover, Air Force officials stated  that if a conflict arises, they will be able to fill shortfalls and repair  equipment as needed by using supplemental funding and obtaining some  vehicles and other stocks in other countries through contracts already in  place.

While the Army is  planning on recalculating these requirements by the end of 2005, it is  currently unclear what the requirements for these stocks should be. As a  result, program managers cannot be sure what to buy because they do not  know if inventory shortfalls are valid. We reported on the operational  impacts of this problem in our March 2004 testimony on prepositioned  stocks used during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Additionally, in our April  2005 report, we found that because the process used to determine  requirements for Army war reserve spare parts had not been updated, the  war reserve inventories for some spare parts were inadequate in Operation  Iraqi Freedom and could not meet initial wartime demands. In addition,  inaccurate and inadequately funded Army war reserve requirements  contributed to shortages in other items, such as track shoes for Abrams  tanks and Bradley Fighting Vehicles and lithium batteries.", "Additionally, we identified problems with DOD\u2019s process for establishing  requirements for prepositioned munitions. For example, during our visit to  U.S. Forces Korea, officials told us that the command is not afforded the  opportunity to proactively participate in the determination of either total  munitions requirements or, more specifically, prepositioned munitions  requirements. In October 2002, we reported that DOD\u2019s munitions  requirements determination process did not fully consider the combatant  commander\u2019s preferences for munitions and weapon systems that will be  used against targets identified in projected scenarios. We recommended  that the Secretary of Defense establish a direct link between the munitions  needs of the combatant commands and the munitions requirements  determinations and purchasing decisions made by the military services. In  October 2003, DOD issued instruction 3000.4, which required that the  munitions requirements developed by each of the military services address  the operational objectives of the combatant commanders against potential  threats. In addition, it directed the military services to work directly with  the military service component and the combatant commands to develop  near- and out-year munitions requirements. Finally, it directed combatant  commanders to review the military services\u2019 generated munitions  requirements and report any issues needing resolution during the planning  and programming process. We found that these requirements are not being  met. Only the Air Force visits the command prior to developing total  munitions requirements to support purchasing decisions. The other  services do not coordinate with the command prior to generating  munitions requirements. Further, U.S. Forces, Korea, officials told us that  they do not have the opportunity to review the service-generated  munitions requirements prior to purchasing decisions and have no input to  what munitions will be prepositioned or where those munitions will be  located. While officials in the Office of the Secretary of Defense and Joint  Staff expressed skepticism about the way U.S. Forces, Korea, had  developed their munitions requirements, they agreed that the proper  coordination was not occurring.

Our 1998 report also noted  that it was difficult for DOD to assess the readiness of its prepositioned  stocks and the impact of any shortfalls due to the poor information the  services used to manage these programs.

For example, the Army Materiel  Command reported in 2003 that the requirements computation for war  reserve stocks and stockage lists for prepositioned stocks did not  accurately portray what was needed for Operation Iraqi Freedom. These  stockage lists did not contain the most critical items needed to sustain  combat equipment during the operation. In addition, the Army Audit  Agency reported in 2004 that Army program managers had not reviewed  the requirements for many of the operational projects it examined. As a  result, some operational projects contained inaccurate, overstated, or  questionable requirements. Of $1.5 billion in requirements examined,  about $727 million were valid, $472 million were invalid, and about $280  million were questionable. In addition, the Air Force Audit Agency  reported in May 2003 that Air Force personnel did not properly segregate  certain war reserve requirements from peacetime operating spare parts  requirements, resulting in more than $118.8 million of overstated  requirements for peacetime.", "Past reports have also revealed problems with the reliability of inventory  information.

More recently, the Army Materiel Command\u2019s 2003 report on  lessons learned in Iraq also found that different automated systems  provided different inventory levels at the same storage location during  operations in Iraq. Similarly, a June 2004 CNA Corporation after-action  report on the Marine Corps\u2019 prepositioning program in Operation Iraqi  Freedom found that the Marine Corps did not have reliable information on  the status of some prepositioned equipment used to support operations in  Iraq. Specifically, due to a lack of automated tracking systems, the Marine  Corps had to use manual methods for tracking equipment with hand  counts and written reports.

DOD officials told us that  the future of its prepositioning programs has not yet been determined, in  part because the future is dependent on the outcome of several  interrelated studies ongoing within the department. For example, DOD is  currently reviewing the mobility capabilities required to meet the full  range of mobility needs for all aspects of the national defense strategy.  According to DOD officials, the recommendations from this study will  likely have a significant impact on the services\u2019 prepositioning programs  since requirements for prepositioning are being factored into the mobility  deliberations. In addition, in March 2003, the Secretary of Defense  requested that the department develop a comprehensive and integrated  presence and basing strategy for the next 10 years. This strategy will build  upon multiple DOD studies and will use information from the combatant  commanders to determine the appropriate location of the basing and  associated infrastructure necessary to execute the U.S. defense strategy.

Although  some preliminary results have been released, DOD officials stated that  once these studies are completed, they will have a better understanding of  how prepositioning will be able to support the war fighter.", "Similarly, DOD has not developed joint doctrine to guide the planning and  employment of its prepositioning programs. DOD defines joint doctrine as  the fundamental military principles that guide the employment of forces of  two or more services in coordinated action toward a common objective.  DOD\u2019s transformation guidance states that part of the department\u2019s  transformation efforts is developing concepts to operate in a joint  environment, and placing a continuing emphasis on the importance of  expeditionary operations. DOD has published joint doctrine in a number  of areas, including deployment and redeployment operations,  multinational operations, and military operations other than war.  However, in the absence of a departmentwide plan and joint doctrine for  prepositioning, the military services currently plan and implement  separate programs in an independent, service-centric manner. A service- centric approach to prepositioning potentially misses opportunities to  achieve greater efficiencies where service programs overlap. In a 2003  Joint Staff-sponsored study on strategies for prepositioning, the Logistics  Management Institute found that the military services continue to program  for prepositioning materiel to meet individual service rather than joint  requirements. As a result, the services may overstate operational  requirements and put unnecessary burdens on limited transportation  assets that would be required to move these prepositioned assets from  their storage locations to the operational sites. For example, although the  Army and Air Force have separate bare base programs, there is a lack of  commonality among the design and components of these programs even  though basic capabilities are the same. Moreover, this service-centric  approach to prepositioning is out of step with DOD\u2019s transformation  guidance, which states that developing concepts to operate in a joint  environment and a continuing emphasis on the importance of  expeditionary operations is key to the department\u2019s transformation  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Reconstitution Likely to Be Delayed Due to Ongoing Operations, but Delay Offers DOD Opportunities to Set Clear Direction for Programs", "paragraphs": ["Clearly prepositioning figures prominently in the department\u2019s future  plans, but the services do not have precise estimates of the costs and time  required to reconstitute their prepositioned stocks since the services  continue to use these stocks in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Furthermore, Army officials told us that decisions have  not been made as to whether the sustainment and operational project  stocks will be reconstituted because of the large investments required and  the uncertainty of the future plans for the Army\u2019s prepositioning program.  DOD\u2019s recent report to Congress estimates the costs to reset and  reconfigure the Army\u2019s prepositioned stocks to be more than $4 billion.

In the past year, the Marine Corps considered its  options to reconstitute the equipment stored aboard the prepositioning  ships given its continuing commitment to support operations in Iraq. The  Marine Corps recently decided to partially refill the five ships offloaded to  support operations in Iraq; however, due to the limited availability within  the Marine Corps of equipment needed, such as heavy cargo trucks and  High Mobility Multi-purpose Wheeled Vehicles, the Marine Corps forecasts  that these ships will have major end-item fill rates of less than 50 percent.

We also observed the physical condition of  materiel stored by the Marine Corps at its prepositioning locations in  Norway and aboard a prepositioning ship at its maintenance facility  located at Blount Island, Florida; and observed the maintenance condition  of the Army\u2019s prepositioned stocks at Camp Carroll, South Korea and  Sagami Army Depot, Japan. We interviewed program managers at each of  the military services to determine the impact of reported shortfalls and  poor maintenance condition in the prepositioned stocks and discussed the  time frames and costs needed to repair or replace prepositioned stocks  used in recent military operations.", "To assess the sufficiency of the Department of Defense\u2019s (DOD) and  service-level oversight of these prepositioning programs, we discussed the  processes used by DOD and the services to oversee their prepositioning  programs with officials from the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the  Joint Staff, and the military services. We reviewed relevant DOD directives  and readiness reports prepared by the services and the Joint Staff to  determine the extent to which the information contained in these reports  could be used by DOD or the services to provide oversight. We also  reviewed past reports prepared by GAO, the Army Audit Agency, the Air  Force Audit Agency, the Army Materiel Command Inspector General, and  the CNA Corporation that identified problems with the reliability of data  regarding the preparedness of the services\u2019 prepositioned stocks and  problems with the requirements determination processes for some of  these stocks. We discussed issues regarding the sufficiency of data on the  preparedness of DOD\u2019s prepositioned stocks with program managers from  each of the services.", "To assess whether DOD has developed a coordinated plan for the future of  its prepositioning programs that would meet the goals of the recently  published defense strategy, we collected and analyzed information from  the military services and the Defense Logistics Agency on the future plans  for their prepositioning programs. We also reviewed the recently  published National Defense Strategy and discussed the future direction of  the department\u2019s prepositioning programs with officials in the Office of the  Secretary of Defense, the Joint Staff, and the military services.", "We conducted our review from July 2004 through May 2005 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards.
