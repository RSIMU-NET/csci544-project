According to the latest data available from HUD, FHA insures mortgage loans for about 15,800 multifamily properties. These properties contain just under 2 million units and have a combined unpaid mortgage principal balance of $46.9 billion.These properties include multifamily apartments and other specialized properties, such as nursing homes, hospitals, student housing, and condominiums.", "HUD\u2019s Section 8 program provides rental subsidies for low-income families. These subsidies are linked either to multifamily apartment units (project-based) or to individuals (tenant-based). According to HUD\u2019s latest available data, about 1.4 million units at about 20,400 multifamily properties receive Section 8 project-based subsidies. Under the Section 8 program, residents in subsidized units generally pay 30 percent of their income for rent and HUD pays the balance. According to HUD\u2019s data, monthly Section 8 payments to HUD-insured properties average about $300 to $500 per unit."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Insured Section 8 Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["According to HUD, its restructuring proposals apply to 8,636 properties that both have mortgages insured by FHA and receive project-based Section 8 rental subsidies for some or all of their units.

Data provided by HUD show that, together, these properties contain 859,000 units and have unpaid principal balances totaling $17.8 billion.", "For various reasons, HUD chose to exclude from its restructuring proposals properties with project-based Section 8 assistance that are insured under its \u201cmoderate rehabilitation\u201d program. HUD estimates that about 167 properties containing about 16,800 units are insured under this program. Figure 1.1 shows how the insured Section 8 portfolio fits into HUD\u2019s overall multifamily housing portfolio.", "Excludes properties with HUD-held mortgages.", "Excludes 167 properties and about 16,800 units with project-based assistance provided under the Section 8 \u201cmoderate rehabilitation\u201d program.", "According to HUD\u2019s data, about 45 percent of the insured Section 8 portfolio (3,859 properties) consists of \u201colder assisted\u201d properties. These were constructed beginning in the late 1960s under a variety of mortgage subsidy programs, to which project-based Section 8 assistance (Loan Management Set-Aside) was added later, beginning in the 1970s, to replace other subsidies and to help troubled properties sustain operations. About 55 percent of the insured Section 8 portfolio (4,777 properties) consists of \u201cnewer assisted\u201d properties. These were built after 1974 under HUD\u2019s Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation programs and received project-based Section 8 subsidies calculated on the basis of formulas with automatic annual adjustments, which, according to HUD, tended to be relatively generous to encourage the production of affordable housing.

According to the available data from HUD, contracts covering about 69 percent of the project-based Section 8 units in the insured Section 8 portfolio will expire by the end of the year 2000 and contracts covering about 98 percent of the units will expire by the end of the year 2006. (See fig. 1.3.) In the early 1990s, most expiring contracts were renewed for 5-year periods, but the terms of Section 8 contracts have been gradually shortened since then. To improve its budgeting for contract renewals, HUD proposes to renew all contracts for 1-year terms, beginning in fiscal year 1997."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Problems Affecting the Insured Section 8 Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["The insured Section 8 portfolio suffers from three basic problems\u2014high subsidy costs; high exposure to insurance loss; and, in the case of some properties, poor physical condition.", "A substantial number of properties in the insured Section 8 portfolio now receive subsidized rents above market levels. Many of these rents substantially exceed the rents charged for comparable unsubsidized units. This problem is most prevalent in (but not confined to) the newer assisted segment of the portfolio, where it stems from the design of the Section 8 New Construction and Substantial Rehabilitation programs. The government originally paid to develop these properties under the two Section 8 programs by establishing rents above market levels and then raising them regularly through the application of set formulas that, according to HUD, tended to be generous to encourage the production of new affordable housing.", "The high cost of Section 8 subsidies is reflected in the cost of renewing the existing project-based contracts for the properties in the insured Section 8 portfolio as they expire. HUD is requesting $863 million in budget authority for fiscal year 1997 to renew expiring contracts covering almost 293,000 insured Section 8 units. As its long-term Section 8 contracts expire and its 1-year contracts are renewed annually, HUD estimates that its annual renewal costs will increase steadily in each of the following 9 fiscal years, resulting in an estimated annual renewal cost of about $6.7 billion by the year 2006 and a 10-year cumulative renewal cost approaching $45 billion.", "A second key problem affecting the insured Section 8 portfolio is the high risk of insurance loss. Under FHA\u2019s insurance program, HUD bears virtually all the risk in the event of a loan default. According to a recent HUD-contracted study of the Department\u2019s capacity to manage the assisted multifamily portfolio\u2019s financial risk, HUD\u2019s multifamily insurance program depends upon the actions of private parties whose share in the risk and stake in the properties\u2019 financial success may be limited. The study points out that instead of bearing the financial risk of default, private lenders may have a more limited stake in the continuation of mortgages through their servicing rights. Rather than having substantial equity invested in the properties, the owners may possess indirect interests that are hard for HUD to evaluate. Borrowers are often structured into partnerships in which the general partners, who are responsible for the properties\u2019 day-to-day management, may have interests in property management fees through affiliated firms.", "HUD\u2019s fiscal year 1994 loan loss reserve analysis evaluated the risk of default and insurance loss for a sample of multifamily properties on the basis of a set of financial, physical, and management data. The properties were categorized as excellent, good, standard, substandard, or doubtful, and degrees of risk were assigned on the basis of these categories. According to the analysis, 48 percent of the older assisted properties and 20 percent of the newer assisted properties had a medium to high risk of default. This risk could increase substantially if the properties\u2019 Section 8 contracts are not renewed or are renewed at substantially lower levels.", "Poor physical condition is a third key problem affecting many properties in the insured Section 8 portfolio. A 1993 study of multifamily rental properties with FHA-insured or HUD-held mortgages found that almost one-fourth of the properties were \u201cdistressed.\u201d The properties were considered to be distressed if they failed to provide sound housing and lacked the resources to correct their deficiencies or if they were likely to fail financially."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Principal Causes of the Problems", "paragraphs": ["The problems affecting HUD\u2019s insured Section 8 portfolio have several causes. These include (1) program design flaws that have contributed to high subsidies in the Section 8 program and have put virtually all the risk on HUD in the insurance program; (2) HUD\u2019s dual role as both the mortgage insurer and the rental subsidy provider, which has resulted in the federal government\u2019s averting claims against FHA\u2019s insurance fund by supporting a subsidy and regulatory structure that has masked the true market value of the properties; and (3) weaknesses in HUD\u2019s oversight and management of the insured portfolio, which have allowed physical and financial problems at a number of HUD-insured multifamily properties to go undetected or uncorrected. According to a September 1995 paper prepared by the Affordable Housing Preservation Tax Policy Group, a related problem is that the limited-partner investors in many of the properties no longer have an economic incentive to invest, or an interest in investing, additional capital to pay for improvements, such as new roofs, boilers, and updated appliances, which many properties are now starting to need."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "HUD\u2019s Proposals to Address Problems With the Insured Section 8 Portfolio", "paragraphs": ["In May 1995, HUD proposed to address the key problems affecting the insured Section 8 portfolio through a process that it called \u201cmark-to-market.\u201d The principal steps in this process were to reset rents to market levels and reduce mortgage debt if necessary to permit a positive cash flow, terminate FHA\u2019s mortgage insurance, and replace project-based Section 8 subsidies with portable tenant-based subsidies.", "The basic idea behind HUD\u2019s mark-to-market proposal was to address the three key problems and their causes by decoupling HUD\u2019s mortgage insurance and project-based rental subsidies and subjecting the properties to the forces and disciplines of the commercial market. HUD originally proposed to do this by (1) eliminating project-based Section 8 subsidies as existing contracts expired (or sooner if the owners agreed), (2) allowing owners to rent their apartments for whatever amounts the marketplace would bear, (3) facilitating the refinancing of FHA-insured mortgages with smaller mortgages if needed for the properties to operate at the new rents, (4) terminating FHA\u2019s insurance on the mortgages, and (5) providing the residents of assisted units with portable Section 8 rental subsidies that they could use to either stay in their current apartment or move to another one in accordance with their wishes or financial needs.", "HUD recognized that many owners could not cover their expenses and might eventually default on their mortgages if their properties were forced to compete in the commercial marketplace without their project-based Section 8 subsidies. The mark-to-market proposal therefore included several alternatives for restructuring the program\u2019s FHA-insured mortgages to bring properties\u2019 income and expenses into line. These alternatives included selling the mortgages, engaging third parties to work out restructuring arrangements, and paying full or partial FHA insurance claims to lenders to reduce the mortgage debt and monthly payments. Each of these alternatives would likely expose HUD to claims against FHA\u2019s insurance fund, but HUD estimated that over the long term this approach would cost the government less than maintaining the status quo.", "The proposed mark-to-market process would likely affect properties differently, depending on whether their existing rents were higher or lower than market rents and whether they needed funding for capital items, such as deferred maintenance. If the existing rents exceeded market value, the process would lower the mortgage debt, thereby allowing the property to operate and compete effectively at lower market rents. If the existing rents were below market value, the process would allow the owner to increase the rents, potentially providing more money to improve and maintain the property. HUD recognized, however, that some properties would not be able to generate enough income to cover their expenses even if their mortgage payments were reduced to zero. In these cases, HUD proposed using alternative strategies, including demolishing the property and subsequently selling the land to a third party, such as a nonprofit organization or government entity.", "Although both the Senate and the House held hearings on the mark-to-market proposal, no consensus was reached as to whether it or some other approach should be adopted. No action was taken, in part because reliable information was not available on the properties and their surrounding commercial rental markets. Potential stakeholders raised questions about the proposal that could not be answered, including the following: (1) What are the physical and financial conditions of the properties that make up the insured Section 8 portfolio? (2) What different effects would the proposal have at different types of properties? (3) Would the government realize net savings or incur additional costs in the long run? (4) To what extent would low-income residents be displaced or have to pay higher rents? (5) To what extent could such residents find suitable and affordable alternative housing if they chose to or had to? (6) To what extent would possible income tax consequences and other negative effects on owners cause them to oppose the proposal and hamper HUD\u2019s efforts to implement it? and (7) To what extent would owners with substantial time left on their Section 8 contracts disinvest and let their properties deteriorate? Without this information, it was difficult to predict the overall effects of HUD\u2019s mark-to-market proposal on the properties, their owners, the residents, and the federal government. HUD contracted with Ernst & Young LLP in 1995 to obtain up-to-date information on market rents and the physical condition of properties in the insured Section 8 portfolio, develop a financial model to show how HUD\u2019s proposal would affect the properties, and estimate the subsidy and insurance claims costs associated with the proposal. (See ch. 2 for our analysis of Ernst & Young\u2019s study.)", "In April 1996, before Ernst & Young completed its study, HUD modified the original mark-to-market proposal in several ways in response to concerns raised by industry officials and resident groups about various issues, such as the elimination of project-based subsidies and the termination of FHA insurance, and changed the name of the process from mark-to-market to portfolio reengineering. HUD left the basic thrust of the original proposal intact but made several key changes. These included (1) giving priority attention for at least the first 2 years to properties with subsidized above-market rents while continuing to discuss approaches with stakeholders for solving capital needs at properties with expiring contracts and subsidized below-market rents; (2) allowing state and local governments to decide whether to continue Section 8 project-based rental subsidies at individual properties after their mortgages are restructured or switch to tenant-based assistance; and (3) allowing owners to apply for FHA insurance on the newly restructured mortgage loans. HUD\u2019s portfolio reengineering proposal further differed from the original mark-to-market proposal in that it (1) put more emphasis on proactively using third parties to restructure and resolve problems with mortgages before properties\u2019 project-based Section 8 contracts expire; (2) better protected current residents from displacement by providing those in assisted apartment units with \u201cenhanced vouchers\u201d that would pay the difference between 30 percent of their income and the market rent for their building (even if that rent exceeded the normal Section 8 limits) and by providing rental assistance to currently unassisted residents if restructuring increased their rent to more than 30 percent of their income; and (3) reflected HUD\u2019s willingness to work with the Congress on developing mechanisms to take into account the tax consequences to the owners of properties whose mortgage debt would be forgiven as part of the restructuring process. More recently, HUD has also proposed deferring action on properties that would not be able to generate enough income to cover their operating expenses after reengineering until strategies have been developed to address the needs of their residents and of the communities in which the properties are located."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Objectives, Scope, and Methodology", "paragraphs": ["To assist the Congress in evaluating HUD\u2019s proposal for reengineering the insured Section 8 multifamily housing portfolio, we examined the (1) problems affecting the properties in the portfolio and HUD\u2019s proposals for addressing them; (2) results and reasonableness of a HUD-contracted study carried out by Ernst & Young LLP that assesses, on the basis of a national sample of 558 randomly selected properties, the effects of HUD\u2019s proposal on the portfolio; and (3) key issues facing the Congress in assessing HUD\u2019s proposal.

We also reviewed HUD documents discussing the Department\u2019s mark-to-market and portfolio reengineering proposals, as well as comments on the proposals provided by groups representing the multifamily housing industry and residents. We also discussed the proposals with HUD and industry officials and participated in four forums that HUD held in early 1996 to discuss problems pertaining to the insured Section 8 properties and options for addressing them.", "To evaluate the results and reasonableness of Ernst & Young\u2019s study, we were briefed by staff from Ernst & Young and HUD on the approaches that Ernst & Young planned to use to carry out its study and on the actual methods used. The briefings included discussions about Ernst & Young\u2019s sampling and statistical methods, market surveys for estimating the market rents for the insured Section 8 properties, site inspections for estimating the properties\u2019 deferred maintenance and capital needs, and the financial model for determining the effect of portfolio reengineering on the properties and estimating the costs and savings associated with reengineering.", "We reviewed selected aspects of Ernst & Young\u2019s sampling and statistical methodology. For example, we reviewed the computer programs that Ernst & Young used to select sample projects and reviewed the statistical methods that the firm planned to use to estimate population totals from the sample. We also reviewed the presentation of information derived from the sample in Ernst & Young\u2019s May 2, 1996, report.", "When data are missing for sampled projects, a potential exists for the results of the sample to create a biased representation of the entire population of projects. In addition, assigning values on the basis of the observed sample mean can cause the sampling errors to be somewhat understated. We checked the completeness of the data collected for Ernst & Young\u2019s sampled projects. Only one project subject to portfolio reengineering was excluded from the study. For the 558 projects included in the study, the data collection was generally complete. About 85 percent of the projects in the final sample had complete data. For the remaining projects, one or more of the following were missing: (1) data from financial statements, (2) data on tenants\u2019 payments, and (3) data on deferred maintenance. Tenant payment data were missing most frequently\u2014about 12 percent of the time. Financial statement data and deferred maintenance data were missing no more than 3 percent of the time. When data were missing for a project, Ernst & Young assigned a value to it based on the average of the known sample properties or industry standards. (The overall reasonableness of Ernst & Young\u2019s study is discussed in ch. 2.)", "To evaluate Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates of market rents, we reviewed the firm\u2019s methodology for performing market surveys and, as discussed in greater detail below, contracted with three licensed real estate appraisal firms to estimate the market rents for 10 properties in Ernst & Young\u2019s sample.", "To assess Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates of deferred maintenance needs and capital costs, we met with Ernst & Young officials to understand the firm\u2019s methodology and underlying assumptions. We also obtained and analyzed related data collection documents used in the firm\u2019s study, including the instructions to those conducting on-site property inspections and the completed inspection forms and supporting documentation for the 10 properties independently assessed by the contract appraisers. We also discussed Ernst & Young\u2019s methodology with industry representatives and provided Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates for the 10 properties to the respective owners and managers and to the contract appraisers. We asked those who reviewed Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates to comment on the reasonableness and accuracy of the estimates; to state whether they generally agreed or disagreed with the estimates; and if they disagreed with an estimate, to provide specific information on the adjustments needed and the reasons for the adjustments.", "To review Ernst & Young\u2019s financial model for assessing the effects of portfolio reengineering on the sample properties, we obtained a copy of the model and discussed the assumptions used in it with Ernst & Young staff. Because the model contains hundreds of data fields, formulas, and assumptions, we did not attempt to examine every data element or verify every formula or calculation. Rather, we focused on assessing the structure of the model and reviewed its key data elements and the logic of what we considered to be its major assumptions. We also discussed the financing and operating assumptions used in the model with officials of various organizations that have expertise in underwriting and/or servicing mortgages on multifamily housing properties (including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the Reilly Mortgage Group, and GMAC Commercial Mortgage Corporation). Our assessment of the model is discussed in chapter 2. As discussed in chapter 2, we used information obtained from these experts to perform sensitivity analyses that assess the effects of changes in the assumptions on the model\u2019s results. We also used data from Ernst & Young\u2019s sample to estimate certain costs. These estimates apply to the 8,363 projects from which the sample was drawn. Had we made estimates for the number of properties that Ernst & Young assumed to be affected by portfolio reengineering (8,563 properties), our estimates of the totals would have been about 2 percent higher. As discussed earlier, HUD now believes that 8,636 properties would be affected by its proposal.", "We did not verify the accuracy of the data that Ernst & Young derived from HUD\u2019s data systems for use in its study except for certain data pertaining to the 10 case study properties. We found that the final data used in Ernst & Young\u2019s study for these properties were generally consistent with the data we obtained. HUD\u2019s OIG conducted a more detailed assessment of the data that Ernst & Young derived from HUD\u2019s information systems. The OIG tested 69 of the 189 data elements that Ernst & Young used for 56 projects. The OIG found differences between the data it obtained and the data Ernst & Young used for 423 of the 3,864 data elements it reviewed, 114 of which the OIG determined to be significant. The OIG shared the results of its analysis with Ernst & Young and HUD. Ernst & Young officials informed us that they had used the OIG\u2019s results to improve the study\u2019s data.", "We provided comments to HUD and Ernst & Young about issues that arose throughout the study\u2019s design and implementation.

We selected these properties judgmentally from a list of properties in Ernst & Young\u2019s sample. The 10 properties are not statistically representative of the properties in either HUD\u2019s insured Section 8 housing portfolio or Ernst & Young\u2019s sample. We selected the 10 properties to reflect differences in geographical location (they are located in six states and the District of Columbia), assisted rent levels, and physical condition (as indicated in physical inspection reports from HUD).

We also obtained data on the properties\u2019 characteristics from HUD\u2019s field office and property records. We provided the basic data we obtained on each property to the property owner or manager for review and verification. To develop estimates of the market rents that the properties could command and assessments of the effects that portfolio reengineering would have on the properties, we contracted for the services of three licensed real estate appraisal firms with experience in assessing properties insured or assisted by HUD: Goyette Roark Appraisal Services; Maiden, Haase & Smith, Ltd.; and Miller Appraisal Review.

Ernst & Young\u2019s study indicates that for most of the properties subject to portfolio reengineering, the assisted rents are greater than the estimated market rents. In addition, according to the study, the properties have significant amounts of immediate deferred maintenance and short-term and long-term capital needs. The study further indicates that about 80 percent of the properties would need to have their debt reduced in order to continue operations after reengineering. For approximately 22 to 29 percent of the properties, writing down the existing debt to zero would not reduce their costs enough for them to cover their operating expenses and/or address their deferred maintenance and capital needs. Ernst & Young\u2019s report does not present information gathered during the study on the costs of portfolio reengineering to the government\u2014that is, on how the costs of providing Section 8 assistance would change and what the likely claims against FHA\u2019s insurance fund would be. Our analysis of these data indicates that although the costs of Section 8 assistance would eventually be lower under portfolio reengineering than under the current renewal policies, little or no Section 8 savings would be achieved over the next 10 years if all Section 8 properties were reengineered when their current Section 8 contracts expire. Furthermore, Ernst & Young\u2019s data indicate that the cost of insurance claims associated with the reengineering proposal during the 10-year period would amount to between $6 billion and $7 billion.", "Ernst & Young\u2019s financial model provides a reasonable framework for projecting the overall results of portfolio reengineering, such as the number of properties that would need to have their debt reduced. Furthermore, we did not identify any substantive problems with the model\u2019s sampling and statistical methodology. However, some assumptions used in the financial model may not reflect the way in which insured Section 8 properties would actually be affected by portfolio reengineering. In addition, our comparison of Ernst & Young\u2019s data with the information we gathered on our 10 case-study properties raises questions about one key data element\u2014the estimated costs of deferred maintenance and capital needs. Specifically, the owners or managers of the 10 properties and the independent appraisers we retained questioned the model\u2019s cost estimates for deferred maintenance at the properties, generally indicating that the estimates were too high.", "To assess the extent to which the use of different assumptions would affect the results of Ernst & Young\u2019s study, we performed sensitivity analyses of Ernst & Young\u2019s model using two sets of revised assumptions that we developed through our discussions with multifamily housing industry officials. One scenario reflects assumptions that are more optimistic in terms of the cost to the government of portfolio reengineering. The other uses assumptions that are more conservative or pessimistic.

In these cases, Ernst & Young assumed that because the neighborhoods were essentially maintained by non-market-driven forces, there were no markets for unassisted rents other than those controlled by the local housing authorities. Thus, Ernst & Young based its estimates of market rents on the rents subsidized by the local housing authorities. In contrast, the appraisers believed that there were comparable properties that could be used to estimate market rents for the two properties.", "While Ernst & Young and the contract appraisers arrived at generally consistent estimates of market rents for the 10 case study properties, they developed widely differing estimates of the properties\u2019 capital needs. In general, Ernst & Young projected significantly higher costs. These differences occurred, in part, because Ernst & Young and the contract appraisers used different approaches for assessing capital needs.", "Ernst & Young retained a firm to conduct engineering studies at the properties. As discussed earlier, Ernst & Young\u2019s assessment of a property\u2019s capital needs included three components: the immediate deferred maintenance, short-term capital backlog, and long-term capital backlog. In the model, Ernst & Young assumed that funding would be provided to cover the immediate deferred maintenance and short-term capital needs at the time the property was reengineered (up to a full write-down of the property\u2019s mortgage). The short-term capital needs cover the \u201cestimated expired costs\u201d rather than the full replacement costs of the items with remaining useful lives of 5 years or less. For example, a $15,000 roof with an original useful life of 15 years would, when it was 11 years old, have estimated expired costs of $11,000, which would be included in the property\u2019s short-term capital backlog. The additional funding needed to replace the roof in 4 years would be funded by annual replacement reserves factored into the property\u2019s annual cash flows. Thus, the reserves cover part of the short-term capital backlog and the replacement of systems and components that have remaining useful lives of more than 5 years. Ernst & Young\u2019s approach for estimating capital needs involved reviewing a property\u2019s major subsystems and unit components and then estimating, for each, the original useful life, remaining useful life, replacement cost, and need for repairs or replacement. This information was used to calculate the property\u2019s immediate deferred maintenance needs and short-term capital backlog. According to Ernst & Young, the estimates included in the study represent the (1) costs for items that require immediate attention, (2) costs for items that may still be operable but have outlasted their planned useful life,and (3) expired costs (depreciation) for items that are expected to need replacement in the next 5 years.", "In general, the contract appraisers based their estimate of a property\u2019s capital needs on their assessment of the repairs and renovations required for the property to operate as a market-rate property after reengineering. This approach relies primarily on an evaluation of the property relative to others in the same market, whereas Ernst & Young\u2019s approach depends, in part, on useful-life standards. The appraisers based their assessment on their review of the property\u2019s previous physical inspections and on their own physical inspection. The appraisers were not, however, tasked with performing engineering studies.", "Because of these methodological differences, direct comparisons of Ernst & Young\u2019s and the appraisers\u2019 estimates are difficult. In our view, the most comparable estimates are for immediate deferred maintenance needs; these estimates for 10 properties appear in table 2.5. Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates are taken from the firm\u2019s May 2, 1996, report.", "In commenting on this comparison, Ernst & Young officials indicated that their firm\u2019s estimates of deferred maintenance needs are likely to be higher than those of the contract appraisers because they include costs not only for the major subsystems and components that need major repair or are in poor condition but also for items such as appliances and heating and air-conditioning systems that are still functioning but have outlasted their useful life. Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates assumed that investors or lenders would want to replace such items. To demonstrate the effect of this assumption on their firm\u2019s estimates of deferred maintenance needs, Ernst & Young officials provided us with an analysis showing how the exclusion of such items would change the estimates. This additional information showed that using useful-life standards generally resulted in higher cost estimates than using, as the contract appraisers did, the actual condition of systems and components and comparisons of the appraised property with other properties in the local real estate market.", "Table 2.6 adjusts Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates for the 10 properties\u2019 immediate deferred maintenance needs, eliminating the global assumption that items exceeding their estimated useful life would be replaced. This adjustment reduced Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates, in some cases substantially. For example, the estimate for Murdock Terrace in Dallas, Texas, was adjusted from $5.7 million to $2.1 million when the replacement costs for items that were still operable but had exceeded their useful life were excluded.", "Even after adjusting Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates, we found that, for some properties, Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates still differed substantially from those of the contract appraisers. For example, Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate of the immediate deferred maintenance needs at Jacksonville Townhouse in Jacksonville, Florida, remained at $797,402, while the appraiser did not identify any deferred maintenance needs. The property\u2019s owner and manager also strongly disagreed with Ernst & Young\u2019s cost estimates for immediate deferred maintenance, especially the estimate of $360,018 to replace heating and air-conditioning systems. The manager said the main system is only 3 years old and is covered by a maintenance contract and that the cost of work in the individual units, which Ernst & Young had estimated at $295,492 (or $3,545 a unit), is more than four times higher than necessary. He said that the heating and air-conditioning systems had recently been replaced in 35 units at a cost of $800 per unit.", "Because the estimates of capital needs that Ernst & Young presented in its study were difficult to compare directly with those of the contract appraisers, we provided both estimates to the owners and managers of the 10 case study properties for their review and comment. The owners and managers generally disagreed with Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates. For the most part, they said that the estimates were too high and did not accurately reflect the physical condition of the properties. In some cases, the owners and managers questioned some of the underlying assumptions used in developing the estimates and identified cost estimates that they considered too high\u2014in some cases, almost twice as high as they would estimate. For example, one property manager agreed that all of the property\u2019s operating systems needed major rehabilitation. However, his detailed estimate of about $3 million, including a $500,000 allowance for overruns, was about 50 percent lower than Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate of nearly $5.7 million. The contract appraiser for that property also believed that Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate was excessive. He stated that the neighborhood\u2019s standards and rental rates would not justify the renovation costs identified by Ernst & Young. When Ernst & Young adjusted its estimate by removing the replacement costs of items that had exceeded their useful life but were still in working condition, the revised estimate of $2.1 million was more in line with the property manager\u2019s assessment of the property\u2019s physical condition.", "Another property manager said that Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate was \u201cgrossly overstated and in no way accurately represent the condition of the property\u201d because it did not appear to reflect a $2 million rehabilitation that was done in 1991 and 1992. While Ernst & Young estimated immediate deferred maintenance needs of $362,349 for this property, the manager said there were no deferred maintenance needs and the contract appraiser identified no deferred maintenance or other repairs needed for the property to compete in the marketplace. Ernst & Young\u2019s adjusted estimate of the immediate deferred maintenance needs for this property was $128,535.", "According to an official from the engineering firm retained by Ernst & Young, with whom we discussed the owners\u2019 and managers\u2019 assessments of Ernst & Young\u2019s cost estimates, the owners\u2019 cost estimates may be understated. He said, for example, that current owners may be less concerned than new investors with comparing their property to others in the surrounding market and may therefore not plan for some changes that new owners would want to make. He said the estimates used in Ernst & Young\u2019s study represent the costs of meeting the standards of the industry and of the surrounding market.", "Other comments provided by owners and property managers and our review of the estimates indicated that Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates may not take into account all of the ongoing maintenance at the properties, such as the cyclical replacement of carpets and other unit items, preventive maintenance performed under contracts, recent improvements, and improvements that were under way at the time of Ernst & Young\u2019s inspections. For example, one manager said that Ernst & Young\u2019s study did not reflect the actual condition of the property\u2019s heating and air-conditioning systems because it included the full replacement cost of $253,000 for the heating system in its estimate of the property\u2019s immediate deferred maintenance needs. However, the manager noted that when the engineering firm retained by Ernst & Young inspected the property in January 1996, the system\u2019s renovation was well under way. The manager said the renovated heating system has a life expectancy of 30 years. According to Ernst & Young, this difference occurred because the study used a \u201cpoint-in-time\u201d methodology. This approach included only improvements that had been substantially completed at the time of the inspection and specifically excluded those that were planned or ongoing. Consequently, even though the inspector noted that work on the heating system was occurring in most units and would be completed within 2 months, the estimate does not reflect this work because it was not substantially completed.", "We identified some additional limitations in Ernst & Young\u2019s approach that may affect the accuracy of the firm\u2019s capital needs estimates. For example, officials from Ernst & Young and the engineering firm acknowledged that although they intended to base these estimates on inspections of 10 percent of each property\u2019s randomly selected units, they were not always able to do so because of management, tenant, or timing considerations. At 7 of the 10 case study properties, Ernst & Young\u2019s inspectors examined fewer than 10 percent of the units. Also, Ernst & Young calculated cost estimates for unit items, such as cabinets, appliances, and heating and air-conditioning components, by multiplying the estimated immediate cost per unit by the total number of units at the property. However, in some cases this approach may not have been reliable because of differences among units. For example, at one of the case study properties, which has 112 apartments with kitchens and 92 assisted living units without kitchens, Ernst & Young\u2019s estimate of the property\u2019s immediate deferred maintenance needs included the costs of replacing kitchen cabinets in all of the units."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Questions Exist About Some Assumptions That Can Affect the Study\u2019s Results", "paragraphs": ["Through our discussions with representatives of multifamily housing lending organizations and other multifamily housing industry officials and through our own analysis, we identified some assumptions used in the financial model that may not (1) reflect the way in which insured Section 8 properties would actually be affected by portfolio reengineering or (2) be apparent to readers of Ernst & Young\u2019s May 1996 report but are important to understanding the study\u2019s results.", "Ernst & Young\u2019s assumptions about the transition period for reengineered properties may be overly optimistic. During this period, a reengineered property changes from an assisted property with rental subsidies linked to its units to an unsubsidized property competing in the marketplace for residents. The model estimates that the entire transition will be completed within a year after the first Section 8 contract expires. In addition, the model assumes that during this year, the property\u2019s rental income will move incrementally towards stabilization over 9 months. The lenders with whom we discussed the reasonableness of the model\u2019s major assumptions considered a transition period of 1 to 2 years more likely. They also anticipated a less stable transition than the model assumed, with less income and more costs. An Ernst & Young official told us that the 9-month period was designed to reflect an average transition period for reengineered properties. While recognizing that the transition period for some properties would be longer, he believed that for others it could be shorter. In Ernst & Young\u2019s financial model, the first test of a loan\u2019s performance under portfolio reengineering assumes the elimination of the interest subsidy that many older assisted properties currently receive. Specifically, the model compares the net operating income under market rents with the current debt service, excluding any interest subsidy provided with the current loan. This assumption puts fewer loans in the performing category than would appear there if the subsidies were assumed to continue. According to Ernst & Young, the model excludes the current interest subsidies under portfolio reengineering because it assumes that subsidies would not exist under true market conditions. However, such an assumption implies a change in the terms of loans to which both borrowers and lenders have agreed. Hence, while this assumption might be appropriate for restructuring loans on which defaults would occur if the terms of the loans were not changed, it is not, in our view, appropriate for identifying the loans that need restructuring. As long as the borrowers continue to meet the terms of these loans, HUD cannot, as an official indicated, unilaterally discontinue the interest subsidy payments on them. Typically, the interest subsidies reduce interest payments on the loans to 1 percent. If Ernst & Young\u2019s model assumed that interest subsidies would continue, some additional properties would be classified as performing. This change would decrease the model\u2019s estimates of the claims costs associated with portfolio reengineering but would entail the Department\u2019s continuing to incur interest subsidy costs.", "The debt service coverage ratios, loan-to-value ratios, and amortization periods used in the model provide for higher levels of mortgage debt than the lenders we contacted generally understood to be available. If their understanding is correct, the model\u2019s assumptions would provide for lower claims than might actually result. For example, the lenders we contacted generally believed that most lenders would want to see at least 1 year\u2019s worth of operations at the stabilized level before approving a loan. Without such a stabilized period of operations, they believed, many commercial lenders would consider the properties too risky to provide long-term commercial financing at standard terms. Some officials believed that venture capital firms might be the only firms interested in properties whose operations had not stabilized after reengineering. In any case, they believed that the financing terms available for reengineered properties without proven track records would be more conservative than standard financing terms. The lenders believed that the 1.20 debt service coverage ratio and the 1.0 loan-to-value ratio used in the model would not likely be available for loans on many reengineered properties, particularly given the uncertainties concerning (1) how these properties would operate in a market-rate environment and (2) whether, what type of, and what levels of Section 8 assistance would be available in the future. They believed that higher debt service coverage ratios and lower loan-to-value ratios would be more likely. In addition, they believed that 30-year loan amortizations might not be available. The lenders indicated that 25-year loan amortizations were typical for commercial loans. In commenting on the views of the lenders we contacted, an Ernst & Young official stated that the underwriting criteria would take into account not only the debt service coverage and loan-to-value ratios and the amortization periods but also the level of capital provided through the short-term capital needs estimates and annual replacement reserves, as well as the interest rates, operating expenses, and revenues estimates. He believed that these factors would provide lenders with more comfort about the ability of properties to make the transition to a market environment. When obtaining the views of the lenders, we provided them with information on the full range of underwriting assumptions used by Ernst & Young, including those relating to the funding for capital needs, interest rates, revenues, and operating expenses. The Ernst & Young official also noted that Ernst & Young\u2019s terms assumed the Congress would continue to subsidize residents with Section 8 tenant-based assistance under a multiyear program. Finally, the Ernst & Young official noted that the financial model used 1.0 as a loan-to-value ratio so that the model would calculate the mortgage amounts for reengineered properties on the basis of their debt service coverage ratios rather than their loan-to-value ratios.", "The model assumes that replacement reserves must cover the estimated annual replacement costs for all major property systems. In contrast, the lenders we spoke with generally require replacement reserves for capital items for a set period of time\u2014such as over the life of the loan or over the life of the loan plus 2 years. Thus, Ernst & Young\u2019s approach requires higher replacement reserves than the private sector may require. The requirements for replacement reserves affect annual cash flows and the funding available to support mortgage debt. For example, in Ernst & Young\u2019s study, if a property\u2019s hot water systems were evaluated to have a remaining useful life of 25 years, the annual replacement reserve would include prorated amounts for the full cost of replacing the hot water systems. However, if the restructured loan were for 15 years, the lenders we spoke with believed that annual funding for replacing the hot water systems typically would not be required. Some replacement reserve items funded in Ernst & Young\u2019s study, such as walls and foundations and parking lots, have useful lives of more than 50 years.", "The Section 8 costs for reengineering are estimated only for the residents who currently receive Section 8 project-based assistance. In contrast to HUD\u2019s original proposal, which was the basis of Ernst & Young\u2019s study, HUD\u2019s current proposal includes the residents who do not receive Section 8 project-based assistance but would qualify for assistance when market rents were applied."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Sensitivity Analysis Can Assist in Evaluating the Range of Possible Outcomes", "paragraphs": ["Any estimates of the outcomes and costs of portfolio reengineering are likely to be subject to some error because they rely on predicting the reactions of numerous owners, lenders, and residents. In addition, as discussed above, some assumptions used in Ernst & Young\u2019s financial model may not accurately reflect the effects of portfolio reengineering on insured Section 8 properties or, at a minimum, are subject to debate. To assess the extent to which the use of different assumptions affects the results of Ernst & Young\u2019s study, we performed sensitivity analyses of Ernst & Young\u2019s model using two sets of revised assumptions that we developed through our discussions with multifamily housing industry officials. One scenario reflects assumptions that are more optimistic in terms of the cost to the government of portfolio reengineering. The other uses assumptions that are more conservative or pessimistic. Taken together, these sets of assumptions are intended to reflect the range of potential outcomes resulting from the basic policy assumptions used in Ernst & Young\u2019s study. We recognize that using alternative policy assumptions could produce different outcomes.", "Appendix IV provides information on the assumptions used in Ernst & Young\u2019s study and in our optimistic and pessimistic analyses. Because the owners and managers and the contract appraisers generally believe that the capital costs for the 10 case study properties were significantly lower than those Ernst & Young estimated, we reduced all capital costs used by Ernst & Young by 25 percent in our optimistic scenario. We did not adjust Ernst & Young\u2019s capital costs in the pessimistic scenario.", "As table 2.7 indicates, under both the optimistic and the pessimistic alternatives, as well as under Ernst & Young\u2019s original assumptions, a substantial number of properties are likely to do well and other properties will have difficulty sustaining operations. For example, under the optimistic assumptions, between 24 and 30 percent of the properties fall into the performing category, but between 15 and 20 percent fall into the two bottom categories\u2014full write-off or nonperforming. Under the pessimistic assumptions, between 10 and 14 percent are in the performing category and between 39 percent and 46 percent are in the full write-off or nonperforming category.", "As table 2.8 indicates, the cost of FHA insurance claims associated with portfolio reengineering are estimated to be between $4.9 billion and $5.9 billion under optimistic assumptions and between $8.2 billion and $9.4 billion under pessimistic ones. Because we used the same market rents for our optimistic scenario as Ernst & Young assumed, the 10-year costs of Section 8 assistance are the same. However, the 5-percent reduction in rents assumed in the pessimistic scenario lowered these 10-year costs by between $0.9 billion and $1.0 billion.", "As previously discussed, these subsidy estimates assume that loans are restructured when their first Section 8 contract expires. However, as noted, HUD is now proposing a proactive approach under which owners would agree to restructure their loans before the first Section 8 contract expires.

One important task will be to incorporate the results of Ernst & Young\u2019s study into HUD\u2019s budget estimates under portfolio reengineering. Other areas that merit additional analysis are the effects of including or excluding various segments of the portfolio in reengineering; the cost implications of continuing versus discontinuing FHA\u2019s insurance after reengineering and of using project-based versus tenant-based assistance; and the options for dealing with those properties that fall into the nonperforming or full write-off categories after reengineering. In addition, given the uncertainties about the capital costs used in the study, further analysis of the physical condition and related capital needs of the insured Section 8 portfolio is needed.

(HUD\u2019s comments are reproduced in app. VI). While agreeing that differences in the estimates are due, in part, to differences in the methodologies, we continue to question certain aspects of Ernst & Young\u2019s approach, including (1) the assumption that working systems and components will be replaced if their estimated useful lives have expired and (2) the inclusion in the capital needs estimates of the cost of work that is under way but not yet completed. The fact that Ernst & Young\u2019s estimates for 7 of the 10 case study properties that GAO reviewed were based on inspections of fewer than 10 percent of each property\u2019s units also adds to the uncertainty of the estimates.

If HUD were to discontinue the insurance when restructuring the loans, as it originally planned, it would likely incur higher debt restructuring costs because lenders would set the terms of the new loans (e.g., interest rates) to reflect the risk of default that they would now assume. The primary benefits of discontinuing FHA insurance are that (1) the government\u2019s dual role as mortgage insurer and rental subsidy provider would end, eliminating the management conflicts associated with this dual role, and (2) the risk of default borne by the government would end as the loans were restructured.", "If FHA insurance were continued, another issue is whether it would need to be provided for the whole portfolio or could be used selectively. The government could, for example, insure loans only when owners could not obtain reasonable financing without insurance. Also, if FHA insurance were continued, the terms and conditions under which it is provided would affect the government\u2019s future costs. Some lenders have indicated that short-term (or \u201cbridge\u201d) financing insured by FHA might be needed while the properties make the transition to market conditions, after which time conventional financing at reasonable terms would be available. Under such an arrangement, the government could insure loans for 3 to 5 years, instead of bearing the risk of default, as it now does, for the life of the loans\u2014generally 40 years.

On the other hand, using project-based assistance, which links subsidies directly to rental units, can help sustain properties in housing markets that have difficulty supporting unsubsidized rental housing, such as inner-city and rural locations.

For example, the residents of Section 8 units that were converted from project-based to tenant-based assistance would receive an enhanced voucher to pay the difference between 30 percent of their household\u2019s adjusted income and the market rent for their unit even if the market rent exceeded the area\u2019s fair market rent ceiling.
