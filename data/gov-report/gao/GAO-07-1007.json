This growth creates the need for additional support infrastructure at these bases and in nearby communities. Military construction costs of over $17 billion are expected for new personnel, and communities will incur infrastructure costs as well. GAO prepared this report under the Comptroller General's authority to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. It addresses (1) the challenges and associated risks the Army faces in providing for timely infrastructure support at its gaining installations and (2) how communities are planning and funding for infrastructure to support incoming personnel and their families. GAO analyzed personnel restationing numbers, discussed planning efforts with Army and community officials, and visited nine of the larger gaining bases and nearby communities."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Army has developed plans to accommodate the growth of about 154,000 personnel at its domestic bases, but it faces several complex implementation challenges that risk late provision of needed infrastructure to adequately support incoming personnel. First, Army plans continue to evolve, and Army headquarters and each of the nine gaining bases we visited were relying on different numbers of personnel movements and were not fully aware of the causes for the variances. For example, Fort Benning officials expected more than 6,000 additional soldiers and military students than Army headquarters planned. Because consistency in the relocation numbers is important for properly determining not only base infrastructure support needs but those of nearby communities as well, inconsistent numbers could lead to an improperly sized facilities' infrastructure. Second, the Army faces challenges in synchronizing personnel movements with planned newly constructed on-base infrastructure improvements. Any significant delays in implementing planned actions could place the Army at risk of not meeting BRAC statutory deadlines. Third, competing priorities could lead the Army to redirect resources planned for needed infrastructure improvements and operations to such priorities as current operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as has happened in the past. However, such redirection of resources could undermine the Army's ability to complete infrastructure improvements in time to support personnel movements and to meet planned timelines. Fourth, the Army Corps of Engineers, the primary construction agent for the Army, must manage an unprecedented volume of construction, implement a new construction strategy designed to save construction costs and time, and complete infrastructure improvements within available resources and planned timelines. The Army recognizes these challenges and is refining its implementation plans to overcome these challenges. While communities surrounding growth bases GAO visited have generally proactively planned for anticipated growth, they have been hindered in fully identifying additional infrastructure requirements and associated costs by the evolving nature of the Army's plans and different interpretations of the plans. For example, while Army officials at Fort Benning, Georgia, project an influx of about 10,000 school-age children, the Department of Defense's (DOD) November 2006 figures project only about 600. At the time of our review, these disparities remained unresolved. Communities surrounding growth bases have their own unique infrastructure improvement needs, such as schools, housing, or transportation, based on (1) the number of personnel to actually move to the nearby base, (2) the community's current capacity in its area(s) of need, and (3) the community's own capacity to finance additional infrastructure requirements and the availability of federal or state assistance to finance these needs. Some communities had already sought federal and state assistance to help finance construction efforts at the time of GAO's review even though the evolving nature of the Army's planning prevented the communities from having reasonable assurance that they knew the full scope of their infrastructure requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Army is implementing extensive worldwide transformation initiatives  to enhance U.S. national security while conducting operations in  Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. These initiatives are expected to lead to  significantly increased military and civilian populations on certain  domestic installations by 2011. Because of the combined effect of  implementing base realignment and closure (BRAC); overseas force  redeployments back to the United States under the Global Defense  Posture Realignment, known as overseas rebasing; and a major Army force  reorganization, known as force modularity, the Army expects to relocate  over 150,000 personnel and increase 18 base populations by about  136,000. Department of Defense (DOD) estimates that military  construction costs will exceed $17 billion through fiscal year 2011 at these  18 bases, and surrounding communities will likely incur costs to provide  adequate schools, transportation, and other infrastructure improvements.  These figures do not include personnel increases and added infrastructure  costs as a result of Army actions to increase its active end strength  authorization by 65,000 soldiers. Furthermore, family members and non- mission-related defense contractors, whose numbers are not included in  the relocation figures cited above, will also relocate to areas surrounding  these bases, thus fueling increased civilian infrastructure needs.  Compounding the challenges of moving so many personnel is the statutory  requirement to complete BRAC closures and realignments by September  15, 2011. The Army expects to continue modularity-related moves beyond  2011. Senior Army officials consider appropriate infrastructure support as  integral to maintaining operational readiness and quality of life for  soldiers, DOD civilians, and their families.", "This report is one in a series that addresses emerging issues associated  with the implementation of the BRAC 2005 round, overseas rebasing, and  force modularity initiatives. Because of the broad implications these  initiatives have on the infrastructure support at the Army\u2019s domestic  installations and surrounding communities and widespread congressional  interest in this subject, we prepared this report under the authority of the  Comptroller General to conduct evaluations on his own initiative. We are  reporting the results to you in order to facilitate your oversight of the  Army\u2019s efforts to address infrastructure needs as a result of the expected  growth. Our objectives were to (1) identify the challenges and risks the  Army faces in providing adequate infrastructure when needed at its major  gaining bases and (2) describe surrounding communities\u2019 plans and  funding for needed infrastructure to support incoming personnel and their  families.", "To achieve our objectives, we analyzed data on the expected number and  timing of military and civilian personnel arrivals and departures at gaining  installations and military construction plans and funding to support these  moves. We also discussed implementation, funding, and personnel  movement plans with officials from various Army organizations, including  the Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation Management, the  Installation Management Command and its four regional offices, the Office  of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans, and the Army Corps  of Engineers. We also discussed implementation challenges with  installation officials at nine domestic bases expecting significant personnel  growth and with local leaders in communities surrounding these bases. To  address the surrounding communities\u2019 plans for needed schools, housing,  transportation, and other infrastructure, we reviewed documents on  community growth impacts and actions to address these impacts and data  on financial grants provided by DOD\u2019s Office of Economic Adjustment  (OEA) to communities surrounding the growth bases. We also met with  community leaders and discussed their plans to meet DOD-prompted  needs and with OEA officials to identify their interagency community  impact assistance efforts with other federal agencies, such as the  Departments of Transportation and Education.", "We conducted our work from March 2006 through July 2007 in accordance  with generally accepted government auditing standards. Business plans  intended to direct the implementation of the BRAC recommendations  affecting the gaining bases were in draft at the time of our review. In  addition, other information the Army provided us was preliminary and  subject to change. Nonetheless, Army officials told us that the information  constituted their current plans at the time of our review and should be  considered an approximation of projected personnel movement and  funding.  Similarly, because surrounding communities\u2019 plans depend on  the Army\u2019s plans, community planning information is also considered  preliminary and subject to change. Although we found some discrepancies  in the Army\u2019s information, we concluded that, overall, it was sufficiently  reliable for the purposes of this report. A more detailed description of our  scope and methodology is included in appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["BRAC, overseas rebasing, and Army modularity are all expected to  generate significant personnel movements among numerous bases within  the United States and from certain overseas locations back to the United  States.

The BRAC Commission recommendations were accepted by the  President and Congress and became effective on November 9, 2005. In  accordance with BRAC statutory authority, DOD must complete closures  and realignments by September 15, 2011. BRAC 2005\u2019s key goals were to  (1) transform DOD by more closely aligning its infrastructure with defense  strategy, (2) enhance joint operations, and (3) reduce excess  infrastructure and produce savings. Traditionally, DOD relied on BRAC  primarily to reduce excess property and save money since property that  has been disposed of is no longer maintained by DOD. Conversely, due in  part to the addition of the transformation and joint operations goals to  BRAC 2005, this round led to more than twice the number of actions in all  previous rounds combined, 837 distinct actions in all. These BRAC actions  incorporate many of the more than 50,000 Army personnel expected to  return from overseas locations to the United States as part of DOD\u2019s  overseas rebasing initiative discussed below.", "Second, in August 2004, the President announced plans for sweeping  changes to the number and locations of DOD\u2019s overseas-based facilities.  Known as the Global Defense Posture Realignment, DOD plans to realign  its overseas basing structure over a 6- to 8-year period from the legacy  Cold War posture to one that would more effectively support current allies  and strategies and address emerging threats. Under the overseas rebasing  effort, the 50,000 Army personnel plus another 20,000 other defense  personnel and about 100,000 family members are to relocate from  overseas locations\u2014primarily in Europe and Korea\u2014to bases in the  United States. Although some of these personnel have already relocated,  many were still overseas at the time of our review. Army plans call for  overseas relocations to the United States to be completed prior to  September 15, 2011.", "Third, similar to BRAC and overseas rebasing actions, implementation of  Army force modularity will add to the personnel growth at some bases.  The Army\u2019s modular transformation has been referred to as the largest  Army reorganization in 50 years and affects the active Army, Army  National Guard, and U.S. Army Reserve. The foundation for the modular  force is the creation of brigade combat teams that while somewhat smaller  than existing brigades, are expected to be more agile and deployable and  better able to meet combatant commander requirements. Successful  implementation of this initiative requires the movement of personnel  across various units, new facilities and equipment, a different mix of skills  and occupational specialties, and significant changes in doctrine and  training. The Army began the modularity initiative in 2004 and expects to  finish most associated reorganizations by 2011, but expects that some  reorganizations will occur after 2011.", "As a result of the three initiatives and certain other restationing moves, the  Army expects a net gain of about 154,000 personnel at its domestic gaining  bases from fiscal years 2006 through fiscal year 2011. These gains include  active and reserve soldiers, military students and trainees, civilians, and  mission contractors but do not include family members and non-mission- related contractors. Our analysis of March 2007 Army data on personnel  restationing actions indicates that 18 domestic installations, as shown in  table 1, are likely to experience a net gain of at least 2,000 military and  civilian personnel for fiscal years 2006 through 2011 because of BRAC  2005, overseas rebasing, modularity, and other miscellaneous restationing  actions. Personnel gains at individual locations are projected to range  from 7 percent to 111 percent.", "As also shown in table 1, while the overall net gain in personnel at these  installations averages 31 percent, Forts Belvoir, Bliss, Lee, and Riley are  expected to experience a 53 percent or more growth rate. The expected  personnel net gains at these 18 installations account for nearly 90 percent  of the total expected personnel net gains across all Army domestic  installations through 2011. Figure 1 shows the locations of the 18  installations.", "Accommodating the expected large increase of personnel at these 18 Army  locations over the next several years requires the expenditure of  significant military construction funds for required facilities. Although the  Army also will have procurement, operations and maintenance, and other  associated cost increases at these bases because of the personnel  increases, the scope of this report focuses on military construction  funding. Our analysis of DOD data, as shown in table 2, indicates that DOD  is planning to spend over $17 billion to construct facilities at these  locations through the fiscal year 2011 time frame.", "Also shown in table 2, the overwhelming majority, over 80 percent, of the  planned construction expenditures at these Army installations are  attributable to BRAC, overseas rebasing, and modularity actions.  Moreover, as shown in the table, other military services or defense  agencies and activities are planning to expend about $4.6 billion for  constructing BRAC facilities they expect to use at these Army  installations. For example, several defense agencies are expecting to  spend more than $2.6 billion in facility construction at Fort Belvoir,  Virginia, while the Air Force plans to spend in excess of $600 million for  facilities to house medical training personnel and students at Fort Sam  Houston, Texas."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Four Organizations Are Primarily Responsible for Managing These Personnel Moves and Assisting Communities", "paragraphs": ["The following four organizations are to manage personnel moves  associated with BRAC, overseas rebasing, or Army modularity and to  assist local communities affected by the movements:    The Army\u2019s Office of the Assistant Chief of Staff for Installation  Management provides policy guidance and program management on all  matters relating to the management and funding of Army installations  worldwide and to ensure the availability of installation services and  facilities. To accomplish its mission, the office coordinates with other key  Army headquarters organizations, including the Office of the Deputy Chief  of Staff for Operations and Plans and the Army Budget Office, to respond  to operational requirements and resource availability in providing for  installation infrastructure. To assist in this role, the Installation  Management Command provides needed installation services and  facilities, including construction, family care, food management,  environmental programs, well-being, logistics, public works, and  installation funding to support readiness and mission execution.", "The Army Corps of Engineers is the Army\u2019s construction agent and is  charged with contracting for infrastructure construction for the Army. The  Corps also manages the construction process, including supervision and  inspection as facilities construction progresses. It also functions as the  construction agent for selected Air Force construction projects and fulfills  a role as an agent for a civil works construction program involving flood  control, water supply, hydroelectric power generation, navigation,  recreation, wetlands regulation, and resource protection.", "OEA is a field activity within the Office of the Secretary of Defense that  assists states and communities by providing technical and financial  assistance in planning and carrying out adjustment strategies in response  to defense actions. Much of that assistance in the past had been directed  toward communities that lost military and civilian personnel because of  the closure or major realignment of a base. Conversely, because the 2005  BRAC round, overseas rebasing, and Army modularity have created  significant growth at many bases, OEA has assisted affected communities  with growth planning.", "The President\u2019s Economic Adjustment Committee was established under  Executive Order 12788 and comprises 22 federal agencies that are to  facilitate the organization, planning, and execution of community-based  defense adjustment strategies. The Deputy Under Secretary of Defense  (Installations and Environment) chairs the committee, and the Secretaries  of Labor and Commerce serve as Vice Chairmen.

First,  Army plans are still evolving, and officials at the gaining bases we visited  did not agree with Army headquarters on personnel movements at their  bases.  Second, the synchronization of personnel movements across  installations with the planned infrastructure construction is difficult  because any unforeseen delays or disruptions in providing for necessary  facilities can adversely affect synchronization plans. Third, competing  resource demands could lead to redirection of resources that would have  been used for infrastructure improvements to other priorities, as has  happened in the past.

As  of March 2007, the nine gaining bases we visited were expecting different  numbers of personnel arrivals and departures than those generated by the  Office of the Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans. Table 3  provides examples of these variances at six of these bases, five of which  are planning for more personnel movement than Army headquarters\u2019 plans  while one base expects slightly less. While the other three bases we  visited had personnel movement numbers that also differed from the  Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations and Plans\u2019 numbers, the data were  not as easily comparable as those presented in table 3.", "The examples in table 3 are not necessarily representative of all Army  growth locations and all categories of arriving personnel, but they  nonetheless could lead to unnecessary infrastructure improvements on  some bases and inadequate improvements on others. Army headquarters  officials explained that they program military construction funds based on  their numbers while base-level officials and surrounding communities rely  more on the base-level numbers for planning purposes. While we  recognize that the numbers of personnel moving to Army growth  installations will fluctuate, officials could fully explain the reasons for  discrepancies as large as those shown in table 3, and inconsistent numbers  can lead to under- or overbuilding by the base and the surrounding  communities.", "Expected personnel movements also can vary based on doctrinal changes  that consequently lead to changes in operational unit sizes and  organizational structures. For example, BRAC 2005 recommended the  creation of certain Army training centers of excellence that consequently  require consolidation of some training staff and facilities in certain  locations. One such planned center of excellence\u2014the Army Maneuver  Center at Fort Benning, Georgia\u2014is to be created through the  consolidation of the Armor School and Center (currently located at Fort  Knox, Kentucky) with the Infantry School and Center at Fort Benning.  This consolidation is expected to lead to personnel movements from Fort  Knox to Fort Benning. However, because the organizational framework for  the centers of excellence had not been fully defined at the time of our  review and was therefore still evolving, Army\u2019s headquarters and Training  and Doctrine Command officials still had not reached agreement on the  number of people to be assigned to each center. Thus, gaining base  officials, such as those at Fort Benning, could not fully plan for incoming  personnel movements based on the center\u2019s personnel numbers and  associated personnel reductions until the final personnel numbers were  approved. Table 4 shows the wide disparity in the proposed personnel  reduction numbers and those ultimately approved by the Vice Chief of  Staff for the Army in March 2007.", "Military planners and base operations and community officials require  accurate personnel arrival information to ensure that they can effectively  plan for and fund infrastructure improvements to provide adequate  facilities for the new arrivals. To the extent that personnel numbers are  inaccurate, the Army and the surrounding community could either plan for  too much or too little space to meet infrastructure requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Army Faces Challenges in Synchronizing Personnel Restationing Plans with Planned Construction of Facilities", "paragraphs": ["Synchronizing personnel movements with the completion of infrastructure  needed to accommodate newly arriving personnel at gaining bases  presents difficult challenges that must be overcome to ensure that  facilities are ready when relocated personnel arrive. These challenges  include developing plans to account for (1) the complexities inherent in  coordinating the expected large number of individual movements  prompted by BRAC, overseas rebasing, and modularity and (2) the need to  manage interdependent BRAC actions affecting individual bases.  Moreover, delays in constructing needed infrastructure, for reasons such  as environmental assessments on gaining bases, can force delays in  carrying out the personnel movements. Given the compressed time frames  for completing construction of facilities and subsequently relocating  personnel, any significant delays of BRAC actions could place the Army at  risk of not completing personnel moves at some locations and not meeting  the September 15, 2011, statutory deadline.", "The Army faces a key challenge stemming from the sheer number of  synchronized actions that must take place to successfully complete certain  personnel movements. In congressional testimony, the Assistant Secretary  of the Army (Installations and Environment) stated that the Army has to  complete more than 1,300 discrete actions to successfully implement  BRAC recommendations. For example, 14 separate BRAC  recommendations involving 59 separate DOD organizations impact Fort  Belvoir, Virginia, which is expected to gain nearly 24,000 personnel by  September 15, 2011.  Among the personnel moving to Fort Belvoir will be  about 15,000 expected to arrive as late as August 2011 as the result of the  closure of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., to  staff a newly constructed hospital, the collocation of various defense  agencies and activities from leased space off base, and several National  Geospatial-Intelligence Agency moves. These moves all depend on the  completion of new construction at Fort Belvoir, much of which is  expected to be completed only shortly before or at the same time as the  relocations. For example, current plans call for construction to be  complete in September 2011 for the collocation of about 9,000 personnel  from various defense agencies and activities at the base. However, at the  time of our review, the Army had not made a final decision whether to  obtain General Services Administration land it owns near rail and transit  stations in Springfield, Virginia, where the Army would move these  personnel. If this process delays these moves, it could jeopardize meeting  the statutory deadline.", "The Army also has to overcome the challenge to planned synchronization  from the interdependence of various BRAC recommendations. For  example, the BRAC recommendation to close Fort Monmouth, New  Jersey, includes the planned relocation of some personnel into renovated  facilities at the Aberdeen Proving Ground, Maryland. However, the  designated receiving facilities at Aberdeen cannot be renovated until the  military organization currently occupying those facilities\u2014the Ordnance  Center and School\u2014relocates. The school, however, cannot relocate\u2014an  action associated with another BRAC recommendation\u2014until new space  is provided at Fort Lee, Virginia. According to Army officials, the  Ordnance Center and School is expected to move to Fort Lee in July 2009,  and some personnel from Fort Monmouth are expected to move into the  renovated space at Aberdeen in June 2011. Any delay could jeopardize  these moves and meeting the September 15, 2011, deadline.", "Another key synchronization challenge is the need to complete required  environmental assessments, conduct any needed environmental cleanup,  and undertake endangered species protection before construction  commences. For example, construction of the new Maneuver Center of  Excellence at Fort Benning, Georgia, could be delayed because the  installation is required to account for endangered species protection  actions in its construction plans. While the Army initially expected to  complete the relevant environmental impact statement by the end of fiscal  year 2007, it has revised its expected completion date by about 3 months.  Base officials said that this delay will not affect current construction  schedules. However, if any further delays materialize, both needed  construction and arrival of Armor School and Center personnel from Fort  Knox could be delayed. Army officials also told us that other regulatory  environmental requirements must be complied with, including certain  studies, consultations, and permitting, before various construction  projects can commence and any delays could undermine the  synchronization schedule of construction and personnel movements that  must be completed before the deadline.", "Synchronization difficulties have already arisen in the Army\u2019s BRAC 2005  plans, and the Army consequently delayed scheduled personnel  movements in at least the following three instances because facilities were  not expected to be ready at the gaining bases when needed:       Fort Benning, Georgia: Officials delayed the start-up of the Maneuver  Center of Excellence by a year or more from their initial plans for it to  begin operations in fiscal year 2009.", "Fort Bliss, Texas: The 1st Armored Division\u2019s planned move from Germany  was moved from fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010 to fiscal years 2010 and  2011. Similarly, a 1st Armored Division brigade relocation has been  rescheduled from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008.", "Fort Sill, Oklahoma: The Net Fires Center of Excellence is to begin  operations in fiscal years 2009 instead of fiscal year 2008 as originally  planned.", "To the extent that delays occur as implementation proceeds, the Army  faces an increased risk that it may not complete all closures and  realignments by the statutory deadline.", "The Army is now emphasizing the need to have adequate permanent  facilities in place when personnel arrive because utilizing temporary  facilities, often referred to as relocatables, adds to the facilities\u2019 cost in the  long term as permanent facilities are to eventually replace the  relocatables. Army officials have told us that because of congressional  concerns regarding the possible use of temporary facilities to meet  requirements for 2005 BRAC round and overseas rebasing actions, they do  not plan to use relocatable facilities for these moves, even though they  would serve as an interim measure for providing needed infrastructure.  Nonetheless, in the recent past the Army has relied on temporary facilities  to accommodate troops for operational reasons when no permanent  facilities were available, as evidenced by the Army\u2019s modularity initiative  and facilities construction in Iraq and Afghanistan. Army data indicate that  more than 7 million square feet of relocatables have been used to  accommodate modular force conversions at a cost of nearly $1 billion  since 2004 at domestic bases. Figures 2 and 3 show relocatables in place at  Fort Bliss to accommodate the arrival of the 1st Cavalry Division in 2006."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Competing Priorities Could Lead to Redirection of Funding from Infrastructure to Other Priorities", "paragraphs": ["Competing priorities could lead to the redirection of funds planned for  infrastructure construction or improvement to other priorities and  consequently lead to delays in preparing facilities for newly arriving  personnel at gaining bases. In September 2006, the Chief of Staff of the  Army negotiated directly with the Office of Management and Budget for an  increase in the Army\u2019s total fiscal year 2008 budget rather than the usual  practice of providing its budget request to the Secretary of Defense. The  Army Chief of Staff took this step because he perceived a shortfall of  nearly $25 billion in the Army\u2019s fiscal year 2008 budget. However, as a  result of the negotiations, the Army received $7 billion more than that  originally supported by the Secretary of Defense, but still $18 billion less  than the amount the Chief of Staff believed was required to fund all  priorities.", "The Army projects the cost of BRAC implementation to be about           $17.6 billion of which military construction is projected to account for  about $13.1 billion. The Army plans to fund the $17.6 billion from a variety  of sources. First, to help finance portions of the Army\u2019s BRAC 2005  implementation costs, DOD will provide BRAC funding of almost               $7 billion. Second, DOD also will provide funding for overseas rebasing,  which will supply the Army with about $2.6 billion to fund these  redeployment actions to the United States. Together, these amounts will  provide the Army about $9.5 billion. Thus, the Army will need about  another $8.1 billion to finance BRAC 2005 implementation of about       $17.6 billion. To address the shortfall, at the time of our review, the Army  planned to rely heavily on funding programmed for certain projects  outside the BRAC account\u2015the Military Construction Army  Account\u2015through 2011 and to move these targeted projects further into  the future.", "While the Army has identified sources for the funds to implement BRAC  2005, competing priorities could prompt future redirection of funds away  from BRAC or other construction. Operations in Iraq and Afghanistan;  support for new weapons systems, including the Future Combat System;  costs to implement modularity; plans to increase the Army\u2019s active force  structure by 65,000 personnel; and other initiatives all will compete for  funds with BRAC 2005 and other infrastructure construction priorities.  Moreover, cost growth in any of these priorities could increase the  pressure to redirect funds. For example, in March 2007, we reported that  the Army\u2019s projected cost for the Future Combat System had increased by  almost 80 percent from $91.4 billion to $163.7 billion. We also reported  that the Office of the Secretary of Defense\u2019s independent estimates of the  acquisition cost of the system were higher and ranged from $203 billion to  $234 billion.", "As we have previously reported, concerns have remained regarding the  adequacy of funding allocated to maintain DOD infrastructure and support  other installation operating needs. Furthermore, underfunding, including  the deterioration of facilities and its negative effects on the quality of life  for those living and working at affected installations and on their ability to  accomplish their mission activities, further affects military operations.  This has been particularly prevalent in the Army and in 2004 was  exacerbated because varying amounts were redirected from facilities  accounts to help pay for the Global War on Terrorism. At the end of fiscal  year 2004, Army installations received additional funds to help offset these  shortfalls, but the timing made it difficult for the installations to execute  these funds. Our visits to various gaining bases revealed that the adequacy  of operations and maintenance funds to operate bases continues to be an  issue. The Army has had to take steps in each of the last 3 years, affecting  facilities accounts, to help fund the war. We are continuing to conduct  work in this area and have recently initiated a review looking at the  sustainment and operation of DOD facilities.", "Because of expected budgetary pressures and competing priorities, and to  limit short-term construction costs, the Army plans to delay construction  of certain quality of life facilities at some gaining installations. Quality of  life facilities include child development and youth centers, physical fitness  centers, chapels, on-post shopping and convenience areas, and athletic  fields. BRAC recommendations do not require specific construction  projects, and thus the Army has chosen to defer some quality of life  facilities beyond 2011. Specifically, at the nine Army growth installations  we visited, the BRAC requirement for quality of life facilities has an  estimated value of about $739 million. However, if only certain quality of  life facilities are included, then the requirement drops to about               $472 million. Nonetheless, the Army planned to fund only about $76  million using BRAC funds and about another $122 million using military  construction funds through 2011. As a consequence, for example, at Fort  Carson, Colorado, officials requested that two child care centers be  constructed before most incoming personnel arrived in 2009.

Through its transformation strategy, the Corps intends to change  how it executes construction projects by  standardizing facility designs and processes, expanding the use of manufactured building solutions,    executing military construction as a continuous building program and not  just a collection of individual projects, and    emphasizing commercial rather than government building standards and  base master planning.", "The Army approved the strategy on February 1, 2006, and the  established  eight centers to simplify the contracting and construction processes for  certain types of facilities as a step in its goal to reduce construction costs  and time. By 2008, the Corps expects that each center will establish  baseline requirements for common facilities to reduce construction costs  and time frames on the theory that contractors can build to the same  design faster and cheaper once they have experience with the design. The  Fort Worth, Texas, district is to standardize enlisted barracks\u2019  construction; the Savannah, Georgia, district is to standardize brigade  operations complexes; and the Louisville, Kentucky, district is to  standardize operational readiness training complexes. A further cost- saving element of the strategy is to reduce the cost of support facilities,  such as utility connections, paved parking and walkways, storm drains,  information technology connections, and antiterrorism and force  protection measures. According to officials, these costs usually range from  25 to 30 percent of the construction cost when government construction  standards are used.", "In addition to common designs, the strategy encourages contractors to use  manufactured buildings with flexibility to use any of five construction  types rather than requiring only noncombustible, concrete and steel type I  or II construction. Corps officials said that this approach provides not  only greater flexibility in the design and construction of military projects  but also flexibility to respond to fluctuating material prices. They also  noted that using materials other than concrete and steel makes it easier to  renovate, reuse, and reconfigure a facility when appropriate. These  officials believe that the changes would not significantly reduce the useful  life of facilities.", "Recognizing that its construction strategy constitutes a critical operational  change, the Army Corps of Engineers is testing its new approach on  projects at five locations. A Corps official told us that 11 projects awarded  at the pilot locations during fiscal year 2006 all were bid under the price  set by the Corps thus achieving up to a 17 percent savings. Further, these  projects were all awarded without scope reductions. Corps officials also  told us that the contractors for these projects are expected to complete  them in from 440 to 540 days as compared with the normal completion  time of about 720 days. In addition, we were told that the Corps hopes to  have completed the pilot testing and developed regional contracts for the  standardized facility types so that they can be used in the fiscal year 2008  military construction program. According to Corps officials, these  contracts will help streamline the construction process because a task  order can be issued against an already existing contract when needed.  Despite the early positive results, however, Corps officials acknowledge  that their strategy has not been tested in high-demand conditions, such as  those that will occur because of the much larger construction budgets and  extensive construction plans during fiscal years 2008 through 2010.", "With respect to implementing this transformational construction strategy,  building materials cost and labor wage rates that exceed rates used in the  construction budget process could lead to unexpectedly costly building  projects. In recent years, the actual rate of construction inflation has  exceeded the federal government\u2019s inflation rate, which the Corps is  required to use in budgeting for its construction projects. While this  variance, which was as high as 6.1 percentage points in fiscal year 2004,  has diminished over time, the actual rate of construction inflation  continues to exceed the Corps\u2019 budgeted rate. Because the Corps uses  government inflation rates to develop its cost estimates and budget for  construction in any given year, any variance in actual inflation from those  rates has an impact on the cost of construction projects. Army Corps of  Engineers officials told us that to the extent that the actual rate of inflation  continues to exceed the budgeted rate as implementation proceeds and  construction material costs are higher than anticipated, they would either  have to redirect funding from other sources to provide for construction  projects or resort to a reduction in the scope of some construction  projects. We note, however, that this trend may not necessarily continue  into the future, depending on the economics surrounding the construction  industry.", "Finally, the Corps is expected to manage an unprecedented volume of  construction through 2011, with some regions expecting to far exceed  their normal construction capacity. For example, the Fort Worth, Texas,  district is to manage about $2.5 billion in construction work at Fort Bliss.  Corps officials said that this amount would place them at their maximum  capacity of about $400 million in construction work annually managed by  that district, and they must also manage $2 billion in construction in the  San Antonio, Texas, area. Similarly, at Fort Benning, Georgia, the Corps\u2019  military construction budget will increase from about $50 million per year  to more than $300 million annually over the next 3 years. These costs do  not include the costs of the Corps\u2019 civil works program, which would  include construction programs such as recovering from the impacts of  Hurricane Katrina. Corps headquarters officials have said that they will  bring in assistance from other Corps districts, hire outside help if specific  districts are unable to meet the demand without such help, or both thus  potentially adding additional cost to the projects."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Communities Have Efforts Under Way to Address Anticipated Army Growth, but Planning and Funding Challenges Remain", "paragraphs": ["Communities surrounding growing Army installations have acted to  address school, housing, transportation, and other infrastructure needs,  but each community\u2019s actions are unique because demands vary by  location.

A number of reasons  accounted for the variances, including differences in the scope (e.g.,  defense personnel versus defense and nondefense personnel) of the  projected arrivals and assumptions underlying the projections for family  dependents related to those arriving personnel. At the time of our review,  these disparities remained unresolved. There are a number of installations,  in addition to Fort Benning, for which base projections differ from those  generated by the Army. Forts Benning and Riley officials told us that they  have been in direct contact with the units that will be moving to the bases  and consequently believe that their own estimates more accurately reflect  impending growth than those by Army headquarters. As a result, Forts  Benning and Riley officials are relying on their own estimates and  communicating them to local officials for use in their school construction  planning.", "Financing school construction is a key challenge confronting officials in  communities surrounding growth bases, and these officials have adopted a  variety of strategies. For example, Forts Bliss and Riley area school  systems have passed bonds to expand their schools\u2019 capacity. The  community surrounding Fort Bliss approved bonds totaling over            $600 million for school construction intended to serve an increased  student population of about 14,900. In addition, one community  surrounding Fort Riley passed a $33 million school bond to finance a new  1,100-student middle school, a new 400-student elementary school, and the  expansion of existing elementary schools. Another school system near  Fort Riley decided to keep a school open that was to close. In addition to  bonds, some school systems are seeking federal assistance. For example,  local officials in the community adjacent to Fort Benning estimate that  they need about $321 million to support incoming students and are seeking  federal assistance. Moreover, the school systems near Forts Benning,  Bliss, Carson, Lee, Riley, and Sill have formed the Seven Rivers National  Coalition and were subsequently joined by the school systems near the  Aberdeen Proving Ground; Forts Bragg, Knox, Leonard Wood, and Meade;  and the Redstone Arsenal. The coalition has petitioned for construction  funding from DOD, the Department of Education, and Congress and  believes that it needs about $2 billion to support incoming students.
