It was also part of an effort to report conviction statistics that would be less likely to be misinterpreted, according to DOJ officials. The FBI historically classified more convictions than EOUSA as terrorism-related because it used a different classification system and included convictions obtained in international, federal, and state courts. EOUSA only included federal convictions. Our review of a sample of cases investigated and classified by the FBI as terrorism-related, including U.S. Attorney Office (USAO) cases covered by the article, found documentation to support the terrorism-related classification for these cases. As for the accuracy and reliability of EOUSA's terrorism-related statistics included in its annual performance reports, we found that DOJ does not have sufficient management oversight and internal controls in place, as required by federal internal control standards, to ensure the accuracy and reliability of its terrorism-related conviction statistics.

The DOJ components primarily responsible for investigating and  prosecuting terrorism-related cases are the FBI and the USAOs. The FBI is  the lead federal agency responsible for investigating crimes for which it  has primary or concurrent jurisdiction and which involve terrorist  activities, or acts in preparation of terrorist activities, within the statutory  jurisdiction of the United States. The USAOs prosecute federal criminal  cases, including those related to terrorism.", "There is no single, uniform definition of terrorism. Several federal statutes  define terrorism in a variety of contexts. Appendix I provides examples of  various statutory terrorism definitions. In addition to these statutory  definitions, the FBI has a regulatory definition of terrorism, which refers  to the \u201cunlawful use of force and violence against persons or property to  intimidate or coerce a government, the civilian population, or any segment  thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives.\u201d", "Although the FBI\u2019s regulatory definition of terrorism relates to cases  involving the unlawful use of force or violence, this same regulation  designates the FBI as the lead federal agency for investigating both  terrorist activities and acts in preparation of terrorist activities. Thus, the  FBI may investigate cases that do not involve the use of force or violence  that may be terrorism-related (e.g., cases involving money laundering or  drug trafficking in support of a terrorist organization)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "FBI and EOUSA Classification Criteria Differ", "paragraphs": ["Prior to fiscal year 2002, the FBI and EOUSA\u2019s criteria for classifying cases  and any resulting convictions differed. The FBI classified a case as  terrorism-related based on the overall violation being investigated. USAOs,  following EOUSA guidance, classified a case based on the charges in the  indictment or the charges for which the defendant was convicted. For  example, if the FBI arrested an individual for money laundering and, as  part of its investigation, gathered evidence that indicated that the  defendant was laundering money for a terrorist group, the FBI generally  classified such a case as terrorism-related. On the other hand, if a USAO  prosecuted the defendant and obtained a conviction solely on money  laundering charges, USAO generally classified the conviction in the case as  a money laundering conviction and not a terrorism conviction.", "Although the FBI\u2019s regulatory definition of terrorism refers to cases  involving force and violence, as previously noted, this same regulation also  designates the FBI as the lead agency responsible for investigating both  terrorist activities, and acts in preparation of terrorist activities, within the  statutory jurisdiction of the United States. Thus, a case need not involve  force or violence to be classified by the FBI as terrorism-related. For  example, the FBI may also classify nonviolent crimes (e.g., money  laundering and fraud) as terrorism-related if they are undertaken to  support terrorism-related activities. To capture and track the volume of its  counterterrorism work, the FBI used the classification criteria contained  in its Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines. The Manual,  among other things, set forth multiple classification codes for domestic  and international terrorism investigations and extensive guidance for  agents and squad supervisors to determine the appropriate classification  of an investigation.", "As stated previously, at the time of the Philadelphia Inquirer\u2019s allegation,  EOUSA used a classification system that was based on the charges in an  indictment or the charges for which a defendant were convicted. EOUSA\u2019s  classification guidelines are set forth in the Legal Information On-line  System (LIONS) Users Manual. As outlined in the Manual, for an  international terrorism classification, EOUSA used a representative (but  not exhaustive) list of statutes that may relate to an international terrorist  incident, (e.g., 18 U.S.C. 32 relating to destruction of aircraft or aircraft  facilities and 18 U.S.C. 1203 relating to hostage taking). For a domestic  terrorism classification, the case must involve force or violence or the  threat of force or violence undertaken by an individual or group seeking to  further political or social goals.", "EOUSA\u2019s classification had no bearing on the FBI\u2019s classification of a  conviction resulting from a terrorism-related investigation, according to an  FBI official.

The  Attorney General noted that the attacks of September 11, 2001, had  redefined the mission of DOJ. He described defending the nation and  defending the citizens of America against terrorist attacks as the  department\u2019s first and overriding priority. On November 29, 2001, in a  speech at a U.S. Attorney\u2019s conference, the President said that terrorist  violence on the home front must be prevented and defeated with vigilance,  aggressive investigation, and certain punishment.", "In December 2001, EOUSA issued new procedures for classifying cases as  terrorism-related. Through these new procedures, EOUSA instructed all  USAO district offices to immediately begin using terrorism-related  program codes as the first code to identify and report on criminal and civil  matters and cases arising out of terrorist attacks on the U.S. In addition,  the policy memorandum added a new code to track terrorism-related  hoaxes that had not been previously tracked under the old classification  system. In an August 7, 2002, policy memo, EOUSA added a new code to  track terrorist financing, updated its guidance for classifying  international and domestic terrorism cases, and provided additional  procedures regarding how USAOs are to report terrorism-related cases.  In addition, the August 7, 2002, policy memo, instructed the various  USAOs to retroactively review the classification of cases opened or closed  during fiscal year 2002 to ensure that all cases related to or involving  terrorism-related activities were coded in LIONS and that the most  appropriate terrorism-related or antiterrorism-related criminal program  category code were used. This resulted in the reclassification of  convictions in USAO cases.", "The new policy introduced changes to EOUSA\u2019s classification system.   According to EOUSA officials, under the previous system cases were  classified based on the lead charge for which a defendant was indicted or  convicted. For example, if the lead conviction charge was money  laundering, the primary classification of the case would have been  classified as money laundering, even if terrorism-related purposes were  also evident during the investigation. Under the new system, a case of this  nature would result in the case being classified as a terrorism-related  conviction.
