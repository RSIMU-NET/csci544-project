Chemicals are used to produce items widely used throughout society, such as cleansers and plastics as well as industrial solvents and additives. However, some chemicals, such as lead and mercury, are highly toxic at certain doses and need to be regulated because of health and safety concerns. In 1976, the Congress passed the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) to authorize the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control chemicals that pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. This testimony is based on GAO's June 2005 report, Chemical Regulation: Options Exist to Improve EPA's Ability to Assess Health Risks and Manage Its Chemical Review Program (GAO-05-458). GAO's report describes EPA's efforts to (1) assess chemicals used in commerce, (2) control the use of chemicals not yet in commerce, and (3) publicly disclose information provided by chemical companies under TSCA. GAO recommended that the Congress consider providing EPA additional authorities under TSCA to improve EPA's ability to assess chemical risks, and that the EPA Administrator take several actions to improve EPA's management of its chemical review program. EPA did not disagree with our findings and is currently implementing some of our recommendations."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["EPA's authority under TSCA to obtain the data needed to assess existing chemicals does not facilitate its review process because the costly and time-consuming burden of obtaining the data is on EPA, rather than chemical companies. Consequently, EPA has used its authorities to require testing of fewer than 200 of the 62,000 chemicals in commerce when EPA began reviewing chemicals under TSCA in 1979. To obtain more data on existing chemicals, EPA implemented its High Production Volume Challenge Program, under which chemical companies voluntarily provide test data on about 2,800 chemicals produced or imported in amounts of 1 million pounds or more a year. While the purpose of the program is laudable, several problems remain, including that the chemical industry has not agreed to provide test data for over 200 chemicals with high production volumes. Moreover, after obtaining test data, EPA is required under TSCA's provisions to determine that a chemical poses an unreasonable risk before EPA can act to regulate its production or use. EPA officials say the act's legal standards for demonstrating unreasonable risk are so high that they have generally discouraged EPA from using its authorities to ban or restrict the manufacture or use of existing chemicals. Since Congress enacted TSCA in 1976, EPA has issued regulations to ban or limit the production of only five existing chemicals or groups of chemicals. EPA's reviews of new chemicals provide only limited assurance that health and environmental risks are identified because TSCA does not require companies to test chemicals before they notify EPA of their intent to manufacture the chemicals. Because of a general lack of data on new chemicals, EPA has developed methods to predict their potential exposure and toxicity levels by using scientific models to compare the new chemicals with chemicals that have similar molecular structures and for which toxicity information is available. However, the use of these models can be problematic because the models are not always accurate in predicting chemical properties and EPA's evaluation of general health effects of the chemicals is contingent upon the availability of information on chemicals with similar molecular structures. Additionally, the estimates of a chemical's production volume and anticipated uses, which EPA uses to assess exposure, can change substantially after EPA completes its review. Despite these limitations, EPA's reviews have resulted in some action being taken to reduce the risks of over 3,600 new chemicals. EPA's ability to provide the public with information on chemical production and risk is generally limited by the confidential business information provisions of TSCA. As a result, state agencies and foreign governments interested in obtaining this data for important purposes are denied access to the information. Recently, chemical companies have expressed interest in working with EPA to identify ways of enabling the agency to share confidential information with other organizations, provided that appropriate safeguards are adopted to prevent the unauthorized use of the information."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to appear today before the Senate Committee on  Environment and Public Works, to discuss our work on the Environmental  Protection Agency\u2019s (EPA) implementation of the Toxic Substances  Control Act (TSCA). Tens of thousands of chemicals are currently in  commercial use in the United States and, on average, over 700 new  chemicals are introduced into commerce each year. Although these  chemicals are an integral component in the production of important goods  and services, some may be toxic and may adversely affect human health  and/or the environment. It was in this context, that the Congress passed  TSCA in 1976, authorizing EPA to obtain manufacturer information on the  risks of chemicals and to control those that EPA determines will pose an  unreasonable risk.", "TSCA addresses those chemicals manufactured, imported, processed,  distributed in commerce, used, or disposed of in the United States, but  excludes certain substances including pesticides regulated under the  Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) and food  additives, drugs, and cosmetics regulated under the Federal Food, Drug,  and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA). TSCA authorizes EPA to review those  chemicals already in commerce \u2013 what are referred to as existing  chemicals \u2014 and to assess chemicals before they enter commerce \u2013 so- called new chemicals. EPA lists chemicals currently in commerce in the  TSCA inventory. Of the over 82,000 chemicals currently in the TSCA  inventory, about 62,000 were already in commerce when EPA began  reviewing chemicals in 1979. Since then, approximately 20,000 new  chemicals were added to the inventory and are now in use as existing  chemicals.", "Prior to the passage of TSCA, chemical substances generally entered the  marketplace without review or controls. Without government intervention,  and often with little or no knowledge of their potential adverse health and  environmental impacts, some of these chemicals were produced and used  in high volumes. Earlier legislation on clean water and air had primarily  addressed releases of chemicals into the environment. In contrast, TSCA  authorized EPA to control the entire life cycle of chemicals from their  production and distribution to their use and disposal\u2014including options  for the outright banning of chemical substances to mandating  requirements for chemical testing or product labeling. Now, chemical  companies are required to submit to EPA, 90 days before beginning to  manufacture a new chemical, a premanufacture notice containing  information including the chemical\u2019s identity, categories of uses, estimated  production volumes, and any test data possessed by the chemical  company.", "My testimony today, which is based on our June 2005 report, Chemical  Regulation: Options Exist to Improve EPA\u2019s Ability to Assess Health  Risks and Manage Its Chemical Review Program, describes EPA\u2019s  efforts to (1) assess existing chemicals used in commerce, (2) control the  risks of new chemicals not yet in commerce, and (3) publicly disclose  information provided by chemical companies under TSCA.", "In summary, EPA does not routinely assess the human health and  environmental risks of existing chemicals and faces challenges in  obtaining the information necessary to do so. TSCA\u2019s authorities for  collecting data on existing chemicals do not facilitate EPA\u2019s review  process because they generally place the costly and time-consuming  burden of obtaining data on EPA, rather than requiring chemical  companies to develop and submit such data to EPA. Consequently, EPA  has used its authorities to require testing for fewer than 200 of the 62,000  chemicals in commerce when EPA began reviewing chemicals under  TSCA in 1979. Recognizing the need for additional information on existing  chemicals, in the late 1990s EPA implemented its High Production Volume  (HPV) Challenge Program, under which chemical companies have begun  to voluntarily provide test data on about 2,800 chemicals produced or  imported in amounts of 1 million pounds or more a year. While the HPV  Challenge Program is a laudable effort to develop data on these chemicals,  several problems remain, including that the chemical industry has not  agreed to provide testing for over 200 chemicals originally identified in the  HPV Challenge Program and that even with the test data provided under  the program, EPA would need to demonstrate that the chemicals pose  unreasonable risks in order to control their production or use under TSCA.  While TSCA does not define what risk is unreasonable, according to EPA  officials the standard has been difficult to meet. In order to withstand  judicial scrutiny, a TSCA rule must be supported by substantial evidence  in the rulemaking record. In this regard, EPA officials say the act\u2019s legal  standards are so high that they have generally discouraged EPA from using  its authorities to ban or restrict the manufacture or use of chemicals. Since  Congress enacted TSCA in 1976, EPA has issued regulations under the act  to ban or limit the production of only five existing chemicals or groups of  chemicals.", "EPA\u2019s reviews of new chemicals can provide only limited assurance that  health and environmental risks are identified before the chemicals enter  commerce because TSCA does not require chemical companies to test  new chemicals before notifying EPA of their intent to manufacture a  chemical. Furthermore, chemical companies generally do not voluntarily  perform such testing. Because of a general lack of data, EPA has  developed sophisticated methods to predict the potential exposure and  toxicity levels of new chemicals by using scientific models to compare  them with chemicals with similar molecular structures for which toxicity  information is available. However, the use of these models can present  weaknesses in the assessment because the models are not always accurate  in predicting physical chemical properties and the evaluation of general  health effects is contingent on the availability of information on chemicals  with similar molecular structures. Additionally, chemical company  estimates of a chemical\u2019s production volume and anticipated uses  provided in the premanufacture notices that EPA uses to assess exposure,  can change substantially after EPA completes its review and  manufacturing begins. However, these estimates do not have to be  amended by companies unless EPA promulgates a rule determining that a  use of a chemical constitutes a significant new use, which EPA has done  for only a small percentage of new chemicals. Despite limitations in the  information available on new chemicals, EPA\u2019s reviews have resulted in  some action being taken to reduce the risks of over 3,600 new chemicals  submitted for review.", "EPA\u2019s ability to provide the public with information on chemical  production and risk has also been hindered by strict confidential business  information provisions of TSCA. TSCA generally prohibits the disclosure  of confidential business information and, according to EPA officials, about  95 percent of the premanufacture notices for new chemicals contain some  information that is claimed as confidential. While EPA has the authority to  evaluate the appropriateness of confidentiality claims, these efforts are  time and resource-intensive, and the agency does not have the resources  to challenge a significant number of claims. State environmental agencies  and others have expressed interest in obtaining information claimed as  confidential business information for use in various activities, such as  developing contingency plans to alert emergency response personnel to  the presence of highly toxic substances at manufacturing facilities.  Chemical companies recently have expressed interest in working with  EPA to identify ways to enable other organizations to use the information  given the adoption of appropriate safeguards.", "In our June 2005 report, we recommended that the Congress consider  providing EPA additional authorities under TSCA to improve its ability to  assess chemical risks, such as providing the EPA Administrator the  authority to require chemical companies develop test data when  production volumes reach certain levels. We also recommended that the  EPA Administrator take several actions to improve EPA\u2019s management of  its chemical program, including revising its regulations to require that  companies reassert confidentiality claims under TSCA within a certain  time period after the information is initially claimed as confidential. EPA  did not disagree with the report\u2019s findings and is in the process of  implementing several of our recommendations.

While TSCA authorizes the  review of existing chemicals, it generally provides no specific requirement,  time frame, or methodology for doing so. Chemical companies are not  required to develop and submit toxicity information to EPA unless the  agency promulgates a testing rule, thus placing the burden for obtaining  data on EPA. In addition, if chemical company testing shows that a  chemical is not toxic, there is generally no standing requirement that the  chemical companies submit this data to EPA. Consequently, when EPA  decides to review existing chemicals, it generally has only limited  information on the risks of injury the chemicals pose to human health and  the environment.", "EPA officials told us that in cases where chemical companies do not  voluntarily provide test data and health and safety studies in a complete  and timely manner, requiring the testing of existing chemicals of  concern\u2014those chemicals for which some suspicion of harm exists\u2014is  the only practical way to ensure that the agency obtains the needed  information. For example, there are currently over 200 high-production- volume chemicals for which chemical companies have not agreed to  provide the minimal test data that EPA believes are needed to initially  assess their risks. Furthermore, many additional chemicals are likely to be  added to become high production chemicals because the specific  chemicals used in commerce are constantly changing, as are their  production volumes. Chemical industry representatives told us that TSCA  provides EPA with adequate authority to issue rules requiring companies  to provide EPA with any test and exposure data possessed by the  companies, and that EPA could use such authority to obtain company  information on existing chemicals of concern. EPA could then use that  information to determine whether additional rules should be issued to  require companies to perform additional testing of the chemicals.", "However, EPA officials told us that it is time-consuming, costly, and  inefficient for the agency to use a two-step process of (1) issuing rules  under TSCA (which can take months or years to develop) to obtain  exposure data or available test data that the chemical industry does not  voluntarily provide to EPA and then (2) issuing additional rules requiring  companies to perform specific tests necessary to ensure the safety of the  chemicals tested. Officials also said that EPA\u2019s authority under TSCA to  issue rules requiring chemical companies to conduct tests on existing  chemicals has been difficult to use because the agency must first make  certain findings before it can require testing. Specifically, TSCA requires  EPA to find that current data is insufficient; testing is necessary; and that  either (1) the chemical may present an unreasonable risk or (2) that the  chemical is or will be produced in substantial quantities and that there is  or may be substantial human or environmental exposure to the chemical.", "Once EPA has made the required findings, the agency can issue a  proposed rule for public comment, consider the comments it receives, and  promulgate a final rule ordering chemical testing. EPA officials told us that  finalizing rules can take from 2 to 10 years and require the expenditure of  substantial resources. Given the time and resources required, the agency  has issued rules requiring testing for fewer than 200 chemicals. Because  EPA has used authority to issue rules to require testing so sparingly, it has  not continued to maintain information on the cost of implementing these  rules. However, in our October 1994 report on TSCA, we noted that EPA  officials told us that issuing such a rule can cost hundreds of thousands of  dollars.", "Given the difficulties involved in requiring testing, EPA officials do not  believe that TSCA provides an effective means for testing a large number  of existing chemicals. They believe that EPA could review substantially  more chemicals in less time if they had the authority to require chemical  companies to conduct testing and provide test data on chemicals once  they reach a substantial production volume, assuming EPA had first  determined that these data cannot be obtained without testing. We have  long held a similar view based on our reviews involving TSCA, and in our  in June 2005 report, we recommended that the Congress consider giving  EPA the authority to require chemical manufacturers and processors to  develop test data based on substantial production volume and the  necessity for testing."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "EPA Has Had Difficulty Proving That Chemicals Pose Unreasonable Risks and Has Regulated Few Existing Chemicals under TSCA", "paragraphs": ["Even when EPA has toxicity and exposure information on existing  chemicals, the agency stated that it has had difficulty demonstrating that  harmful chemicals pose an unreasonable risk and that they should be  banned or have limits placed on their production or use.

Since the Congress enacted TSCA in 1976, EPA has issued  regulations under the act to ban or limit the production or restrict the use  of only five existing chemicals or chemical classes.

According to EPA, the lack of information on  existing chemicals and the relative difficulty of requiring testing under  TSCA on the scale that would be necessary for the thousands of chemicals  produced at high volumes, has led EPA, in cooperation with chemical  companies, environmental groups, and other interested parties, to  implement a voluntary program to obtain test data on high-production- volume chemicals from chemical companies. The HPV Challenge Program  focuses on obtaining chemical company \u201csponsors\u201d to voluntarily provide  data on the approximately 2,800 chemicals that chemical companies  reported in 1990, that they produced at a high volume\u2014generally over 1  million pounds.", "Through this program, sponsors develop a minimum set of data on the  chemicals, either by gathering available information, using models to  predict the chemicals\u2019 properties, or conducting testing of the chemicals.  EPA plans to use the data collected under the program to prioritize high- production chemicals for further assessment, but it has not yet adopted a  methodology for prioritizing the chemicals or for determining those that  require additional information. In our June 2005 report, we recommended  that EPA develop and implement such a methodology for using  information collected through the HVP Challenge Program to prioritize  chemicals for further review and to identify and obtain additional  information needed to assess their risks. At EPA\u2019s request, a federal  advisory group has proposed a methodology for prioritizing the HPV  Challenge Program chemicals, and EPA anticipates that the agency will  implement the proposal during 2006.", "Nonetheless, other problems exist in the HPV Challenge Program.  Chemical companies have not volunteered to provide data on all the  chemicals currently in the HPV Program. In addition, despite the fact that  companies may begin raising the production volumes of other chemicals,  EPA has no mechanism for placing these chemicals on the HPV Challenge  Program list once they are produced in greater volume.

Chemical companies do not have an incentive to conduct these  tests because they may take over a year to complete, and some tests may  cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. During a review of a new chemical,  EPA evaluates risks by conducting a chemical analysis, searching the  scientific literature, reviewing agency files (including files of related  chemicals that have already been assessed by EPA), analyzing toxicity  data on structurally similar chemicals, calculating potential releases of and  exposures to the chemical, and identifying the chemical\u2019s potential uses.  On the basis of this review, EPA makes a decision to (1) take no action; (2)  require controls on the use, manufacture, processing, distribution in  commerce, or disposal of the chemical pending development of test data;  or (3) ban or otherwise regulate the chemical pending the receipt and  evaluation of test studies performed by the chemical\u2019s manufacturer.  Because EPA generally does not have sufficient data on a chemical\u2019s  properties and effects when reviewing a new chemical, EPA uses a method  known as structure activity relationships analysis to screen and evaluate a  chemical\u2019s toxicity. This method, also referred to as the nearest analogue  approach, involves using models to compare new chemicals with  chemicals with similar molecular structures for which test data on health  and environmental effects are available.", "EPA officials told us that, while the overall accuracy of the models has not  been validated for regulatory purposes, they are effective as screening  tools that allow EPA to focus its attention on the chemicals of greatest  concern\u2014chemicals about which little is known other than that they are  structurally related to known harmful chemicals. By applying approaches  that make conservative predictions, EPA believes that it is more likely to  identify a false positive (where a chemical is determined to be of concern,  but on further analysis is found to be of low concern) than a false negative  (where a chemical is initially viewed as a low concern though on further  analysis is actually of higher concern). According to EPA, only about 20  percent of the premanufacture notices received annually go through the  agency\u2019s more detailed full-review process after they have been initially  screened. That is, according to EPA officials, the majority of new  chemicals submitted for review can be screened out as not requiring  further review because (1) EPA determines on the basis of its screening  models that a chemical has low potential to harm human health or the  environment or (2) on the basis of other information, such as the  anticipated uses, exposures, and releases of the chemicals, only limited  potential risks to people and the environment are expected. In addition,  using these models, EPA identifies for possible regulatory action, those  chemicals belonging to certain chemical categories that based on its prior  experience in reviewing new chemicals are likely to pose potential risks  such that testing or controls are needed.

However, the  potential risk of injury to human health or the environment may increase  when chemical companies increase production levels or expand the uses  of a chemical. To address this potential, TSCA authorizes EPA to  promulgate a rule specifying that a particular use of a chemical would be a  significant new use.

Moreover, EPA\u2019s  ability to provide the public with information on chemical production and  risks is hampered by the strict confidential business information  provisions of TSCA. While protecting such information is a legitimate  concern, TSCA currently prohibits EPA from disclosing much data for  important purposes such as assisting state agencies in carrying out their  environmental management responsibilities and foreign governments in  harmonizing international chemical assessment approaches\u2014a goal  generally shared by these governments and the chemical industry. We  believe the actions that we have recommended to both the Congress and  EPA would go a long way in addressing the challenges EPA faces in  exercising its authorities under TSCA.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my prepared statement.
