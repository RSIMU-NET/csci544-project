In August 1995, Customs considered the Southwest border the drug smugglers\u2019 area of choice, with hundreds of thousands of pounds of cocaine and marijuana shipped from Mexico to the United States yearly, according to intelligence estimates. According to Customs, this environment, with narcotics being smuggled through ports of entry and Customs inspectors seeking to prevent such illegal entries, is typically dangerous, difficult, and contradictory. Customs further stated that \u201cenforcement strategies  producing more determined, violent, smarter, organized, better equipped, and funded violators because of the very high economic incentives to continue their actions.\u201d In its 1994 reorganization report, Customs recognized the continuing controversy over achieving the right balance between enforcing the law and facilitating the flow of conveyances, merchandise, and people into the country.", "From the mid-1960s until the mid-1990s, Customs\u2019 organizational structure included a headquarters, region and district offices, Special Agent in Charge (SAC) offices, and ports of entry. In 1993, Customs created a team to reorganize the Customs Service. Some results of that effort were that Customs moved to a system of management by process and reorganized its field and headquarters structures. In October 1995 Customs reorganized its headquarters, which included creating an Office of Field Operations responsible for overseeing the Customs Management Centers (CMCs) and ports. The Office of Investigations\u2019 responsibilities continued to include overseeing the Special Agents in Charge (SACs) in the field.

In February 1996, Customs updated relevant portions of this report. We also reviewed documents that Customs officials provided that were related to actions taken to implement the recommendations. To expand on the information provided in the Customs-prepared report and to determine if Customs officials knew if the problems identified by the panel still existed, we interviewed Customs officials from offices that were at the time of our review responsible for areas covered by the report, including the Offices of Investigations, Internal Affairs, and Human Resources Management. We also interviewed officials in Customs\u2019 Office of Planning and Evaluation and the Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Inspector General (IG).

The Commissioner created the panel, in part, because of allegations of corruption, harassment, retaliation, mismanagement, and an old-boy network in Customs\u2019 Southwest Region. The panel was made up of nine individuals\u2014five from outside Customs and four from within. It was chaired by the then General Counsel of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, who had formerly been, among other things, Associate Attorney General in the U.S. Justice Department, Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Enforcement, U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Oklahoma, and an FBI agent.", "The panel did its work over an approximately 6-week period, according to its chairman. It conducted over 150 interviews and briefings with Customs employees and non-Customs officials in the Southwest Region and Washington, D.C. The panel looked at two offices within Customs\u2014Enforcement and Internal Affairs. Those non-Customs officials interviewed were said to be key federal, state, and local law enforcement officials. They included employees of the FBI, the Marshals Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and the U.S. Attorneys Office. According to the chairman\u2019s testimony, much of the panel\u2019s information was anecdotal and if the panelists heard it repeatedly, they considered it a finding.", "The chairman further stated in the testimony that the panel did not have subpoena power and it was not a grand jury; nor did it view its work as a law enforcement mission. The panel examined system failures. He said that \u201chat the report concentrated on was assuming the integrity of all the allegations and all the swirling controversy, how could these things happen.\u201d The panel\u2019s suggestions, he added, were to tighten down and firm up disciplinary processes and the management and supervisory structures.", "The panel issued its report in August 1991.

The overall aim of the recommendations was to safeguard the integrity and strengthen the management systems of the Customs Service. While the panel did not determine if the Southwest region situation was representative of the rest of Customs, it believed the implications of the findings and recommendations could be applied to the entire agency.

The apparent breakdown of the management structure in the Southwest Region was precipitated by inadequate and/or inattentive supervision in specific cases. Compounding those situations, managers were unable and/or unwilling to address serious supervisory and management problems. There was an absence of management accountability, and a perception of a collusive relationship between management and Internal Affairs. Customs\u2019 management systems failed to identify and correct these deficiencies.\u201d \u201cThe Blue Ribbon Panel determined that the Office of Internal Affairs (IA), at least in the Southwest Region, did not recognize the gravity of the circumstances that caused the perception of corruption, nor did it promptly initiate or complete certain investigations of related allegations. Non-criminal misconduct and mismanagement matters were explicitly removed from the IA purview. As a result, Internal Affairs did not provide the necessary safeguard to protect the reputation, operations and organizational effectiveness of the Customs Service.\u201d \u201cOffice of Enforcement (OE) activities in the Southwest Region suffer from a lack of national direction and from confused and competing lines of authority that undermine effectiveness. Clearly articulated recruitment, mobility, and career path policies do not exist and the influence of various \u2019old boy\u2019 networks taints the objectivity of the selection process and rating systems.\u201d", "Some of the actions that the panel recommended in the sections on management, the Office of Internal Affairs, and the Office of Enforcement were the following:", "Customs should establish an Office of Organizational Effectiveness (OOE) led by an Associate Commissioner who would report directly to the Commissioner, at a level above the Assistant Commissioners. The Associate Commissioner\u2019s recommended responsibilities included supervising the Assistant Commissioner for Internal Affairs and reforming Customs pursuant to the panel\u2019s recommendations.", "The Office of Internal Affairs should be restructured. Its responsibilities should include the comprehensive and aggressive internal inspection program recommended by the panel and investigation of matters related to mismanagement, criminal misconduct, and serious noncriminal misconduct.", "Direct line authority should be established in the Office of Enforcement from the Assistant Commissioner for Enforcement through the Special Agent in Charge to the agent. Customs should establish a national recruitment policy and mobility policy for the Office of Enforcement.", "Customs accepted the panel\u2019s findings and recommendations almost immediately and took several major actions to implement these recommendations. In April 1992, the Commissioner testified that \u201cthe Customs Service accepted the findings and recommendations of the panel and went to work using teams of managers and executives that we developed, and we have put together a comprehensive implementation plan that is just as hard hitting as the report was.\u201d According to Customs\u2019 1992 report on its implementation of the recommendations, the implementation effort was national in scope and focused on the development or redesign of management systems throughout Customs to prevent a future reoccurrence. A Customs December 1992 written response to the Chairman of the Commerce, Consumer, and Monetary Affairs Subcommittee stated that Customs had \u201cmade implementation of the Panel\u2019s recommendations a top priority and dedicated substantial resources to the effort.\u201d", "According to Customs\u2019 1992 report on its implementation of the recommendations, Customs created a Board of Directors to direct the implementation process. This board included the Commissioner, Deputy Commissioner, senior managers, and the Department of the Treasury IG. In the Commissioner\u2019s testimony for the April 1992 hearing she explained that Customs also established internal task forces of managers and subject matter experts to respond to each recommendation. These task forces designed implementation strategies, action plans, and milestones for implementing the recommendations. In October 1991, the action plans were given to various Assistant Commissioners to continue the implementation efforts in their areas of responsibility. The Board of Directors, among others, monitored these implementation efforts.", "Some of the actions Customs took that were related to the panel\u2019s recommended actions cited above were the following:", "Customs formally established OOE in April 1992 with the appointment of its Associate Commissioner. According to testimony by the Commissioner, the position of the head of OOE was established at a level above the Assistant and Regional Commissioners with commensurate authority and responsibility to oversee the reforms and to compel action as necessary. The Associate Commissioner was also given responsibility for overseeing the Office of Internal Affairs. Customs\u2019 1992 revision to its Organization Handbook stated that OOE was \u201cintended to ensure effective transition to an organization which incorporates reforms called for by the Blue Ribbon Panel. Therefore, the continued necessity for this organization will be reviewed after a three year period and annually thereafter.\u201d The chairman of the panel testified in July 1991 that the decision on whether the Associate Commissioner position should be temporary or permanent is the Commissioner\u2019s decision.", "In December 1992 Customs issued a report describing the progress it had made in implementing the panel\u2019s recommendations. Customs closed OOE in October 1994. According to the acting Associate Commissioner at that time, OOE was closed as part of Customs\u2019 reorganization and the reduction of its headquarters staff. The Director, Office of Planning and Evaluation, stated that when OOE was closed Customs felt it had substantially implemented the key provisions made by the panel and that those recommendations were institutionalized throughout the agency. The recommendations that remained either required additional funding or could be addressed under the reorganized agency. He also stated that Customs\u2019 December 1992 report analyzed the agency\u2019s actions taken regarding the panel\u2019s recommendations and that Customs used that report in making its determination that by October 1994 it had devoted sufficient time and effort to virtually bring the recommendations to a conclusion and would close OOE.", "Customs restructured the Office of Internal Affairs. The Office\u2019s responsibilities included investigating criminal misconduct, serious noncriminal misconduct, and certain mismanagement matters. According to Customs\u2019 1992 report on its implementation of the panel recommendations, while OOE was in place, OOE was to be the recipient of mismanagement allegations. With the abolishment of OOE, according to an IA official, IA is to be the recipient of mismanagement allegations and is to determine if IA should conduct an investigation or should refer the allegation to management. Additionally, while OOE was in existence, OOE was responsible for the internal inspection program. The Office of Internal Affairs became responsible for those inspections when OOE closed.", "Direct line authority was established in the Office of Enforcement in 1991. The Office of Investigations instituted a national recruitment program and has drafted a mobility program."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Implementation Status", "paragraphs": ["To report on the status of the implementation of the recommendations, we used the following implementation categories:", "Fully implemented. The entire wording of the recommendation has been fulfilled, except in cases where the panel did not define terminology. In those instances, we did not assess the recommendation on the basis of the undefined terms. If Customs had implemented the rest of the recommendation, we categorized it as fully implemented.", "Substantially implemented. Either (1) implementation has occurred or action has been taken that, while not responsive to the letter of the recommendation, generally was consistent with its purpose; or (2) a recommendation was not clearly defined; however, Customs took actions that appeared to be responsive to the recommendation.", "Partially implemented. Only a portion of the recommendation has been implemented. When the wording of the recommendation had multiple parts, if one part or a portion of a part had been implemented (but not all parts), we categorized the recommendation as \u201cpartially implemented.\u201d", "Not implemented\u2014action taken. No part of the recommendation has been implemented, but some action has been taken toward the completion of the recommendation. For example, if legislation had been introduced to address the recommendation, but it had not been enacted into law, we categorized the recommendation as \u201cnot implemented\u2014action taken.\u201d", "Not implemented\u2014no action. No part of the recommendation has been completed, and no action has been taken to address the recommendation. Insufficient information. Insufficient or conflicting information prevented us from determining the status of the recommendation.", "We did not evaluate the recommendations or determine whether Customs could or should have implemented them. The implementation status may have varied over time; however, our analysis reflects the status of implementation for most recommendations as of February 1996 with updates on others provided through June 1996. We took a fairly literal reading of the recommendations to determine into which implementation category each recommendation fell. If a subjective or unclear term was not defined in the recommendation, we did not assess the recommendation on the basis of that term. For example, Integrity recommendation 4 said that \u201cInternal Affairs must aggressively monitor and act upon perceptions of Federal, State, and local law enforcement officials ...\u201d The panel did not state what it meant by \u201caggressively;\u201d therefore, we did not assess the recommendation on the basis of whether Internal Affairs\u2019 actions were \u201caggressive.\u201d", "Several of the recommendations made general references to other recommendations in the report. For instance, Integrity recommendation 1 stated that \u201cImplementing this recommendation requires that the Customs Service adopt the recommended restructuring of Internal Affairs discussed elsewhere in this report.\u201d In this and similar instances, we did not attempt to determine which specific recommendations the panel was referring to. Therefore, we did not factor the implementation of those statements into our categorization of the status of the implementation of the recommendation.", "Each recommendation, the supporting material provided by Customs, and our interview write-ups were reviewed by GAO evaluators to determine the implementation status of the recommendations. At least two additional GAO staff reviewed each categorization to reach concurrence on the categorization status.", "Table 1 is a summary of our categorization of the recommendations broken out by the sections of the panel\u2019s report.", "Appendix I shows by recommendation the actions Customs has taken and our assessment of the implementation status.", "Various characteristics of the recommendations should be kept in mind when reading the statistics.", "A number of recommendations were made up of multiple parts. Each part had to be fully implemented for us to categorize the recommendation as fully implemented. In its report, the panel referred to the recommendations\u2019 interlocking relationships, and we found that the report does not contain 50 discrete recommendations. Thus, a portion of one recommendation can be part of a number of recommendations. If Customs did not fully implement that portion of the recommendation, it could affect the implementation category of other recommendations. For example, included in Management recommendation 4 is a statement that raters of key managers should solicit input from other appropriate parts of the Customs organization. Customs did not implement this portion of the recommendation because, according to the Commissioner in her April 1992 testimony, officials in Customs\u2019 Office of Human Resources and a group of managers thought it would diminish accountability within the managers\u2019 chain of command. This portion of the recommendation was also included in Management recommendation 10 and Office of Enforcement recommendation 6; because Customs chose not to implement this portion of the recommendations, we categorized all three as partially implemented.", "Similarly, in some cases, the implementation of one recommendation relied upon the implementation of a particular facet of another recommendation, at least in part. For example, Management recommendation 2 recommends the establishment of a management inspection program in which office inspections are to occur at least every 2 years. Customs has a management inspection program, but inspections are scheduled every 3 or 4 years according to the Director, Management Inspections Division. Thus, when other recommendations state that something should be done through the management inspection process (such as in Integrity recommendation 4, which states that Internal Affairs should monitor and act upon perceptions of law enforcement officials through the management inspection process), we did not classify the recommendation as fully implemented, even if Customs was doing what was recommended, because the inspections were not being done as frequently as recommended."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Customs Officials\u2019 Views on the State of the Problems Identified by the Panel", "paragraphs": ["We asked Customs officials whether they knew if the general and specific problems identified by the panel still existed.

The office reports directly to him, and one of its functions is to look for trends and patterns of systemic noncompliance that are identified through such things as audit reports and cases brought before the Discipline Review Boards.", "The Assistant Commissioner for Internal Affairs explained some ongoing efforts in his office that he believed would assist in identifying potential problem areas. These included the development of performance measures for investigations and management inspections and the development of an automated management inspection information system that he said should improve Internal Affairs\u2019 ability to do trend analyses of inspection findings.", "The Assistant Commissioner for Investigations said that he believed that the Office of Investigations-related problems identified by the panel had diminished significantly. He said the status of the problems varied by issue, and he discussed special agent training as an example. One of the panel\u2019s training recommendations concerned the need for agents to receive continuing formalized in-service training. The Assistant Commissioner believed that training was an area where further enhancement was still needed, and his office had embarked on a training effort that had already resulted in a better trained workforce. Built into this effort were various policies and processes that would allow for evaluation, oversight, and accountability.", "The Assistant Commissioner for Internal Affairs believed that the problems related to Internal Affairs when the panel did its work no longer existed. As an example, he discussed the issue of lengthy investigations. One of the panel\u2019s findings was that \u201cbecause of the failure to conclude investigations, employees who were targets of allegations of serious misconduct and/or perceived integrity violations remain under a cloud of suspicion.\u201d The Assistant Commissioner described actions that Internal Affairs took to diminish this problem and to allow his office to explain the reasons for lengthy cases when they occurred. These actions included making managers take a more hands-on approach in overseeing the investigations, highlighting cases in the automated tracking system when they reached certain time frames, and distributing monthly reports that depicted the ratio of the length of cases by office."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We requested comments on a draft of this report from the Commissioner of Customs or his designee.

Among other things, the program recognizes completion of various career-enhancing assignments, including ones to IA field offices.", "IA\u2019s Special Assistant Commissioner said that IA wants agents with at least 5 to 10 years\u2019 experience as investigators; therefore, IA recruits from OI because it also has a working knowledge of Customs.", "Customs did not fully implement the provision that (1) career paths should include an assignment in IA; and (2) with the exception of Headquarters service, these assignments should require geographical relocations. The Career Development Program is still under review.", "Training recommendation 1: The Customs Service should establish a formal training program tailored to agents operating on the Southwest border. The program should emphasize the integrity concerns, technical law enforcement skills, and professional development unique to operating on the Southwest border.", "Written response: Customs has emphasized a formal training program tailored to Special Agents on the Southwest border. Since October, 1991, seventy-five percent of all Southwest border agents have attended one or more training classes that have included surveillance, undercover operations, and basic and advanced technical training.", "Substantially implemented.", "Updated response: According to the OI Director, Office of Policy and Oversight, at least one training course was tailored for and given to some agents on the Southwest border after the panel\u2019s report. According to the OI Director of Administration, OI does not now have classes tailored specifically for agents on the Southwest border. He said that OI is working on improving training for all the agents. OI has retooled its advanced training classes, the subjects of which mirror OI\u2019s four major investigative areas. It is giving a larger number of these classes in the field than it has in the past so that there will be opportunities for more special agents to take them. According to the Director, Office of Policy and Oversight, each SAC office\u2019s field training officer is to provide training quarterly that can be geared to the office.", "Customs did not have a formal training program tailored to agents operating on the Southwest border as of May 1996. However, OI is retooling and developing training programs that cover the areas identified in this recommendation\u2014integrity, technical law enforcement skills, and professional development. Additionally, the Office of Internal Affairs will be giving a training program dealing with integrity geared to an enforcement operation along the southern border. We believe these efforts are generally consistent with the purpose of this recommendation but not responsive to the letter of the recommendation.", "OI also reworked its special agent refresher seminar and has been giving it in the field. Among the topics covered are integrity and ethics, interviewing, legal issues, professionalism, report writing, and undercover operations.", "According to the OI Director of Administration, OI is developing a leadership/management symposium that will be geared to those who have gone through supervisory training and have been supervisors for a couple of years. Topics to be covered include necessary skills for successful managers, how to lead teams and motivate people, and professional responsibility (including ethics and integrity issues).", "The Special Assistant Commissioner, IA, said that in July 1996 the Office of Internal Affairs will be providing training in concert with a Customs operation covering the southern border, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. The training will be given to special agents and others operating in those locations, and it will include information on Customs\u2019 integrity policy.", "Training recommendation 2: The Customs Service should require Spanish language proficiency for all agents operating on the Southwest border.", "Written response: It is not economically or logistically feasible to require Spanish language proficiency of current employees.", "Not implemented\u2014no action taken.", "Updated response: According to information provided by Customs at an April 1992 congressional hearing that included testimony on the implementation of the panel\u2019s recommendations, in response to this recommendation, Customs stated that it was difficult to make Spanish language mandatory, and there were many downsides to requiring it in terms of hiring and retention.", "Customs is not requiring Spanish language proficiency for all agents operating on the Southwest border. OI is attempting to get funding to train certain agents sent to the Southwest border in the Spanish language.", "According to the OI Director, Office of Policy and Oversight, after the panel\u2019s report Customs tried different types of Spanish language training for special agents. They found, however, that the agents were not reaching the proficiency level needed to interview informants and violators.", "According to the OI Director of Administration, OI is working with another office in Customs to get funding for Spanish language training for four SAC offices. This official also said that the San Diego office has a Spanish language program that it funded out of its own budget.", "Training recommendation 3: All new supervisors must successfully complete in-service supervisory training. Supervisors, at every level, must participate on a periodic basis in a continued supervisory training and performance assessment program.", "Written response: Customs policy requires that all employees selected for initial entry into a supervisory position attend a two week basic supervisory seminar. The seminar includes modern management principles, integrity awareness, internal controls, performance management, discipline and whistleblower concerns and workforce diversity issues. In addition, Customs offers supervisory refresher training designed for supervisors who have not attended Customs supervisory skills development training within the previous three years.", "Partially implemented.", "Updated response: The Director, Management Training Division, Customs Service Academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC), said that Customs has no policy that states supervisors must take refresher training. In April 1996, he said that Customs did provide supervisory refresher training at the Customs Academy at FLETC, up until 1 year ago, but now Customs has not funded such training at FLETC. Some supervisory refresher training is being provided by individual Customs offices. OI is working on a supervisory symposium that has not yet been implemented. The Assistant Commissioner, Human Resources, has an initiative under way to revamp all supervisory training at FLETC, according to an official in Customs\u2019 Office of Planning and Evaluation.", "We categorized this recommendation as \u201cpartially implemented\u201d because, although the provision for new supervisors to successfully complete in-service training was fully implemented, Customs did not fully implement the recommendation\u2019s provision that supervisors, at every level, must participate on a periodic basis in a continued supervisory training and performance assessment program.", "On June 24, 1996, Customs provided an additional written response to its implementation of this recommendation.

The track, however, was not being adhered to, and OI drafted a Career Development Program in 1995. (See Office of Enforcement recommendation 3.)", "He said that with the change in OI\u2019s structure, the drafted Career Development Program has to change. He also said that with the President\u2019s cap on the number of GS-13 to GS-15s and SESers, the number of OI supervisory positions is affected.", "We categorized the implementation of this recommendation as \u201cnot implemented\u2014action taken\u201d because no part of this recommendation has been fully implemented, but some action has been taken toward establishing a Career Development Program (rather than a career track).", "OI\u2019s Director, Office of Policy and Oversight, said that OI does not have a relief supervisor program. She noted that legally, she was not sure that they could tap the same person every time to be a \u201crelief supervisor.\u201d They would have to rotate 120-day supervisory details among the experienced staff.", "Training recommendation 5: The supervisory training and performance assessment program should be constantly re-evaluated to ensure sufficient emphasis on personnel management problems, \u201cwhistleblower\u201d policies, integrity awareness, quality management, institutional loyalty and leadership values.", "Fully implemented.", "Updated response: Customs stated in its 1992 report on the implementation of the panel\u2019s recommendations that in response to the recommendations of the blue ribbon panel, supervisory and management training has been examined and refined. According to the report, to set the tone for these training efforts, the Commissioner promulgated a management philosophy stressing the key themes of leadership, integrity, management accountability, and institutional loyalty. These principles form the foundation of all of the management training programs. The curriculum of the basic supervisory training course has been expanded to include emphasis in areas such as integrity awareness, internal controls, performance management, discipline and whistleblower concerns, and workforce diversity issues.", "The Commissioner\u2019s April 1, 1992, testimony on the panel\u2019s recommendations included Customs\u2019 actions taken to implement the recommendations. Some of these actions were stated in the document as (1) Customs has recently completed a major review of all supervisory programs, (2) both supervisor and manager courses have been updated, and (3) whistleblower training was incorporated in supervisor and manager courses.", "The Director of the Management Training Division at FLETC said that the Assistant Commissioner, Human Resources, established a team that is specifically addressing this recommendation in terms of evaluating the effectiveness of supervisory/managerial training. He said that the team will be addressing such issues as how to evaluate the supervisory/managerial training programs.", "The team\u2019s plan is to assess Customs\u2019 core competencies and identify gaps in these competencies. The team will use assessment tools designed to identify the developmental needs and job strengths of Customs\u2019 managerial pool and to assess the gap in managers\u2019 and supervisors\u2019 competencies.", "Training recommendation 6: The Customs Service should establish a new agent \u201cmentor\u201d program.

This handbook stated that one of the purposes of the program is to improve the professionalism and competence of Special Agent personnel assigned to SAC offices. One of the mentor\u2019s responsibilities is to serve as a professional role model for the trainee.", "Training recommendation 7: The Customs Service should ensure that agents receive continuing formalized in-service training that addresses evolving issues in criminal law enforcement and reinforces adherence to professional standards.", "Written response: Customs agents currently receive training in law enforcement and professional standards.", "Fully implemented.", "Updated response: As discussed under the training recommendation 1 updated response, OI reworked its special agent refresher seminar and has been holding the seminar in the field. OI retooled its advanced courses in its four program areas and has been holding them in the field. They include evolving issues in law enforcement. Additionally, according to the OI Director, Office of Policy and Oversight, each SAC office\u2019s training officer is expected to make arrangements for 8 hours of training on law enforcement issues to be given at the SAC office each quarter. Agents are encouraged but not required to attend the training.", "According to the OI Director of Administration, OI is requiring that the following agents in the field office in which the advanced training is given attend the training: those who are in the group dealing with that issue, who are projected to move into that group, or who have not had the training. The Assistant Commissioner, OI, said he set a goal for the Director of Enforcement Training to ensure that each operational nonsupervisory agent receive refresher or specialized training every 5 years.", "Whistleblowers recommendation 1: Customs employees should be informed of the various avenues for reporting problems that are available to whistleblowers. Alternative channels for reporting grievances should be similarly explained and the use encouraged.", "Written response: In September 1991, a memorandum was issued to all Customs employees concerning the Whistleblower Protection Act (WPA). Employees were also provided a booklet, published by the Merit Systems Protection Board, which contained information on the WPA and identified the employee rights and avenues available to them. Currently, employees make complaints to IA, the Office of Special Counsel or both.", "Fully implemented.", "Updated response: The Customs representatives of OPE, IA, Office of Chief Counsel, and HRM with whom we spoke believed this recommendation concerned avenues for reporting problems of retaliation against whistleblowers. Depending upon the type of retaliation alleged, Customs employees may direct their allegation through the agency\u2019s grievance system (for union employees, this would be the grievance and arbitration procedures as provided in the union agreement); or to the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Furthermore, according to an OPE official, reporting through one avenue does not preclude the employee from reporting through another avenue.", "Information on the grievance system is in Customs\u2019 Policies and Procedures Manual. Discussion of the availability of the grievance and arbitration procedures is in the bargaining unit contract section on \u201cProtection Against Prohibited Personnel Practices.\u201d According to an OPE official, a copy of the contract is to be given to each union employee. This section also states that the employee may raise the matter under a statutory procedure.", "According to an IA official, claims of retaliation that are sent to Internal Affairs are read by one individual to determine if the claim appears to be a whistleblower retaliation claim. If it appears to be so, this individual asks the relevant Internal Affairs agent to tell the complainant that he/she needs to file the complaint with the Office of Special Counsel for investigation. Customs did not have a written policy on this practice. Customs formerly investigated these complaints but no longer does the investigations. (See whistleblowers recommendation 4.) Customs issued a memo in June 1996 to managers in the Internal Affairs field offices telling them that when an employee makes a whistleblower retaliation claim, the employee should be advised to contact OSC.", "Whistleblowers recommendation 2: Comprehensive procedures should be issued to supervisors for dealing with employees who are designated whistleblowers.", "Written response: In September and December 1991, a memorandum was issued to all Assistant and Regional Commissioners and Supervisors and Managers respectively expressing the Commissioner\u2019s commitment to ensuring all employees who made whistleblower disclosures were protected from retaliation and reprisal.", "Fully implemented.", "Updated response: According to a Customs training manager, the procedures for dealing with employees who are designated whistleblowers also have been included in supervisory training since 1992.

Since OOE\u2019s abolishment, Headquarters IA and the Office of Chief Counsel serve as the agency contact for employees and the Office of Special Counsel respectively.", "Substantially implemented.", "Updated response: Although there is no one designated agency point to receive whistleblowing disclosures, Customs officials stated there were a variety of avenues through which employees could report whistleblowing disclosures. In addition to headquarters IA, the Office of Chief Counsel, and the Office of Special Counsel, as mentioned above, Customs representatives of OPE, IA, Office of Chief Counsel, and HRM told us other avenues are available.

Hence, we believe that while the situation is not responsive to the letter of the recommendation, it is generally consistent with its purpose.", "An official from OPE stated that ways in which employees know about one or more of these avenues included: \u2014whistleblowing segments in training courses, such as supervisory and basic inspector training; \u2014a directive in Customs Policies and Procedures Manual on allegation reporting and processing; \u2014the union contract; and \u2014periodic reminders issued by the Department of the Treasury Office of Inspector General.", "Whistleblowers recommendation 4: If the Associate Commissioner receives a complaint and determines that the complainant is a whistleblower, investigation of the whistleblower\u2019s allegations must be given priority in accordance with strict timelines for expeditious completion of the investigation.", "Written response: Determinations on Whistleblower allegations are made by the Office of Chief Counsel and referred to IA for expeditious investigation.", "Substantially implemented.", "Updated response: The Customs representatives of OPE, IA, Office of Chief Counsel, and HRM with whom we spoke believed this recommendation concerned complaints of retaliation. After the panel\u2019s report, Customs hired an investigator formerly with the Office of Special Counsel to do in-house investigations of whistleblower retaliation complaints. According to that individual, he did those investigations expeditiously because they were his only priority. As a result of Customs\u2019 reorganization, in November 1994 Customs ceased to accept whistleblower retaliation complaints for investigation. He said IA does not have the assets to do the investigations. The practice in Customs then was to have the individual who formerly investigated these complaints review any retaliation complaints that came through IA to determine if they appeared to be whistleblower retaliation complaints. If they did, he requested the IA agent who logged the complaint into IA\u2019s tracking system to notify the complainant that he/she needed to file the complaint with the Office of Special Counsel.

OOE no longer exists, however, and the whistleblower complaints are investigated by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC). Because OSC is an agency external to Customs, Customs cannot ensure that Customs employees\u2019 whistleblower allegations are given priority.", "Customs issued a memo in June 1996 to managers in the Internal Affairs field offices stating that if an employee made a whistleblower retaliation claim, the employee should be advised to contact OSC.", "Whistleblowers recommendation 5: No administrative action may be taken against a designated whistleblower until the whistleblower\u2019s allegations have been resolved unless there is no nexus between the whistleblower\u2019s allegations and the alleged misconduct of the whistleblower.

Beginning at the top with Assistant and Regional Commissioners, and working through mid-management levels to first line supervisors, a major training initiative was accomplished: virtually every supervisor in the Customs Service has been trained in whistleblower rights and protections.
