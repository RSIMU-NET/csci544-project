The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) provided states with the option to expand their Medicaid programs, and created new coverage options beginning in 2014, including for American Indians and Alaska Natives. GAO was asked to review how PPACA has affected health care coverage and services for American Indians and Alaska Natives. In this report, GAO describes (1) trends in health insurance coverage and third-party collections at federally operated and tribally operated facilities from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, and (2) the effects of any changes in coverage and collections on these facilities.", "To address these objectives, GAO analyzed IHS data on coverage, third-party collections, and PRC. GAO interviewed IHS officials from headquarters and all 12 area offices, as well as from 17 facilities selected to include a mix of federally operated and tribally operated hospitals and health centers in states that both had and had not expanded their Medicaid programs as of September 2018. GAO interviewed officials from 11 federally operated IHS facilities and 6 tribally operated facilities.", "GAO provided a draft of this report to the Secretary of Health and Human Services for comment.

While all federally operated IHS facilities reported coverage increases, the magnitude of these changes differed by facility, with those located in states that expanded access to Medicaid experiencing the largest increases. Federally operated IHS facilities' third-party collections\u2014that is, payments for enrollees' medical care from public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, or from private insurers\u2014totaled $1.07 billion in fiscal year 2018, increasing 51 percent from fiscal year 2013. Although exact figures were not available, tribally operated facilities, which include hospitals and health centers not run by IHS, also experienced increases in coverage and collections over this period, according to officials from selected facilities and national tribal organizations.", "Increases in health insurance coverage and third-party collections helped federally operated and tribally operated facilities continue their operations and expand the services offered, according to officials from 17 selected facilities. These officials told GAO that their facilities have been increasingly relying on third-party collections to pay for ongoing operations including staff payroll and facility maintenance. Officials at most facilities with increases in third-party collections also stated that they expanded their onsite services, including increasing the volume or scope of services offered by, for example, adding new providers or purchasing medical equipment. Increased coverage and collections also allowed for an expansion in the complexity of services provided offsite through the Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program, which enables patients to obtain needed care from private providers if the patients meet certain requirements and funding is available. According to IHS and facility officials, increases in coverage have allowed some patients to access care offsite using their coverage, and an expansion of onsite services has reduced the need for some patients to access PRC. Officials GAO interviewed from federally operated and tribally operated facilities stated that facilities' expansion of onsite and offsite services has led to enhancements in patients' access to care in some instances."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Indian Health Service (IHS) is responsible for providing health care  for over two million American Indians and Alaska Natives (AI/AN) who are  members or descendants of federally recognized tribes. According to  IHS, its mission is to raise the physical, mental, social, and spiritual health  of AI/AN to the highest level. IHS provides health care services to AI/AN  either directly through a system of federally operated IHS facilities or  indirectly through facilities that are operated by tribes or others. As of  February 2019, IHS, tribes, and tribal organizations operated 46 hospitals  and 353 health centers as well as a range of other types of health  facilities\u2014of which 24 hospitals and 50 health centers were federally  operated IHS facilities. With almost 5 million outpatient visits in fiscal year  2017, federally operated IHS facilities provide mostly primary and  emergency care, as well as some other services, and are located in ten of  IHS\u2019s twelve geographic areas. In certain circumstances when needed  health care services are not available at federally operated or tribally  operated facilities, care may be obtained from private providers and paid  for through IHS\u2019s Purchased/Referred Care (PRC) program.", "AI/AN have experienced long-standing problems accessing needed  health care services and have historically had poorer health than the U.S.  general population, as evidenced by a shorter average life span and  higher incidence of certain medical conditions\u2014many of which can be  mitigated through access to effective preventive primary care services. In  prior reports we have noted that IHS has not been able to pay for all  eligible health care services, leading to an unmet need for health care  among AI/AN. In February 2017, GAO added federal management of  programs that serve Indian tribes and their members to our High Risk List  because inadequate oversight hindered IHS\u2019s ability to ensure that Indian  communities have timely access to quality health care, among other  reasons.", "Like most federal agencies, IHS receives funding through annual  appropriations, which it uses to fund federally operated and tribally  operated facilities throughout the country. These facilities may also bill  public programs such as Medicaid (the federal-state health insurance  program for certain low-income individuals), Medicare (the federal health  insurance program for persons aged 65 and over, and certain others),  and the Department of Veterans Affairs (which provides health care  services for veterans), as well as private insurance, for care provided to  patients. Federally operated and tribally operated facilities are allowed to  retain collections from these payers\u2014referred to as third-party  collections\u2014without an offset to any other appropriations made to IHS.  Unlike funds made available through annual appropriations acts, which  generally must be obligated during the fiscal year for which they were appropriated, third-party collections are available to facilities until  expended.", "Beginning in 2014, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act  (PPACA) provided opportunities to expand coverage of AI/AN through  Medicaid and private health insurance. PPACA also provided that IHS is  the payer of last resort for all health services provided at federally  operated and tribally operated facilities\u2014meaning that enrollees\u2019 health  insurance coverage should pay for care, to the extent of its liability, before  IHS. Increased AI/AN enrollment in health insurance such as Medicaid  may increase revenue for federally operated and tribally operated  facilities, even if the patient population remains constant, if those with  coverage seek care at such facilities. Health insurance may also provide  AI/AN with options to obtain care outside of federally operated or tribally  operated facilities, including more comprehensive health services, if such  options exist in their community.", "In 2013, we reported that most AI/AN were potentially eligible for  expanded coverage created by PPACA, but action was needed to  increase enrollment. You asked us to review how PPACA has affected  AI/AN access to health care. In this report we describe, for fiscal years  2013 through 2018,  1.  trends in health insurance coverage among AI/AN populations served  by federally operated and tribally operated facilities as well as trends  in third-party collections at these facilities, and  2.  the effects of any changes in health insurance coverage and third- party collections on federally operated and tribally operated facilities.", "To describe trends in health insurance coverage among AI/AN  populations served by federally operated and tribally operated facilities, we analyzed IHS data representing the self-reported health insurance  status of patients seeking care at all 73 federally operated IHS hospitals  and health centers that were in operation from fiscal years 2013 through  2018. We also analyzed IHS data on the amount and source of third- party collections at all IHS facilities\u2014including hospitals, health centers,  health clinics or other types of facilities\u2014that were federally operated  throughout this period. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing related documentation, interviewing IHS officials, and  examining the data for missing values and outliers. On the basis of these  steps, we concluded that the data were sufficiently reliable for the  purposes of our reporting objective. Similar aggregate data on trends in  health insurance coverage and collections at tribally operated facilities are  not available because these facilities are not required to report coverage  and collections data to IHS. For information and context on trends in  coverage and collection at federally operated and tribally operated  facilities, we interviewed officials from IHS headquarters and all 12 area  offices, as well as those from 17 facilities, which we selected to include a  mix of federally operated and tribally operated facilities, including  hospitals and health centers ranging in size and location and those  operating in states that had expanded their Medicaid programs as of  September 2018 as well as those that had not. In total, we interviewed  officials from 11 federally operated facilities and 6 tribally operated facilities across 7 states, with 14 facilities located in states that expanded  Medicaid, and 3 located in states that had not. Our findings from these  interviews cannot be generalized to all federally operated or tribally  operated facilities. For context, we also interviewed officials from the  National Indian Health Board, five area Indian health boards which we  selected to include a mix of areas with predominantly tribal facilities as  well as those with federally operated and tribally operated facilities, as  well as officials from the National Congress of American Indians and the  Tribal Self-Governance Advisory Committee.", "To describe the effects of any changes in health insurance coverage and  third-party collections on federally operated and tribally operated facilities  from fiscal years 2013 through 2018, we interviewed IHS officials,  including those at headquarters and all 12 area offices, as well as officials  from the 17 selected facilities.

For  example, officials from three IHS area offices and one tribally operated  facility said they analyzed PRC data to identify the services that patients  were obtaining through that program, and worked to bring those services  onsite. Officials from two federally operated IHS facilities also noted that  they incorporated local tribal input as they identified local needs and  projects to fund.

Our analysis of  IHS data showed that these PRC programs were increasingly able to fund  additional medical priority levels of care each year from fiscal year 2015\u2014 the first year that such data were available\u2014through fiscal year 2018,  with most IHS-administered programs funding care through priority level 4  in fiscal year 2018. (See fig. 8.)", "Officials we interviewed at some of the 17 selected federally operated and  tribally operated facilities that had been able to both expand services  onsite and offsite through PRC funds told us that these changes have  made a large impact on patients\u2019 health and quality of life. For example,  officials at some federally operated IHS facilities reported that having  more providers onsite has allowed them to offer patients more rapid  access to care, and officials from some tribally operated facilities reported  that an expansion of onsite services has allowed them to serve more  patients. Officials at some of the selected federally operated and tribally  operated facilities reported that an expansion of onsite services has also  reduced the need for some patients to travel long distances to obtain  diagnostic services and specialty care through the PRC program. In  addition, officials from two IHS area offices noted that PRC has been able  to pay for services such as patients\u2019 long-awaited knee and hip  replacements, which have enabled patients to return to normal activities  of life and reduce their need for pain management."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report for review and comment to the  Secretary of Health and Human Services.
