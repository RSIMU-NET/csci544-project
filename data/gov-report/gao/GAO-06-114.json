The National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation had most of the programs and spent most of the funds. Officials also reported that evaluations were completed or under way for about half of the programs. While the total numbers of students, graduates, and employees in STEM fields increased, changes in the numbers and percentages of women, minorities, and international students varied during the periods reviewed. From academic year 1995-1996 to 2003-2004, the percentage of students in STEM fields increased from 21 to 23 percent. Changes in the percentages of domestic minority students varied by group. From academic year 1994-1995 to 2002-2003, the number of graduates in STEM fields increased 8 percent, but this was less than the 30 percent increase in graduates in non-STEM fields. International graduates continued to earn about one-third or more of the advanced degrees in three STEM fields. Between calendar years 1994 and 2003, employment in STEM fields increased 23 percent compared to 17 percent in non-STEM fields, and there was no statistically significant change in the percentage of women employees. Educators and others cited several factors that affected students' decisions about pursuing STEM degrees and occupations, and made suggestions to encourage more participation. They said teacher quality at the kindergarten to 12th grades, the mathematics and science courses completed in high school, and a mentor, especially for women and minorities, influenced domestic students' decisions. Also, these sources said that opportunities outside the United States and the visa process affected international students' decisions. To encourage more participation in STEM fields, educators and others made several suggestions. But before adopting any of them, it is important to know the extent to which existing STEM education programs are appropriately targeted and making the best use of available federal resources."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The United States has long been known as a world leader in scientific and  technological innovation.

Some of these programs were designed to increase the numbers of  women and minorities pursuing degrees in STEM fields. In addition, for  many years, thousands of international students came to the United States  to study and work in STEM fields. However, concerns have been raised  about the nation\u2019s ability to maintain its global technological competitive  advantage in the future. In spite of the billions of dollars spent to  encourage students and graduates to pursue studies in STEM fields or  improve STEM educational programs, the percentage of United States  students earning bachelor\u2019s degrees in STEM fields has been relatively  constant\u2014about a third of bachelor\u2019s degrees\u2014since 1977. Furthermore,  after the events of September 11, 2001, the United States established  several new systems and processes to help enhance border security. In  some cases, implementation of these new systems and processes, which  established requirements for several federal agencies, higher education  institutions, and potential students, made it more difficult for international  students to enter this country to study and work.", "In the last few years, many reports and news articles have been published,  and several bills have been introduced in Congress that address issues  related to STEM education and occupations. This report presents  information on (1) the number of federal civilian education programs  funded in fiscal year 2004 that were designed to increase the numbers of  students and graduates pursuing STEM degrees and occupations or  improve educational programs in STEM fields and what agencies report  about their effectiveness; (2) how the numbers, percentages, and  characteristics of students, graduates, and employees in STEM fields have  changed over the years; and (3) factors cited by educators and others as  influencing people\u2019s decisions about pursuing STEM degrees and  occupations, and suggestions that have been made to encourage greater  participation in STEM fields. To determine the number of programs  designed to increase the numbers of students and graduates pursuing  STEM degrees and occupations, we identified 15 federal departments and  agencies as having STEM programs, and we developed and conducted a  survey asking each department or agency to provide information on its  education programs, including information about their effectiveness. We  received responses from 14 of them, the Department of Defense did not  participate, and we determined that at least 13 agencies had STEM  education programs during fiscal year 2004 that met our criteria.", "To describe how the numbers of students, graduates, and employees in  STEM fields have changed, we analyzed and reported data from the  Department of Education\u2019s (Education) National Center for Education  Statistics (NCES) and the Department of Labor\u2019s (Labor) Bureau of Labor  Statistics (BLS). Specifically, as shown in table 1, we used the National  Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and the Integrated  Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) from NCES and the  Current Population Survey (CPS) data from BLS. We assessed the data for  reliability and reasonableness and found them to be sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report.", "To obtain perspectives on the factors that influence people\u2019s decisions  about pursuing STEM degrees and occupations, and to obtain suggestions  for encouraging greater participation in STEM fields, we interviewed  educators and administrators in eight colleges and universities (the  University of California Los Angeles and the University of Southern  California in California; Clark Atlanta University, Georgia Institute of  Technology, and Spelman College in Georgia; the University of Illinois;  Purdue University in Indiana; and Pennsylvania State University). We  selected these colleges and universities to include a mix of public and  private institutions, provide geographic diversity, and include a few  minority-serving institutions, including one (Spelman College) that serves  only women students. In addition, most of the institutions had large total  numbers of students, including international students, enrolled in STEM  fields. We also asked officials from the eight universities to identify  current students to whom we could send an e-mail survey. We received  responses from 31 students from five of these institutions. In addition, we  interviewed federal agency officials and representatives from associations  and education organizations, and analyzed reports on various topics  related to STEM education and occupations. Appendix I contains a more  detailed discussion of our scope and methodology. We conducted our  work between October 2004 and October 2005 in accordance with  generally accepted government auditing standards."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["STEM includes many fields of study and occupations. Based on the  National Science Foundations\u2019 categorization of STEM fields, we  developed STEM fields of study from NCES\u2019s National Postsecondary  Student Aid Study (NPSAS) and Integrated Postsecondary Education Data  System (IPEDS), and identified occupations from BLS\u2019s Current  Population Survey (CPS). Using these data sources, we developed nine  STEM fields for students, eight STEM fields for graduates, and four broad  STEM fields for occupations. Table 2 lists these STEM fields and  occupations and examples of subfields. Additional information on STEM  occupations is provided in appendix I.", "Many of the STEM fields require completion of advanced courses in  mathematics or science, subjects that are introduced and developed at the  kindergarten through 12th grade level, and the federal government has  taken steps to help improve achievement in these and other subjects.  Enacted in 2002, the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLBA) seeks to improve  the academic achievement of all of the nation\u2019s school-aged children.  NCLBA requires that states develop and implement academic content and  achievement standards in mathematics, science and the reading or  language arts. All students are required to participate in statewide  assessments during their elementary and secondary school years.  Improving teacher quality is another goal of NCLBA as a strategy to raise  student academic achievement. Specifically, all teachers teaching core  academic subjects must be highly qualified by the end of the 2005-2006  school year. NCLBA generally defines highly qualified teachers as those  that have (1) a bachelor\u2019s degree, (2) state certification, and (3) subject  area knowledge for each academic subject they teach.", "The federal government also plays a role in coordinating federal science  and technology issues. The National Science and Technology Council  (NSTC) was established in 1993 and is the principal means for the  Administration to coordinate science and technology among the diverse  parts of the federal research and development areas. One objective of  NSTC is to establish clear national goals for federal science and  technology investments in areas ranging from information technologies  and health research to improving transportation systems and  strengthening fundamental research. NSTC is responsible for preparing  research and development strategies that are coordinated across federal  agencies in order to accomplish these multiple national goals.", "In addition, the federal government, universities and colleges, and others  have developed programs to provide opportunities for all students to  pursue STEM education and occupations. Additional steps have been  taken to increase the numbers of women, minorities, and students with  disadvantaged backgrounds in the STEM fields, such as providing  additional academic and research opportunities. According to the 2000  Census, 52 percent of the total U.S. population 18 and over were women;  in 2003, members of racial or ethnic groups constituted from 0.5 percent to  12.6 percent of the civilian labor force (CLF), as shown in table 3.", "In addition to domestic students, international students have pursued  STEM degrees and worked in STEM occupations in the United States. To  do so, international students and scholars must obtain visas. International  students who wish to study in the United States must first apply to a  Student and Exchange Visitor Information System (SEVIS) certified  school. In order to enroll students from other nations, U.S. colleges and  universities must be certified by the Student and Exchange Visitor  Program within the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Immigration and  Customs Enforcement organization. As of February 2004, nearly 9,000  technical schools and colleges and universities had been certified. SEVIS,  is an Internet-based system that maintains data on international students  and exchange visitors before and during their stay in the United States.  Upon admitting a student, the school enters the student\u2019s name and other  information into the SEVIS database. At this time the student may apply  for a student visa. In some cases, a Security Advisory Opinion (SAO) from  the Department of State (State) may be needed to determine whether or  not to issue a visa to the student. SAOs are required for a number of  reasons, including concerns that a visa applicant may engage in the illegal  transfer of sensitive technology. An SAO based on technology transfer  concerns is known as Visas Mantis and, according to State officials, is the  most common type of SAO applied to science applicants. In April 2004,  the Congressional Research Service reported that State maintains a  technology alert list that includes 16 sensitive areas of study. The list was  produced in an effort to help the United States prevent the illegal transfer  of controlled technology and includes chemical and biotechnology  engineering, missile technology, nuclear technology, robotics, and  advanced computer technology.", "Many foreign workers enter the United States annually through the H-1B  visa program, which assists U.S. employers in temporarily filling specialty  occupations. Employed workers may stay in the United States on an H-1B  visa for up to 6 years. The current cap on the number of H-1B visas that  can be granted is 65,000. The law exempts certain workers, however, from  this cap, including those who are employed or have accepted employment  in specified positions.

Officials at two universities said  that some research programs are not open to non-citizens. Such  restrictions may reflect concerns about access to sensitive areas. In  addition to these restrictions, some programs are designed to increase  minority representation in STEM fields.

In addition, several sources noted that mentoring played a  key role in the participation of women and minorities in STEM fields.  Current students from five universities we visited generally agreed with  these observations, and several said that having good mathematics and  science instruction was important to their overall educational success.  International students\u2019 decisions about participating in STEM education  and occupations were affected by opportunities outside the United States  and the visa process. To encourage more student participation in the  STEM fields, university officials, researchers, and others have made  several suggestions, and four were made repeatedly.

Officials at all eight universities we visited  expressed the view that a student\u2019s experience from kindergarten through  the 12th grades played a large role in influencing whether the student  pursued a STEM degree. Officials at one university we visited said that  students pursuing STEM degrees have associated their interests with  teachers who taught them good skills in mathematics or excited them  about science. On the other hand, officials at many of the universities we  visited told us that some teachers were unqualified and unable to impart  the subject matter, causing students to lose interest in mathematics and  science. For example, officials at one university we visited said that some  elementary and secondary teachers do not have sufficient training to  effectively teach students in the STEM fields and that this has an adverse  effect on what students learn in these fields and reduces the interest and  enthusiasm students express in pursuing coursework in high school,  degree programs in college, or careers in these areas.", "Teacher quality issues, in general, have been cited in past reports by  Education. In 2002, Education reported that in the 1999-2000 school year,  14 to 22 percent of middle-grade students taking English, mathematics,  and science were in classes led by teachers without a major, minor, or  certification in these subjects\u2014commonly referred to as \u201cout-of-field\u201d  teachers. Also, approximately 30 to 40 percent of the middle-grade  students in biology/life science, physical science, or English as a second  language/bilingual education classes had teachers lacking these  credentials. At the high school level, 17 percent of students enrolled in  physics and 36 percent of those enrolled in geology/earth/space science  were in classes instructed by out-of-field teachers. The percentages of  students taught by out-of-field teachers were significantly higher when the  criteria used were teacher certification and a major in the subject taught.  For example, 45 percent of the high school students enrolled in  biology/life science and approximately 30 percent of those enrolled in  mathematics, English, and social science classes had out-of-field teachers.  During the 2002-2003 school year, Education reported that the number and  distribution of teachers on waivers\u2014which allowed prospective teachers  in classrooms while they completed their formal training\u2014was  problematic. Also, states reported that the problem of underprepared  teachers was worse on average in districts that serve large proportions of  high-poverty children\u2014the percentage of teachers on waivers was larger  in high-poverty school districts than all other school districts in 39 states.  Moreover, in 2004, Education reported that 48 of the 50 states granted  waivers.", "In addition to teacher quality, students\u2019 high school preparation in  mathematics and science was cited by university officials and others as  affecting students\u2019 success in college-level courses and their decisions  about pursuing STEM degrees and occupations. University officials at six  of the eight universities we visited cited students\u2019 ability to opt out of  mathematics and science courses during high school as a factor that  influenced whether they would participate and succeed in the STEM fields  during undergraduate and graduate school. University officials said, for  example, that because many students had not taken higher-level  mathematics and science courses such as calculus and physics in high  school, they were immediately behind other students who were better  prepared. In July 2005, on the basis of findings from the 2004 National  Assessment of Educational Progress, the National Center for Education  Statistics reported that 17 percent of the 17-year-olds reported that they  had taken calculus, and this represents the highest percentage in any  previous assessment year. In a study that solicited the views of several  hundred students who had left the STEM fields, researchers found that the  effects of inadequate high school preparation contributed to college  students\u2019 decisions to leave the science fields. These researchers found  that approximately 40 percent of those college students who left the  science fields reported some problems related to high school science  preparation. The underpreparation was often linked to problems such as  not understanding calculus; lack of laboratory experience or exposure to  computers, and no introduction to theoretical material or to analytic  modes of thought. Further, 12 current students we interviewed said they  were not adequately prepared for college mathematics or science. For  example, one student stated that her high school courses had been limited  because she attended an all-girls school where the curriculum catered to  students who were not interested in STEM, and so it had been difficult to  obtain the courses that were of interest to her.", "Several other factors were mentioned during our interviews with  university officials, students, and others as influencing decisions about  participation in STEM fields. These factors included relatively low pay in  STEM fields, additional tuition costs to obtain STEM degrees, lack of  commitment on the part of some students to meet the rigorous academic  demands, and the inability of some professors in STEM fields to effectively  impart their knowledge to students in the classrooms. For example,  officials from five universities said that low pay in STEM fields relative to  other fields such as law and business dissuaded students from pursuing  STEM degrees in some areas. Also, in a study that solicited the views of  college students who left the STEM fields as well as those who continued  to pursue STEM degrees, researchers found that students experienced  greater financial difficulties in obtaining their degrees because of the extra  time needed to obtain degrees in certain STEM fields. Researchers also  noted that poor teaching at the university level was the most common  complaint among students who left as well as those who remained in  STEM fields. Students reported that faculty do not like to teach, do not  value teaching as a professional activity, and therefore lack any incentive  to learn to teach effectively. Finally, 11 of the students we interviewed  commented about the need for professors in STEM fields to alter their  methods and to show more interest in teaching to retain students\u2019  attention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Mentoring Cited as a Key Factor Affecting Women\u2019s and Minorities\u2019 STEM Participation Decisions", "paragraphs": ["University officials and students said that mentoring is important for all  students but plays a vital role in the academic experiences of women and  minorities in the STEM fields. Officials at seven of the eight universities  discussed the important role that mentors play, especially for women and  minorities in STEM fields. For example, one professor said that mentors  helped students by advising them on the best track to follow for obtaining  their degrees and achieving professional goals. Also, four students we  interviewed\u2014three women and one man\u2014expressed the importance of  mentors. Specifically, while all four students identified mentoring as  critical to academic success in the STEM fields, two students expressed  their satisfaction since they had mentors, while the other two students  said that it would have been helpful to have had someone who could have  been a mentor or role model.", "Studies have also reported that mentors play a significant role in the  success of women and minorities in the STEM fields. In 2004, some of the  women students and faculty with whom we talked reported a strong  mentor was a crucial part in the academic training of some of the women  participating in sciences, and some women had pursued advanced degrees  because of the encouragement and support of mentors. In September  2000, a congressional commission reported that women were adversely  affected throughout the STEM education pipeline and career path by a  lack of role models and mentors. For example, the report found that girls  rejection of mathematics and science may be partially driven by teachers,  parents, and peers when they subtly, and not so subtly, steer girls away  from the informal technical pastimes (such as working on cars, fixing  bicycles, and changing hardware on computers) and science activities  (such as science fairs and clubs) that too often were still thought of as the  province of boys. In addition, the commission reported that a greater  proportion of women switched out of STEM majors than men, relative to  their representation in the STEM major population. Reasons cited for the  higher attrition rate among women students included lack of role models,  distaste for the competitive nature of science and engineering education,  and inability to obtain adequate academic guidance or advice. Further,  according to the report, women\u2019s retention and graduation in STEM  graduate programs were affected by their interaction with faculty,  integration into the department (versus isolation), and other factors,  including whether there were role models, mentors, and women faculty."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "International Students\u2019 STEM Participation Decisions Were Affected by Opportunities Outside the United States and the Visa Process", "paragraphs": ["Officials at seven of the eight universities visited, along with education  policy experts, told us that competition from other countries for top  international students, and educational or work opportunities, affected  international students\u2019 decisions about studying in the United States.

Also,  university officials told us that students from several countries, including  China and India, were being recruited to attend universities and get jobs in  their own countries. In addition, education organizations and associations  have reported that global competition for the best science and engineering  students and scholars is under way. One organization, NAFSA: Association  of International Educators reported that the international student market  has become highly competitive, and the United States is not competing as  well as other countries.", "According to university officials, international students\u2019 decisions about  pursuing STEM degrees and occupations in the United States were also  influenced by the perceived unwelcoming attitude of Americans and the  visa process. Officials from three of the universities said that the perceived  unwelcoming attitude of Americans had affected the recruitment of  international students to the United States. Also, officials at six of the eight  universities visited expressed their concern about the impact of the  tightened visa procedures and/or increased security measures since  September 11 on international graduate school enrollments. For example,  officials at one university stated that because of the time needed to  process visas, a few students had missed their class start dates. Officials  from one university told us that they were being more proactive in helping  new international students navigate the visa system, to the extent possible.  While some university officials acknowledged that visa processing had  significantly improved, since 2003 several education associations have  requested further changes in U.S. visa policies because of the lengthy  procedures and time needed to obtain approval to enter the country.", "We have reported on various aspects of the visa process, made several  recommendations, and noted that some improvements have been made. In  October 2002 we cited the need for a clear policy on how to balance  national security concerns with the desire to facilitate legitimate travel  when issuing visas and we made several recommendations to help  improve the visa process. In 2003, we reported that the Departments of  State, Homeland Security, and Justice could more effectively manage the  visa function if they had clear and comprehensive policies and procedures  and increased agency coordination and information sharing. In February  2004 and February 2005, we reported on the State Department\u2019s efforts to  improve the program for issuing visas to international science students  and scholars. In 2004 we found that the time to adjudicate a visa depended  largely on whether an applicant had to undergo a security check known as  Visas Mantis, which is designed to protect against sensitive technology  transfers. Based on a random sample of Visas Mantis cases for science  students and scholars, it took State an average of 67 days to complete the  process. In 2005, we reported a significant decline in Visas Mantis  processing times and in the number of cases pending more than 60 days.  We also reported that, in some cases, science students and scholars can  obtain a visa within 24 hours.", "We have also issued several reports on SEVIS operations. In June 2004 we  noted that when SEVIS began operating, significant problems were  reported. For example, colleges and universities and exchange programs  had trouble gaining access to the system, and when access was obtained,  these users\u2019 sessions would \u201ctime out\u201d before they could complete their  tasks. In that report we also noted that SEVIS performance had improved,  but that several key system performance requirements were not being  measured. In March 2005, we reported that the Department of Homeland  Security (DHS) had taken steps to address our recommendations and that  educational organizations generally agreed that SEVIS performance had  continued to improve. However, educational organizations continued to  cite problems, which they believe created hardships for students and  exchange visitors."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Suggestions Were Made to Encourage More Participation in the STEM Fields", "paragraphs": ["To increase the number of students entering STEM fields, officials from  seven universities and others stated that teacher quality needs to improve.  Officials of one university said that kindergarten through 12th grade  classrooms need teachers who are knowledgeable in the mathematics and  science content areas. As previously noted, Education has reported on the  extent to which classes have been taught by teachers with little or no  content knowledge in the STEM fields. The Congressional Commission on  the Advancement of Women and Minorities reported that teacher  effectiveness is the most important element in a good education. The  commission also suggested that boosting teacher effectiveness can do  more to improve education than any other single factor. States are taking  action to meet NCLBA\u2019s requirement of having all teachers of core  academic subjects be highly qualified by the end of the 2005-2006 school  year.", "University officials and some students suggested that better preparation  and mandatory courses in mathematics and science were needed for  students during their kindergarten through 12th grade school years.  Officials from five universities suggested that mandatory mathematics and  science courses, especially in high school, may lead to increased student  interest and preparation in the STEM fields. With a greater interest and  depth of knowledge, students would be better prepared and more inclined  to pursue STEM degrees in college. Further, nearly half of the students  who replied to this question suggested that students needed additional  mathematics and science training prior to college. However, adding  mathematics and science classes has resource implications, since more  teachers in these subjects would be needed. Also this change could require  curriculum policy changes that would take time to implement.", "More outreach, especially to women and minorities from kindergarten  through the 12th grade, was suggested by university officials, students, and  other organizations. Officials from six of the universities we visited  suggested that increased outreach activities are needed to help create  more interest in mathematics and science for younger students. For  example, at one university we visited, officials told us that through inviting  students to their campuses or visiting local schools, they have provided  some students with opportunities to engage in science laboratories and  hands-on activities that foster interest and excitement for students and can  make these fields more relevant in their lives. Officials from another  university told us that these experiences were especially important for  women and minorities who might not have otherwise had these  opportunities. The current students we interviewed also suggested more  outreach activities. Specifically, two students said that outreach was  needed to further stimulate students\u2019 interest in the STEM fields. One  organization, Building Engineering and Science Talent (BEST), suggested  that research universities increase their presence in prekindergarten  through 12th grade mathematics and science education in order to  strengthen domestic students\u2019 interests and abilities. BEST reported that  one model producing results entailed universities adopting students from  low-income school districts from 7th through 12th grades and providing  them advanced instruction in algebra, chemistry, physics, and  trigonometry. However, officials at one university told us that because of  limited resources, their efforts were constrained and only a few students  would benefit from this type of outreach.", "Furthermore, university officials from the eight schools and other  education organizations made suggestions regarding the role of the federal  government. University officials suggested that the federal government  could enhance its role in STEM education by providing more effective  leadership through developing and implementing a national agenda for  STEM education and increasing federal funding for academic research.  Officials at six universities suggested that the federal government  undertake a new initiative modeled after the National Defense Education  Act of 1958, enacted in response to the former Soviet Union\u2019s achievement  in its space program, which provided new funding for mathematics and  science education and training at all education levels. In June 2005, CGS  called for a renewed commitment to graduate education by the federal  government through actions such as providing funds to support students  trained at the doctoral level in the sciences, technology, engineering, and  mathematics; expanding U.S. citizen participation in doctoral study in  selected fields through graduate support awarded competitively to  universities across the country; requiring recruitment, outreach, and  mentoring activities that promote greater participation and success,  especially for underrepresented groups; and fostering interdisciplinary  research preparation. In August 2003, the National Science Board  recommended that the federal government direct substantial new support  to students and institutions in order to improve success in science and  engineering studies by domestic undergraduate students from all  demographic groups. According to this report, such support could include  scholarships and other forms of financial assistance to students, incentives  to institutions to expand and improve the quality of their science and  engineering programs in areas in which degree attainment is insufficient,  financial support to community colleges to increase the success of  students in transferring to 4-year science and engineering programs, and  expanded funding for programs that best succeed in graduating  underrepresented minorities and women in science and engineering. BEST  also suggested that the federal government allocate additional resources  to expand the mathematics and science education opportunities for  underrepresented groups. However, little is known about how well federal  resources have been used in the past. Changes that would require  additional federal funds would likely have an impact on other federal  programs, given the nation\u2019s limited resources and growing fiscal  imbalance, and changing the federal role could take several years."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["While the total numbers of STEM graduates have increased, some fields  have experienced declines, especially at the master\u2019s and doctoral levels.  Given the trends in the numbers and percentages of students pursuing  STEM degrees, particularly advanced degrees, and recent developments  that have influenced international students\u2019 decisions about pursuing  degrees in the United States, it is uncertain whether the number of STEM  graduates will be sufficient to meet future academic and employment  needs and help the country maintain its technological competitive  advantage. Moreover, it is too early to tell if the declines in international  graduate student enrollments will continue in the future. In terms of  employment, despite some gains, the percentage of women in the STEM  workforce has not changed significantly, minority employees remain  underrepresented, and many with degrees in STEM fields are not  employed in STEM occupations.", "To help improve the trends in the numbers of students, graduates, and  employees in STEM fields, university officials and others made several  suggestions, such as increasing the federal commitment to STEM  education programs. However, before making changes, it is important to  know the extent to which existing STEM education programs are  appropriately targeted and making the best use of available federal  resources.

Commerce explicitly concurred with  several findings and agreed with our overall conclusion. However,  Commerce suggested that we revise the conclusion to point out that  despite overall increases in STEM students, the numbers of graduates in  certain fields have declined. We modified the concluding observations to  make this point. HHS agreed with our conclusion that it is important to  evaluate ongoing programs to determine the extent to which they are  achieving their desired results. The comments from NSTC cited  improvements made to help ensure that international students, exchange  visitors, and scientists are able to apply for and receive visas in a timely  manner. We did not make any changes to the report since we had cited  another GAO product that discussed such improvements in the visa  process.", "NSF commented about several of our findings. NSF stated that our  program evaluations finding may be misleading largely because the type of  information GAO requested and accepted from agencies was limited to  program level evaluations and did not include evaluations of individual  underlying projects. NSF suggested that we include information on the  range of approaches used to assure program effectiveness. Our finding is  based on agency officials\u2019 responses to a survey question that did not limit  or stipulate the types of evaluations that could have been included.", "Nonetheless, we modified the report to acknowledge that NSF uses  various approaches to evaluate its programs.", "NSF criticized the methodology we used to support our finding on the  factors that influence decisions about pursuing STEM fields and suggested  that we make it clearer in the body of the report that the findings are  based on interviews with educators and administrators from 8 colleges  and universities, and responses from 31 students. Also, NSF suggested that  we improve the report by including corroborating information from  reports and studies. Our finding was not limited to interviews at the 8  colleges and universities and responses from 31 current students but was  also based on interviews with numerous representatives and policy  experts from various organizations as well as findings from research and  reports\u2014which are cited in the body of the report. Using this approach,  we were able to corroborate the testimonial evidence with data from  reports and research as well as to determine whether information in the  reports and research remained accurate by seeking the views of those  currently teaching or studying in STEM fields. As NSF noted, this  approach yielded reasonable observations. Additional information about  our methodology is listed in appendix I, and we added a bibliography that  identifies the reports and research used during the course of this review.", "NSF also commented that the report mentions the NSTC efforts for  interagency collaboration, but does not mention other collaboration  efforts such as the Federal Interagency Committee on Education and the  Federal Interagency Coordinating Council. NSF also pointed out that  interagency collaboration occurs at the program level. We did not modify  the report in response to this comment. In conducting our work, we  determined that the NSTC effort was the primary mechanism for  interagency collaboration focused on STEM programs. The coordinating  groups cited by NSF are focused on different issues. The Federal  Interagency Committee on Education was established to coordinate the  federal programs, policies, and practices affecting education broadly, and  the Federal Interagency Coordinating Council was established to minimize  duplication of programs and activities relating to children with disabilities.", "In addition, NSF provided information to clarify examples related to their  programs that we cited in the report, stated that some data categories  were not clear, and commented on the graduate level enrollment data we  used in the report. NSF pointed out that while its program called  Opportunities for Enhancing Diversity in the Geosciences is designed to  increase participation by minorities, it does not limit eligibility to  minorities. Also, NSF noted that while the draft report correctly indicated  that students receiving scholarships or fellowships from NSF must be U.S.  citizens or permanent residents, the reason given for limiting participation  in these programs in the draft report was not accurate. According to NSF,  these restrictions are considered to be an effective strategy to support its  goal of creating a diverse, competitive and globally engaged U.S.  workforce of scientists, engineers, technologists and well prepared  citizens. We revised the report to reflect these changes. Further, NSF  commented that the data categories were not clear, particularly the  technology degrees and occupations, and that the data did not include  associate degrees. We added information that lists all of the occupations  included in the analysis, and we added footnotes to clarify which data  included associate degrees and which ones did not. In addition,  NSF  commented that the graduate level enrollment data for international  students based on NPSAS data are questionable in comparison with other  available data and that this may be because the NPSAS data include a  relatively small sample for graduate education. We considered using  NPSAS and other data but decided to use the NPSAS data for two reasons:   NPSAS data were more comprehensive and more current.

Using these  resources, we identified 15 agencies with STEM education programs. The  survey was conducted via e-mail using an ActiveX enabled MSWord  attachment. A contact point was designated for each agency, and  questionnaires were sent to that individual. One questionnaire was  completed for each program the agency sponsored. Agency officials were  asked to provide confirming documentation for their responses whenever  possible.", "The questionnaire was forwarded to agencies on February 15, 2005, and  responses were received through early May 2005. We received 244  completed surveys and determined that 207 of them met the criteria for  STEM programs.

In addition, the Health  Resources and Services Administration, Indian Health Service, and  National Institutes of Health, all part of Health and Human Services, took  part in the survey. Also participating were the U.S. Environmental  Protection Agency; the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;  and the National Science Foundation. Labor\u2019s programs did not meet our  criteria for 2004 and the Department of Defense (DOD) did not submit a  survey. According to DOD officials, DOD needed 3 months to complete the  survey and therefore could not provide responses within the time frames  of our work. We obtained varied amounts of documentation from 13  civilian agencies for the 207 STEM education programs funded in 2004 and  information about the effectiveness of some programs.", "Because we administered the survey to all of the known federal agencies  sponsoring STEM education programs, our results are not subject to  sampling error. However, the practical difficulties of conducting any  survey may introduce other types of errors, commonly referred to as  nonsampling errors. For example, differences in how a particular question  is interpreted, the sources of information available to respondents in  answering a question, or the types of people who do not respond can  introduce unwanted variability into the survey results. We included steps  in the development of the survey, the collection of data, and the editing  and analysis of data for the purpose of minimizing such nonsampling  errors. To reduce nonsampling error, the questionnaire was reviewed by  survey specialists and pretested in person with three officials from  agencies familiar with STEM education programs to develop a  questionnaire that was relevant, easy to comprehend, unambiguous, and  unbiased. We made changes to the content and format of the questionnaire  based on the specialists\u2019 reviews and the results of the pretests. To further  reduce nonsampling error, data for this study returned electronically were  entered directly into the instrument by the respondents and converted into  a database for analysis. Completed questionnaires returned as hard copy  were keypunched, and a sample of these records was verified by  comparing them with their corresponding questionnaires, and any errors  were corrected. When the data were analyzed, a second, independent  analyst checked all computer programs.

The study had four primary objectives: (1) to identify  sources of qualitative differences in educational experiences of  science, mathematics, and engineering students at higher educational  institutions of different types; (2) to identify differences in structure,  culture, and pedagogy of science, mathematics, and engineering  departments and the impact on student retention; (3) to compare and  contrast causes of science, mathematics, and engineering students\u2019  attrition by race/ethnicity and gender; and (4) to estimate the relative  importance of factors found to contribute to science, mathematics, and  engineering students\u2019 attrition. The researchers selected seven  universities to represent the types of colleges and universities that  supply most of the nations\u2019 scientists, mathematicians, and engineers.  The types of institutions were selected to test whether there are  differences in educational experiences, culture and pedagogy,  race/ethnicity and gender attrition, and reasons for attrition by type of  institution.
