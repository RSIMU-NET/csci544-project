In 2001, VHA began an initiative, HealtheVet, to modernize its current medical information system. GAO's objectives were to determine the status of the modernization, VA's overall plan for completing it, and how VA is providing oversight to ensure the success of the initiative. To conduct this review, GAO analyzed project documentation and interviewed officials responsible for the development and implementation of the new system."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["As of June 2008, the HealtheVet initiative has these eight major software development projects under way. One project is to further develop the Health Data Repository, a database of standardized health data. This database, which is currently operational, is not yet complete; additional types of health data remain to be standardized and added to the repository. Four application projects are currently in development. One application project is in the planning stage. Two projects are being pursued to enhance current systems, prepare them for transition to HealtheVet, and develop new applications. From 2001 through fiscal year 2007, VA reported spending almost $600 million for these eight projects. The time frame for completing the projects and the HealtheVet system as a whole was 2012, but the projected completion date has now been delayed until 2018. The department has a high-level strategy for HealtheVet, in which the remainder of the initiative is to be completed incrementally in phases (referred to as \"blocks\"), but it does not have a comprehensive project management plan to guide the remaining work. This work is considerable: the department plans to replace the 104 applications in its current medical information system with 67 modernized applications (of which 5 are currently in development, as described), 3 databases, and 10 common services (general software functions, such as messaging and security, on which application software can call as needed). In view of this scope, the importance is increased of developing a comprehensive project management plan that includes, among other things, an integrated schedule that considers all dependencies and defines subtasks to ensure that deadlines are realistic. Another important component of such planning is determining the resources necessary to accomplish tasks throughout the life cycle of the initiative. In April 2008, VA provided an $11 billion cost estimate for completion of HealtheVet; however, it has not yet independently validated this estimate. Having a validated cost estimate is essential to improve the accuracy of cost, schedule, and performance management. Without an integrated plan that includes independently validated cost estimates, VA increases the risk that HealtheVet could incur cost increases and continued schedule slippages and not achieve its intended outcomes. Various levels and types of oversight are currently being provided for the HealtheVet initiative by business owners, developers, and departmental information technology governance boards. However, the business owners have not yet implemented a complete governance structure, several key leadership positions within the developers' organization are either vacant or filled with acting personnel, and the governance boards have not yet scheduled critical reviews of HealtheVet projects. Until all elements of governance and oversight are in place, the risk to the success of the HealtheVet initiative is increased."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) operates the largest health care  delivery system in America, providing health care to more than 5 million  patients in more than 1,000 facilities. The department\u2019s health information  system\u2014the Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology  Architecture (VistA)\u2014is an essential part of health care delivery, helping  to ensure the quality of health care received by the nation\u2019s veterans and  their dependents. The use of VistA, which includes electronic health  records, has been widely credited with improving health care among VA  patients.", "However, VistA currently consists of numerous applications, some of  which have been in operation for more than 20 years and, according to VA,  have become increasingly difficult and costly to maintain. Further, these  applications contain data that are not standardized across VA\u2019s medical  facilities. Standardization is a prerequisite for data to be computable\u2014that  is, acted on by computer applications. Such data can provide important  improvements to health care decision making\u2014for example, allowing  applications to provide alerts to clinicians (for drug allergies) or plot  graphs of changes in vital signs such as blood pressure.", "Accordingly, in 2001, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) began an  initiative to modernize VistA\u2014the HealtheVet initiative. With HealtheVet,  VA plans to standardize patient data and modernize health information  software applications. In doing so, its goal is to move from the hospital- centric environment that has long characterized the department\u2019s health  care operations to a veteran-centric environment built on an open, robust  systems architecture that will more efficiently provide both the same  functions and benefits of the existing system and enhanced functions  based on computable data. The development and implementation of  HealtheVet is also key to achieving electronic medical records that are  interoperable between VA and the Department of Defense (DOD).", "Until the new system is fully implemented, the department continues to  depend on the VistA system, which it intends to maintain concurrently\u2014a  complex task that requires VA to develop interfaces between HealtheVet  and existing VistA software applications to ensure seamless delivery of  care to veterans. According to the department, HealtheVet\u2014the largest  investment in the department\u2019s information technology portfolio\u2014is  scheduled to be fully implemented by 2018 at a total estimated cost of  about $11 billion.", "Given the importance of the HealtheVet project to the department\u2019s efforts  to deliver high-quality health care to veterans, you requested that we  review the department\u2019s continuing efforts to develop and implement the  modernized system. Specifically, our objectives were to determine (1) the  status of the HealtheVet initiative, (2) VA\u2019s overall plan for completing the  initiative, and (3) how the department is providing oversight to ensure the  success of the initiative.", "To achieve our objectives, we analyzed documentation including project  schedules, development plans, technical approach descriptions, funding,  transition plans, information technology governance plans, and  information technology (IT) governance board charters and meeting  minutes. To supplement our analysis, we interviewed officials responsible  for department information technology and the HealtheVet initiative,  including managers of individual HealtheVet projects. The information on  costs that have been incurred for the HealtheVet projects were provided  by VA officials. We did not audit the reported costs and thus cannot attest  to their accuracy or completeness.", "We conducted this performance audit from July 2007 through June 2008 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards. Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the evidence  obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions  based on our audit objectives. For more details on our objectives, scope,  and methodology, see appendix I."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["The current health information system used by VA clinicians is VistA.  Since the inception of this system in 1983, VHA has made numerous  enhancements to its functionality. A significant example was the release  in 1996 of the Computerized Patient Record System, which enabled the  department to provide an individual electronic medical record for each VA  patient. By fiscal year 2007, the implementation of an imaging capability  (VistA Imaging) at all the department\u2019s facilities further enhanced the  system by enabling multimedia data, such as radiology images, to be  linked to a patient\u2019s electronic medical record. These collective  enhancements to VistA resulted in a comprehensive, integrated, electronic  medical record for each patient that is viewable by all of the department\u2019s  clinicians at all of its health care facilities, thus eliminating the need for  paper medical records.", "According to VHA officials, VistA was developed based on close  collaboration between staff in the medical facilities and VHA\u2019s IT  personnel, with the intention of providing a system that met the clinicians\u2019  needs. In this regard, clinicians and IT personnel in the various medical  facilities collaborated to define the system\u2019s requirements and, in certain  cases, carry out its development and implementation. For example,  development of VistA Imaging resulted from a clinician building a  prototype at home before it was fielded at a medical facility. Although  system enhancements to VistA were disseminated through a central office,  staff at a medical center could develop and implement applications at the  local level to facilitate the potentially different functions at each location.", "According to the department, as a result of VHA\u2019s decentralized  development approach, VistA now consists of 104 separate computer  applications. These include 56 health provider applications; 19  management and financial applications; 13 crosscutting applications such  as patient data exchange; 8 registration, enrollment, and eligibility  applications; 5 health data applications; and 3 information and education  applications (app. III contains a complete list of these applications).", "Besides being numerous, these applications have been customized at all  128 VA sites. According to VA, this customization increases the cost of  maintaining the system, as it requires that maintenance also be  customized. VA has reported expending significant resources  (approximately $2.5 billion) to maintain the system between 2001 and  2007.", "Further, according to the department, limitations in the system need to be  addressed for the system to remain effective. As mentioned, some VistA  applications are more than 20 years old, and VistA does not standardize  data, which is a prerequisite to making data computable. In addition,  according to VA, VistA stores data in an organizational format based on  the location where care is provided, rather than maintaining a global  record for each individual patient, and it is programmed in a language for  which there is a continually decreasing supply of qualified software  developers.", "Accordingly, in 2001, VHA undertook the HealtheVet initiative in order to  standardize its health care system and eliminate the approximately 128  different systems used by its field locations. As we reported in 2003, it  planned to develop or enhance specific areas of system functionality  through six projects, which were to be completed between 2006 and 2012  (shown in table 1). These six projects did not represent all the  functionality provided by the 104 VistA applications; rather, they were  high-priority projects that were under way at the time.", "In 2004, VA contracted with the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) for a  technical review of the HealtheVet program. As a result of this review,  SEI concluded, among other things, that VA needed to improve and  integrate the governance of the HealtheVet program, develop an  organizational structure for the program, define the program\u2019s vision, and  define the path for transition from VistA to HealtheVet.", "In 2005, VA began to take action on the SEI recommendations. For  example, the department began to develop a HealtheVet organizational  structure, including defining the responsibilities of a project management  office. In addition, it developed an initial draft for HealtheVet governance  that defined decision-making processes, established guidelines for issue  identification and escalation, defined areas of control and levels of  authority, and established accountability. However, the effort to develop a  governance plan and structure was superseded by a major realignment of  the department\u2019s overall IT management structure.", "This realignment, initiated in October 2005, was undertaken with the goal  of providing greater authority and accountability over VA resources by  centralizing IT management under the department\u2019s CIO; an additional  goal was to standardize operations and systems development across the  department using new management processes based on industry best  practices. Under the department\u2019s realigned structure, the Assistant  Secretary for Information and Technology serves as VA\u2019s CIO.  The CIO is  assisted by one Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary and five Deputy  CIOs. In particular, the Deputy CIO  for Enterprise Development serves  as the chief advisor to the CIO for all enterprise applications development  activities, including HealtheVet; this official heads the Office for  Enterprise Development, which is responsible for performing enterprise  applications development.", "Before the realignment, funding and approval of IT was controlled by each  medical center director, this enabled local IT personnel to make changes  to VistA applications that were specific to the local medical facility. As a  result of the realignment, the funding for all IT development projects,  including both VistA and HealtheVet projects, was moved under the  control of the department\u2019s CIO. The business owners (that is, VHA for  VistA and HealtheVet) retain responsibility for development and  prioritization of requirements and program oversight, while staff in the  Office of Enterprise Development are responsible for planning and  execution of information technology development projects."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "HealtheVet Projects Are Under Way, but Time Frames Have Slipped", "paragraphs": ["As of June 2008, the HealtheVet program has eight major software  development projects under way.

The Health Data Repository (HDR) database, which  became operational in 2006, currently contains standardized health data in  three areas: vital signs, allergies, and outpatient pharmacy. These data  were addressed first because they were given high priority by clinicians.  As we have previously reported, the department is currently using HDR  to help achieve interoperability with DOD to support the exchange of  computable electronic patient information.

The current Billing project is a second attempt to  modernize the billing system. Under the first attempt, VA awarded a  contract in July 2003 to implement a commercial product to provide an  updated billing capability for the department (called at that time the  Patient Financial Services System); however, after about $107 million was  spent on this effort, the contract was terminated in September 2006 by  mutual agreement between the department and the contractor.

Inherent in such planning is the development and use of a project  management plan that describes, among other factors, the project\u2019s scope,  implementation strategy, lines of responsibility, security requirements,  resources, and estimated schedule for development and implementation.  Specifically, an effective project management plan incorporates all the  critical areas of system development and is to be used as a means of  determining what needs to be done and when, and should measure  progress.

To address staffing within the Office of  Enterprise Development, the department stated that it had posted a  vacancy announcement to fill the leadership position for the Program  Management Office. Lastly, the department said it expects final review and  approval of the HealtheVet governance plan by July 2008.
