About 85 percent of these personnel were members of the Army National Guard or the Army Reserve. Furthermore, the availability of reserve component forces will continue to play an important role in the success of DOD's future missions, and DOD has projected that over the next 3 to 5 years, it will continuously have more than 100,000 reserve component members mobilized. Since September, 2001, GAO has issued a number of reports that have dealt with issues related to the increased use of Reserve and National Guard forces. For this hearing, GAO was asked to provide the results of its work on the extent to which DOD has the strategic framework and policies necessary to maximize reserve component force availability for a long-term Global War on Terrorism."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have a strategic framework with human capital goals concerning the availability of its reserve component forces. The manner in which DOD implements its mobilization authorities affects the number of reserve component members available. The partial mobilization authority limits involuntary mobilizations to not more than 1 million reserve component members at any one time, for not more than 24 consecutive months, during a time of national emergency. Under DOD's current implementation of the authority, members can be involuntarily mobilized more than once, but involuntary mobilizations are limited to a cumulative total of 24 months. Given this implementation, DOD could eventually run out of forces. During GAO's 2004 review, DOD was facing shortages of some reserve component personnel, and officials considered changing their implementation of the partial mobilization authority to expand the pool of available personnel. Under the proposed implementation, DOD could have mobilized personnel for less than 24 consecutive months, sent them home for a period, and remobilized them, repeating this cycle indefinitely and providing an essentially unlimited flow of forces. After GAO's review was done, DOD said it would retain its current implementation that limits mobilizations to a cumulative total of 24 months. However, DOD did not clarify how it planned to meet its longer-term requirements for the Global War on Terrorism as additional forces reach the 24-month mobilization point. By June 2004, 30,000 reserve component members had already been mobilized for 24 months. DOD's policies also affect the availability of reserve component members. Many of the policies that affect reserve component availability were focused on the services' short-term requirements or the needs of individual service members rather than on long-term requirements and predictability. For example, DOD implemented stop-loss policies, which are short-term measures that increase force availability by retaining active or reserve component members on active duty beyond the end of their obligated service. Because DOD's various policies were not developed within the context of an overall strategic framework, they underwent numerous changes as DOD strove to meet current requirements, and they did not work together to meet the department's long-term Global War on Terrorism requirements. These policy changes created uncertainties for reserve component members concerning the likelihood of their mobilization, the length of service commitments and overseas rotations, and the types of missions they will have to perform. The uncertainties may affect future retention and recruiting efforts, and indications show that some parts of the force may already be stressed."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to provide this statement for your hearing  on the adequacy of Army forces.", "The Department of Defense (DOD) cannot meet its global commitments  without sizable participation from among its current 1.2 million National  Guard and Reserve members.

We also visited sites where the services  conduct mobilization and demobilization processing and interviewed  responsible officials at those sites. Although we visited sites for all the  services, we focused our review primarily on the Army\u2019s mobilization and  demobilization processes, since more personnel from the Army have been  and are expected to be mobilized than from all the other services  combined.

Mobilization usually begins when the  President invokes a mobilization authority and ends with the voluntary or  involuntary mobilization of an individual Reserve or National Guard  member. Demobilization is the process necessary to release from active  duty units and members of the National Guard and Reserve components  who were ordered to active duty under various legislative authorities.  Mobilization and demobilization times can vary from a matter of hours to  months, depending on a number of factors. For example, many air reserve  component units are required to be available to mobilize within 72 hours,  while Army National Guard brigades may require months of training as  part of their mobilizations. Reserve component members\u2019 usage of accrued  leave can greatly affect demobilization times. Actual demobilization  processing typically takes a matter of days once the member arrives back  in the United States.

The manner in which  DOD implements the mobilization authorities currently available can  result in either an essentially unlimited supply of forces or running out of  forces available for deployment, at least in the short term.", "DOD has used two mobilization authorities to gain involuntary access to  its reserve component forces since 1990. In 1990, the President invoked  Title 10 U.S.C. Section 673b, allowing DOD to mobilize Selected Reserve  members for Operation Desert Shield. The provision was then commonly  referred to as the Presidential Selected Reserve Call-up authority and is  now called the Presidential Reserve Call-up authority. This authority  limits involuntary mobilizations to not more than 200,000 reserve  component members at any one time, for not more than 270 days, for any  operational mission. On January 18, 1991, the President invoked Title 10  U.S.C.

During the  years between Operation Desert Shield and September 11, 2001, DOD  invoked a number of separate mission-specific Presidential Reserve Call- up authorities for operations in Bosnia, Kosovo, Southwest Asia, and Haiti,  and the department did not seek a partial mobilization authority for any of  these operations.", "After the events of September 11, 2001, the President immediately invoked  the partial mobilization authority without a prior Presidential Reserve Call- up. Since the partial mobilization for the Global War on Terrorism went  into effect in 2001, DOD has used both the partial mobilization authority  and the Presidential Reserve Call-up authorities to involuntarily mobilize  reserve component members for operations in the Balkans.", "The manner in which DOD implements the partial mobilization authority  affects the number of reserve component forces available for deployment.

Under this cumulative implementation approach, it  is possible for DOD to run out of forces during an extended conflict, such  as a long-term Global War on Terrorism. During our 2003-2004 review of  mobilization and demobilization issues, DOD was already facing some  critical personnel shortages. At that time, to expand its pool of available  personnel, DOD was considering a policy shift that would have authorized  mobilizations under the partial mobilization authority of up to  24 consecutive months with no limit on cumulative months. Under the  considered approach, DOD would have been able to mobilize its forces for  less than 24 months, send them home, and then remobilize them, repeating  this cycle indefinitely and providing essentially an unlimited flow of  forces. After our review was complete, DOD said it would continue its  implementation of the partial mobilization authority that limits  mobilizations to a cumulative total of 24 months.

DOD officials  stated that they wanted to focus involuntary mobilizations on the paid,  rather than unpaid, members of the reserve components. However, our  prior reports documented the lack of predictability that resulted from the  volunteer and IRR policies. Our August 2003 mobilization report showed  that the policies were disruptive to the integrity of Army units because  there had been a steady flow of personnel among units. Personnel were  transferred from nonmobilizing units to mobilizing units that were short of  personnel, and when the units that had supplied the personnel were later  mobilized, they in turn were short of personnel and had to draw personnel  from still other units. From September 11, 2001 to May 15, 2004, the Army  Reserve mobilized 110,000 reservists, but more than 27,000 of these  reservists were transferred and mobilized with units that they did not  normally train with. In addition, our November 2004 report on the National  Guard noted that between September 11, 2001, and July 2004, the Army  National Guard had transferred over 74,000 personnel to deploying units.  The reluctance to use the IRR is reflected in the differences in usage rates  between Selected Reserve and IRR members. About 42 percent of the  personnel who were members of Selected Reserve on November 30, 2004,  had been mobilized since September 2001, compared to about 3 percent of  the IRR members. Within the Army, use of the IRR had been less than  2 percent. Because the IRR makes up about one-quarter of the Ready  Reserve, policies that discourage the use of the IRR will cause members of  the Selected Reserve to share greater exposure to the hazards associated  with national security and military requirements, and could cause DOD\u2019s  pool of available reserve component personnel to shrink by more than  276,000 personnel."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Stop-Loss Policies", "paragraphs": ["At various times since September 2001, all of the services have had  \u201cstop-loss\u201d policies in effect.

Under that policy,  Army reserve component personnel were not permitted to leave the  service from the time their unit was alerted until 90 days after the date  when their unit was demobilized. Because many Army units undergo  several months of training after being mobilized but before being deployed  overseas for 12 months, stop-loss periods can reach 2 years or more.", "According to Army officials, a substantial number of reserve component  members have been affected by the changing stop-loss policies. As of  June 30, 2004, the Army had over 130,000 reserve component members  mobilized and thousands more alerted or demobilized less than 90 days.  Because they have remaining service obligations, many of these reserve  component members would not have been eligible to leave the Army even  if stop-loss policies had not been in effect. However, from fiscal year 1993  through fiscal year 2001, Army National Guard annual attrition rates  exceeded 16 percent, and Army Reserve rates exceeded 25 percent. Even a  16 percent attrition rate means that 20,800 of the mobilized 130,000 reserve  component soldiers would have left their reserve component each year. If  attrition rates exceed 16 percent or the thousands of personnel who are  alerted or who have been demobilized for less than 90 days are included,  the numbers of personnel affected by stop-loss policies would increase  even more.

Under DOD\u2019s cumulative approach, these  personnel will not be available to meet future requirements under the  current partial mobilization. The shrinking pool of available personnel,  along with the lack of a strategic plan to clarify goals regarding the reserve  component force\u2019s availability, will present the department with additional  short- and long-term challenges as it tries to fill requirements for mobilized  reserve component forces."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["As the Global War on Terrorism stretches into its fourth year, DOD  officials have made it clear that they do not expect the war to end soon.  Furthermore, indications exist that certain components and occupational  specialties are being stressed, and the long-term impact of this stress on  recruiting and retention is unknown. Moreover, although DOD has a  number of rebalancing efforts under way, these efforts will take years to  implement. Because this war is expected to last a long time and requires  far greater reserve component personnel resources than any of the smaller  operations of the previous two decades, DOD can no longer afford  individual policies that are developed to maximize short-term benefits and  must have an integrated set of policies that address both the long-term  requirements for reserve component forces and individual reserve  component members\u2019 needs for predictability.", "For example, service rotation policies are directly tied to other personnel  policies, such as policies concerning the use of the IRR and the extent of  cross training. Policies to fully utilize the IRR would increase the pool of  available servicemembers and would thus decrease the length of time each  member would need to be deployed, based on a static requirement.  Policies that encourage the use of cross-training for lesser-utilized units  could also increase the pool of available servicemembers and decrease the  length of rotations. Until DOD addresses its personnel policies within the  context of an overall strategic framework, it will not have clear visibility  over the forces that are available to meet future requirements. In addition,  it will be unable to provide reserve component members with clear  expectations of their military obligations and the increased predictability  that DOD has recognized is a key factor in retaining reserve component  members who are seeking to successfully balance their military  commitments with family and civilian employment obligations.", "In our previously published reports, we made several recommendations  aimed at increasing the long-term availability of reserve component forces.  In particular, we recommended that DOD develop a strategic framework  that sets human capital goals concerning the availability of its reserve  force to meet the longer-term requirements of the Global War on  Terrorism, and we recommended that DOD identify policies that should be  linked within the context of the strategic framework. DOD generally  agreed with our recommendations concerning long-term availability of  reserve component forces."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Contacts and Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["For answers to questions about this statement, please contact Derek B.
