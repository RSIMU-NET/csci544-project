These threats can be unintentional and intentional, targeted or nontargeted, and can come from a variety of sources, such as foreign nations engaged in espionage and information warfare, criminals, hackers, virus writers, and disgruntled employees and contractors working within an organization. Moreover, these groups and individuals have a variety of attack techniques at their disposal, and cyber exploitation activity has grown more sophisticated, more targeted, and more serious. As government, private sector, and personal activities continue to move to networked operations, as digital systems add ever more capabilities, as wireless systems become more ubiquitous, and as the design, manufacture, and service of information technology have moved overseas, the threat will continue to grow. In the absence of robust security programs, agencies have experienced a wide range of incidents involving data loss or theft, computer intrusions, and privacy breaches, underscoring the need for improved security practices. These developments have led government officials to become increasingly concerned about the potential for a cyber attack. According to GAO reports and annual security reporting, federal systems are not sufficiently protected to consistently thwart cyber threats. Serious and widespread information security control deficiencies continue to place federal assets at risk of inadvertent or deliberate misuse, financial information at risk of unauthorized modification or destruction, sensitive information at risk of inappropriate disclosure, and critical operations at risk of disruption. For example, over the last several years, most agencies have not implemented controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer networks, systems, and information, and weaknesses were reported in such controls at 23 of 24 major agencies for fiscal year 2008. Agencies also did not always configure network devices and service properly, segregate incompatible duties, or ensure that continuity of operations plans contained all essential information. An underlying cause for these weaknesses is that agencies have not yet fully or effectively implemented key elements of their agencywide information security programs. To improve information security, efforts have been initiated that are intended to strengthen the protection of federal information and information systems. For example, the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative was launched in January 2008 and is intended to improve federal efforts to protect against intrusion attempts and anticipate future threats. Until such opportunities are seized and fully exploited and GAO recommendations to mitigate identified control deficiencies and implement agencywide information security programs are fully and effectively implemented, federal information and systems will remain vulnerable."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today\u2019s hearing on  the threats, vulnerabilities, and challenges in securing federal  information systems.

In preparing for this testimony, we  relied on our previous reports on federal information security.  These reports contain detailed overviews of the scope and  methodology we used. We also reviewed inspectors general (IG)  reports on information security, analyzed performance and  accountability reports for 24 major federal agencies, and examined  information provided by the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness  Team (US-CERT) on reported security incidents.", "We conducted our work in support of this testimony during April  and May 2009, in the Washington, D.C. area. The work on which this  testimony is based was performed in accordance with generally  accepted government auditing standards. Those standards require  that we plan and perform audits to obtain sufficient, appropriate  evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe that the  evidence obtained provides a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Background", "paragraphs": ["As computer technology has advanced, federal agencies have  become dependent on computerized information systems to carry  out their operations and to process, maintain, and report essential  information. Virtually all federal operations are supported by  automated systems and electronic data, and agencies would find it  difficult, if not impossible, to carry out their missions, deliver  services to the public, and account for their resources without these  information assets. Information security is thus especially important  for federal agencies to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of their information and information systems.  Conversely, ineffective information security controls can result in  significant risk to a broad array of government operations and  assets. For example:  \u25cf  Resources, such as federal payments and collections, could be lost  or stolen.  \u25cf  Computer resources could be used for unauthorized purposes or to  launch attacks on other computer systems.  \u25cf  Sensitive information, such as taxpayer data, Social Security  records, medical records, intellectual property, and proprietary  business information, could be inappropriately disclosed, browsed,  or copied for purposes of identity theft, espionage, or other types of  crime.  \u25cf  Critical operations, such as those supporting critical infrastructure,  national defense, and emergency services, could be disrupted.  \u25cf  Data could be added, modified, or deleted for purposes of fraud,  subterfuge, or disruption.  \u25cf  Agency missions could be undermined by embarrassing incidents  that result in diminished confidence in the ability of federal  organizations to conduct operations and fulfill their responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Systems and Infrastructures Face Increasing Cyber Threats", "paragraphs": ["Cyber threats to federal information systems and cyber-based  critical infrastructures are evolving and growing. In September 2007,  we reported that these threats can be unintentional and intentional,  targeted or nontargeted, and can come from a variety of sources.  Unintentional threats can be caused by inattentive or untrained  employees, software upgrades, maintenance procedures, and  equipment failures that inadvertently disrupt systems or corrupt  data. Intentional threats include both targeted and nontargeted  attacks. A targeted attack is when a group or individual attacks a  specific system or cyber-based critical infrastructure. A nontargeted  attack occurs when the intended target of the attack is uncertain,  such as when a virus, worm, or other malicious software is released  on the Internet with no specific target.", "Government officials are concerned about attacks from individuals  and groups with malicious intent, such as criminals, terrorists, and  adversarial foreign nations. For example, in February 2009, the  Director of National Intelligence testified that foreign nations and  criminals have targeted government and private sector networks to  gain a competitive advantage and potentially disrupt or destroy  them, and that terrorist groups have expressed a desire to use cyber  attacks as a means to target the United States.  The Federal Bureau  of Investigation has identified multiple sources of threats to our  nation\u2019s critical information systems, including foreign nations  engaged in espionage and information warfare, domestic criminals,  hackers, virus writers, and disgruntled employees and contractors  working within an organization. Table 1 summarizes those groups or  individuals that are considered to be key sources of cyber threats to  our nation\u2019s information systems and cyber infrastructures.", "These groups and individuals have a variety of attack techniques at  their disposal. Furthermore, as we have previously reported, the  techniques have characteristics that can vastly enhance the reach  and impact of their actions, such as the following:  \u25cf  Attackers do not need to be physically close to their targets to  perpetrate a cyber attack.  \u25cf  Technology allows actions to easily cross multiple state and national  borders.  \u25cf  Attacks can be carried out automatically, at high speed, and by  attacking a vast number of victims at the same time.  \u25cf  Attackers can more easily remain anonymous.", "Table 2 identifies the types and techniques of cyber attacks that are  commonly used.", "Government officials are increasingly concerned about the potential  for a cyber attack. According to the Director of National  Intelligence, the growing connectivity between information  systems, the Internet, and other infrastructures creates  opportunities for attackers to disrupt telecommunications, electrical  power, and other critical infrastructures. As government, private  sector, and personal activities continue to move to networked  operations, as digital systems add ever more capabilities, as wireless  systems become more ubiquitous, and as the design, manufacture,  and service of IT have moved overseas, the threat will continue to  grow. Over the past year, cyber exploitation activity has grown more  sophisticated, more targeted, and more serious. For example, the  Director of National Intelligence also stated that, in August 2008, the  Georgian national government\u2019s Web sites were disabled during  hostilities with Russia, which hindered the government\u2019s ability to  communicate its perspective about the conflict.

This activity includes being  the victim or participating in a denial of service attack.   \u25cf  Malicious code: Successful installation of malicious software (e.g.,  virus, worm, Trojan horse, or other code-based malicious entity)  that infects an operating system or application. Agencies are not  required to report malicious logic that has been successfully  quarantined by antivirus software.   \u25cf  Improper usage: A person violates acceptable computing use  policies.  \u25cf  Scans/probes/attempted access: This category includes any activity  that seeks to access or identify a federal agency computer, open  ports, protocols, service, or any combination of these for later  exploit. This activity does not directly result in a compromise or  denial of service.   \u25cf  Investigation: Unconfirmed incidents that are potentially malicious  or anomalous activity deemed by the reporting entity to warrant  further review.", "As noted in figure 2, the three most prevalent types of incidents  reported to US-CERT during fiscal years 2006 through 2008 were  unauthorized access, improper usage, and investigation."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Vulnerabilities Pervade Federal Information Systems", "paragraphs": ["The growing threats and increasing number of reported incidents,  highlight the need for effective information security policies and  practices.

For example:   \u25cf  We reported in September 2008 that although the Los Alamos  National Laboratory (LANL)\u2014one of the nation\u2019s weapons  laboratories\u2014implemented measures to enhance the information  security of its unclassified network, vulnerabilities continued to  exist in several critical areas, including (1) identifying and  authenticating users of the network, (2) encrypting sensitive  information, (3) monitoring and auditing compliance with security  policies, (4) controlling and documenting changes to a computer  system\u2019s hardware and software, and (5) restricting physical access  to computing resources. As a result, sensitive information on the  network\u2014including unclassified controlled nuclear information,  naval nuclear propulsion information, export control information,  and personally identifiable information\u2014were exposed to an  unnecessary risk of compromise. Moreover, the risk was heightened  because about 300 (or 44 percent) of 688 foreign nationals who had  access to the unclassified network as of May 2008 were from  countries classified as sensitive by the Department of Energy, such  as China, India, and Russia.   \u25cf  In May 2008 we reported that the Tennessee Valley Authority  (TVA)\u2014 a federal corporation and the nation\u2019s largest public power  company that generates and transmits electricity using its 52 fossil,  hydro, and nuclear power plants and transmission facilities\u2014had  not fully implemented appropriate security practices to secure the  control systems used to operate its critical infrastructures. Both its  corporate network infrastructure and control systems networks and  devices at individual facilities and plants were vulnerable to  disruption. In addition, the interconnections between TVA\u2019s control  system networks and its corporate network increased the risk that  security weaknesses, on the corporate network could affect control  systems networks and we determined that the control systems were  at increased risk of unauthorized modification or disruption by both  internal and external threats. These deficiencies placed TVA at  increased and unnecessary risk of being unable to respond properly  to a major disruption resulting from an intended or unintended  cyber incident, which could then, in turn, affect the agency\u2019s  operations and its customers."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Weaknesses Persist in All Major Categories of Controls", "paragraphs": ["Vulnerabilities in the form of inadequate information system  controls have been found repeatedly in our prior reports as well as  IG and agency reports. These weaknesses fall into five major  categories of information system controls: (1) access controls,  which ensure that only authorized individuals can read, alter, or  delete data; (2) configuration management controls, which provide  assurance that security features for hardware and software are  identified and implemented and that changes to that configuration  are systematically controlled; (3) segregation of duties, which  reduces the risk that one individual can independently perform  inappropriate actions without detection; (4) continuity of operations  planning, which provides for the prevention of significant  disruptions of computer-dependent operations; and (5) an  agencywide information security program, which provides the  framework for ensuring that risks are understood and that effective  controls are selected and properly implemented. Figure 4 shows the  number of major agencies with weaknesses in these five areas.", "Over the last several years, most agencies have not implemented  controls to sufficiently prevent, limit, or detect access to computer  networks, systems, or information. Our analysis of IG, agency, and  our own reports uncovered that agencies did not have adequate  controls in place to ensure that only authorized individuals could  access or manipulate data on their systems and networks. To  illustrate, weaknesses were reported in such controls at 23 of 24  major agencies for fiscal year 2008. For example, agencies did not  consistently (1) identify and authenticate users to prevent  unauthorized access, (2) enforce the principle of least privilege to  ensure that authorized access was necessary and appropriate,  (3) establish sufficient boundary protection mechanisms, (4) apply  encryption to protect sensitive data on networks and portable  devices, and (5) log, audit, and monitor security-relevant events. At  least nine agencies also lacked effective controls to restrict physical  access to information assets. We previously reported that many of  the data losses occurring at federal agencies over the past few years  were a result of physical thefts or improper safeguarding of systems,  including laptops and other portable devices.", "In addition, agencies did not always configure network devices and  services to prevent unauthorized access and ensure system integrity,  patch key servers and workstations in a timely manner, or segregate  incompatible duties to different individuals or groups so that one  individual does not control all aspects of a process or transaction.  Furthermore, agencies did not always ensure that continuity of  operations plans contained all essential information necessary to  restore services in a timely manner. Weaknesses in these areas  increase the risk of unauthorized use, disclosure, modification, or  loss of information.", "An underlying cause for information security weaknesses identified  at federal agencies is that they have not yet fully or effectively  implemented key elements for an agencywide information security  program. An agencywide security program, required by the Federal  Information Security Management Act, provides a framework and  continuing cycle of activity for assessing and managing risk,  developing and implementing security policies and procedures,  promoting security awareness and training, monitoring the  adequacy of the entity\u2019s computer-related controls through security  tests and evaluations, and implementing remedial actions as  appropriate.

We have also recommended that agencies fully implement  comprehensive, agencywide information security programs by  correcting shortcomings in risk assessments, information security  policies and procedures, security planning, security training, system  tests and evaluations, and remedial actions. The effective  implementation of these recommendations will strengthen the  security posture at these agencies.", "In addition, the White House, the Office of Management and Budget  (OMB), and certain federal agencies have continued or launched  several governmentwide initiatives that are intended to enhance  information security at federal agencies. These key initiatives are  discussed below.   \u25cf  Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative: In January 2008,  President Bush began to implement a series of initiatives aimed  primarily at improving the Department of Homeland Security and  other federal agencies\u2019 efforts to protect against intrusion attempts  and anticipate future threats. While these initiatives have not been  made public, the Director of National Intelligence stated that they  include defensive, offensive, research and development, and  counterintelligence efforts, as well as a project to improve  public/private partnerships.  \u25cf  The Information Systems Security Line of Business: The goal of  this initiative, led by OMB, is to improve the level of information  systems security across government agencies and reduce costs by  sharing common processes and functions for managing information  systems security. Several agencies have been designated as service  providers for IT security awareness training and FISMA reporting.   \u25cf  Federal Desktop Core Configuration: For this initiative, OMB  directed agencies that have Windows XP deployed and plan to  upgrade to Windows Vista operating systems to adopt the security  configurations developed by the National Institute of Standards and  Technology, Department of Defense, and Department of Homeland  Security. The goal of this initiative is to improve information  security and reduce overall IT operating costs.   \u25cf  SmartBUY: This program, led by the General Services  Administration, is to support enterprise-level software management  through the aggregate buying of commercial software  governmentwide in an effort to achieve cost savings through volume  discounts. The SmartBUY initiative was expanded to include  commercial off-the-shelf encryption software and to permit all  federal agencies to participate in the program. The initiative is to  also include licenses for information assurance.  \u25cf  Trusted Internet Connections Initiative: This is an effort designed  to optimize individual agency network services into a common  solution for the federal government. The initiative is to facilitate the  reduction of external connections, including Internet points of  presence, to a target of 50.", "We currently have ongoing work that addresses the status, planning,  and implementation efforts of several of these initiatives.", "In summary, the threats to federal information systems are evolving  and growing, and federal systems are not sufficiently protected to  consistently thwart the threats.

Opportunities exist to improve  information security at federal agencies. The White House, OMB,  and certain federal agencies have initiated efforts that are intended  to strengthen the protection of federal information and information  systems. Until such opportunities are seized and fully exploited, and  agencies fully and effectively implement the hundreds of  recommendations by us and by IGs to mitigate information security  control deficiencies and implement agencywide information  security programs, federal information and systems will remain  vulnerable.", "Chairwoman Watson, this concludes my statement.
