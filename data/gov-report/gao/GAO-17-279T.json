Initial plans to experiment with two different prototype ships adapted from commercial designs were abandoned early in favor of an acquisition approach that committed to numerous ships before proving their capabilities. Cost, schedule, and capability expectations have eroded over time, as shown in the table below. More recently, the Navy attributed a series of engineering casualties on delivered LCS to shortfalls in crew training, seaframe design, and construction quality.", "Concerned about the LCS's survivability and lethality, in 2014 the Secretary of Defense directed the Navy to evaluate alternatives. After rejecting more capable ships based partly on cost, schedule, and industrial base considerations, the Navy chose the existing LCS designs with minor modifications and re-designated the ship as a frigate. Many of the LCS's capabilities are yet to be demonstrated and the frigate's design, cost, and capabilities are not well-defined. The Navy proposes to commit quickly to the frigate in what it calls a block buy of 12 ships.", "Soon, Congress will be asked to make key decisions that have significant funding and oversight implications, but without having important information. The Navy plans to request fiscal year 2018 authorization for its frigate block buy approach. Of note, the pricing the Navy intends to seek from the shipyards will be for 12 basic LCS. Only later will the shipyards submit their proposals for adding frigate capabilities to the LCS hulls. Congress will be asked to authorize this approach many months before the Department of Defense (DOD) prepares an independent cost estimate. Further, there is no industrial base imperative to continue with the Navy's planned pace for the frigate acquisition. LCS workload backlogs, when combined with 2 LCS awarded earlier in 2016 and 2 more planned for award in fiscal year 2017, will take construction at both shipyards into 2021."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO is not making any new recommendations in this statement but has made numerous recommendations to DOD in the past on LCS and frigate acquisition, including strengthening the program's business case before proceeding with acquisition decisions.

GAO has also suggested that Congress take certain actions to support better LCS and frigate outcomes."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss the Department of the Navy\u2019s  Littoral Combat Ship (LCS) and frigate programs. The Navy envisioned a  revolutionary approach to the LCS program. Unlike other surface  combatant programs, LCS consists of two different ship design variants  (called seaframes) with interchangeable mission packages carrying  equipment for three mission areas\u2014surface warfare, anti-submarine  warfare, and mine countermeasures\u2014intended to give the Navy flexibility  to rapidly deploy equipment and incorporate new systems. Coupled with  this approach, the LCS would have a smaller crew that would rely on  shore-based support for its maintenance needs in an effort to reduce life- cycle costs.", "To execute the program, the Navy deviated from traditional shipbuilding  acquisition in hopes of rapidly delivering ships to the fleet. The  consequences of this approach are well known today\u2014costs to construct  the ships have more than doubled from initial expectations, with promised  levels of capability unfulfilled and deliveries significantly delayed.  Acknowledging capability and affordability concerns, the Navy\u2014with the  Secretary of Defense\u2019s approval\u2014changed course in late 2014 to pursue  a more capable frigate based on the LCS concept. The current Secretary  of Defense also directed that the total seaframe buy be reduced from 52  to 40.", "Today, with 26 ships delivered or under contract, the LCS program again  stands at a crossroads. The Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2017 budget request  asked Congress to fund the last two planned LCS. Further, early next  year Congress will need to decide whether to authorize the Navy\u2019s plans  to procure the remaining 12 ships, including funding the lead frigate. With  that context in mind, I will discuss today: (1) how the LCS program has  evolved over time to where it stands today; (2) LCS program cost,  schedule, and performance, including several recent engineering  casualties on delivered ships; (3) key risks in the Navy\u2019s plans for the  frigate based on the LCS program; and (4) remaining oversight  opportunities for the LCS and frigate programs.", "This testimony largely leverages our past reports on the LCS program  from 2005 to 2016.

The Navy planned to experiment with these ships  to determine its preferred design variant. However, in relatively short  order, this experimentation strategy was abandoned in favor of a more  traditional acquisition of over 50 ships. More recently, the Secretary of  Defense questioned the appropriate capability and quantity of the LCS  and directed a re-evaluation of the small surface combatant needs  consistent with frigate-like capabilities. Thus, the program has evolved  from concept experimentation, to LCS, and more recently, to an LCS that  will be upgraded to a frigate. The strategy for contracting and competing  for ship construction has also changed. This evolution is captured in  figure 1.", "While one could argue that a new concept could be expected to evolve  over time, the LCS evolution has been complicated by the fact that major  commitments have been made to build large numbers of ships before  proving their capabilities. Whereas acquisition best practices embrace a  \u201cfly before you buy\u201d approach, the Navy has subscribed to a buy before  you fly approach for LCS. Consequently, budgets were requested and  approved, contracts were awarded, and ship construction was undertaken  at two shipyards. This all happened without adherence to the principles  that lead to sound shipbuilding outcomes\u2014namely, ensuring the maturity  of technologies, requirements, and design before construction begins,  and delaying commitments until testing can prove that needed capabilities  will be delivered.", "As a result, taxpayers have paid for 8 delivered LCS, with 14 more in  some stage of the construction process (including LCS 21, with a planned  December 2016 construction start) without an understanding of the  capability that the ships will ultimately provide and with notable  performance issues discovered among the few ships that have already  been delivered. I will outline these issues in more detail below."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "LCS Cost, Schedule, and Performance Expectations Have Eroded", "paragraphs": ["In addition to significant changes to the acquisition strategy for LCS, the  program has also deviated substantially from expectations about its cost,  schedule, and the capabilities the ship would provide with the seaframes  as well as with the modular mission packages. All the while, the Navy has  continued to request funding to buy more ships and mission packages,  and Congress has appropriated funds. Table 1 compares the Navy\u2019s  initial expectations of the LCS cost, schedule, capabilities, and crewing  concepts with the present version of the program.", "We reported in July 2014 on issues with LCS training, manning, and  maintenance constructs during the 2013 deployment of USS Freedom.  We found that the seaframe crew experienced high workload even though  they were augmented by mission module crew and contractor ship riders,  and that gaps remained in fully training LCS sailors prior to deployment.", "The Navy has attributed a series of recent engineering casualties on  delivered LCS to shortfalls in crew training, seaframe design, and  construction quality. According to the Navy, these failures have resulted  in substantial downtime and costs for repairs or replacements. Table 2  describes the recent major failures at sea.", "However, these types of major incidents are not limited to the past 12  months. For example, LCS 4 also rubbed against the sides of the  Panama Canal locks and experienced hull damage in February 2014  when pieces of the lock penetrated the hull.", "The question may be asked: who pays for these types of damage and  deficiencies? Our past work has found that, by virtue of using guaranty  provisions as opposed to warranties (such as the U.S. Coast Guard  generally uses), the Navy is responsible for paying for the vast majority of  defects. Specifically regarding LCS, we found that for LCS 4, the Navy\u2019s  guaranty provisions were structured such that the Navy paid all of the  costs to correct all defects. For LCS 3, the shipbuilder was responsible for  30 percent of the cost of the first $100,000 in defects\u2014a number the  Navy surpassed just days after delivery. Thus, the Navy was 100 percent  responsible for the costs of all remaining defects. For LCS 5-8, the  shipbuilder is responsible for some portion of the first $1 million in defects  for each ship. Time will tell whether this amount is sufficient to account for  discovered defects.", "Turning to cost and schedule, our recent work has shown that LCS under  construction have exceeded contract cost targets, with the government  responsible for paying for a portion of the cost growth. This growth has  prompted the Navy to request $246 million in additional funding for fiscal  years 2015-2017, largely to address cost overruns on 12 LCS seaframes.  Similarly, deliveries of almost all LCS under contract at both shipyards  (LCS 5-26) have been delayed by several months, and, in some cases,  close to a year or longer. Navy officials recently reported that, despite  having had 5 years of LCS construction to help stabilize ship delivery  expectations, the program would not deliver four LCS in fiscal year 2016  as planned.", "The LCS mission packages have also lagged behind expectations. The  Navy has fallen short of demonstrating that the LCS with its mission  packages can meet the minimum level of capability defined at the  beginning of the program. As figure 2 shows, 24 LCS seaframes will  already be delivered by the time all three mission packages achieve only  a minimum level of capability.", "Since 2007, delivery of the total initial mission package operational  capability has been delayed by about 9 years (from 2011 to 2020) and the  Navy has lowered the level of performance needed to achieve the initial  capability for two packages\u2014surface warfare and mine countermeasures.  As the Navy continues to concurrently deliver seaframes and develop  mission packages, it has become clear that the seaframes and mission  package technologies were not mature and remain largely unproven.", "Another area of concern is changes to the LCS concept of operations as  a consequence of less than expected lethality and survivability. LCS was  designed with reduced requirements as compared to other surface  combatants, and over time the Navy has lowered several survivability and  lethality requirements further and removed some design features\u2014 making the ships less survivable in their expected threat environments  and less lethal than initially planned. This has forced the Navy to redefine  how it plans to operate the ships. Our previous work highlighted the  changes in the LCS\u2019s expected capability, as shown in table 3.", "Further capability changes may be necessary as the Navy continues to  test the seaframes and mission packages, as well as gain greater  operational experience. For example, the Navy has not yet demonstrated  that LCS will achieve its survivability requirements and does not plan to  complete survivability assessments until 2018\u2014after more than 24 ships  are either in the fleet or under construction. The Navy has identified  unknowns related to the Independence variant\u2019s aluminum hull, and  conducted underwater explosion testing in 2016, but the Navy has yet to  compile and report the results. Both variants also sustained some  damage in trials in rough sea conditions, but the Navy has not completed  its analytical reports of these events. Results from air defense and  cybersecurity testing also indicate capability concerns, and both seaframe  variants were found to have significant reliability and maintainability  issues during several tests and trials.", "A final issue I will comment on regarding testing is that the Navy\u2019s Chief  of Naval Operations recently determined that LCS 1-4 will be test ships.  This decision supports an aggressive testing schedule between fiscal  years 2017 and 2022. The Navy noted that testing requirements have  contributed to limited operational availability for delivered LCS. Because  operational testing was not conducted in a timely manner to inform any  needed design changes to seaframes, additional deficiencies discovered  during upcoming tests could require expensive changes to the seaframes  and mission packages that have already been delivered."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frigate Acquisition Strategy Rushes Procurement in Light of Continued Unknowns", "paragraphs": ["The Navy has elected to pursue an acquisition strategy that starts with  getting what it calls block buy pricing from both shipyards for 12 LCS.

Still, many questions remain to  be settled about the frigate\u2019s design, cost, schedule, and capabilities.", "Despite these uncertainties, the Navy\u2019s current acquisition strategy  indicates it intends to request authorization from Congress for all of the  planned frigates\u201412 in total\u2014and for funding the lead frigate before  establishing realistic cost, schedule, and technical parameters.

Navy officials have stated that  the frigate is expected to cost no more than 20 percent\u2014approximately  $100 million\u2014more per ship than the average LCS seaframes, though  this is still just an initial estimate. In addition to the continued cost  uncertainty, the schedule and approach for the frigate acquisition have  undergone substantial changes in the last year, as shown in table 4.", "According to frigate program officials, under the current acquisition  approach, the Navy will award contracts in fiscal year 2017 to each of the  current LCS contractors to construct one LCS with a block buy option for  12 additional LCS\u2014not frigates. Then, the Navy plans to obtain proposals  from both LCS contractors in late 2017 that would upgrade the block buy  option of LCS to frigates using frigate-specific design changes and  modifications. The Navy will evaluate the frigate upgrade packages and  then exercise the option\u2014now for frigates\u2014on the contract that provides  the best value based on tradeoffs between price and technical factors.  This downselect to one shipyard is planned to occur in summer 2018.  Figure 3 illustrates how the Navy plans to modify the fiscal year 2017 LCS  contract to convert the ships in the block buy options to frigates.", "The Navy\u2019s current plan, which moves the frigate award forward from  fiscal year 2019 to fiscal year 2018, is an acceleration that continues a  pattern of committing to buy ships in advance of adequate knowledge.  Specifically, the Navy has planned for its downselect award of the frigate  to occur before detail design of the ship begins. As we previously  reported, awarding a contract before detail design is completed\u2014though  common in Navy ship acquisitions\u2014has resulted in increased ship  prices. Further, without a year of frigate detail design that had been  previously planned before the contract award, the Navy plans to rely on a  contractor-driven design process that is less prescriptive than a  government-driven design process. This approach is similar to what the  Navy used for the original LCS program, whereby the shipyards were  given performance specifications and requirements, selecting the design  and systems that they determined were best suited to fit their designs in a  producible manner. Program officials told us that this new approach  should yield efficiencies; however, history from LCS raises concern that  this approach for the frigate similarly could lead to the ships having non- standard equipment, with less commonality with the other design and the  rest of the Navy."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Frigate Does Not Address All Navy Priorities and Will Likely Carry Forward Some LCS Design Limitations", "paragraphs": ["As LCS costs grew and capabilities diluted, the Secretary of Defense  directed the Navy in February 2014 to explore alternatives to the LCS to  address key deficiencies. In response, the Navy created the Small  Surface Combatant Task Force and directed it to consider new and  existing frigate design options, including different types of modified LCS  designs. As we reported in June 2016, the task force concluded that the  Navy\u2019s desired capability requirements could not be met without major  modifications to an LCS design or utilizing other non-LCS designs. When  presented with this conclusion, senior Navy leadership directed the task  force to explore what capabilities might be more feasible on a minor  modified LCS. This direction led the task force to develop options with  diminished capabilities, such as reduced speed or range, resulting in  some capabilities becoming equal to or below expected capabilities of the  current LCS. Ultimately, the department chose a frigate concept based on  a minor modified LCS in lieu of more capable\u2014and more expensive\u2014 small surface combatant options. Navy leadership indicated this decision  was based on LCS\u2019s relatively lower cost and quicker ability to field, as  well as the ability to upgrade remaining LCS and maintain stability in the  industrial base and vendor supply chain.", "Table 5 presents an analysis from our June 2016 report, which found that  the Navy\u2019s proposed frigate will offer some improvements over LCS. For  example, the Navy plans to equip the frigates with the mission systems  from both the surface and anti-submarine warfare mission packages  simultaneously instead of just one at a time (e.g., in a modular fashion)  like LCS. However, the Navy\u2019s planned frigate upgrades will not result in  significant improvements in survivability areas related to vulnerability\u2014the  ability to withstand initial damage effects from threat weapons\u2014or  recoverability\u2014 the ability of the crew to take emergency action to contain  and control damage.", "Further, the Navy sacrificed capabilities that were prioritized by fleet  operators. For example, fleet operators consistently prioritized a range of  4,000 nautical miles, but the selected frigate concept is as much as 30  percent short of achieving such a range.", "The Director, Operational Test and Evaluation has noted that the Navy\u2019s  proposed frigate design is not substantially different from LCS and does  not add much more redundancy or greater separation of critical  equipment or additional compartmentation, making the frigate likely to be  less survivable than the Navy\u2019s previous frigate class. Further, the Navy  plans to make some similar capability improvements to existing and future  LCS, narrowing the difference between LCS and the frigate. We found  that the proposed frigate does not add any new offensive anti-submarine  or surface warfare capabilities that are not already part of one of the LCS  mission packages, so while the frigate will be able to carry what equates  to two mission packages at once, the capabilities in each mission area  will be the same as LCS. While specific details are classified, there are  only a few areas where there are differences in frigate warfighting  capability compared to the LCS.", "Since it will be based on the LCS designs, the frigate will likely carry  forward some of the limitations of those designs. For example, LCS was  designed to carry a minimally-sized crew of approximately 50. The Navy  has found in various studies that the crew is undersized and made some  modest increases in crew size. A frigate design based on LCS may not be  able to support a significant increase in crew size due to limited space for  berthing and other facilities. Additionally, barring Navy-directed changes  to key mechanical systems, the frigate will carry some of the more failure- prone LCS equipment, such as some propulsion equipment, and will likely  carry some of the non-fleet-standard, LCS-unique equipment that has  challenged the Navy\u2019s support and logistics chain. Uncertainties or needs  that remain with the surface and anti-submarine warfare mission  packages, such as demonstrating operational performance of the surface- to-surface missile and the anti-submarine warfare package, also pose risk  for the frigate based on the Navy\u2019s planned timeframes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Limited Opportunities Remain to Shape LCS and Frigate Programs", "paragraphs": ["Over the past 10 years, we have made recommendations to DOD on a  number of issues with the LCS program. We have also suggested actions  for Congress to consider. Now, with the fiscal year 2018 budget request  imminent, opportunities for Congress to affect the way forward for this  program are becoming limited. This upcoming request, which will include  the start of frigate acquisition, presents Congress with an opportunity to  ensure the Navy possesses sufficient knowledge before making a  substantial commitment to the frigate.", "Our recommendations to DOD since 2005 have largely focused on LCS  combat capability shortfalls and the Navy\u2019s acquisition strategy. While  DOD agreed, at times, with these recommendations, it seldom took action  if a consequence would be to slow LCS procurement, even when doing  so would enable the Navy to build and demonstrate sufficient knowledge  in critical areas. Table 6 highlights some of our past recommendations  and the department\u2019s response.", "In addition to these recommendations to DOD, our past reports have  made suggestions to Congress on actions to support better LCS program  outcomes. For instance, in 2013, we asked Congress to consider  restricting construction funding for additional LCS seaframes until the  Navy had adequate knowledge to mitigate substantial unknowns about  LCS capabilities, use, and costs. Congress responded to our suggestion  in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2014, restricting  the use of funds for LCS seaframes until the Navy submitted information  to the defense committees on LCS requirements, maturity, testing, and  concept of operations. In other cases, however, Congress has opted to  take alternative routes. For example, we suggested in June 2016 that the  Congress consider a pause in LCS procurement funding for fiscal year  2017. In doing so, we noted such a pause would provide the Navy with an  opportunity to address unresolved LCS performance concerns without  creating production problems at the shipyards. However, the Conference  Report accompanying the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal  Year 2017 reflects funding for two more LCS, suggesting that LCS  procurement will continue as planned.", "The Navy\u2019s plans for fiscal year 2018 involve significant decisions for  Congress in terms of the way forward in the immediate future the frigate  program, including potential future commitments of about $9 billion based  on early budget estimates. On the heels of the decision to fund two LCS  in fiscal year 2017 is a decision on whether to authorize the frigate  contracting approach and fund the lead frigate.", "As I noted above, the current acquisition plans for the frigate have been  accelerated during the past year. If these plans hold, the Navy will ask  Congress in a few months to consider authorizing a block buy of 12  frigates and funding the lead frigate when the fiscal year 2018 budget is  proposed. This request appears premature, as it requires Congress to  make a decision on the frigate before detail design has begun and before  the scope and cost of the design changes needed to turn an LCS into a  frigate are well understood. The Navy will not establish its cost estimate  until May 2017\u2014months after requesting authorization from Congress for  the block buy contracting approach for 12 frigates. Further, DOD\u2019s Office  of Cost Assessment and Program Evaluation is not expected to complete  an independent cost estimate on the frigate until fiscal year 2018. This  means that the upcoming budget request is unlikely to reflect the most  current costs for the program moving forward.", "Similar to what we previously have advised about LCS block buy  contracting, a frigate block buy approach also could reduce funding  flexibility. For example, the LCS block buy contracts provide that a failure  to fully fund the purchase of a ship in a given year would make the  contract subject to renegotiation. DOD has pointed to this as a risk that  the contractors would supersede the block buy pricing with higher prices.  Thus, DOD and Congress have had a notable disincentive to take any  action that might delay procurement, even when a program is  underperforming as has been the case with LCS.", "Also, the shipyards\u2019 existing LCS construction workload suggests that a  request to authorize the frigate in early 2017 (with the fiscal year 2018  budget request) may not only be premature, but also unnecessary.  Although the Navy has argued that pausing LCS production would result  in loss of production work and start-up delays to the frigate program, the  schedule suggests that both shipyards have sufficient workload remaining  from prior LCS contract awards that could offset the need to award the  frigate in 2018 as planned. The Navy\u2019s concern also does not account for  any other work that the shipyards may have from other Navy or  commercial contracts and the possibility of continued delays in the  delivery of LCS. As figure 4 depicts, delays that have occurred for  previously funded ships have resulted in a construction workload that  extends into fiscal year 2020. This prolonged workload, when combined  with the two LCS awarded earlier in 2016 and the two LCS planned to be  awarded in fiscal year 2017, takes construction at both shipyards into  2021.", "With 14 LCS in various phases of construction (LCS 9-22) and 3 more  (LCS 23, 24, and 26) set to begin construction later in fiscal year 2017,  delaying a decision on the frigate until fiscal year 2019 would enable the  Navy and the shipbuilders to improve design and cost knowledge.
