One of the most notable differences is the introduction of a new designation for less populated areas--micropolitan statistical areas. These are areas comprised of a central county or counties with at least one urban cluster of at least 10,000 but fewer than 50,000 people, plus adjacent outlying counties if commuting criteria is met. The 2000 standards and the latest population update have resulted in five counties being dropped from metropolitan statistical areas, while another 41counties that had been a part of a metropolitan statistical area have had their statistical status changed and are now components of micropolitan statistical areas. Overall, the 2000 standards have resulted in changes in every state and nationwide statistical coverage has increased. Under the 1990 standards, 847 counties were in metropolitan statistical areas. Now, there are 1090 counties in metropolitan statistical areas and 690 counties in micropolitan statistical areas. Of the four federal programs GAO reviewed to determine the impact of the 2000 standards, eligibility under one has expanded; eligibility under another is expected to expand in January 2005; the agency overseeing another anticipates under its proposal that program payments for fiscal year 2005 will be affected, but with no net increase in funding; and eligibility under another program is unaffected because the geographic boundaries used to determine eligibility are set by statute. For example, the standards have resulted in new eligibility in fiscal year 2004 for 60 cities to receive a total of $36.2 million in Community Development Block Grants, which provide funds to revitalize neighborhood infrastructure. This funding increase required a 1.2 percent funding cut for all other grantees because a cut is required to offset increases due to expanded eligibility."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For the past 50 years, the federal government has had a metropolitan area  program designed to provide consistency in collecting, tabulating, and  publishing federal statistics for geographic areas in the United States and  Puerto Rico.

In 1989, OMB asked the Census Bureau to  examine the concepts underlying the identification and definitions of  metropolitan areas.  The goal was to evaluate alternative approaches for  identifying metropolitan areas that would take into account the variation in  geographic settlement patterns across the United States.  These patterns  range from heavy concentrations of people to vast sparsely populated  regions.", "The Bureau formed two working groups to research alternative  approaches.  The working groups found that assigning all territory outside  of a metropolitan area to a single residual, nonmetropolitan area was no  longer satisfactory.  Based on these conclusions, the Census Bureau  established agreements with four university working groups in 1991; each  was to develop its own alternative for defining both metropolitan and  nonmetropolitan areas.  In 1995, these four alternatives were presented at a  public conference hosted by the Council of Professional Associations on  Federal Statistics (COPAFS), a group of professional associations,  businesses, research institutes, and others interested in federal statistics  that was established to promote an open dialogue with the federal  statistical agencies.", "As the process for revising the standards moved along, there was also  congressional interest in its progress.  In July 1997, OMB and Census  Bureau officials testified before the Subcommittee on Government  Management, Information, and Technology, House Committee on  Government Reform and Oversight, on the effort.", "In the fall of 1998, OMB chartered the interagency Metropolitan Area  Standards Review Committee (MASRC), a group representing various  statistical agencies within the federal government, and charged it with  recommending revisions to the 1990 standards.  In a December 21, 1998,  Federal Register notice, OMB requested comments from the public on   (1) the suitability of the current standards, (2) principles that should  govern any proposed revisions to the standards, (3) reactions to the four  approaches outlined in the notice, and (4) proposals for other ways to  define metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas.  The issues posed in this  Federal Register notice were also discussed at a second public conference  hosted by COPAFS in January 1999.  In addition, these issues were  discussed extensively in two subsequent Federal Register notices, which  solicited public comment on MASRC\u2019s recommendations.", "On December 27, 2000, after considering public comments on MASRC  recommendations, OMB released new standards for determining the  boundaries of metropolitan and micropolitan statistical areas.  In that  notice of decision, OMB stated that it would apply the standards to  geographic areas within the United States based on Census 2000 data and  publish the results in 2003.  On June 6, 2003, OMB published newly  configured geographic areas.

OMB told us that that  this change in terminology was a concern for many areas renamed  metropolitan divisions.  Long Island, New York, for example, expressed  concern that the change in its designation, from part of a PMSA to a  metropolitan division, might affect the distribution of federal funds to the  area under programs that use the OMB standards.  Although the criteria for  PMSAs and metropolitan divisions are not identical because the population  threshold increased, Long Island qualified as a metropolitan division,  leaving its statistical status effectively unchanged.  OMB provided  additional guidance in its February 18, 2004, population update stating that  if federal agencies were using PMSAs for program, administrative, and fund  allocation purposes, the agencies should now consider using the  metropolitan division definition, the comparable geographic unit  established by the 2000 standards.", "Another change in the 2000 standards was in how an outlying county could  link to a central county (or counties) and become part of a metropolitan or  micropolitan statistical area. This process has been streamlined.  Under the  2000 standards, an outlying county can be linked to a central county (or  counties) if at least 25 percent of employed residents from the outlying  county work in the central county (or counties) or at least 25 percent of the  employment in the outlying county is accounted for by workers residing in  the central county (or counties).  This differs from the 1990 standards in  which there were six scenarios for linking outlying counties to central  counties, each of which included differing requirements for measures of  settlement structure, such as population density and the percentage of the  population that was urban.  Two of the six scenarios also required a  minimum amount of commuting of 15 percent.  Thus, because the 2000  standards raised that amount to 25 percent and eliminated the other  requirements of the 1990 standards, counties that had qualified under one  of these two scenarios and had a minimum amount of commuting from 15  to 25 percent would no longer qualify as outlying counties."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "2000 Standards Affected How and Whether Many Counties Were Included in New Statistical Areas", "paragraphs": ["When OMB issued its June 6, 2003, newly configured statistical areas using  the 2000 standards for the United States, five counties that had been part  of metropolitan statistical areas, no longer qualified for this designation.

Specifically,  the replacement of the term central city by principal city had no effect on  the status of then-eligible communities.  HUD officials said that although  principal cities within newly created micropolitan statistical areas would  not qualify for CDBG funding, no city that had established eligibility for at  least 2 years would lose its eligibility as a result of the new standards  because current law allows such cities to retain their eligibility once they  obtain it.
