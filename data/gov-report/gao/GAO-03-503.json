Since June 2000, when we last reported on performance accountability at the Forest Service, the agency has continued to study the issue but has made little real progress. For example, in March 2002, the agency initiated a study of how several other federal agencies implemented their performance accountability systems and, by September 2002, had devised a draft plan for implementing a system of its own. However, broad support within the agency for implementing this plan could not be achieved, and an executive steering team was recently established to restudy the issue. While the agency continues to study and restudy the issue, opportunities to establish key linkages among components of a performance accountability system have been missed. For example, in April 2000, the agency began considering a new budget system and, in August 2001, a new work-plan system--two critical components that should be part of a performance accountability system. However, the Forest Service has yet to develop clear linkages between these new systems and its strategic goals and performance results. Without these linkages, the agency will be unable to report in an integrated, results-oriented way on what activities it completed, how much they cost, and what they accomplished--key elements of an effective performance accountability system. While we recognize that developing a performance accountability system is a complex, time-consuming process, other federal agencies with land management responsibilities have developed and implemented performance accountability systems and believe that their systems have produced multiple benefits. The Forest Service faces three key challenges that it must meet if it is to make more progress. First, the agency needs to establish clear lines of authority and responsibility for developing and implementing a performance accountability system. Currently, various senior executives have responsibilities for components of performance accountability; however, no one has overall responsibility and authority for ensuring these components are developed and properly linked. Second, the Forest Service needs to address its culture of consensus decision-making, which has made it difficult for the Forest Service to agree on how to develop and implement an integrated performance accountability system. Third, top agency leadership needs to give sufficient emphasis and priority to establishing a performance accountability system. The agency is currently giving greater emphasis to other priorities, like financial accountability. GAO recognizes the importance of, and need for, addressing the Forest Service's long-standing financial accountability problems, but believes more can and should be done to address the agency's performance accountability problems so that both performance and financial accountability can work in concert to assess and, ultimately, to improve the agency's overall performance."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["For 10 years, Congress and the administration have focused on making  federal agencies more accountable for what they accomplish with the  dollars they receive.

Over this period, GAO has reviewed agencies\u2019 efforts to achieve  the accountability for financial management and performance envisioned  by this framework. Since 1999, in a series of reports identifying agencies  with major management challenges and at high risk of waste, fraud, abuse,  and mismanagement, GAO has consistently reported serious financial and  performance accountability weaknesses at the U.S. Department of  Agriculture\u2019s (USDA\u2019s) Forest Service.

Furthermore, while the agency had  made numerous commitments in recent years to provide the Congress and  the public with a better understanding of what it accomplishes with  appropriated funds, it did not appear to be fully committed to establishing  the key linkages, measures, monitoring, and coordination needed for  accountability. We reported that the Forest Service has studied options to  address performance accountability but has done little else. In addition,  we determined that the Forest Service has found it difficult to develop a  performance accountability system because responsibilities for  accountability have been fragmented among organizational components  and because the agency\u2019s culture allows field managers significant  independence in deciding whether to implement headquarters\u2019 guidance.", "You asked us to (1) review the progress the Forest Service is making in  resolving known performance accountability problems and (2) identify  key challenges impeding the Forest Service\u2019s ability to resolve its  performance accountability problems.

GPRA requires  agencies to develop strategic plans that have outcome-related goals and  objectives. Agencies must also develop annual performance plans that  establish goals for program activities and that create performance  measures to assess program outcomes and to provide a basis for linking  program results with established goals. The strategic plan must describe  how the annual performance goals relate to the strategic plan\u2019s goals and  objectives.

However, as we reported, the Forest  Service had not established objective and verifiable performance  measures.

This study reports on lessons  learned for successfully developing, evaluating, and implementing a  performance accountability system. In particular, a good performance  accountability system, among other things, should include    senior leadership commitment to performance accountability;    clear delineation of organizational responsibilities for performance  measurement, budget integration, performance evaluation, and  reporting;    close coordination of performance accountability activities;    national performance measures;  linkages from the strategic plan to annual performance measures to  budget activities; and  the ability to track total costs and tie those costs to desired outcomes.", "Not until July 2002 did the Chief of the Forest Service emphasize his  intention to \u201cget started\u201d on studying how performance accountability  could be implemented at the Forest Service. In September 2002, in  response to the Chief\u2019s direction, the strategic planning and budget staffs  completed a draft plan for an agencywide performance accountability  system that incorporated the lessons learned from their benchmarking  study. The Forest Service\u2019s Draft Performance Accountability System  Implementation Plan provides a conceptual framework and time frames  for developing a performance accountability system. It is designed to  develop the critical links among performance accountability components:  the strategic plan, annual performance plan, project planning, budget, and  annual reporting of results. The plan also explains how existing Forest  Service databases, such as those for formulating the budget and the annual  work plans, could be used to provide the information needed for  performance accountability.

These new systems should be integral parts of a performance  accountability system, but the Forest Service has not developed clear  linkages between these new systems\u2019 main outputs\u2014budgets and work  activities\u2014and its strategic goals and performance results. Without these  linkages, the agency will not be able to report in an integrated, results- oriented way on what activities it completed, how much they cost, and  what they accomplished\u2014key elements of any effective performance  accountability system.", "In June 2000, the House Committee on Appropriations reported it was  concerned that the agency devoted too much of its funding to  headquarters initiatives and special projects, to the detriment of  conservation and public service activities the Committee believed to be  important. As a result, the Committee directed the Forest Service to better  link its budget formulation and allocation systems to the actual work  planned for the nation\u2019s forests.", "The Forest Service developed such a system\u2014the Budget Formulation and  Execution System (BFES)\u2014and in March 2001 began using it to formulate  its fiscal year 2003 budget. The agency viewed BFES as an answer to the  Committee\u2019s concerns, but not necessarily part of any effort to achieve  performance accountability. The Forest Service designed BFES to allow  field units to have more input into the budget formulation process, to plan  activities and their associated funding throughout the annual budget  development process, and to serve as a basis for subsequent field unit  allocations. If BFES accomplishes these goals, according to senior officials  in the budget office, it could allow field units to estimate their ability to  carry out program activities in light of the agency\u2019s strategic goals,  headquarters priorities, and local priorities. Furthermore, according to  these officials, BFES\u2019s potential to establish such linkages could make it  integral to the agency\u2019s recent attempt to develop a performance  accountability system. However, as of May 2003\u2014more than 3 years after  the Forest Service began work on BFES and 2 years after its first use\u2014 only a portion of the agency\u2019s budget is included in the system.", "Despite the expectations for BFES to link the agency\u2019s strategic goals with  headquarters and local priorities, the Forest Service has not established  clear linkages between its strategic goals and field units\u2019 local priorities,  which makes it harder for the Forest Service to achieve performance  accountability. In particular, budget instructions for fiscal years 2003 and  2004 attempted to guide field units on how to make these linkages.  According to these instructions, as field units planned their activities and  associated funding, they were to weigh the agency\u2019s strategic goals in  making budgetary trade-offs between competing local priorities. In fiscal  year 2003, field units found it impossible to deal effectively with the large  number of priorities\u201450\u2014headquarters identified. For fiscal year 2004,  the agency\u2019s guidance did not provide a formal process to document such  linkages. Field managers used their \u201cprofessional judgment\u201d to draw these  linkages. Consequently, for both fiscal years 2003 and 2004, field units  used BFES estimates to set local priorities based on incremental  adjustments to their previous year\u2019s funding. Such a process does not meet  the criteria for performance accountability because it is not clearly based  on the strategic plan and associated outcomes. However, according to  senior budget officials, the BFES approach to budget formulation for these  years represents an improvement over the Forest Service\u2019s previous  process, a more arbitrary practice based almost entirely on the previous  year\u2019s funding.", "Although the Forest Service\u2019s budget formulation effort for fiscal year 2005  is an improvement over the budget formulation process for the prior 2  fiscal years, it once again falls short of establishing clear linkages between  the agency\u2019s strategic goals and field unit priorities. In December 2002, the  National Leadership Team\u201460 senior executives in the agency\u2014reviewed  a set of draft management objectives developed by the planning staff and  tentatively approved 11 of them for field units to consider in developing  their fiscal year 2005 budget submissions. Field units have been instructed  to use these management objectives in integrating local forest plan  priorities with agency objectives. Agency officials reported this initial step  was intended to have field staff become \u201ccomfortable\u201d in seeing budget  and strategic goals together and to begin linking performance goals to the  budget. However, staff in the planning office as well as some senior  executives questioned the extent to which the fiscal year 2005  management objectives mirrored strategic goals, primarily because  National Leadership Team members did not have sufficient time to  carefully review the draft management objectives.", "The Forest Service decided to replace its work-planning system in August  2001, when conversion to new computer hardware caused the existing  work-planning system to lose some of its usefulness. The agency sought a  national work-planning system to, among other things, help field units plan  and manage work activities at the project level. According to agency  officials, the new work-planning system\u2014called WorkPlan\u2014will be  completed and implemented in two phases. The first phase is scheduled to  be completed by May 1, 2003, but it will include only a planning  component. WorkPlan should be available to field units in time to help  them develop their fiscal year 2004 work plans. The agency expects to  complete the second phase in October 2003, which is to add tracking  completed activities and reporting accomplishments to WorkPlan\u2019s  capabilities. According to the draft performance accountability system  implementation plan, WorkPlan may eventually link field units\u2019 work  activities to Forest Service planning, budgeting, and results reporting  functions. These linkages, if established, could assist program managers  in, among other things, reporting accomplishments and their related  expenditures and integrating these functions with the Forest Service\u2019s  strategic goals\u2014key functions in a performance accountability system.", "However, it is not clear whether the agency will be able to establish the  necessary linkages that would enable WorkPlan to meet these  expectations. For example, it is unclear how accurately the Forest Service  will be able to report on the actual costs of individual work activities.  Currently, the agency\u2019s financial information system reports actual  expenditures only at the budget line item level, while WorkPlan is being  designed to provide the planned costs of individual work activities at the  project level. The Forest Service is planning to develop linkages to bridge  this discrepancy between levels of reporting and thus to provide estimates  of project activities\u2019 actual costs. Forest Service officials believe that such  estimates could provide sufficient detail and clarity to adequately address  performance accountability concerns. However, until such linkages are, in  fact, established and evaluated, it is uncertain that the agency will ever be  able to accurately report the actual cost of project activities.", "WorkPlan\u2019s future ability to report accomplishments depends heavily on  the Forest Service making significantly more progress on developing  outcome performance measures for all of its goals and objectives. While  we understand the difficulty in developing meaningful performance  measures, the Forest Service is in the process of developing such  measures only for its wildfire program. For example, in Forest Service\u2019s  fiscal year 2005 draft Performance Management Plan, the measure for  reducing hazardous fuels is expressed in terms of how much the risk of  catastrophic fire has been reduced, an outcome-based performance  measure. However, officials from the wildfire, wildlife and fish,  engineering, and water and air programs told us that relating work  activities, such as those that will likely be reported in WorkPlan, to  achieving results requires systematic monitoring of the changing  conditions in the forests over time in order to validate the effects of these  different work activities. These program officials told us that with the  exception of the wildfire program, currently they do not have plans to  undertake this systematic monitoring for their other programs."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Other Federal Land Management Agencies Have Implemented Performance Accountability Systems", "paragraphs": ["Other federal agencies with land management responsibilities have made  more progress in developing and implementing performance  accountability systems.

Furthermore, strong  leadership commitment enabled the agencies to develop and begin  implementing their systems with existing resources within a few years\u20144  years for NRCS and 3 years for BLM. Finally, several other factors also  contributed to the agencies\u2019 success: taking the risk of investing time and  resources into developing a performance accountability system, using the  strategic plan to guide their efforts, and having an implementation plan  with time frames for completing steps throughout the development and  implementation phases.", "Both NRCS and BLM believe that their accountability systems have  produced multiple benefits. Specifically, managers can make more  informed decisions on resource allocation because the systems align  actual costs with program work. For example, BLM officials report they  can track actual costs to projects and tasks. In addition, their budget can  show how these tasks and associated costs link with the agency\u2019s strategic  plan. NRCS officials can also report on the actual costs of the agency\u2019s  programs as well as how workload and time frames will change as  resources change. Both agencies also told us that their Web-based systems  enable them to know what they are accomplishing with the money they  spend at any given moment. As a result, BLM officials report that they can  reallocate dollars as priorities shift because it is easy to determine where  dollars are available.

The Office of Budget and Program Analysis and  selected field offices are responsible for the budget formulation and  execution system, and work-planning system. We also reviewed reports,  planning documents, USDA OIG audits, and other documents on past  performance accountability problems in the Forest Service and on the  status of the development and implementation of the agency\u2019s efforts to  improve its planning, budgeting, performance measurement, and  accomplishment reporting processes. Additionally, we interviewed  officials at NRCS and BLM about their efforts to develop and implement  Web-based accountability systems and reviewed related documents.
