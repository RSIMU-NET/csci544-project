Tied aid can distort trade when it is used to influence competitions for foreign government procurement rather than allowing those procurements to be decided on the basis of quality, price, or service. The provision of tied aid is subject to a nonbinding Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) arrangement, to which the United States is a party, that sets rules restricting the instances in which such offers can be made.", "Through the Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund, known as the War Chest, Ex- Im Bank may provide tied aid financing to support the negotiations and policing of OECD tied aid rules and to match foreign tied aid offers to level the playing field for U.S. exporters. In consultation with the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), Ex-Im Bank assesses applications from U.S. exporters for tied aid financing to counter foreign offers. In March 2001, the interagency decision-making process for determining the eligibility of applications for tied aid financing broke down when Ex-Im Bank and Treasury disagreed on two applications and Treasury \u201cvetoed\u201d them.While Ex-Im Bank and Treasury at the time agreed that Treasury had the authority to veto these applications, Ex-Im Bank changed its position in June 2001 and challenged Treasury\u2019s veto authority. The dispute over the handling of the two cases and the extent of Treasury\u2019s authority over the tied aid program was highlighted in congressional hearings on reauthorization of Ex-Im Bank during May and June 2001. While the two agencies instituted formal consultation procedures in July 2001 to prevent future breakdowns in the interagency decision-making process, these new procedures did not address the issue of whether Treasury had statutory veto authority over the use of tied aid.", "You expressed concern about the nature of Treasury\u2019s authority over the use of tied aid and the underlying reasons for Ex-Im Bank and Treasury\u2019s differences.

To identify the principles governing the use of tied aid, we examined agency records related to the tied aid policy and decision-making principles, and we interviewed agency officials. To assess how the principles for tied aid financing were applied, we examined eight tied aid applications, including the two applications that led to the March 2001 disagreement.

This fund was intended to (1) make other countries aware of the United States\u2019 willingness to challenge foreign tied aid offers when U.S. exporters were in a disadvantageous competitive position and (2) create bargaining leverage in U.S. negotiations with the other OECD members to discipline or set rules for tied aid.", "OECD negotiators concluded a landmark tied aid agreement in 1992, known as the Helsinki Package. It established a comprehensive framework for the use of tied aid based on two major principles: (1) tied aid should not be used for commercially viable projects and (2) higher-income developing countries should be graduated from eligibility for tied aid credits.", "In 1994, Ex-Im Bank established the Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund, which incorporated the Tied Aid Credit Fund. The $150 million fund was established to provide the United States with the means to support its efforts to discipline tied aid in OECD and to match trade-distorting foreign tied aid offers that were undermining U.S. exporters\u2019 competitiveness. Appendix I provides more information on activity under the U.S. tied aid program.", "Ex-Im Bank became concerned that the Fund\u2019s restrictive criteria might have discouraged U.S. exporters from bidding on projects in which tied aid was offered by foreign competitors. In 1998, Ex-Im Bank initiated an internal policy review, followed by an interagency review with Treasury in 1999. These reviews resulted in modifications of the criteria for matching foreign tied aid offers, making them somewhat less restrictive. The review also resulted in a set of separate criteria that were designed to facilitate the matching of foreign tied aid credits in Africa.", "Although the policy review was intended to ease the criteria and facilitate additional opportunities for tied aid matching, the lasting effects of international events, such as the Asian financial crisis of 1997 and the enhancement of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries Initiative in 1999, as well as reductions in the level of foreign tied aid offers, had a significant impact on its implementation. The devastating effects of the Asian financial crisis of 1997 on Indonesia, the second largest recipient of U.S. tied aid matching funds (see app. I), made meeting the U.S. tied aid criteria, especially for follow-on sales on commercial terms, more difficult to satisfy. The 1999 debt relief initiative, which accelerated and deepened debt relief treatments, specifically prohibited participating countries from receiving financial capital on commercial terms.

They agreed that the United States will provide tied aid offers to support the U.S. negotiating position at the OECD to continue to reduce trade- distorting aid, enforce other governments\u2019 compliance with the OECD tied aid rules, and protect U.S. exporters when foreign tied aid allowed under the OECD rules disadvantages their competitive position for future commercial sales. In addition, in using the fund, the United States is to preemptively counter potential foreign tied aid offers without triggering foreign tied aid use and to defend potential U.S. sales to projects that are developmentally and environmentally sound.", "Because the fund is not nearly large enough to match all instances of foreign tied aid offers, Ex-Im Bank and Treasury developed criteria designed to maximize the benefits to the U.S. economy when tied aid is used. Also, Congress required that when the United States matched foreign tied aid offers that complied with the OECD Arrangement, Ex-Im Bank was to determine that such cases were in the national trade or economic interest. To maximize the benefits of each use of the fund, the agencies agreed to examine two other aspects of each tied aid application\u2014 whether the country receiving the financing could be considered a dynamic market and whether there would likely be follow-on U.S. exports financed on commercial terms.

It is the lead U.S. agency at OECD in negotiating and policing the tied aid rules agreed to under the Helsinki Package in 1992. Treasury focuses on using tied aid financing to advance U.S. interests at OECD negotiations to expand the coverage of the Helsinki Package and to bring \u201cuntied\u201d aid under the OECD disciplines. Treasury also seeks to police foreign competitors\u2019 compliance with the Helsinki tied aid rules. These policing efforts have included using the fund to combat other countries\u2019 use of untied aid that is de facto tied. Treasury\u2019s primary aim is to deter other governments from offering tied aid that does not meet the Helsinki rules in both letter and spirit. It also seeks to remove tied aid as an export promotion tool, allowing U.S. exporters to compete on a level playing field without needing export subsidies. It also seeks to ensure that matching foreign tied aid offers helps U.S. exporters compete without having these individual transactions undermine the cooperation of other governments in achieving this broader goal of a level playing field, according to a Treasury official.", "Treasury does not want tied aid to be used routinely to match allowable cases, because it fears that this would cause foreign competitors to once again increase their use of tied aid and because it would be expensive for the U.S. government to engage in this kind of subsidy competition. Because the rules established under the OECD Arrangement and the Helsinki Package are voluntary rather than legally binding agreements, Treasury is concerned about losing the gains achieved over years of negotiations at the OECD to reduce use of tied aid. It emphasizes that far more benefit has accrued to U.S. exporters by the removal of tied aid from major segments of the market than could possibly have been provided by even vastly increased levels of tied aid financing.", "Treasury\u2019s other concern is that the tied aid allowed under the Helsinki rules is for projects that are not commercially viable and would therefore not allow for regular commercial financing. Such tied aid is generally part of the foreign assistance programs of the other OECD members, who do not define foreign assistance as generally precluding capital projects the way the United States does. According to Treasury officials, if a foreign tied aid offer is designed to lock in market share, the offer would meet follow-on sales criteria. Otherwise, it is generally a legitimate aid project that Treasury does not think U.S. tied aid offers should challenge. Such matches would have to be made over and over again, with no possibility of follow-on sales made on commercial terms. According to Treasury officials, this would make the U.S. appear to be preying on bona fide foreign aid programs.", "According to a Treasury official, the department has been successful in achieving its objective of reducing trade-distorting tied aid. While tied aid offers accounted for about $9.3 billion in 1991 before the new rules under the Helsinki Package were put in place, that amount had been reduced to around $3.5 billion by 1998. By 2001, tied aid financing from all donors other than Japan was down to about $1.5 billion. Owing to a shift in Japanese aid programs from untied to tied aid after 1998, Japanese tied aid rose to about $1.9 billion, so that the total amount of tied aid offers in 2001 was about $3.4 billion. According to Treasury officials, despite these reductions, Treasury is aware that tied aid can still affect future commercial competitions in some cases, and it supports use of tied aid matching under such circumstances."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Ex-Im Bank\u2019s Transactional Approach to Tied Aid Financing", "paragraphs": ["Ex-Im Bank takes a transactional approach to tied aid financing. Its overall mission is to finance and promote exports of U.S. goods and services. In the tied aid arena, it helps U.S. exporters counter foreign competitors that can use their government\u2019s offer of concessionary or subsidized financing terms to skew competition for foreign government capital projects. Ex-Im Bank focuses on establishing that such foreign tied aid offers have actually been made and on determining whether the exporter has a reasonable prospect of follow-on sales on commercial terms from that tied aid deal. If so, and if Ex-Im Bank finds the borrower government and the exporter to be creditworthy, it is ready to move the transaction through its decision process to final approval by its Board of Directors.", "Ex-Im Bank works directly with U.S. exporters who are competing with foreign tied aid offers. Although Ex-Im Bank officials do not specifically advocate the routine use of tied aid to match allowable cases, they cite the very low level of exporter applications for tied aid and the even lower level of approved cases that get funded (see table 2, in app. I). They also state that more should be done to assist U.S. exporters facing tied aid in overseas markets. The belief that U.S. tied aid rules were too restrictive led to Ex-Im Bank\u2019s internal policy review in 1998 and an interagency review in 1999, resulting in modifications to the tied aid criteria that were designed to expand the potential for tied aid matching. In fact, however, the level of U.S. matching has steadily decreased, because the lasting effects of international events\u2014such as the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1999 restrictions on concessional borrowing by African participants in international debt relief programs\u2014have made meeting U.S. tied aid rules for commercial-term follow-on sales more difficult. Another reason is related to the reduction in the level of foreign tied aid offers. According to an Ex-Im Bank official, the tied aid criteria were developed in order to ration limited War Chest funds at a time when a high level of foreign tied aid offers was expected, so that the justification for the strict adherence to these eligibility criteria has since been eroded.", "According to an Ex-Im Bank official, the Bank does not share Treasury\u2019s concern about harming foreign governments\u2019 \u201clegitimate aid\u201d programs. Ex-Im Bank\u2019s view is that when the foreign aid offer is used to tilt the playing field against the U.S. exporter of a better product, Ex-Im Bank offers the recipient government an alternative and the chance to get the best value for its money. Ex-Im Bank officials also did not share Treasury\u2019s concern that increasing the amount of U.S. tied aid provided to exporters would jeopardize the gains made at OECD on restricting tied aid use.", "According to an Ex-Im Bank official, the Bank is also concerned about the sometimes predatory character of foreign tied aid offers and the potential impact on the U.S. exporters competing for the bid. The predatory effect of foreign tied aid offers is seen, for instance, when a U.S. exporter is successfully competing with a foreign company for a commercial bid, and the foreign competitor suddenly makes a concessionary tied aid offer. Ex- Im Bank is also concerned about the potential impact of losing the sale on the U.S. exporter, which may have invested extensive time and money to develop the deal."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Differing Assessments of Follow-on Sales Criteria", "paragraphs": ["One result of Ex-Im Bank and Treasury\u2019s differing approaches to tied aid has been that they sometimes have differed in assessing the requirements for follow-on sales. Our analysis of selected tied aid cases indicated that when the two agencies disagreed on the eligibility of a tied aid case, their disagreement was based on differences in how they assessed the potential for follow-on sales to provide sufficient additional U.S. economic benefits attributable to the tied aid financing.", "Ex-Im Bank has tried to keep the assessment of follow-on sales straightforward by determining whether there is a potential for follow-on sales to occur in the recipient or neighboring country that can be linked to the tied aid sale without more Ex-Im Bank tied aid financing. Ex-Im Bank prefers that follow-on sales be on commercial terms. However, under the revised criteria, it is prepared to accept future sales on concessional terms as long as another institution, such as the World Bank, provides the concessional financing. According to an Ex-Im Bank official, if the application fits the criteria, then Ex-Im Bank is ready to consider financing the tied aid transaction. In this view, a finding of potential follow-on sales in itself meets the need to demonstrate economic benefits from the tied aid financing.", "In applying follow-on sales criteria, however, Treasury assesses whether the tied aid will provide substantial additional U.S. economic benefits. In Treasury\u2019s view, a finding of potential follow-on sales is necessary but not sufficient; there must also be a concomitant finding that there would be substantial additional economic benefits for the United States that are attributable to the original tied aid financing.", "In the eight selected tied aid cases that we reviewed, half were approved and half were denied, and all had been decided since the 1999 revision of tied aid criteria (see table 1). The decision-making process was fairly straightforward when, as in case B, the decision to approve a case was strategic, either to support negotiations or police compliance with the Helsinki rules. Again, in cases in which the foreign tied aid offer was allowed under the Helsinki rules and the U.S. eligibility criteria were clearly met or not met, the decision-making process was generally concluded without major disagreement (cases C, F, G, and H). Thus, in three of the denied cases, there was no real disagreement between the two agencies. However, in cases in which the eligibility criteria were not clearly met (cases A, D, and E)\u2014generally involving the follow-on sales criteria\u2014then the two agencies\u2019 differing approaches to tied aid heightened the potential for disagreement. On the basis of the cases we reviewed and interviews with agency officials, we observed that differences arise when follow-on sales potential is marginal or its attribution to the tied aid sale is questioned.", "In the three cases we reviewed that raised significant disagreement between Ex-Im Bank and Treasury, the disagreement arose over the agencies\u2019 differing assessments of whether the application met the follow- on sales criteria. Ex-Im Bank determined that the criteria had been met in all three cases. Treasury determined, in the first of these three cases (case E), that follow-on sales would not be attributable to the tied aid sale; in the second case (case A), that linkage to follow-on sales in the private sector in a neighboring country needed to be better established; and in the third case (case D), that stronger assurance was needed that product sales would supplant the foreign tied aid offer instead of being used to supplement the offer. These three cases are discussed in detail in the following paragraphs.", "In case E, Treasury and Ex-Im Bank disagreed over whether the follow-on sales would be attributable to the tied aid sale. Ex-Im Bank thought that the exporter, a manufacturer of irrigation machinery, had made a strong case for follow-on sales. The company had made prior sales on commercial terms in China. The Xinjiang provincial government had plans to irrigate vast tracts of agricultural land, and Ex-Im Bank believed that follow-on sales potential existed. Ex-Im Bank also believed that Austria\u2019s numerous tied aid offers showed its intent to lock in market advantage. However, Treasury did not accept that the follow-on sales criteria had been met because it believed (1) that the U.S. exporter had superior technology and an already well-established market position in China and (2) that the technology involved was not unique and the foreign competitor could not use it to lock in market share. Thus, Treasury\u2019s view was that the U.S. exporter did not need tied aid to get follow-on sales, because its position was so strong that it would get follow-on sales in any case. Treasury also believed that demand for financing such equipment in the future would far exceed expected aid financing, therefore ensuring commercial competition. The follow-on sales thus would not be attributable to the tied aid. Treasury also explicitly warned the Austrian export credit agency against any future tied aid offers, stating that Treasury would support tied aid matching if the Austrian agency continued to offer tied aid in this sector when in competition with U.S. firms.", "In case A, Treasury and Ex-Im Bank disagreed over whether the linkage from the tied aid sale to follow-on sales in the neighboring country\u2019s private sector had been adequately established. This case involved a U.S. exporter of solar lighting equipment, which faced a tied aid financing offer from a Spanish competitor for a project in Ghana. Follow-on sales on commercial terms were problematic in that the government of Ghana could enter only into concessional borrowing arrangements, owing to the provisions of an International Monetary Fund program to which it was a party. However, the U.S. exporter claimed that because of the demonstration effect of the tied aid deal in Ghana, it would be able to make follow-on sales on commercial terms to the private sector in Nigeria. Ex-Im Bank concluded that the exporter had made a credible case for follow-on sales in Nigeria, that this transaction offered the kind of initial market penetration opportunity intended by the follow-on sales provision, and that many potential projects in the region could follow. Treasury, however, did not believe that the follow-on sales criteria had been met, saying that the exporter needed to establish a clearer connection between the Ghana project and the follow-on sales in Nigeria. It required the exporter to provide additional information establishing the potential private sector buyer\u2019s actual intent to purchase similar equipment and their ability to obtain such financing. Once the exporter provided this information, Treasury removed its objection to the transaction. By that time, however, Ghana had defaulted on other Ex-Im Bank debts and the transaction, although officially approved, was not made operative.", "In case D, Treasury and Ex-Im Bank initially disagreed over whether there was adequate assurance that a U.S. tied aid offer involving product sales would supplant the foreign tied aid offer instead of being used to supplement the offer. This case involved a U.S. exporter of medical equipment that was faced with tied aid competition from Spanish and Austrian exporters for a project in Ghana. Ex-Im Bank again concluded that a credible case had been made for follow-on sales. The Bank had obtained information from the U.S. embassy in Ghana that a potential market for new or used medical equipment in the private sector existed; it had also obtained information from the U.S. embassy in Nigeria that both the Nigerian government and the private sector were potential customers of U.S. medical equipment. Treasury thought that the case for follow-on sales was not strong, but it was most concerned by the fact that the export involved product sales, which are inherently fungible or interchangeable. A central element of the U.S. tied aid matching policy is that each use of tied aid should supplant a foreign tied aid offer, not be used to supplement the offer and actually increase the amount of tied aid in that market. For instance, a recipient government could manipulate a bid for X-ray equipment and find a way to accept both the foreign and the U.S. tied aid offer, perhaps by using the U.S. tied aid to fulfill the original bid and switching the foreign offer to another set of hospitals in another city. The result would be that the United States would be supplementing rather than supplanting the foreign tied aid offer. In the end, Treasury decided to support the use of tied aid in this case, although it had serious misgivings."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from Ex-Im Bank and Treasury.

It said that the broader objectives of tied aid policy should have been analyzed. Our report was not intended to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the tied aid program, but rather to address the specific questions raised relating to Treasury\u2019s legal authority over the program and the problems with program administration.", "Treasury raised three specific issues regarding the report. First, it said that we should not have included Ex-Im Bank\u2019s view that increased U.S. tied aid levels would not jeopardize the gains made at OECD on restricting tied aid use, without requiring Ex-Im Bank to justify this belief. We are reporting Ex-Im Bank\u2019s view, as clearly attributed in the report. Second, it objected to the statement on page 1 of the report that Treasury had vetoed two tied aid cases in March 2001. It said that this statement was misleading because it implied that Treasury had used its statutory authority to overturn two Ex-Im Bank Board decisions, while it had actually indicated its objections in advance of the Board vote. We do not believe our statement is misleading since we make clear in the report that, under the program legislation, Ex-Im Bank was required to comply with a Treasury recommendation not to fund a particular project, which in effect allowed Treasury a veto of tied aid proposals. In addition, we do not discuss the Board vote, its circumstances, or its timing, but merely describe the Ex-Im Bank and Treasury disagreement on the two applications and Treasury\u2019s objection to them. We do not intend any implication that Treasury\u2019s veto occurred after the Ex-Im Bank Board vote, and we added a footnote to provide this clarification. Third, Treasury said it was misleading to state that half of the eight tied aid cases we examined were denied tied aid, because it might give the impression that Treasury alone denied tied aid in all four cases. Our statement that we selected eight cases to review, of which half were approved and half denied, is a simple statement of methodology. In order to prevent any misunderstanding that Treasury was solely responsible for denying these four cases, we added a statement to the detailed discussion of our findings related to these cases that, in three of the denied cases, there was no disagreement between the two agencies.", "We are sending copies of this report to the Chairman of the Export-Import Bank, the Secretary of the Treasury, and other appropriate congressional committees.

These instruments consist of a letter of interest with willingness-to-match indication, a tied aid letter of interest, or a preliminary commitment. Approved tied aid cases have been accepted for tied aid matching; however, they do not become authorized cases until the U.S. exporter wins the bid.

Both agencies determine whether the application has met the requirements of the tied aid program and review the application to ensure that the principles established by the Tied Aid Capital Projects Fund for using tied aid are met. If so, Ex-Im Bank can issue a letter of interest with willingness-to-match indication, a tied aid letter of interest, or a preliminary commitment, depending upon the evidence available (e.g., foreign government notification of tied aid offers to the OECD) to prove that a foreign government has made a tied aid offer.", "Ex-Im Bank will approve a letter of interest with willingness-to-match indication when an OECD no aid common line has been rejected by other governments. The letter\u2019s purpose is to deter the foreign tied aid offer by showing the United States\u2019s intention to challenge the foreign competitor\u2019s source of advantage, the concessional financing, in the hope that tied aid will be withdrawn and the bidding continued on a commercial basis. It is not a tied aid offer but an indication of intent to match such an offer if necessary. Ex-Im Bank will consider approving a tied aid letter of interest if there is documentary evidence of a foreign tied aid offer\u2014for instance, a bilateral tied aid protocol between the donor and recipient governments that identifies the project\u2014but the OECD has not yet been notified of the offer. This letter offers to match a foreign offer with respect to the specific project, credit size, and equivalent financing terms. If a foreign tied aid credit offer of which OECD has been notified has cleared the OECD challenge and consultation process, Ex-Im Bank will consider approving a preliminary commitment\u2014a formal offer that specifies the terms for financing. If the U.S. exporter wins the bid, and once the contract is signed with the recipient government and all financing requirements are met, a preliminary commitment can be converted directly to a final commitment to provide a tied aid credit.", "It is important to note that in the tied aid lexicon, an approved tied aid case is one that has been found to meet the tied aid criteria and for which tied aid matching has been approved. A case can start at any one of the stages discussed above, depending on the circumstances of the foreign offer. Each time the case moves up a stage\u2014for example, from letter of interest to preliminary commitment\u2014the Ex-Im Bank Board of Directors, in consultation with Treasury and in accordance with Treasury\u2019s recommendations, must determine whether to approve the tied aid matching. However, the tied aid credit offer is not completed until the U.S. exporter wins the bid and signs the contract with the foreign recipient government. At that time, it is converted to a final commitment and is considered to be authorized. Thus, approved cases have been approved for tied aid matching but are still awaiting a decision by the purchasing government, whereas authorized cases have been finalized and funding has been provided for them.", "Ex-Im Bank typically includes three options in its tied aid financing packages: a soft loan with a grace period, a mixed credit with a grant and a standard export credit component, and a direct loan with a 0 percent interest rate. For example, a soft loan with a grace period might mean a 25- year loan with a 5-year grace period and an interest rate of 3.66 percent. A mixed credit might comprise a grant for 35.23 percent of the contract price and a 10-year direct loan for 64.77 percent of the contract price, with no grace period and 6.13 percent interest.
