Over nearly 2 decades, VA has pursued multiple efforts to modernize the system. In June 2017, the department announced plans to acquire the same system\u2014the Cerner system\u2014that DOD is implementing. VA plans to continue using VistA during the decade-long transition to the Cerner system.", "GAO was asked to review key aspects of VistA and VA's plans for the new acquisition of the Cerner system.

For example, VA has identified components that comprise VistA, identified interfaces related to the system, and collected system user guides and installation manuals. VA has also conducted analyses to better understand customization of VistA components at various medical facilities. Nevertheless, the existing information and analyses do not provide a thorough understanding of the local customizations reflected in about 130 versions of VistA that support health care delivery at more than 1,500 sites. Program officials stated that they have not been able to fully define VistA due to the decentralization of the development of the system for more than 30 years. Cerner's contract to provide a new electronic health record system to VA calls for the company to conduct comprehensive assessments to identify site-specific requirements where its system is planned to be deployed. Three site assessments have been completed and additional assessments are planned. If these assessments provide a thorough understanding of the 130 VistA versions, the department should be able to define VistA and be better positioned to transition to the new system.", "VA identified costs for VistA and its related activities adding up to approximately $913.7 million, $664.3 million, and $711.1 million in fiscal years 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively\u2014for a total of about $2.3 billion over the 3 years. However, of the $2.3 billion, the department was only able to demonstrate that approximately $1 billion of these costs were sufficiently reliable. In addition, the department omitted VistA-related costs from the total. The lack of a sufficiently reliable and comprehensive total cost for VistA is due in part to not following a well-documented methodology that describes how the department determined the costs for the system. As a result of incomplete cost data and data that could not be determined to be sufficiently reliable, the department, legislators, and the public do not have a complete understanding of how much it has cost to develop and maintain VistA. Further, VA lacks the information needed to make decisions on sustaining the many versions of the system.", "VA has initiated a number of actions to prepare for the transition from VistA to the Cerner system. These actions include taking steps to establish and begin to staff a program office, forming a governance structure, conducting assessments at the initial sites, preparing program plans to guide the initial system implementation, and setting a program baseline to help guide implementation at the initial sites. The department's actions in these important areas are ongoing. Additional actions are in progress to address GAO's September 2018 recommendation that VA clearly define the role and responsibilities of the joint Department of Defense (DOD) and VA Interagency Program Office in the department's governance plans for the new electronic health record system.

These documents included the VA Monograph, reports from the VA  Systems Inventory, and documents listed in the VA Software Document  Library. We also examined the VistA Product Roadmap, which described  modernization plans and achievements related to VistA.", "Further, we reviewed the results of additional efforts undertaken by the  department to define VistA. For example, we reviewed analyses that the  department undertook to identify VistA components to be replaced by the  Cerner System and the department\u2019s visual mapping of VistA. We then  compared the extent to which VA has defined VistA with elements for  defining information technology (IT) systems described in GAO\u2019s  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government and our Cost  Estimating and Assessment Guide. In addition, we reviewed Electronic  Health Records Modernization (EHRM) Program documentation related  to site visits that the department and Cerner have conducted at initial  operating capability sites and planned for future sites.

The scope of our work focused on these 3 prior fiscal years  because development and sustainment cost information for full fiscal  years should have been available during the time period in which we  conducted our evaluation.", "Specifically, we examined documentation of the total costs for these 3  years, including source data provided by the department for each  category of cost identified, to assess the reliability of the supporting data  consistent with best practices described in GAO\u2019s Cost Estimating and  Assessment Guide. We also examined the documentation and controls  related to the IT systems that VA identified as the sources of these cost data. The systems included OIT\u2019s Budget Tracking Tool and VA\u2019s  Financial Management System.", "Further, we discussed with knowledgeable EHRM program officials the  nature of the cost data, the rationale for why each cost line item was  included, and any anomalies (e.g., missing data and calculation errors)  found during our analysis. In addition, we interviewed OIT and VHA  subject matter experts and vendors identified by VA to further understand  the methodology that the department used to identify or estimate VistA  costs.", "This report includes specific VistA-related cost totals for which OIT and  VHA were able to sufficiently demonstrate the reliability of the program  data. For other costs in which we were not able to make a reliability  determination, we have summarized and reported those to provide  context for the magnitude of the total costs.", "To address the third objective, we examined the department\u2019s decision  memorandums and charters establishing the Office of Electronic Health  Record Modernization and the EHRM program to manage VA\u2019s transition  from VistA to Cerner. We also examined VA\u2019s plans to establish a  structure for governing technical and functional issues and joint decisions  that arise with DOD. To understand how the office intended to manage  the transition from VistA to the commercial system, we reviewed the site  assessment reports to understand how the reports were used to refine  the scope of work. We reviewed the EHRM Program Management Plan  and subordinate plans used to guide the program. We also examined  documentation supporting establishment of the initial program baseline.

Specifically, it focused on modernizing the VistA system,  increasing the department\u2019s data exchange and interoperability with DOD  and private sector health care partners, and reducing the time it takes to  deploy new health information management capabilities. The VistA 4  Roadmap was the key plan that the department used to guide VistA  Evolution. According to this plan, VistA Evolution was intended to result in  lower costs for system upgrades, maintenance, and sustainment.", "As part of VistA Evolution, the department initiated work to, among other  things, standardize VistA instances; expand the use and functionality of  the Joint Legacy Viewer; and release enhancements to legacy  scheduling, pharmacy, and immunization systems. For example, one  focus of the VistA Evolution program over the last several years was to  standardize a core set of the system\u2019s modules which, according to the  department, account for about 60 percent of VistA.", "As part of these efforts, the department implemented a process to assess  variances in the system at individual sites. According to OIT officials, this  process led to more standardization of the code, where possible, and also  allowed sites to apply for a waiver if there was a need to continue to  operate a nonstandardized VistA instance.", "Although VistA Evolution was intended to modernize aspects of the  system through December 2018, the planned scope of work was reduced  as VA redirected the department\u2019s efforts. Specifically, in June 2017, the  former VA Secretary announced a significant shift in the department\u2019s  approach to modernizing VistA. Rather than continue to use the system,  the Secretary stated that the department planned to acquire the same  EHR system that DOD is acquiring\u2014Cerner Millennium. According to  the department, it has chosen to acquire this product because Cerner  Millennium should allow the entire department\u2019s and DOD\u2019s patient data  to reside in one system, thus, potentially reducing or eliminating the  manual and electronic exchange and reconciliation of data between two  separate systems.", "Accordingly, the department awarded an indefinite delivery, indefinite  quantity contract to Cerner in May 2018 for a maximum amount of $10  billion over 10 years. Cerner is to replace the 130 instances of VistA with  a standard COTS system to be implemented across VA. This new system  is to support a broad range of health care functions including acute care,  clinical decision support, dental care, and emergency medicine. When  implemented, the new system will be expected to become the  authoritative source of clinical data to support improved health, patient  safety, and quality of care provided by VA.", "The EHRM program is responsible for managing the Cerner contract  implementation. As of June 2019, the department had issued eight task  orders to Cerner to: provide project management and planning support services,  conduct site assessments at the initial operating capability sites, host the Cerner system and supporting data, perform data migration and enterprise interface development, develop a functional baseline, deploy the Cerner system at the initial operating capability sites, analyze, design, and develop a technical baseline, and provide additional interface development.", "For fiscal year 2019, the program was appropriated about $1.1 billion for  planning and managing the transition from VistA to Cerner.

To understand how the program office plans to  manage the program, we examined the EHRM Program Management  Plan and subordinate plans that guide the management of the program  and describe ongoing efforts to define the policies and processes  necessary to achieve the program\u2019s goals. To address the program\u2019s  establishment of an initial program baseline, we examined the decision  memorandum approving the award of the Cerner contract, the briefings  presented to program stakeholders at the initial program baseline review,  and the documents supporting the program baseline review. We  supplemented our analysis with information obtained through interviews  with relevant department officials including the Executive Director and  Chief Technology and Integration Officer for the EHRM program.", "We conducted this performance audit from August 2017 to July 2019 in  accordance with generally accepted government auditing standards.  Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain  sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our  findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
