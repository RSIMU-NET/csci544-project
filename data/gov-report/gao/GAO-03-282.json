Although each program has its own purpose and eligibility requirements, VBA does not set a separate timeliness goal for each in its annual performance plan. This obscures the significant differences in the time required to complete decisions under each program. Fiscal year 2002 timeliness, using VBA's measure, was 223 days; however, disability compensation decisions took significantly longer than decisions under the other two programs. A disability compensation decision requires more evidence, in part because VBA must determine that each claimed disability is related to the veteran's military service. VBA does not yet have adequate data to measure the timeliness of its new specialized regional office claims processing teams but is working to improve its data. VBA's inventory management system, which allows it to report and analyze teams' timeliness, relies on an existing information system that does not provide timeliness data on all cases. VBA is acting to improve the completeness of the data in the existing system. Meanwhile, VBA is deploying new software that it expects should enable it to capture more complete and accurate data. VBA expects to deploy this new software at all regional offices by October 2003."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Timely compensation and pension claims processing has been a longstanding problem for the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA). In fiscal year 2002, VBA took an average of more than 7 months to complete veterans\u2019 claims for disability compensation and pension benefits. In order to ensure that veterans and their families receive more timely decisions, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) tasked VBA to reduce claims processing time to an average of 100 days by the end of fiscal year 2003. As part of this effort, the Secretary created the VA Claims Processing Task Force to recommend ways to improve the claims process. In October 2001, the task force recommended actions to improve claims processing. VBA is in the process of implementing these recommendations.", "You asked that we assist the Committee in its oversight of VBA\u2019s efforts to improve its compensation and pension claims processing. As part of this request, you asked that we examine VBA\u2019s timeliness performance measures. Specifically, we assessed (1) whether VBA\u2019s key timeliness measure clearly reflects its performance and (2) whether VBA has adequate data to measure the timeliness of its newly created specialized claims processing teams. We analyzed VBA\u2019s claims processing timeliness data. We reviewed VA\u2019s strategic plan, most recent performance plan, and report and VBA\u2019s implementation plan for its claims process improvement (CPI) initiative. We also talked with VBA officials about the quality of its existing timeliness data and its efforts to improve data quality. In addition, we observed how performance data are collected and used and how the reorganization of claims processing was being implemented at the Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and San Diego, California, regional offices. These were two of the four pilot sites for VBA\u2019s CPI initiative, which is implementing task force recommendations to organize claims processing around specialized teams to handle specific stages of the claims process at all 57 regional offices. We focused our work on VBA\u2019s compensation and pension programs, since they account for most VBA benefit claims and were the subject of the task force\u2019s report.

In addition, VBA pays dependency and indemnity compensation to some deceased veterans\u2019 spouses, children, and parents. In fiscal year 2001, VBA paid over $20 billion in disability compensation to about 2.3 million veterans and over 300,000 survivors. VBA also paid over $3 billion in pensions to over 600,000 veterans and survivors.", "Veterans may submit their disability claims to any of VBA\u2019s 57 regional offices, which process these claims in accordance with VBA regulations, policies, procedures, and guidance. Regional offices assist veterans in obtaining evidence to support their claims. This assistance includes helping veterans obtain the following documents: records of service to identify when the veteran served, records of medical treatment provided while the veteran was in military service, records of treatment and examinations provided at VA health-care facilities, and records of treatment of the veteran by nonfederal providers. Also, if necessary for decision on a claim, the regional office arranges for the veteran to receive a medical examination or opinion. Once this evidence is collected, VBA makes a rating decision on the claim. Veterans with multiple disabilities receive a single composite rating. For pension claims, VBA determines whether the veteran meets certain criteria. The regional office then notifies the veteran of its decision.", "In May 2001, the Secretary created the VA Claims Processing Task Force to develop recommendations to improve the compensation and pension claims process and to help VBA improve claims processing timeliness and productivity. The task force observed that the work management system in many VBA regional offices contributed to inefficiency and an increased number of errors. The task force attributed these problems primarily to the broad scope of duties performed by regional office staff\u2014in particular, veterans service representatives (VSR). For example, VSRs were responsible for both collecting evidence to support claims and answering claimants\u2019 inquiries. In October 2001, the task force made short- and medium-term recommendations for improving the claims process and reorganizing regional office operations. In particular, the task force recommended that VBA change its claims processing system to one that utilizes specialized teams. VBA is in the process of implementing many of these recommendations and has established a new claims processing structure that is organized by specific steps in the claims process. For example, regional offices will have teams devoted specifically to claims development, that is, obtaining evidence needed to evaluate claims."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VBA\u2019s Key Timeliness Measure Does Not Clearly Reflect Its Performance", "paragraphs": ["VBA\u2019s key timeliness measure does not clearly reflect its timeliness in completing claims because it fails to distinguish among its three disability programs\u2014disability compensation, pension, and dependence and indemnity compensation.

Despite these differences, VBA sets an annual performance goal that is an average of all three programs.", "For the purposes of reporting its performance to the Congress and other stakeholders, VBA adopted one key timeliness measure\u2014the average time to complete decisions on rating-related cases. This measure includes original and reopened disability compensation, pension, and dependency and indemnity compensation claims\u2014in other words, claims for three VBA compensation and pension programs.

In general, the disability compensation program requires the most evidence and thus these claims generally take longer to complete, as shown in figure 1. While VBA\u2019s average fiscal year 2002 timeliness was 223 days, disability compensation decisions (which represented about 83 percent of total decisions) took almost twice as long to complete as pension decisions. The aggregate measure understated the time required to decide disability compensation claims by 18 days and overstated the time to decide pension claims by 97 days and dependency and indemnity compensation claims by 51 days.", "Each program has a different claims processing time frame because each has different evidence requirements resulting from their different purposes and eligibility requirements. For example, a major reason why disability compensation claims take longer is that VBA must not only establish that each claimed disability exists, but that each was caused or aggravated by the veteran\u2019s military service. This process requires substantial evidence gathering, with VBA actively assisting the claimant. To prove service- connection, VBA obtains the veteran\u2019s service medical records and may request medical examinations and treatment records from VA medical facilities. In contrast, pension claims do not require evidence that the claimed disabilities were service-connected. Also, veterans aged 65 and older do not have to prove that they are disabled to receive pension benefits as long as they meet the income and military service requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VBA Does Not Have Adequate Data to Measure Timeliness of Claims Processing Teams, but Is Making Progress", "paragraphs": ["VBA does not yet have adequate data to measure timeliness or set goals for its specialized regional office teams but is making progress in obtaining complete and accurate data.

Where teams were once responsible for processing claims from receipt to completion, teams are now responsible for specific phases of the process. With complete and accurate data, VBA will be able to measure the timeliness of the individual teams and, therefore, will be able to hold them accountable for their performance as well as identify processing delays and take corrective actions. VBA expects to be able to obtain more complete and accurate data to measure team performance once it deploys new software applications that should enable it to consistently capture data for all cases and will rely less on manual data entry. VBA expects these applications to be fully deployed by October 2003.", "The task force recommended that regional office Veterans Service Centers (VSC), which process compensation and pension claims, be reorganized into specialized teams. The task force identified six types of teams\u2014triage, pre-determination, rating, post-determination, appeals, and public contact\u2014based on different phases of the claims process. From February through April 2002, VBA piloted its CPI initiative, which included reorganizing regional offices\u2019 VSCs into specialized teams at four regional offices. The CPI task team noted that processing teams needed clearly defined and reasonable performance expectations and recommended timeliness measures for each team, as shown in table 1. VBA began to implement the CPI model at its other regional offices in July 2002.", "VBA has implemented an inventory management system (IMS) that allows it to measure and report team timeliness, nationally and at the regional office level. This system should provide VBA with the necessary data to develop annual performance goals, which can be used to hold itself and its regional offices accountable for improving timeliness. IMS should also provide useful data to assist VBA management with identifying problems in specific regional offices and allowing regional office management to identify problems with specific teams for further analysis and corrective actions.", "However, VBA acknowledges that its IMS reports are not as useful as they can be, because IMS receives incomplete data from an existing VBA system\u2014the Claims Automated Processing System (CAPS). Not all regional offices are fully using CAPS; thus, CAPS data that are sent to IMS are incomplete. CAPS was not being used to collect timeliness data for all cases; rather, it was used to provide regional office staff with information on the status of cases expected to take more than 30 days to process. In order to provide a short-term improvement in the completeness of IMS data, in May 2001 VBA instructed regional offices to ensure that certain data were consistently entered into CAPS; for example, dates when evidence was requested and received. In May 2002, VBA instructed regional offices to report on how fully they use CAPS and to provide estimated timeframes for complete compliance with CAPS data entry requirements. As of August 2002, VBA reported that about 81 percent of its pending cases had records in CAPS.", "According to VBA officials, as the regional offices implement new software applications, the ability of IMS to provide complete and accurate timeliness reports is expected to improve. For example, Share, the new claims establishment application, will automatically input data on a case into other applications, including CAPS. This will help ensure more complete and consistent data in the short term, because there will be a CAPS record for each case. Eventually, the Modern Award Processing\u2013 Development (MAP-D) application will replace CAPS as a source of timeliness data for IMS. MAP-D will, according to VBA officials, contain records for all cases and will reduce the amount of manual data entry required, thus reducing the potential for data input errors. VBA plans to have all regional offices using Share and MAP-D by October 2003."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VBA has chosen to use one aggregate performance measure for timeliness for its disability compensation, pension, and dependency and indemnity compensation programs.

Consequently, the aggregate measure can make the processing time for VBA\u2019s largest and most time-consuming workload look better than it really is. As long as VBA uses an aggregate timeliness measure, it will not be able to clearly demonstrate to the Congress, top VA management, and claimants how well it is meeting its objectives to serve disabled veterans and their families.", "VBA\u2019s reorganization of its regional office compensation and pension claims processing operations into specialized teams underscores the need for complete and accurate data on the timeliness of the phases of the claims process. VBA does not yet have adequate data for timeliness measurement purposes but is making progress in ensuring that it does. Once VBA has deployed its new claims processing software applications at all of its regional offices, it expects to be able to better measure the timeliness of its specialized teams, provide baselines for future comparisons, quantify team performance goals, and identify problems needing corrective action.

We believe developing timeliness measures for each program would not obscure VBA\u2019s focus on performance improvement, but would provide a more accurate picture of claims processing timeliness, because the new measures would reflect the differences among the three programs. Because VBA already has the necessary data, we believe that it should report timeliness by program for fiscal year 2004 and set goals by program for fiscal year 2005, at the latest.", "VA also suggested that we based our calculations of average days to complete disability compensation, pension, and dependency and indemnity compensation decisions, as shown in figure 1, on original claims only.
