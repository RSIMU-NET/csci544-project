However, financial market participants were able to recover relatively quickly from the terrorist attacks because of market participants' and infrastructure providers' heroic efforts and because the securities exchanges and clearing organizations largely escaped direct damage. The attacks revealed limitations in the business continuity capabilities of some key financial market participants that would need to be addressed to improve the ability of U.S. markets to withstand such events in the future. GAO's review of 15 stock exchanges, clearing organizations, electronic communication networks, and payments system providers between February and June 2002 showed that all were taking steps to implement physical and electronic security measures and had developed business continuity plans. However, some organizations still had limitations in one or more of these areas that increased the risk that their operations could be disrupted by future disasters. Although the financial regulators have begun efforts to improve the resiliency of clearance and settlement functions within the financial markets, they have not fully developed goals, strategies, or sound practices to improve the resiliency of trading activities. In addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) technology and operations risk oversight, which is increasingly important, has been hampered by program, staff, and resource issues.

Specifically, I will discuss (1) how the September 11, 2001, terrorist  attacks affected the financial markets and the actions market participants  and infrastructure providers took to restore trading; (2) the steps taken by  15 stock exchanges, electronic communication networks (ECN), clearing  organizations, and payment systems providers to address physical and  electronic security and business continuity planning since the attacks; and  (3) the steps financial regulators have taken to ensure that the markets are  better prepared for future disasters.", "The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks severely disrupted the U.S.  financial markets because of the loss of life, damage to buildings, loss of  telecommunications and power, and restrictions that were placed on  access to the affected area. However, financial market participants were  able to recover relatively quickly from the terrorist attacks, as a result of  market participants\u2019 and infrastructure providers\u2019 heroic efforts and  because the securities exchanges and clearing organizations largely  escaped direct damage. If certain organizations had sustained serious  damage, the markets would probably not have been able to reopen by  September 17, 2001. Market participants and regulators have  acknowledged that the attacks revealed limitations in their business  continuity capabilities and that these limitations would need to be  addressed to improve their ability to recover if such events occurred in the  future. Our review of 15 stock exchanges, ECNs, clearing organizations,  and payments system providers between February and June 2002 showed  that all were taking steps to implement physical and electronic security  measures and had developed business continuity plans. However,  organizations still had limitations in one or more areas that increased the  risk of disruptions to their operations if such disasters occurred in the  future. Although the financial regulators have begun efforts to improve the  resiliency of clearance and settlement functions within the financial  markets, they have not fully developed goals, strategies, or sound  practices to similarly improve the resiliency of trading functions. In  addition, the effectiveness of the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s  (SEC) technology and operations risk oversight efforts\u2014which clearly  have increased in importance\u2014have been limited by program, staff, and  resource limitations. Some of these issues were also highlighted in a  January 2003 report issued by the SEC Inspector General. Our report made  recommendations designed to better prepare the markets to deal with  future disasters and to enhance SEC\u2019s technology and operations risk  oversight capabilities. SEC agreed with the thrust of our  recommendations."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Market Participants and Infrastructure Providers Employed Innovative Solutions to Restore Trading", "paragraphs": ["The September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks had a devastating effect on the  U.S. financial markets with significant loss of life, extensive physical  damage, and considerable disruption to the financial district in New York.  Damage from the collapse of the World Trade Center buildings caused  dust and debris to blanket a wide area of lower Manhattan, led to severe  access restrictions to portions of lower Manhattan for days, and destroyed  substantial portions of the telecommunications and power infrastructure  that served the area. Telecommunications service in lower Manhattan was  lost for many customers when debris from the collapse of one the World  Trade Center buildings struck a major Verizon central switching office that  served approximately 34,000 business and residences. The human impact  was especially devastating because about 70 percent of the civilians killed  in the attacks worked in the financial services industry, and physical  access to the area was severely curtailed through September 13, 2001.  Although most stock exchanges and clearing organizations escaped direct  damage, the facilities and personnel of several key broker-dealers and  other market participants were destroyed or displaced. Market  participants and regulators acknowledged that the reopening of the stock  and options markets could have been further delayed if any of the  exchanges or clearing organizations had sustained serious damage.", "The stock and options exchanges remained closed as firms, that were  displaced by the attacks attempted to reconstruct their operations and  reestablish telecommunications with their key customers and other  market participants. In the face of enormous obstacles, market  participants, infrastructure providers, and the regulators made heroic  efforts to restore operations in the markets. Broker-dealers that had their  operations disrupted or displaced either relocated their operations to  backup facilities or other alternative facilities. These facilities had to be  outfitted to accommodate normal trading operations and to have sufficient  telecommunications to connect with key customers, clearing and  settlement organizations, and the exchanges and market centers. Some  firms did not have existing backup facilities for their trading operations  and had to create these facilities in the days following the crisis. For  example, one broker-dealer leased a Manhattan hotel to reconstruct its  operations. Firms were not only challenged with reconstructing  connections to their key counterparties but, in some cases, they also had  the additional challenge of connecting with the backup sites of  counterparties that were also displaced by the attacks. The infrastructure  providers also engaged in extraordinary efforts to restore operations. For  example, telecommunications providers ran cables above ground rather  than underground to speed up the restoration of service.", "By Friday September 14, 2001, exchange officials had concluded that only  60 percent of normal market trading liquidity had been restored and that it  would not be prudent to trade in such an environment. In addition,  because so many telecommunications circuits had been reestablished,  market participants believed that it would be beneficial to test these  telecommunications circuits prior to reopening the markets. Officials were  concerned that without such testing, the markets could have experienced  operational problems and possibly have to close again, which would have  further shaken investor confidence. The stock and options markets  reopened successfully on Monday, September 17, 2001 and achieved  record trading volumes. Although the government securities markets  reopened within 2 days, activity within those markets was severely  curtailed, as there were serious clearance and settlement difficulties  resulting from disruptions at some of the key participants and at one of the  two banks that clear and settle government securities. Some banks had  important operations in the vicinity of the attacks, but the impact of the  attacks on the banking and payment systems was much less severe.", "Regulators also played a key role in restoring market operations. For  example, the Federal Reserve provided over $323 billion in funding to  banks between September 11 and September 14, 2001, to prevent  organizations from defaulting on their obligations and creating a  widespread solvency crisis. SEC also granted regulatory relief to market  participants by extending reporting deadlines and relaxed the rules that  restrict corporations from repurchasing their shares. The Department of  the Treasury also helped to address settlement difficulties in the  government securities markets by conducting a special issuance of 10-year  Treasury notes."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Attacks Revealed Limitations in Market Participants\u2019 Preparedness for Wide-scale Disasters, and Some Limitations Remain", "paragraphs": ["Although financial market participants, regulators, and infrastructure  providers made heroic efforts to restore the functioning of the markets as  quickly as they did, the attacks and our review of 15 key financial market  organizations\u2014including 7 critical ones\u2014revealed that financial market  participants needed to improve their business continuity planning  capabilities and take other actions to better prepare themselves for  potential disasters. At the time of the attacks, some market participants  lacked backup facilities for key aspects of their operations such as trading,  while others had backup facilities that were too close to their primary  facilities and were thus either inaccessible or also affected by the  infrastructure problems in the lower Manhattan area. Some organizations  had backup sites that were too small or lacked critical equipment and  software. In the midst of the crisis, some organizations also discovered  that the arrangements they had made for backup telecommunications  service were inadequate. In some cases, firms found that  telecommunication lines that they had acquired from different providers  had been routed through the same paths or switches and were similarly  disabled by the attacks.", "The 15 stock exchanges, ECNs, clearing organizations, and payment  systems we reviewed had implemented various physical and information  security measures and business continuity capabilities both before and  since the attacks. At the time of our work\u2014February to June 2002\u2014these  organizations had taken such steps as installing physical barriers around  their facilities to mitigate effects of physical attacks from vehicle-borne  explosives and using passwords and firewalls to restrict access to their  networks and prevent disruptions from electronic attacks. In addition, all  15 of the organizations had developed business continuity plans that had  procedures for restoring operations following a disaster; and some  organizations had established backup facilities that were located hundreds  of miles from their primary operations.", "Although these organizations have taken steps to reduce the likelihood  that their operations would be disrupted by physical or electronic attacks  and had also developed plans to recover from such events, we found that  some organizations continued to have some limitations that would  increase the risk of their operations being impaired by future disasters.  This issue is particularly challenging for both market participants and  regulators, because addressing security concerns and business continuity  capabilities require organizations to assess their overall risk profile and  make business decisions based on the trade-offs they are willing to make  in conducting their operations. For example, one organization may prefer  to invest in excellent physical security, while another may choose to  investment less in physical security and more in developing resilient  business continuity plans and capabilities.", "Our review indicated that most of the 15 organizations faced greater risk  of operational disruptions because their business continuity plans did not  adequately address how they would recover if large portions of their  critical staff were incapacitated. Most of the 15 organizations were also at  a greater risk of operations disruption from wide-scale disasters, either  because they lacked backup facilities or because these facilities were  located within a few miles of their primary sites. Few of the organizations  had tested their physical security measures, and only about half were  testing their information security measures and business continuity plans."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Regulators Have Addressed Operations Risks but Have Not Developed Complete Strategies and Practices to Better Assure Recovery of Trading", "paragraphs": ["Securities and banking regulators have made efforts to examine  operations risk measures in place at the financial market participants they  oversee. SEC has conducted reviews of exchanges, clearing organizations,  and ECNs that have generally addressed aspects of these organizations\u2019  physical and information security and business continuity capabilities.  However, reviews by SEC and the exchanges at broker-dealers generally  did not address these areas, although SEC staff said that such risks would  be the subject of future reviews. Banking regulators also reported that  they review such issues in the examinations they conduct at banks.", "Regulators also have begun efforts to improve the resiliency of clearing  and settlement functions for the financial markets. In August 2002, the  Federal Reserve, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and SEC  jointly issued a paper entitled the Draft Interagency White Paper on Sound  Practices to Strengthen the Resilience of the U.S. Financial System.  This  paper sought industry comment on sound business practices to better  ensure that clearance and settlement organizations would be able to  resume operations promptly after a wide-scale regional disaster. The  regulators indicated that the sound practices would apply to a limited  number of organizations that perform important clearing functions, as well  as to between 15 and 20 banks and broker-dealers that also perform  clearing functions with sizeable market volumes.", "The regulators that developed the white paper appropriately focused on  clearing functions to help ensure that settlement failures do not lead to a  broader financial crisis. However, the paper did not similarly address  restoring critical trading activities in the various financial markets. The  regulators that developed the paper believed that clearing functions were  mostly concentrated in single entities for most markets or in a very few  entities for others and thus posed a greater potential for disruption. In  theory, multiple stock exchanges and other organizations that conduct  trading activities could substitute for each other in the event of a crisis.", "Nevertheless, trading on the markets for corporate securities, government  securities, and money market instruments is also vitally important to the  economy; and the United States deserves similar assurance that trading  activities also would be able to resume when appropriate\u2014smoothly and  without excessive delay. The U.S. economy has demonstrated that it can  withstand short periods during which markets are not trading. After some  events occur, having markets closed for some limited time could be  appropriate to allow emergency and medical relief activities, permit  operations to recover, and reduce market overreaction. However, long  delays in reopening the markets could be harmful to the economy. Without  trading, investors lack the ability to accurately value their securities and  cannot adjust their holdings.", "The September 11, attacks demonstrated that the ability of markets to  recover could depend on the extent to which market participants have  made sound investments in business continuity capabilities. Without  clearly identifying strategies for recovery, determining the sound practices  needed to implement these strategies, and identifying the organizations  that could conduct trading under these strategies, the risk that markets  may not be able to resume trading in a fair and orderly fashion and  without excessive delays is increased. Goals and strategies for resuming  trading activities could be based on likely disaster scenarios and could  identify the organizations that are able to conduct trading in the event that  other organizations could not recover within a reasonable time. Goals and  strategies, along with guidance on business continuity planning practices,  and more effective oversight would (1) provide market participants with  the information they need to make better decisions about improving their  operations, (2) help regulators develop sound criteria for oversight, and  (3) assure investors that trading on U.S. markets could resume smoothly  and in a timely manner.", "SEC has begun developing a strategy for resuming stock trading for some  exchanges, but the plan is not yet complete. For example, SEC has asked  the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ to take steps to  ensure that their information systems can conduct transactions in the  securities that the other organizations normally trade. However, under this  strategy NYSE does not plan to trade all NASDAQ securities, and neither  exchange has fully tested its own or its members\u2019 abilities to trade the  other exchanges\u2019 securities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "SEC\u2019s Automation Review Policy Program Could Be Strengthened", "paragraphs": ["Given the increased threats demonstrated by the September 11 attacks and  the need to assure that key financial market organizations are following  sound practices, securities and banking regulators\u2019 oversight programs are  important mechanisms to assure that U.S. financial markets are resilient.  SEC oversees the key clearing organizations and exchanges through its  Automation Review Policy (ARP) program. The ARP program\u2014which also  may be used to oversee adherence to the white paper\u2019s sound practices\u2014 currently faces several limitations. SEC did not implement this ARP  program by rule but instead expected exchanges and clearing  organizations to comply with various information technology and  operations practices voluntarily. However, under a voluntary program,  SEC lacks leverage to assure that market participants implement  important recommended improvements. While the program has prompted  numerous improvements in market participants\u2019 operations, we have  previously reported that some organizations did not establish backup  facilities or improve their systems\u2019 capacity when the SEC ARP staff had  identified these weaknesses. Moreover, ARP staff continue to find  significant operational weaknesses at the organizations they oversee.", "An ARP program that draws its authority from an issued rule could  provide SEC additional assurance that exchanges and clearing  organizations adhere to important ARP recommendations and any new  guidance developed jointly with other regulators. To preserve the  flexibility that SEC staff considers a strength of the current ARP program,  the rule would not have to mandate specific actions but could instead  require that the exchanges and clearing organizations engage in activities  consistent with the ARP policy statements. This would provide SEC staff  with the ability to adjust their expectations for the organizations subject to  ARP, as technology and industry best practices evolve, and provide clear  regulatory authority to require actions as necessary. SEC already requires  ECNs to comply with ARP guidance; and extending the rule to the  exchanges and clearing organizations would place them on similar legal  footing. In an SEC report issued in January 2003, the Inspector General  noted our concern over the voluntary nature of the program.", "Limited resources and challenges in retaining experienced ARP staff also  have affected SEC\u2019s ability to more effectively oversee an increasing  number of organizations and more technically complex market operations.  ARP staff must oversee various industrywide initiatives, such as Year 2000  or decimals pricing, and has also expanded to cover 32 organizations with  more complex technology and communications networks. However, SEC  has problems retaining qualified staff, and market participants have raised  concerns about the experience and expertise of ARP staff. The SEC  Inspector General also found that ARP staff could benefit from increased  training on the operations and systems of the entities overseen by the ARP  program. At current staff levels, SEC staff report being able to conduct  examinations of only about 7 of the 32 organizations subject to the ARP  program each year. In addition, the intervals between examinations were  sometimes long. For example, the intervals between the most recent  examinations for seven critical organizations averaged 39 months."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
