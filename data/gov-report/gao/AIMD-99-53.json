In April 1997, the Special Trustee submitted a strategic plan  to the Congress, but Interior did not fully support the plan.  At this  Committee\u2019s July 1997 hearing on the Special Trustee\u2019s strategic plan, we  testified on the results of our analysis of the strategic plan and provided our  assessment of needed actions related to implementation issues that we had  identified during that analysis.", "On August 22, 1997, the Secretary of the Interior indicated that he and the  Special Trustee for American Indians had agreed on the problems that  needed to be solved immediately and called for the development of a high  level implementation plan within 60 days.

However, Interior disagrees with the report\u2019s conclusions and does not  indicate whether it will implement the recommendations.", "In disagreeing with the report\u2019s first conclusion (that Interior does not have  reasonable assurance that its High Level Plan for improving Indian trust  operations provides an effective solution for addressing long-standing  management weaknesses), Interior states that although it recognizes the  importance of a formal architecture and does not yet have one, the \u201clack of  a formal architecture is not a significant impediment to success in this  case, given the use of proven COTS products.\u201d Interior also expresses  confidence because this effort is smaller than the modernization efforts  that have failed at other agencies like FAA.", "This position is not valid.  The decision to use COTS products does not  compensate for the lack of an integrated information system architecture  for Indian trust operations. Such an architecture would have identified and  preferably reengineered the business functions of trust operations, and  then mapped these into information systems to support the business  functions. Just choosing COTS products from the marketplace does not  accomplish the same purpose.  In fact, the close relationship between  business functions and IT is the reason we focus on all 13 projects in the  High Level Plan as a whole, even though, as Interior points out in its  comments, only 4 of the projects are information technology systems  projects.  Further, small efforts, like IRS\u2019 $17 million Cyberfile project, as  well as large ones, like FAA\u2019s modernization, have failed due to poor  program management, including lack of an architecture. With an estimated  cost of $60 million for IT systems and an additional $54 million for data  cleanup, the information systems supporting the 13 projects will have to be  effectively managed if they are to succeed.", "Interior bases its decision to proceed with its IT acquisitions without a  formal architecture (and without an estimated date for completing one) on  the \u201cpressing need for more responsive Indian trust systems.\u201d However,  moving to implement complex systems before developing an architecture  does not expedite solutions. Instead, it greatly increases the chance of  building duplicative systems, introducing potential integration problems,  and perpetuating inefficient and overlapping business processes that  currently exist in Indian trust operations. This is especially true in the case  of TAAMS as Interior does not yet know whether the COTS product can  effectively work with other Interior systems or with Interior-provided data.   Also, as Interior notes in its comments, it consolidated TAAMS and LRIS  from two separate projects into one because the \u201cconsolidation eliminated  duplication within each system (80% of the data is shared), made better use  of limited resources, and eliminated potential integration issues.\u201d Similarly,  Interior states that it is now considering streamlining the probate process  and consolidating the BIA and OHA probate projects. Had Interior  developed a sound architecture, it would have systematically identified the  shared data and overlapping business processes before proposing either  TAAMS and LRIS or BIA probate and OHA probate as separate projects in  the High Level Plan.  Moreover, it would have done the analysis needed to  know whether other duplications and/or inconsistencies exist among its  projects.", "Interior also disagrees with the report\u2019s second conclusion that Interior  does not have reasonable assurance that its acquisition of the new asset  and land records management (TAAMS/LRIS) service will cost effectively  satisfy trust management needs. Our report bases this conclusion on  findings that Interior did not follow sound processes for defining TAAMS/ LRIS requirements, thoroughly analyzing technical alternatives before  selecting an approach, or managing technical risk.", "Interior states that its requirements were adequately defined and that its  requirements definition process consisted of conducting several  requirements reviews with the end-user community and deciding \u201cearly on  to adopt the business processes afforded through implementation of the  COTS product.\u201d  Just as deciding to use COTS products does not  compensate for the lack of an integrated system architecture for Indian  trust operations, selecting a COTS product before thoroughly analyzing  requirements does not constitute an effective requirements definition  process.  Further, while Interior says that it will adopt the business  processes afforded through implementation of the COTS product, it has at  the same time recognized that the COTS product does not meet all of its  requirements and will have to be modified.  For example, Interior must  modify the COTS product to handle fractionated interests and title  requirements that are unique to Indian ownership.", "Interior does not directly address the finding that it did not thoroughly  analyze technical alternatives before choosing a vendor and a COTS  product to provide asset and land records management services.  As  discussed in the report, these technical alternatives include (1) modifying  existing legacy systems, (2) acquiring a COTS product and using existing  Interior infrastructure resources, (3) building a system to provide the  necessary capability, or (4) acquiring a service.  Instead, Interior dismisses  any use of the legacy systems, stating that the systems \u201c. . . employ both  outdated software products and processing techniques . . . ,\u201d and \u201c. . . would  require a virtual rewrite;\u201d does not address the second and third alternative  at all; and states once again, without having performed a gap analysis, that  \u201cthe use of COTS product, combined with a service bureau approach, does  provide the Department an economical and timely solution.\u201d  Because it  has not thoroughly analyzed all technical alternatives and does not have  convincing, objective evidence to support its decision, there is no  assurance that Interior has selected the most cost-effective alternative.", "Interior then describes several actions which it feels minimizes acquisition  risk.  Specifically, it  \u201c. . . established a risk management plan shortly after  awarding the TAAMS contract\u201d; will have other contractors review the  work of the TAAMS contractor; and will evaluate the results of pilot testing.   Because all of these actions occur after the vendor was selected and the  contract awarded, they are not relevant to our finding that Interior did not  follow a sound process for selecting an approach and, therefore, does not  have reasonable assurance that its trust management needs will be met  cost effectively.", "In its comments, Interior says \u201c. . . a rigorous, standard approach was not  used in identifying the requirements for TAAMS . . .\u201d; and \u201c. . . we would  have preferred to use actual BIA data [in Operational Capabilities  Demonstrations], but given the time constraints, we decided to use scripts   . . .\u201d. Further, Interior recognizes that it had to correct resulting errors  identified in our report.  Specifically, the Request for Proposal and/or the  contract for TAAMS had to be changed to clarify terms such as \u201cconflicts of  interest, abuse, and self-dealing\u201d; to correct the mistaken reference to  Public Key encryption; and to require monthly delivery to the government  of all data to facilitate import into other applications.  However, because  Interior does not explicitly recognize the flaws in its processes and does  not acknowledge the relationship between these weaknesses and the  errors that have already occurred, it has not committed to correcting these  weaknesses and it is likely to repeat similar errors in the future.", "Interior also raises several subsidiary issues.  It asserts that our review was  incomplete because we did not assess the TAAMS vendor selection  process, which, in Interior\u2019s opinion, was necessary to determine if the  TAAMS acquisition was cost effective. The objective of our audit was not to  determine how Interior selected its vendor; it was to determine whether  Interior had done the analysis needed to determine what was required and  to select an approach to the project that would be cost-beneficial.  How  Interior selected its vendor is not relevant to that objective and was  therefore not within the scope of our audit.", "Interior claims that we stopped the audit work \u201cprematurely.\u201d However,  Interior does not cite any significant events that occurred or critical  corrections made since the audit ended that would alter our conclusions.   In fact, during the review, we evaluated every document provided by  Interior.  Moreover, this review was initiated, performed, and concluded  after its objectives were completed according to its established schedule.  The only deviation from schedule was made to accommodate Interior\u2019s  request for an additional 6 business days to comment on this report.", "Interior is concerned that we focused only on the TAAMS/LRIS project and  therefore, were not in a position to make broad statements about the High  Level Plan. In focusing on all IT aspects of the plan, we assessed the  interrelationships of the individual 13 projects as well as the overall  process for developing the plan.  This enabled us to determine that Interior  did not have reasonable assurance that the High Level Plan provides an  effective solution for addressing its long-standing management  weaknesses.  We assessed the TAAMS/LRIS project because it was ongoing  during our review, is one of the major IT projects in the High Level Plan,  and illustrates fundamental problems with Interior\u2019s approach.", "Finally, Interior states that once it deploys TAAMS, it will have the means to  reengineer its business processes to the \u201cindustry standard.\u201d  This runs  counter to the basic tenets of reengineering, that is, organizations should  first reengineer business processes and then assess and acquire or build  systems necessary to support those processes.  This enables organizations  to ensure that they implement optimal technical solutions and that they do  not limit their business process alternatives or entrench themselves in  ineffective ways of doing business.", "Interior needs to implement our recommendations to substantially reduce  the risk to key IT systems in trust management operations.

According to Interior\u2019s High Level Plan (page 70), five projects are  classified as data cleanup projects: OST data cleanup, BIA data cleanup,  BIA probate backlog, OHA probate backlog, and BIA appraisal program.   According to the schedules provided in the High Level Plan (pages 64  through 67) OST data cleanup was initiated in January 1998 and BIA data  cleanup project began in August 1998. 2.  Our intent was to present the sequence of events chronologically, not to  imply that there was a change in direction in the middle of the TAAMS  acquisition.   We clarified the language in the report to reflect this more  precisely. 3.  The report does not state that the High Level Plan should include all  high-level requirements. Our report makes the point that the high-level  requirements for all 13 projects were not defined anywhere. 4.  Although Interior\u2019s letter indicates otherwise, neither the RFP nor the  amendment included any definitions for the terms \u201cconflicts of interest,  abuse and self-dealing.\u201d  In subsequent correspondence to us, Interior  officials told us that they believe these terms are commonly used and do  not require additional definition.  However, Interior requires that TAAMS  implement safeguards to identify incidents of conflicts of interest, abuse,  and self-dealing.  Precise definition of requirements, not assumptions about  \u201ccommon usage\u201d for terms that by their nature are subject to broad  interpretation, is needed to implement systems features effectively. 5.  The TAAMS RFP states this requirement as follows: \u201cAccess to the  system shall at a minimum require unique user IDs with passwords. The  system shall record unsuccessful attempts . . .\u201d The parenthetical phrase  discussing password length does not appear.  After receiving a draft of this  report, Interior issued an amendment to the contract containing the phrase.   This is  another example of inadequate requirement definition that Interior  is addressing piecemeal and ad hoc, without correcting the fundamental  process weaknesses that caused the problem. 6.  Section J of the RFP contains a collection of data elements from  different legacy systems, but it is not a data dictionary for TAAMS.  Because  the data elements required by TAAMS were not defined prior to asking  vendors to respond to the TAAMS RFP, Interior has no assurance that the  vendor\u2019s product can handle all data elements crucial to Indian trust  operations. 7.  We are not suggesting a priori that the legacy system is a viable solution.   Neither we nor Interior can make informed decisions without analyzing  relevant data.  We are pointing out that, consistent with the Clinger-Cohen  Act and good IT investment practices, Interior should have evaluated all  technical alternatives before selecting one. 8.  Interior has quoted this statement out of context. The full sentence from  our draft report states: \u201cSpecifically, although Interior concluded based on  the results of its Request for Information that none of the COTS products  available from responding vendors would meet all its requirements,  Interior did not determine, for each COTS product, which requirements  could not be satisfied and how difficult and expensive it would be to make  the needed modifications.\"  Our point is that Interior did not perform a gap  analysis on products available in the marketplace to determine whether the  COTS approach was optimum.  According to a Mitretek official, the  Mitretek study was completed after the Request for Proposal was issued  and was intended to serve as the government\u2019s independent cost estimate  for use in source selection.    9.  Interior is in error.  While all projects do, indeed, contain some elements  of risk, our point was that Interior was incurring and not mitigating  unnecessarily high levels of risk because it does not have an integrated  architecture for Indian trust operations and has not corrected fundamental  weaknesses in its IT management processes."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Major Contributors to This Report", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Accounting and Information Management Division, Washington, D.C.", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Office of General Counsel", "paragraphs": ["The first copy of each GAO report and testimony is free.
