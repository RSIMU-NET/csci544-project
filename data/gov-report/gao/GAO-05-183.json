The GAO's analysis indicates that total cost growth on these ships could reach $3.1 billion or even more if shipyards do not maintain current efficiency and meet schedules. Cost growth for the CVN 77 aircraft carrier and the San Antonio lead ship (LPD 17) has been particularly pronounced. Increases in labor hour and material costs together account for 77 percent of the cost growth on the eight ships. Shipbuilders frequently cited design modifications, the need for additional and more costly materials, and changes in employee pay and benefits as the key causes of this growth. For example, the San Antonio's lead ship's systems design continued to evolve even as construction began, which required rebuilding of completed areas to accommodate the design changes. Materials costs were often underbudgeted, as was the case with the Virginia class submarines and Nimitz class aircraft carriers. For the CVN 77 carrier, the shipbuilder is estimating a substantial increase in material costs. Navy practices for estimating costs, contracting, and budgeting for ships have resulted in unrealistic funding of programs, increasing the likelihood of cost growth. Despite inherent uncertainties in the ship acquisition process, the Navy does not account for the probability of cost growth when estimating costs. Moreover, the Navy did not conduct an independent cost estimate for carriers or when substantial changes occurred in a ship class, which could have provided decision makers with additional knowledge about a program's potential costs. In addition, contract prices were negotiated and budgets established without sufficient design knowledge and construction knowledge. When unexpected events did occur, the incomplete and untimely reporting on program progress delayed the identification of problems and the Navy's ability to correct them."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["U.S. Navy warships are the most technologically advanced in the world.

Because of the size and routine occurrence of prior year funding, we were  asked to analyze cost overruns on Navy shipbuilding programs.  Specifically, this report (1) estimates the current and projected cost  growth on selected ship construction contracts, (2) breaks down and  examines the components of the cost growth, and (3) identifies any  funding and management practices that contribute to cost growth.", "To address these objectives, we looked at cost growth in the four classes  of ships that account for the majority of the funding for new shipbuilding  and prior year bills, focusing on ships with construction contracts that  were more than 30 percent complete at the time we began our review.  Within each class, we selected two ships currently under contract as case  studies: DDG 91 and DDG 92 in the Arleigh Burke class of destroyers,  CVN 76 and CVN 77 in the Nimitz class of aircraft carriers, LPD 17 and  LPD 18 in the San Antonio class of transports, and SSN 774 and SSN 775 in  the Virginia class of submarines. To estimate the total projected cost  growth on construction contracts, we used contractor performance  reports, projecting high and low estimates for the costs to complete the  ships in the four classes we reviewed. We looked at cost growth by  comparing the initial budget request to the Congress and the updated  budget included in the 2005 President\u2019s budget and by comparing the  initial contract award to the latest estimate at completion. The latest  estimate at completion includes changes to the original baseline or scope  of work. For all ships currently under construction, we also estimated  total cost growth since contract award, using contractor performance  reports to project high and low estimates for the costs to complete  construction of these ships. To break down and examine the components  of cost growth on the eight case study ships, we analyzed the Navy's cost  estimates, its budget requests to the Congress, contractor performance  reports, and other cost data for each of the eight case study ships. To  assess funding and management practices, we spoke with the shipbuilders,  Navy and Defense Contract Audit Agency officials, and reviewed  supporting documentation. Our work was conducted between July 2003  and December 2004 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards. Our analyses and forecasts were based on data  available to us in July 2004. To the extent significant changes occurred, we  incorporated information from the fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s budget. For  a complete description of our scope and methodology, see appendix I.

Four  ship classes, with 23 ships under construction or recently completed,  make up 96 percent of the Navy\u2019s fiscal year 2005 budget for new  construction shipbuilding. (See table 1.)", "Navy ships are complex defense systems, using advanced designs with  state-of-the-art weapons, communications, and navigation technologies.  Ships require many years to plan, budget, design, and build. Like other  weapon acquisition programs, ship acquisitions begin with developing a  system design. For ships, system design is followed by a detail design  phase where specific construction plans are developed. Ship construction  follows and typically takes 4 to 7 years. Construction time for other  defense systems is much shorter\u2014a fighter aircraft takes about 2 years  from start of production to roll out from the factory floor; a tank takes  about a year.

Moreover, the total cost for a  ship must be budgeted for in its first year of construction. Provisions are  made in the event cost growth occurs during construction. The Navy\u2019s  budgeting for cost growth has changed over the past 2 decades. During the  early 1970s and through most of the 1980s, the Navy used program cost  reserves built into ship construction budgets and the Ship Cost  Adjustment process to manage cost growth. During the 1980s, the Navy  procured an average of 17 ships each year. In fiscal year 1988, the Navy  removed program cost reserves from ship construction budgets and began  exclusively using the Ship Cost Adjustment process, shifting funding  between shipbuilding construction programs underrunning cost to  programs that were overrunning costs. Following the end of the Cold War,  the Navy decreased the procurement rate of ships to about 6 per year.  Beginning in fiscal year 1999, cost increases could no longer be covered  using the Ship Cost Adjustment process because no shipbuilding program  was under cost. In 2001, the process was eliminated, which required the  Navy to fund cost growth through the current mechanism of prior year  completion bills."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Components of Shipbuilding Costs", "paragraphs": ["The cost of building a ship can be broken down into four main  components: labor, material, and overhead associated with the  shipbuilders\u2019 contract for the basic ship, and Navy-furnished equipment\u2014 that is, items purchased by the Navy and provided to the contractor for  installation on the ship.

Cost reimbursement contracts provide for payment of allowable  incurred costs, to the extent prescribed in the contract. If the ship cannot  be completed within agreed upon cost limits, the government is  responsible for the additional costs to complete.", "The level of knowledge, or certainty, in the cost estimates for a ship is key  to determining which type of contract to use. Contracts for the first ship of  a new class are often negotiated as cost-reimbursable contracts because  these ships tend to involve a high-level of uncertainty and, thus, high cost  risks. Cost reimbursement contracts were used to procure the San Antonio  and Virginia class ships we reviewed. More mature shipbuilding programs,  where there is greater certainty about costs, are typically fixed-price  contracts with an incentive fee (profit). Fixed-price contracts were used to  procure the Arleigh Burke and Nimitz class ships we reviewed. Both cost- reimbursable and fixed-price incentive fee contracts can include a target  cost, a target profit, and a formula that allows the profit to be adjusted by  comparing the actual cost to the target cost. Construction contracts for  ships generally include provisions for controlling cost growth with  incentive fees, whereby the Navy and the shipbuilder split any savings  when the contract cost is less than its anticipated target. Conversely, when  costs exceed the target, the excess is shared between the Navy and the  shipbuilder."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "New Ships Continue to Cost More Than Budgeted", "paragraphs": ["Ship cost growth continues to pose additional funding demands on the  budget. Budgets for the eight case study ships alone have required  increases of $2.1 billion, and Congress has appropriated funds to cover  these increases. However, the total projected cost growth on contracts for  the eight ships is likely to be higher. Consequently, the Navy will need in  excess of $1 billion in additional appropriations to cover the total  projected cost growth. Cost growth was more pronounced for the lead  ships in the two new classes we looked at\u2014the Virginia class and  especially the San Antonio class\u2014than the more mature Arleigh Burke and  Nimitz classes.

Ship  construction costs comprise the majority of this increase.", "We were not able to determine how much of this increase was due to  changes in the scope of the contract and how much of the growth funded  increases in the costs of completing the initial contract scope. Amounts  identified by shipbuilders and Navy program offices differed substantially.  However, the initial program budgets included funding to support changes  in the scope of the construction contract. These funds amounted to a small  share of the initial program budget: 3 percent for DDGs 91 and 92; 5  percent for CVN 76 and CVN 77; 7 percent for LPD 17 and 4 percent for  LPD 18; and 3 and 4 percent for SSNs 774 and 775, respectively.", "While the Congress has appropriated funds to cover a $2.1 billion increase  in the ships\u2019 costs, more funds will likely be needed to cover additional  cost growth likely for these eight ships. At the time we completed our  analysis in 2004, we calculated a range of the potential growth for the eight  case study ships and found that the total projected cost growth would  likely exceed $2.8 billion and could reach $3.1 billion. (See table 4.)", "These cost growth estimates have already proven to be too conservative.  In its fiscal year 2006 budget submission, the Navy recognizes an  additional cost growth of $223 million for SSN 775 and $908 million for  CVN 77 above its fiscal year 2005 request. In addition, our estimates  assumed that the shipyards will maintain their current efficiency through  the end of their contracts and meet scheduled milestones. Any slips in  efficiency and schedules would likely result in added costs. For example,  the delivery date for SSN 775 is expected to slip by as many as 9 months,  which, according to the fiscal year 2006 President\u2019s budget has increased  the final cost of the ship even more. According to program officials, the  delivery date for the LPD 17 has been changed from December 2004 to  May 2005, and the delivery date for the CVN 77 is expected to slip into  2009.", "Cost growth on new ships has a number of implications. Most tangible,  perhaps, is the significant portion of the ship construction budget that  must be devoted to overruns on ships already under construction. From  fiscal years 2001 to 2005, 5 to 14 percent of the Navy\u2019s ship construction  budget, which totaled about $52 billion over the 5-year period, went to pay  for cost growth for ships funded in prior years. This reduces the buying  power of the budget for current construction and can slow the pace of  modernization. The Navy is in the early stages of buying a number of  advanced ships, including the Virginia class submarine, DD(X) destroyer,  CVN 21 aircraft carrier, and Littoral Combat Ship.

According to the shipbuilders we interviewed, many of the tasks needed to  build ships are complex and require experienced journeymen to efficiently  carry them out. Yet, the majority of the shipbuilders noted that the  shipyards have lost a significant portion of their highly skilled and  experienced workers.

However, for LPD 17, which  experienced over 100-percent growth in material costs, 70 percent of the  material cost increases were actually costs for subcontracts to support  design of the lead ship.", "Growth in materials costs was due, in part, to the Navy and shipbuilders\u2019  underbudgeting for these costs. For example, the materials budget for the  first four Virginia-class submarines was $132 million less than quotes  received from vendors and subcontractors. The shipbuilder agreed to take  on the challenge of achieving lower costs in exchange for providing in the  contract that the shipbuilder would be reimbursed for cost growth in high  value, specialized materials. In addition, the materials budget for CVN 76  and CVN 77 was based on an incomplete list of materials needed to  construct the ship, leading to especially sharp increases in estimated  materials costs. In this case, the Defense Contract Audit Agency criticized  the shipbuilder\u2019s estimating system, particularly the system for material  and subcontract costs, and stated that the resulting estimates \u201cdo not  provide an acceptable basis for negotiation of a fair and reasonable price.\u201d  Underbudgeting of materials has contributed to cost growth recognized in  the fiscal year 2006 budget.", "Price increases also contributed to the growth in materials costs. For  example, the price of array equipment on the Virginia class submarines  rose by $33 million above the original price estimate. In addition to  inflation, a limited supplier base for highly specialized and unique  materials made ship materials susceptible to price increases. According to  the shipbuilders, the low rate of ship production has affected the stability  of the supplier base\u2014some businesses have closed or merged, leading to  reduced competition for the services they once produced and that may be  a cause of higher prices. In some cases, the Navy lost its position as a  preferred customer and the shipbuilder had to wait longer to receive  materials. With a declining number of suppliers, more ship materials  contracts have gone to single and sole source vendors. Over 75 percent of  the materials for the Virginia class submarines\u2014which were reduced in  number from 14 to 9 ships over a 10-year period\u2014is produced by single  source vendors.", "Spending on subcontracts and leased labor also increased material costs  on some case study ships.

Uncertainty analyses and independent estimates are particularly important  given the inherent uncertainties in the ship acquisition process, such as  the introduction of new technologies and volatile overhead rates over  time, creating a significant challenge for cost analysts to develop credible  initial cost estimates. The Navy must develop cost estimates as much as  10 years before ship construction begins\u2014before many program details  are known. As a result, cost analysts have to make a number of  assumptions about certain ship parameters, such as weight, performance,  or software, and about market conditions, such as inflation rates,  workforce attrition, and supplier base.", "In the eight case study ships we examined, cost analysts relied on the  actual cost of previously constructed ships without adequately accounting  for changes in the industrial base, ship design, or construction methods.  Cost data available to Navy cost analysts were based on higher ship  construction rates from the 1980s. As a result, these data were based on  lower costs due to economies of scale\u2014which were not reflective of the  lower procurement rates after 1989. In addition, in developing cost  estimates for DDG 91, DDG 92, LPD 17, and SSN 774, cost analysts relied  on actual cost data from previous ships in the same class or a similar class  but that were less technologically advanced. By using data from less  complex ships, Navy cost analysts tended to underestimate the costs  needed to construct the ships.", "For CVN 76, cost analysts used proposed costs from CVN 74 with  adjustments made for design changes and economic factors. However,  CVN 74 and CVN 75 were more economical ships because both were  procured in a single year\u2014which resulted in savings from economies of  scale. While cost analysts adjusted their estimates to account for the  single-ship buy, costs increased far beyond the adjustment. Even in more  mature programs\u2014like the Arleigh Burke destroyers and the Nimitz  aircraft carriers\u2014improved capabilities and modifications made the costs  of previous ships in the class essentially less analogous.", "Other unknowns also led to uncertain estimates in the case study ships.  Labor hour and material costs were based not only on data from previous  ships but also on unproven efficiencies in ship construction. We found  analysts often factored in savings based on expected efficiencies that  never materialized. For example, cost analysts anticipated savings through  the implementation of computer-assisted design/computer-assisted  manufacturing for LPD 17, but the contractor had not made the requisite  research investments to achieve the proposed savings. Similar unproven  or unsupported efficiencies were estimated for DDG 92 and CVN 76.  Changes in the shipbuilders\u2019 supplier base also created uncertainties in the  shipbuilders\u2019 overhead costs.", "Despite these uncertainties, the Navy did not test the validity of the  assumptions made by the cost analysts in estimating the construction  costs for the eight case study ships nor did the Navy identify a confidence  level for estimates. Specifically, it did not conduct uncertainty analyses,  which generate values for parameters that are less than precisely known  around a specific set of ranges. For example, if the number of hours to  integrate a component onto a ship is not precisely known, analysts may  put in a low and high value. The estimate will generate costs for these  variables along with other variables such as\u2014weight, experience, and  degree of rework. The result is a range of estimates that enables cost  analysts to make better decisions on likely costs. Instead, the Navy  presented its cost estimates as unqualified point estimates, suggesting an  element of precision that cannot exist early on and obscures the  investment risk remaining for the programs. While imprecision decreases  during the program\u2019s life cycle as more information becomes known about  the program, experts emphasize that to be useful, each cost estimate  should include an indication of its degree of uncertainty, possibly as an  estimated range or qualified by some factor of confidence. Other services  qualify their cost estimates by determining a confidence level of  50 percent.", "The Navy also did not conduct independent cost estimates for some ships,  which is required at certain major acquisition milestones. Independent  cost estimates can provide decision makers with additional insight into a  program\u2019s potential costs\u2014in part because these estimates frequently use  different methodologies and may be less burdened with organizational  bias. Independent cost analysts also tend to incorporate cost for risk as  they develop their estimates, which the Navy cost analysts did not do. As a  result, these independent estimates tend to be more conservative\u2014 forecasting higher costs than those forecast by the program office.  Department of Defense officials considered the CVN 68 and DDG 51  programs mature programs and, therefore, did not require independent  estimates. Yet, an independent cost estimate has never been conducted on  a CVN 68 class carrier because the program for this class of ships began  prior to the establishment of an independent cost-estimating group in  DOD. However, Navy officials noted that every carrier is a new program,  different from previous carriers. Although an independent cost estimate  was conducted for the DDG 51 program, it was conducted in 1993, and  since that time, the DDG ships have undergone four major upgrades.", "The Navy has begun taking some actions to improve its cost estimating  capabilities. For example, future programs will be funded at the DOD  independent estimators\u2019 level, which should provide a more conservative  estimate and include risk analysis. In addition, Navy officials told us that  they are in the process of revising cost estimating guidance to include  requirements for risk and uncertainty analysis.

Target prices for detail design and construction of the lead  and early follow-on ships are typically negotiated at one time. In these  cases the Navy does not make use of knowledge gained during detailed  design or during construction of the lead ship to establish more realistic  prices.

For example, for the San Antonio class ships, the Navy negotiated  prices for the detail design and construction of the lead ship (LPD 17) and  the first two follow-on ships (LPD 18 and LPD 19) at the same time. By  negotiating target prices for these ships before detail design even began,  target prices for these three ships did not benefit from information gained  during detail design about the materials and equipment or specific  processes that will be used to construct the ship. Target prices for the  follow-on ships, LPD 18 and LPD 19, did not benefit from knowledge  gained in initial construction of LPD 17. In contrast, for the Virginia class  ships, the Navy negotiated detail design separately from construction,  benefiting from the knowledge gained from detail design in negotiating  prices for construction. However, 2 years after negotiating the detail  design contract, the Navy negotiated target prices for the SSN 774 and  SSN 775, both considered lead ships for the two shipyards involved in  constructing submarines. Target prices for the first two follow-on ships,  SSN 776 and SSN 777 were agreed on at this time as well. As a result,  target prices for these follow-on ships did not benefit from the knowledge  gained from constructing the lead ships.", "The practice of setting target prices early on affects not only the realism of  the contract target prices, but also the realism of the budgets approved by  the Congress to fund these contracts. In order to fund a contract covering  both detail design and lead ship construction, authorization and funding  for detail design and lead ship construction is approved by the Congress in  one budget year, before detail design begins. For example, the Congress  funded detail design and construction of LPD 17 in the fiscal year 1996  budget. While the follow-on ships, LPDs 19 and 20, were funded in  later years, budgets were still unrealistic because the target prices were  used as a basis for the budget request.", "The size of the budget and the contract conditions can also affect the  realism of target prices. In negotiating the contract for the first four  Virginia class ships, program officials stated that the target price they  could negotiate was limited to the amount included in approved or  planned budgets. The shipbuilders said that they accepted a challenge to  design and construct these ships for $748 million less than their estimated  costs because the contract protected their financial risk. The contract  included a large minimum fee (profit), in addition to the incentive fee that  would be reduced in the event of cost growth. Moreover, the contract was  structured so that the Navy would pay the full cost of increases for  specialized, highly engineered components rather than share the cost  increases with the shipbuilder. The Navy also was responsible for the full  amount of growth in certain labor costs.", "Recently, the Navy has supported the preparation of more realistic budget  requests. Program managers are encouraged to budget to their own  estimate of expected costs rather than at target prices that are not  considered realistic.

Programs may undergo several changes after the required estimate, such  as the Arleigh Burke destroyer, which underwent four major upgrades  since its only independent estimate in 1993. We believe DOD needs to  establish criteria concerning what significant changes to a program trigger  an independent cost estimate and have modified our recommendations  accordingly. DOD could clarify whether these changes include baseline,  profile, or major systems upgrades, for instance.", "DOD stated that it will consider, on a case-by-case basis, negotiating detail  design separately from the lead ship and negotiating early follow-on ships  separately from the lead ship. We believe that this approach should be the  normal policy, if overruns are to be reduced.

Ships costing substantially less\u2014for example, $220 million for each  Littoral Combat Ship\u2014are the exception rather than the norm. A realistic  target price is important for structuring contract incentives and providing  informed budgets to the Congress. Deciding prices for the lead ship and  follow-on ships together before detail design has even begun on the lead  ship is unlikely to yield realistic prices. Insight gained into material costs  and labor effort even in the first year of detail design will make realistic  pricing of the lead ship more feasible. Similarly, experience gained in the  first years of construction can benefit the realism of prices for follow-on  ships.", "DOD noted that the Navy is already requiring shipbuilders to submit cost  performance reports monthly with one exception. With the Nimitz class  program beginning monthly reporting in March 2006, the Virginia class will  be the only program to submit quarterly instead of monthly cost  performance reports.

While informal access to timely data is preferable to  delayed access, without written, formal cost reporting there is less  visibility or accountability from the last formal report to the next cost  performance report 3 months later. The Virginia class program has  experienced significant cost increases and experienced one of the largest  prior year funding requests of programs we reviewed. LPD 17 and carrier  program officials recognized that more frequent formal reporting and  review of cost performance helped them to better manage cost growth and  changed their program reporting requirements from quarterly to monthly.  Although variance analysis reporting is required as part of cost  performance reporting and is being conducted by the shipbuilders, we  observed that there is wide variation in the quality of these reports. DOD  rightly observes that these reports are one of many tools used by the  shipbuilders and DOD to track performance. To be a useful tool, however,  we believe it is important that shipbuilders provide the government with  detailed analyses of the root causes and impacts of cost and schedule  variances.

Most shipbuilders allocate  contract costs into three categories: material costs, labor costs, and  overhead costs. We, however, used these data to allocate costs into the  following categories: labor hours, material costs, and labor and overhead  rates. Since labor costs and overhead costs can change due to labor hours,  and labor and overhead rates, we separated the program overhead cost  associated with an increase in labor and overhead rates from the program  overhead cost associated with an increase in labor hours.

In  April 2002\u20147 years after construction began on CVN 76\u2014about  $32 million in errors in material purchase estimates were revealed. CVN 77  has also experienced a significant increase in material costs due to under  budgeting. According to the shipbuilder, a compressed construction  schedule on CVN 77 resulted in the budget for materials being established  prior to the completion of the carrier\u2019s design and even the completion of  design work on certain systems on CVN 76. As a result, the true magnitude  of the carrier\u2019s material costs was not known at the time of the contract  negotiation. Early in CVN 77 construction, however, the shipbuilder  reassessed the materials needed for construction in order to have a more  realistic estimate of final material costs. The Navy and the Defense  Contract Audit Agency recognized the absence of needed information on  materials during its review of the shipbuilder\u2019s proposal and expressed  concerns about the adequacy of the cost estimating system.

The Navy  deemed the carrier overhaul and refueling effort as a higher priority than  new ship construction because carriers were needed back in the fleet to  meet warfighting requirements. Many of the most skilled laborers were  moved to the refueling effort, leaving fewer workers to construct CVN 76.  Without many of the necessary laborers to construct the ship, the CVN 76  construction schedule was delayed.

For example,  many vendors were reluctant to support the Virginia class submarine  contract because costs associated with producing small quantities of  highly specialized materials were not considered worth the investment\u2014 especially for equipment with no other military or commercial  applications.", "Material costs also increased due to nonrecurring costs for integrating  computer data so that the shipbuilders could work from a common design.

In addition, since  ships are funded individually, the Navy believes suppliers are unwilling to  risk investing in technology improvements due to the uncertainty that  future ships will not be purchased. To stabilize the vendor base, the Navy  awarded a multiyear contract that commits the Navy to purchasing  additional submarines.
