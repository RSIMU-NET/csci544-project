The United States provides GPS data free of charge. The Air Force, which is responsible for GPS acquisition, is in the process of modernizing GPS. In light of the importance of GPS, the modernization effort, and international efforts to develop new systems, GAO was asked to undertake a broad review of GPS. Specifically, GAO assessed progress in (1) acquiring GPS satellites, (2) acquiring the ground control and user equipment necessary to leverage GPS satellite capabilities, and evaluated (3) coordination among federal agencies and other organizations to ensure GPS missions can be accomplished. To carry out this assessment, GAO's efforts included reviewing and analyzing program documentation, conducting its own analysis of Air Force satellite data, and interviewing key military and civilian officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["It is uncertain whether the Air Force will be able to acquire new satellites in time to maintain current GPS service without interruption. If not, some military operations and some civilian users could be adversely affected. In recent years, the Air Force has struggled to successfully build GPS satellites within cost and schedule goals; it encountered significant technical problems that still threaten its delivery schedule; and it struggled with a different contractor. As a result, the current IIF satellite program has overrun its original cost estimate by about $870 million and the launch of its first satellite has been delayed to November 2009--almost 3 years late. Further, while the Air Force is structuring the new GPS IIIA program to prevent repeating mistakes made on the IIF program, the Air Force is aiming to deploy the next generation of GPS sa this schedule is optimistic, given the program's late start, past trends in space acquisitions, and challenges facing the new contracto tellites 3 years faster than the IIF satellites. GAO's analysis found that r. Of particular concern is leadership for GPS acquisition, as GAO and other studies have found the lack of a single point of authority for space programs and frequent turnover in program managers have hampered requirements setting, funding stability, and resource allocation. If the Air Force does not meet its schedule goals for development of GPS IIIA satellites, there will be an increased likelihood that in 2010, as old satellites begin to fail, the overall GPS constellation will fall below the number of satellites required to provide the level of GPS service that the U.S. government commits to. Such a gap in capability could have wide-ranging impacts on all GPS users, though there are measures the Air Force and others can take to plan for and minimize these impacts. In addition to risks facing the acquisition of new GPS satellites, the Air Force has not been fully successful in synchronizing the acquisition and development of the next generation of GPS satellites with the ground control and user equipment, thereby delaying the ability of military users to fully utilize new GPS satellite capabilities. Diffuse leadership has been a contributing factor, given that there is no single authority responsible for synchronizing all procurements and fielding related to GPS, and funding has been diverted from ground programs to pay for problems in the space segment. DOD and others involved in ensuring GPS can serve communities beyond the military have taken prudent steps to manage requirements and coordinate among the many organizations involved with GPS. However, GAO identified challenges to ensuring civilian requirements and ensuring GPS compatibility with other new, potentially competing global space-based positioning, navigation, and timing systems."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Global Positioning System (GPS)\u2014a space-based satellite system that  provides positioning, navigation, and timing data to users worldwide\u2014has  become essential to U.S. national security and a key component in  economic growth, transportation safety, homeland security, and critical  national infrastructure in the United States and abroad.

For instance, civil  agencies, commercial firms, and individuals use GPS to accurately  navigate from one point to another. Commercial firms use GPS to route  their vehicles, as do maritime industries and mass transit systems. In  addition to navigation, civil departments and agencies and commercial  firms use GPS and GPS augmentations to provide high-accuracy, three- dimensional positioning information in real time for use in surveying and  mapping. The aviation community worldwide uses GPS and GPS  augmentations to increase the safety and efficiency of flight. GPS is also  used in the agricultural community for precision farming, including farm  planning, field mapping, soil sampling, tractor guidance, and crop  scouting.

TSPR gave a contractor total responsibility for the integration of  an entire weapon system and for meeting DOD\u2019s requirements. This  approach was intended to facilitate acquisition reform and enable DOD to  streamline a cumbersome acquisition process and leverage innovation and  management expertise from the private sector. However, DOD later found  that TSPR magnified problems on a number of satellite acquisition  programs because it was implemented in a manner that enabled  requirements creep and poor contractor performance. For GPS IIF, the  TSPR approach resulted in relaxed specifications and inspections of the  contractor, loss of quality in the manufacturing process, and poor-quality  parts that caused test failures, unexpected redesigns, and the late delivery  of parts. The contractor did not provide data on design drawings and  statistical process control techniques were not used to monitor  production.", "According to GPS program officials, the GPS IIF program was also  negatively impacted by multiple contractor mergers, acquisitions, and  moves. In 1996, shortly after Rockwell won the IIF contract, the company\u2019s  aerospace and defense units, including the Seal Beach, California, facility  where the IIF satellites were to be manufactured, were acquired by  Boeing. In December 1997, Boeing merged with McDonnell Douglas and  took over its Delta launch vehicle unit in Huntington Beach, California,  and subsequently GPS work was moved to that facility. In October 2000,  Boeing acquired Hughes Electronics Corporation\u2019s space and  communications business and related operations. Boeing took over the  Hughes facility in El Segundo, California, and once again, GPS work was  moved to another facility. As these events occurred, the prime contractor  consolidated development facilities to remain competitive. In addition, the  prime contractor lost valuable workers and knowledge, causing  inefficiencies in the program.", "Shortly after the IIF contract was awarded in 1996, the Air Force also  added requirements. For example, the government decided to accelerate  the fielding of new civil and military GPS signals. Flexible power  capabilities were added to IIF several years later. These new requirements  drove design changes and resulted in technical issues and cost overruns  that impacted the schedule.", "According to a GPS IIF program official, the combination of significant  requirements additions, loss of engineering expertise, parts obsolescence,  and fundamental design changes together caused the contractor to \u201close  the recipe\u201d for the IIF space vehicle. In essence, by the completion of the  design phase, the IIF space vehicle was to be built in a third location, by  different people, in a way that was not initially anticipated. In addition, the  program suffered from a lack of management continuity. Since the  program\u2019s inception, the IIF program has had seven different program  managers, the first five of whom only served 1 year each.", "According to a former deputy program director of the GPS program office,  past GPS programs seemed to operate well for a number of reasons. The  programs (1) never added major modifications to ongoing programs and  (2) had no qualms in terminating contractors if work did not meet  standards, business practices, or major milestones. Furthermore, the GPS  program performed more on-site contract management to increase  communications. This approach eliminated surprises like cost and  schedule overruns and held the contractor to a high level of performance.  Lastly, the former director noted that it was important to balance the  responsibility assigned to the program managers with the authority they  needed to properly implement the program. Prior GAO reviews have  identified all of these practices as essential to program execution."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Air Force Improves Oversight of IIF, but Technical Issues Lead to More Delays", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force has since taken action to improve the IIF program. In 2006,  the program office increased its personnel at the contractor\u2019s facility to  observe operations and to verify that corrective measures were being  taken to address deficiencies in the contractor\u2019s cost and schedule  reporting system (also known as earned value management). The Air  Force increased the number of personnel to work on the contractor site,  which included military and civilian personnel, as well as Defense  Contract Management Agency personnel and system engineering  contractors. Greater presence at the contractor\u2019s factory has enabled the  government to find out about problems as they happen and work with the  contractor to come up with solutions and resolve issues quicker,  according to GPS program officials.", "Nonetheless, the program has experienced more technical problems. For  example, last year, during the first phase of thermal vacuum testing (a  critical test to determine space-worthiness that subjects the satellite to  space-like operating conditions), one transmitter used to send the  navigation message to the users failed. The program suspended testing in  August 2008 to allow time for the contractor to identify the causes of the  problem and take corrective actions. The program also had difficulty  maintaining the proper propellant fuel-line temperature; this, in addition to  power failures on the satellite, delayed final integration testing. In  addition, the satellite\u2019s reaction wheels, used for pointing accuracy, were  redesigned because on-orbit failures on similar reaction wheels were  occurring on other satellite programs\u2014this added about $10 million to the  program\u2019s cost.", "As a result of these problems, the IIF program experienced cost increases  and schedule delays. The launch of the first IIF satellite has been delayed  until November 2009\u2014almost 3 years late. According to the program  office, the cost to complete GPS IIF will be about $1.6 billion\u2014about $870  million over the original cost estimate of $729 million.", "In addition, in 2006 we testified that diffuse leadership over military space  acquisitions was another factor contributing to late delivery of capability  and cost growth. We noted that the diverse array of officials and  organizations involved with a space program has made it difficult to pare  back and control requirements. GPS was one example we cited. According  to the Air Force, in 1998 the government decided to accelerate the fielding  of new civil and military GPS signals and added requirements for these  signals to the IIR and IIF GPS satellites. These new requirements drove  design changes and resulted in technical issues, cost overruns, and  program delays."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Problems Experienced in GPS IIF Seen in Other Space System Acquisitions", "paragraphs": ["The problems experienced on the IIF program are not unlike those  experienced in other DOD space system acquisitions. We have previously  reported that the majority of major acquisition programs in DOD\u2019s space  portfolio have experienced problems during the past two decades that  have driven up costs, caused delays in schedules, and increased technical  risk. DOD has restructured several programs in the face of delays and  cost growth. At times, cost growth has come close to or exceeded 100  percent, causing DOD to nearly double its investment without realizing a  better return on investment. Along with the increases, many programs are  experiencing significant schedule delays\u2014as much as 7 years\u2014postponing  delivery of promised capabilities to the warfighter. Outcomes have been so  disappointing in some cases that DOD has gone back to the drawing board  to consider new ways to achieve the same, or less, capability.", "Our work has identified a variety of reasons for the cost growth, many of  which surfaced in GPS IIF. Generally, we have found that DOD starts its  space programs too early, that is before it has assurance that the  capabilities it is pursuing can be achieved within resources and time  constraints. We have also tied acquisition problems in space to inadequate  contracting strategies; contract and program management weaknesses; the  loss of technical expertise; capability gaps in the industrial base; tensions  between labs that develop technologies for the future and current  acquisition programs; divergent needs in users of space systems; and other  issues that have been well documented.", "We also noted that short tenures for top leadership and program managers  within the Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense have  lessened the sense of accountability for acquisition problems and further  encouraged a view of short-term success. Several other studies have  raised similar issues. In 2003, a study conducted for the Defense Science  Board, for example, found that government capabilities to lead and  manage the space acquisition process have seriously eroded, particularly  within program management ranks. A 2005 Defense Science Board study  focused specifically on the future of GPS found that the program was  hampered by sometimes overlapping, sometimes disconnected roles of  Office of the Secretary of Defense staff components, the Joint Staff, and  the Air Force. More recently, a commission formed pursuant to the John  Warner National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007,   concluded in 2008 that there is currently no single authority responsible  for national security space\u2014which includes GPS\u2014below the President  and that within DOD authorities are spread among a variety of  organizations, including the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the Air  Force, the other military services, the Missile Defense Agency, and the  National Reconnaissance Office with no effective mechanism to arrive at a  unified budget and set priorities. A study chartered by the House Select  Committee on Intelligence also recently found leadership for space  acquisitions to be too diffused at higher levels and that there are critical  shortages in skilled program managers. While recent studies have made  recommendations for strengthening leadership for space acquisitions, no  major changes to the leadership structure have been made in recent years.  In fact, an \u201cexecutive agent\u201d position within the Air Force which was  designated in 2001 to provide leadership has not been filled since the last  executive resigned in 2005.", "GPS IIF acquisition problems have not been as extreme as those  experienced on other efforts such as the Space Based Infrared System  (SBIRS) and the National Polar-orbiting Operational Environmental  Satellite System (NPOESS).

However,  the Air Force will still be challenged to deliver IIIA on time because the  satellite development schedule is compressed.

This  includes  reevaluating the contractor incentive/award fee approach;    providing a commitment from the Air Force to fully fund GPS IIIA in  Program Objectives Memorandum 2010;  funding and executing recommended mitigation measures to address the  next generation operational control segment and the GPS IIIA satellites;    combining the existing and new ground control segment levels of effort  into a single level of effort, giving the Air Force greater flexibility to  manage these efforts;    not allowing the program manager to adjust the GPS IIIA program scope to  meet increased or accelerated technical specifications, system  requirements, or system performance; and    conducting an independent technology readiness assessment of the  contractor design once the preliminary design review is complete.", "Table 2 below highlights the major differences in the framework between  the GPS IIF and GPS III programs.", "While these measures should put the GPS IIIA program on sounder  footing, the program is facing serious obstacles\u2014primarily in terms of its  ability to deliver satellites on schedule. At present, the GPS IIIA program is  on schedule and program officials contend that there is no reason to  assume that a delay is likely to occur. They point out that the Air Force is  implementing an incremental development approach and GPS IIIA, the  first increment of GPS III, is not expected to be as technically challenging  as other space programs. In addition, program officials point out that the  Air Force began risk reduction activities in 1998, and has made a  concerted effort to exert more oversight over its contractors and ensure  key decisions are backed by sufficient knowledge about technologies,  design, and production.", "We recognize that these steps offer the best course for GPS to be  completed on time. However, we believe there is still considerable risk  that the schedule may not be met for the following reasons.", "First, the GPS IIIA program got off to a late start. The program was  originally scheduled to begin development in August 2007. However,  according to GPS program officials, the Air Force shifted funds from GPS  III to other commitments in its space portfolio and to address problems in  other programs. The Defense Space Acquisition Board approved formal  initiation of the GPS IIIA acquisition in May 2008.", "Second, when compared to other DOD satellite programs, the GPS IIIA  program schedule appears highly compressed. The Air Force is planning to  launch the first GPS IIIA satellite in 2014 to sustain the GPS constellation.  To launch in 2014, the Air Force has scheduled 72 months from contract  award to first satellite launch. This schedule is 3 years shorter than the  schedule the Air Force has so far achieved under its IIF program. In fact,  the time period between contract award and first launch for GPS IIIA is  shorter than most other major space programs we have reviewed (see fig.  3). Moreover, GPS IIIA is not simply a matter of replicating the IIF  program. Though the contractor has had previous experience with GPS, it  is likely that the knowledge base will need to be revitalized. The  contractor is also being asked to develop a larger satellite bus to  accommodate future GPS increments IIIB and IIIC. In addition, the  contractor is being asked to increase the power of a new military signal by  a factor of 10. In our opinion, there is little room in the schedule to  accommodate difficulties the contractor may have in meeting either  challenge. In addition, the GPS III program office still has not been able to  fill critical contracting and engineering positions needed to assist in  satellites design and contractor oversight\u2014both of which functions are to  receive more emphasis on this program than in the past. Consequently, the  concerns that GPS IIIA could experience a delay are not unreasonable.", "However, according to DOD officials, the incremental approach to GPS  acquisition should significantly lower the risk of schedule delays.  Nonetheless, no major satellite program undertaken in the past decade has  met its scheduled goals.", "Third, we compared the Air Force\u2019s GPS IIIA schedule to best practices  associated with effective schedule estimating. Past GAO work has  identified nine practices associated with effective schedule estimating. We  analyzed the Air Force\u2019s GPS IIIA schedule according to these practices  and found that one was met, one was not met, and the other seven  practices were only partially met. The practices deal with how well the  schedule identifies key development activities, the times to complete these  activities, as well as the amount of float time associated with each of these  activities\u2014float time is the amount of time a task can slip before affecting  the critical path. Further, the practices assess how well activities have  been integrated with other tasks and whether reserve times have been  allocated to high-risk activities. The primary purpose of all scheduling  activities is to establish a credible critical path. The best practices have  been designed to support that goal. Because the GPS IIIA schedule does  not follow all of the best practices, the reliability of the critical path  identified in the schedule is diminished."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "A Delay in GPS III Could Severely Impact GPS Users", "paragraphs": ["Delays in the launch of the GPS IIIA satellites will increase the risk that  the GPS constellation will decrease in size to a level where it will not meet  some users\u2019 needs.

Because there are currently 31 operational GPS  satellites of various blocks, the near-term probability of maintaining a  constellation of at least 24 operational satellites remains well above 95  percent. However, DOD predicts that over the next several years many of  the older satellites in the constellation will reach the end of their  operational life faster than they will be replenished, and that the  constellation will, in all likelihood, decrease in size. Based on the most  recent satellite reliability and launch schedule data approved in March  2009, the estimated long-term probability of maintaining a constellation of  at least 24 operational satellites falls below 95 percent during fiscal year  2010 and remains below 95 percent until the end of fiscal year 2014, at  times falling to about 80 percent. See figure 4 for details.", "The probability curve in figure 4 was generated using unique reliability  curves for each operational satellite in the current on-orbit GPS  constellation, and block-specific reliability curves for each production  (unlaunched) GPS satellite, including IIR-M, IIF, IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC  satellites. (See app. I for a more complete description of the approach  used to generate this probability curve.) Because the reliability curves  associated with new blocks of GPS satellites are based solely on  engineering and design analysis instead of actual on-orbit performance,  this estimated long-term probability of maintaining a 24-satellite  constellation could change once actual on-orbit performance data become  available. For example, while the block IIA satellites were designed to last  only 7.5 years on average, they have actually lasted about twice as long. If  GPS IIF satellites were to last twice as long as their currently estimated  mean life expectancy of 11.5 years, the probability of maintaining a larger  constellation would increase, but the long-term probability of maintaining  the 24-satellite constellation would not improve significantly. Moreover,  program officials provided no evidence to suggest that the current mean  life expectancy for IIF satellites is overly conservative.", "A delay in the production and launch of GPS III satellites could severely  impact the U.S. government\u2019s ability to meet its commitment to maintain a  24-satellite GPS constellation. The severity of the impact would depend  upon the length of the delay. For example, a 2-year delay in the production  and launch of the first and all subsequent GPS III satellites would reduce  the probability of maintaining a 24-satellite constellation to about 10  percent by around fiscal year 2018. This significant gap in service would  persist for about 2 years before the constellation began to recover.  Moreover, this recovery\u2014that is, the return to a high probability of  maintaining a 24-satellite constellation\u2014would take an additional 2 to 3  years. Consequently, a 2-year delay in the production and launch of GPS III  satellites would most likely result in a period of roughly 5 years when the  U.S. government would be operating a GPS constellation of fewer than 24  satellites, and a 12-year period during which the government would not  meet its commitment to maintaining a constellation of 24 operational GPS  satellites with a probability of 95 percent or better. For example, the delay  in GPS III would reduce the probability of maintaining a 21-satellite  constellation to between 50 and 80 percent for the period from fiscal year  2018 through fiscal year 2020. Moreover, while the probability of  maintaining an 18-satellite constellation would remain relatively high, it  would still fall below 95 percent for about a year over this period. See  figure 5 for details.", "The impacts to both military and civil users of a smaller constellation are  difficult to precisely predict. For example, a nominal 24-satellite  constellation with 21 of its satellites broadcasting a healthy standard  positioning service signal would continue to satisfy the availability  standard for good user-to-constellation geometry articulated in the  standard positioning service performance standard. However, because  the GPS constellation has been operating above the committed  performance standard for so long, military and civil users have come to  expect a higher level of service, even though this service is not committed  to them. Consequently, some users may sense an operational impact even  if the constellation were to perform at or near its committed standards. In  general, users with more demanding requirements for precise location  solutions will likely be more impacted than other users. During our  interviews with military, civil, and commercial representatives, several  examples of possible impacts of a smaller GPS constellation were  discussed.", "The accuracy of precision-guided munitions that rely upon GPS to strike  their targets could decrease. To accomplish their mission, military forces  would either need to use larger munitions or use more munitions on the  same target to achieve the same level of mission success. The risks of  collateral damage could also increase.  Intercontinental commercial flights use predicted satellite geometry over  their planned navigation route, and may have to delay, cancel or reroute  flights.", "Enhanced-911 services, which rely upon GPS to precisely locate callers,  could lose accuracy, particularly when operating in \u201curban canyons\u201d or  mountainous terrain.", "Another important consideration is that both the standard positioning  service and precise positioning service performance standards assume  that users have unobstructed visibility to nearly the entire sky, an  assumption that does not hold for the large number of users operating in  moderately mountainous terrain, in the \u201curban canyons\u201d of large cities, or  under forest foliage."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Different Approaches Are Being Evaluated that Could Potentially Mitigate the Gap", "paragraphs": ["The Air Force is aware that there is some risk that the number of satellites  in the GPS constellation could fall below its required 24 satellites, and that  this risk would grow significantly if the development and launch of GPS  IIIA satellites were delayed. Consequently, an Air Force Space Command  representative informed us that the command has established an  independent review team to examine the risks and consequences of a  smaller constellation on military and civil users. However, at this time, Air  Force representatives believe that the best approach to mitigating the risk  is to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the current schedule for GPS  IIF and III is maintained. Those steps include a commitment from the Air  Force to fully fund GPS IIIA in the fiscal year 2010 Program Objectives  Memorandum, and use of an incremental development approach toward  meeting needs. This incremental approach would place a premium on  controlling schedule risk by, among other things, deferring consideration  of civil requirements for subsystems like the Distress Alerting Satellite  System (DASS) and the Satellite Laser Ranging (SLR) payloads to GPS IIIB  or GPS IIIC satellite blocks.", "Options for developing lower-cost alternatives to current GPS satellites  appear to be very limited. For example, in 2007 the Air Force Scientific  Advisory Board examined whether small satellites\u2014which can be  developed more quickly and at relatively low cost\u2014might help meet some  PNT mission requirements. The board concluded that small satellites may  eventually have operational utility in augmenting GPS III capabilities, with  emphasis on enhancing the utility of the GPS M-code signal\u2019s capabilities  against jamming. However, the need for an extensive control segment  infrastructure to monitor and control these small satellite augmentations,  combined with the need to develop, produce, and install user equipment,  would make it very challenging to field a near-term small satellite  augmentation for PNT. With respect to providing basic PNT services, the  board noted that studies of PNT satellite constellations, performed at  different times and by different organizations in the United States and  elsewhere, demonstrate that a robust constellation of relatively powerful  satellites operating at medium earth orbit is the best way to provide  continuous worldwide PNT services; this is a performance set that small  satellites currently cannot provide.", "According to Air Force representatives, the procurement of additional IIF  satellites is not feasible, and initiating development of an alternative full- scale, satellite-based PNT system appears to be impractical. Such a system  would likely be very expensive and would compete with GPS III  development for funding, making it harder for the Air Force to meet its  commitment to fully fund GPS IIIA development. Moreover, the GPS III  system development contract was awarded in accordance with an  approved GPS III acquisition strategy, which selected one alternative from  two competing contractors\u2019 designs; an alternative system development  would be, in effect, a significant deviation from that approved strategy.  Finally, it seems unlikely that the award of a separate system development  contract with another contractor would have any real impact on reducing  the risk of delivering GPS IIIA requirements on the current schedule.", "In the event that this strategy proves unsuccessful and the schedule for  GPS III slips, additional measures could be considered. For example,  excluding random failures, the operational life of a GPS satellite tends to  be limited by the amount of power that its solar arrays can produce. This  power level declines over time as the solar arrays degrade in the space  environment until eventually they cannot produce enough power to  maintain all of the satellite\u2019s subsystems. However, according to Air Force  representatives, the effects of this power loss can be mitigated somewhat  by actively managing satellite subsystems\u2014shutting them down when not  needed\u2014 thereby reducing the satellite\u2019s overall consumption of power. It  would also be possible to significantly reduce the satellite\u2019s consumption  of power by shutting off a secondary GPS payload. This would buy  additional time for the navigation mission of the satellite at the expense of  the mission supported by the secondary payload. The 2004 U.S. Space- Based Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT) policy affirmed PNT as  the primary mission for the GPS constellation, and stated that no  secondary payload may adversely affect the performance, schedule, or  cost of GPS, its signals, or services. Nevertheless, at this time the Air  Force has no intention of shutting off the secondary GPS payload.  Moreover, until there is a more immediate risk that the constellation will  fall below its required size, there is no reason to take this step.", "Military and civil users might also take steps in response to a smaller GPS  constellation. While a smaller GPS constellation could result in a  significant reduction in positioning and navigation accuracy at certain  times and locations, these times and locations are usually predictable in  near-real time. Consequently for military users, who must rely upon GPS\u2019s  precise positioning service, a smaller constellation could require changes  in its approach to mission planning to ensure that operations are  conducted at times when GPS accuracy is relatively high, or changes in  tactics employed during a mission. For example, military users could  utilize a larger number of (or more powerful) munitions to achieve an  equivalent level of mission effectiveness.", "For civil and commercial users, one possible impact of a smaller GPS  constellation could be an increased use of other positioning, navigation,  and timing services, including those expected to be offered through  Europe\u2019s Galileo system by the middle of the next decade.

Without an approach that enables a single  individual to make resource decisions and maintain visibility over  progress, DOD is at risk of facing the same issues in synchronizing the  delivery of GPS assets and wasting capability that will be available in  space but not on the ground. In addition, DOD may still want to consider  establishing a means by which progress in developing the satellites and  ground equipment receives attention from the highest levels of leadership  that is the Secretary and perhaps the National Security Council, given the  criticality of GPS to the warfighter and the nation, and the risks associated  with not meeting schedule goals.", "DOD concurred with our second recommendation to address, if  weaknesses are found, civil agency concerns for developing requirements  and determine mechanisms for improving collaboration and decision  making, and strengthening civil agency participation. DOD acknowledged  that it employs a rigorous requirements process and is aware of the  frustration civil agencies face when using this process. DOD further  indicated that it worked to put in place an interagency requirements plan,  and is currently in the process of jointly coordinating the Charter for an  Interagency Forum for Operational Requirements to provide venues to  identify, discuss, and validate civil or dual-use GPS requirements. Finally,  DOD noted that it will continue to seek ways to improve civil agency  understanding of the DOD requirements process and work to strengthen  civil agency participation. We support DOD\u2019s efforts to inform and educate  other civil agencies on the requirements process. As it undertakes these  efforts, DOD should ensure that it is taking a more active role in directly  communicating with civil agencies to more precisely identify concerns or  weaknesses in the requirements process.", "The full text of DOD\u2019s comments may be found in appendix IV.

We also interviewed officials from  Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center GPS program office; Air Force  Space Command; Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Office of the  Undersecretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics;  Assistant Secretary of Defense Office of Networks and Information  Integration; United States Strategic Command; 2nd Space Operations  Squadron; and the services.", "To determine the extent to which the Air Force had effectively developed  and maintained the GPS IIIA integrated master schedule, we reviewed the  program\u2019s schedule estimates and compared them with relevant best  practices to determine the extent to which they reflects key estimating  practices that are fundamental to having a reliable schedule. In doing so,  we interviewed GPS program officials to discuss their use of best practices  in creating the program\u2019s current schedule.", "To assess the status of the GPS constellation, we interviewed officials  from the Air Force Space and Missile Systems Center GPS program office,  Air Force Space Command, and the 2nd Space Operations Squadron. To  assess the risks that a delay in the acquisition and fielding of GPS III  satellites could result in the GPS constellation falling below the 24  satellites required by the standard positioning service and precise  positioning service performance standards, we obtained information from  the Air Force predicting the reliability for 77 GPS satellites\u2014each of the 31  current (on-orbit) and 46 future GPS satellites\u2014as a function of time. Each  satellite\u2019s total reliability curve defines the probability that the satellite will  still be operational at a given time in the future. It is generated from the  product of two reliability curves\u2014a wear-out reliability curve defined by  the cumulative normal distribution, and a random reliability curve defined  by the cumulative Weibull distribution. For each of the 77 satellites, we  obtained the two parameters defining the cumulative normal distribution,  and the two parameters defining the cumulative Weibull distribution. For  each of the 46 unlaunched satellites, we also obtained a parameter  defining its probability of successful launch, and its current scheduled  launch date. The 46 unlaunched satellites include 2 IIR-M satellites, 12 IIF  satellites, 8 IIIA satellites, 8 IIIB satellites, and 16 IIIC satellites; launch of  the final IIIC satellite is scheduled for March 2023. Using this information,  we generated overall reliability curves for each of the 77 GPS satellites. We  discussed with Air Force and Aerospace Corporation representatives, in  general terms, how each satellite\u2019s normal and Weibull parameters were  calculated. However, we did not analyze any of the data used to calculate  these parameters.", "Using the reliability curves for each of the 77 GPS satellites, we developed  a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the probability that at least a given  number of satellites would be operational as a function of time, based on  the GPS launch schedule approved in March 2009. We conducted several  runs of our simulation\u2014each run consisting of 10,000 trials\u2014and  generated \u201csawtoothed\u201d curves depicting the probability that at least 21,  24, 27, and 30 satellites would still be operational as a function of time. We  compared the results for a 24-satellite constellation with a similar Monte  Carlo simulation that the Aerospace Corporation performed for the Air  Force. We confirmed that our simulation produces results that are within  about 2 percent of the Aerospace Corporation\u2019s results for all times  between October 2008 and April 2024. Using 10,000 trials per run, the  results of different runs of the same Monte Carlo simulation can vary by  about 1 to 2 percent; consequently we concluded that we had successfully  replicated the Aerospace Corporation\u2019s results. We then used our Monte  Carlo simulation model to examine the impact of a 2-year delay in the  launch of all GPS III satellites. We moved each GPS III launch date back by  2 years. We then reran the model and calculated new probabilities that at  least 18, 21, and 24 satellites would still be operational as a function of  time.", "To assess impacts of a potential GPS service disruption on particular types  of military and civil GPS users, we interviewed numerous military and civil  GPS representatives and reviewed studies provided by civil agencies.", "To assess the coordination and collaboration among federal agencies and  the broader GPS community, and to determine the organization of the PNT  community, we analyzed documents from and conducted interviews with  officials in Washington, D.C. at the Office of the Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Networks and Information Integration; SAF/USA (Air Force  Directorate of Space Acquisitions); National Aeronautics and Space  Administration; the Departments of Transportation, State, Commerce, and  Homeland Security; the Space-Based National PNT Coordination Office;  and the U.S. GPS Industry Council.
