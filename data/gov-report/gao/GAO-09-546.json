Concerned by reports of significant vulnerabilities in federal computer systems, Congress passed the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA), which authorized and strengthened information security program, evaluation, and reporting requirements for federal agencies. In accordance with the FISMA requirement that the Comptroller General report periodically to Congress, GAO's objectives were to evaluate (1) the adequacy and effectiveness of agencies' information security policies and practices and (2) federal agencies' implementation of FISMA requirements. To address these objectives, GAO analyzed agency, inspectors general, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and GAO reports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Persistent weaknesses in information security policies and practices continue to threaten the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of critical information and information systems used to support the operations, assets, and personnel of most federal agencies. Recently reported incidents at federal agencies have placed sensitive data at risk, including the theft, loss, or improper disclosure of personally identifiable information of Americans, thereby exposing them to loss of privacy and identity theft. For fiscal year 2008, almost all 24 major federal agencies had weaknesses in information security controls. An underlying reason for these weaknesses is that agencies have not fully implemented their information security programs. As a result, agencies have limited assurance that controls are in place and operating as intended to protect their information resources, thereby leaving them vulnerable to attack or compromise. In prior reports, GAO has made hundreds of recommendations to agencies for actions necessary to resolve prior significant control deficiencies and information security program shortfalls. Federal agencies reported increased compliance in implementing key information security control activities for fiscal year 2008; however, inspectors general at several agencies noted shortcomings with agencies' implementation of information security requirements. Agencies reported increased implementation of control activities, such as providing awareness training for employees and testing system contingency plans. However, agencies reported decreased levels of testing security controls and training for employees who have significant security responsibilities. In addition, inspectors general at several agencies disagreed with performance reported by their agencies and identified weaknesses in the processes used to implement these activities. Further, although OMB took steps to clarify its reporting instructions to agencies for preparing fiscal year 2008 reports, the instructions did not request inspectors general to report on agencies' effectiveness of key activities and did not always provide clear guidance to inspectors general. As a result, the reporting may not adequately reflect agencies' implementation of the required information security policies and procedures."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Information security is a critical consideration for any organization that  depends on information systems and computer networks to carry out its  mission or business.

The act sets forth a comprehensive  framework for ensuring the effectiveness of information security controls  over information resources that support federal operations and assets.  FISMA\u2019s framework creates a cycle of risk management activities  necessary for an effective security program; these activities are similar to  the principles noted in our study of the risk management activities of  leading private-sector organizations\u2014assessing risk, establishing a  central management focal point, implementing appropriate policies and  procedures, promoting awareness, and monitoring and evaluating policy  and control effectiveness. In order to ensure the implementation of this  framework, the act assigns specific responsibilities to agency heads, chief  information officers, inspectors general, and NIST.

The inspector general reported that Web applications used in supporting  air traffic control systems operations were not properly secured to prevent  attacks or unauthorized access. To illustrate, vulnerabilities found in Web  application computers associated with the Traffic Flow Management  Infrastructure System, Juneau Aviation Weather System, and the  Albuquerque Air Traffic Control Tower allowed audit staff to gain  unauthorized access to data stored on these computers, including program  source code and sensitive personally identifiable information. In addition,  the inspector general reported that it found a vulnerability on FAA Web  applications that could allow attackers to execute malicious codes on FAA  users\u2019 computers, which was similar to an actual incident that occurred in  August 2008. In February 2009, the FAA notified employees that an agency  computer had been illegally accessed and employee personal identity  information had been stolen electronically. Two of the 48 files on the  breached computer server contained personal information about more  than 45,000 FAA employees and retirees who were on the FAA payrolls as  of the first week of February 2006.

According to the announcement, in February 2009, a company  based in Cranberry, Pennsylvania, discovered that engineering and  communications documents containing key details about the Marine One  fleet had been downloaded to an Internet Protocol (IP) address in Iran.  The documents were traced back to a defense contractor in Maryland,  where an employee most likely downloaded a file-sharing program that  inadvertently allowed others to access this information.

For example:  In 2009, we reported that security weaknesses at the Securities and  Exchange Commission continued to jeopardize the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of the commission\u2019s financial and sensitive  information and information systems. Although the commission had made  progress in correcting previously reported information security control  weaknesses, it had not completed action to correct 16 weaknesses. In  addition, we identified 23 new weaknesses in controls intended to restrict  access to data and systems. Thus, the commission had not fully  implemented effective controls to prevent, limit, or detect unauthorized  access to computing resources. For example, it had not always (1)  consistently enforced strong controls for identifying and authenticating  users, (2) sufficiently restricted user access to systems, (3) encrypted  network services, (4) audited and monitored security-relevant events for  its databases, and (5) physically protected its computer resources. The  Securities and Exchange Commission also had not consistently ensured  appropriate segregation of incompatible duties or adequately managed the  configuration of its financial information systems. As a result, the  Securities and Exchange Commission was at increased risk of  unauthorized access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of its  financial information, as well as inadvertent or deliberate disruption of its  financial systems, operations, and services. The Securities and Exchange  Commission agreed with our recommendations and stated that it plans to  address the identified weaknesses.", "In 2009, we reported that the Internal Revenue Service had made progress  toward correcting prior information security weaknesses, but continued to  have weaknesses that could jeopardize the confidentiality, integrity, and  availability of financial and sensitive taxpayer information. These  deficiencies included some related to controls that are intended to  prevent, limit, and detect unauthorized access to computing resources,  programs, information, and facilities, as well as a control important in  mitigating software vulnerability risks. For example, the agency continued  to, among other things, allow sensitive information, including IDs and  passwords for mission-critical applications, to be readily available to any  user on its internal network and to grant excessive access to individuals  who do not need it. In addition, the Internal Revenue Service had systems  running unsupported software that could not be patched against known  vulnerabilities. Until those weaknesses are corrected, the Internal Revenue  Service remains vulnerable to insider threats and is at increased risk of  unauthorized access to and disclosure, modification, or destruction of  financial and taxpayer information, as well as inadvertent or deliberate  disruption of system operations and services. The IRS agreed to develop a  plan addressing each of our recommendations.", "In 2008, we reported that although the Los Alamos National Laboratory\u2014 one of the nation\u2019s weapons laboratories\u2014implemented measures to  enhance the information security of its unclassified network,  vulnerabilities continued to exist in several critical areas, including   (1) identifying and authenticating users of the network, (2) encrypting  sensitive information, (3) monitoring and auditing compliance with  security policies, (4) controlling and documenting changes to a computer  system\u2019s hardware and software, and (5) restricting physical access to  computing resources. As a result, sensitive information on the network\u2014 including unclassified controlled nuclear information, naval nuclear  propulsion information, export control information, and personally  identifiable information\u2014were exposed to an unnecessary risk of  compromise. Moreover, the risk was heightened because about 300 (or 44  percent) of 688 foreign nationals who had access to the unclassified  network as of May 2008 were from countries classified as sensitive by the  Department of Energy, such as China, India, and Russia. While the  organization did not specifically comment on our recommendations, it  agreed with the conclusions.", "In 2008, we reported that the Tennessee Valley Authority had not fully  implemented appropriate security practices to secure the control systems  used to operate its critical infrastructures at facilities we reviewed.  Multiple weaknesses within the Tennessee Valley Authority corporate  network left it vulnerable to potential compromise of the confidentiality,  integrity, and availability of network devices and the information  transmitted by the network. For example, almost all of the workstations  and servers that we examined on the corporate network lacked key  security patches or had inadequate security settings. Furthermore,  Tennessee Valley Authority had not adequately secured its control system  networks and devices on these networks, leaving the control systems  vulnerable to disruption by unauthorized individuals. In addition, we  reported that the network interconnections provided opportunities for  weaknesses on one network to potentially affect systems on other  networks. Specifically, weaknesses in the separation of network segments  could allow an individual who had gained access to a computing device  connected to a less secure portion of the network to be able to  compromise systems in a more secure portion of the network, such as the  control systems. As a result, Tennessee Valley Authority\u2019s control systems  were at increased risk of unauthorized modification or disruption by both  internal and external threats and could affect its ability to properly  generate and deliver electricity. The Tennessee Valley Authority agreed  with our recommendations and provided information on steps it was  taking to implement them.", "In 2007, we reported that the Department of Homeland Security had  significant weaknesses in computer security controls surrounding the  information systems used to support its U.S. Visitor and Immigrant Status  Technology (US-VISIT) program for border security. For example, it had  not implemented controls to effectively prevent, limit, and detect access to  computer networks, systems, and information. Specifically, it had not   (1) adequately identified and authenticated users in systems supporting  US-VISIT; (2) sufficiently limited access to US-VISIT information and  information systems; (3) ensured that controls adequately protected  external and internal network boundaries; (4) effectively implemented  physical security at several locations; (5) consistently encrypted sensitive  data traversing the communication network; and (6) provided adequate  logging or user accountability for the mainframe, workstations, or servers.  In addition, it had not always ensured that responsibilities for systems  development and system production had been sufficiently segregated and  had not consistently maintained secure configurations on the application  servers and workstations at a key data center and ports of entry. As a  result, increased risk existed that unauthorized individuals could read,  copy, delete, add, and modify sensitive information\u2014including personally  identifiable information\u2014and disrupt service on Customs and Border  Protection systems supporting the US-VISIT program.

Such controls include both electronic and physical controls. Electronic  access controls include those related to boundary protection, user  identification and authentication, authorization, cryptography, and  auditing and monitoring. Physical access controls are important for  protecting computer facilities and resources from espionage, sabotage,  damage, and theft. These controls involve restricting physical access to  computer resources, usually by limiting access to the buildings and rooms  in which they are housed and enforcing usage restrictions and  implementation guidance for portable and mobile devices.", "At least 23 major federal agencies had access control weaknesses during  fiscal year 2008. An analysis of our reports reveals that 48 percent of  information security control weaknesses pertained to access controls (see  fig. 5). For example, agencies did not consistently (1) establish sufficient  boundary protection mechanisms; (2) identify and authenticate users to  prevent unauthorized access; (3) enforce the principle of least privilege to  ensure that authorized access was necessary and appropriate; (4) apply  encryption to protect sensitive data on networks and portable devices;   (5) log, audit, and monitor security-relevant events; and (6) establish  effective controls to restrict physical access to information assets. Without  adequate access controls in place, agencies cannot ensure that their  information resources are protected from intentional or unintentional  harm.", "Boundary protection controls logical connectivity into and out of  networks and controls connectivity to and from network connected  devices. Agencies segregate the parts of their networks that are publicly  accessible by placing these components in subnetworks with separate  physical interfaces and preventing public access to their internal  networks. Unnecessary connectivity to an agency\u2019s network increases not  only the number of access paths that must be managed and the complexity  of the task, but the risk of unauthorized access in a shared environment. In  addition to deploying a series of security technologies at multiple layers,  deploying diverse technologies at different layers helps to mitigate the risk  of successful cyber attacks. For example, multiple firewalls can be  deployed to prevent both outsiders and trusted insiders from gaining  unauthorized access to systems, and intrusion detection technologies can  be deployed to defend against attacks from the Internet.", "Agencies continue to demonstrate vulnerabilities in establishing  appropriate boundary protections. For example, two agencies that we  assessed did not adequately secure channels to connect remote users,  increasing the risk that attackers will use these channels to gain access to  restricted network resources. One of these agencies also did not have  adequate intrusion detection capabilities, while the other allowed users of  one network to connect to another, higher-security network. Such  weaknesses in boundary protections impair an agency\u2019s ability to deflect  and detect attacks quickly and protect sensitive information and networks.", "A computer system must be able to identify and authenticate different  users so that activities on the system can be linked to specific individuals.  When an organization assigns unique user accounts to specific users, the  system is able to distinguish one user from another\u2014a process called  identification. The system also must establish the validity of a user\u2019s  claimed identity by requesting some kind of information, such as a  password, that is known only by the user\u2014a process known as  authentication.", "Agencies did not always adequately control user accounts and passwords  to ensure that only valid users could access systems and information. In  our 2007 FISMA report, we noted several weaknesses in agencies\u2019  identification and authentication procedures. Agencies continue to  experience similar weaknesses in fiscal years 2008 and 2009. For example,  certain agencies did not adequately enforce strong password settings,  increasing the likelihood that accounts could be compromised and used by  unauthorized individuals to gain access to sensitive information.

To restrict legitimate users\u2019 access to only  those programs and files that they need to do their work, agencies  establish access rights and permissions. \u201cUser rights\u201d are allowable  actions that can be assigned to users or to groups of users. File and  directory permissions are rules that regulate which users can access a  particular file or directory and the extent of that access. To avoid  unintentionally authorizing users access to sensitive files and directories,  an agency must give careful consideration to its assignment of rights and  permissions.", "Agencies continued to grant rights and permissions that allowed more  access than users needed to perform their jobs. Inspectors general at 12  agencies reported instances where users had been granted excessive  privileges. In our reviews, we also noted vulnerabilities in this area. For  example, at one agency, users could inappropriately escalate their access  privileges to run commands on a powerful system account, many had  unnecessary and inappropriate access to databases, and other accounts  allowed excessive privileges and permissions. Another agency allowed (on  financial applications) generic, shared accounts that included the ability to  create, delete, and modify users\u2019 accounts. Approximately 1,100 users at  yet another agency had access to mainframe system management utilities,  although such access was not necessarily required to perform their jobs.  These utilities provided access to all files stored on disk; all programs  running on the system, including the outputs; and the ability to alter  hardware configurations supporting the production environment. We  uncovered one agency that had provided a contractor with system access  that was beyond what was needed, making the agency vulnerable to  incidents on the contractor\u2019s network. Another agency gave all users of an  application full access to the application\u2019s source code although their  responsibilities did not require this level of privilege. Such weaknesses in  authorization place agencies at increased risk of inappropriate access to  data and sensitive system programs, as well as to the consequent  disruption of services.", "Cryptography underlies many of the mechanisms used to enforce the  confidentiality and integrity of critical and sensitive information.

Similarly, 14 agencies did not always have  adequate auditing and monitoring capabilities. For example, one agency  did not conduct a baseline assessment of an important network. This  baseline determines a typical state or pattern of network activity. Without  this information, the agency could have difficulty detecting and  investigating anomalous activity to ascertain whether or not an attack was  under way. Another agency did not perform source code scanning or have  a process for manual source code reviews, which increases the risk that  vulnerabilities would not be detected. As a result, unauthorized access  could go undetected, and if a system is modified or disrupted, the ability to  trace or recreate events could be impeded.", "Physical security controls help protect computer facilities and resources  from espionage, sabotage, damage, and theft.

In its reporting instructions, OMB  requests inspectors general to rate their agency\u2019s certification and  accreditation process using the terms \u201cexcellent,\u201d \u201cgood,\u201d \u201csatisfactory,\u201d  \u201cpoor,\u201d or \u201cfailing.\u201d However, the reporting instructions do not define or  identify criteria for determining the level of performance for each rating.  OMB also requests inspectors general to identify the aspect(s) of the  certification and accreditation process they included or considered in  rating the quality of their agency\u2019s process. Examples OMB included were  security plan, system impact level, system test and evaluation, security  control testing, incident handling, security awareness training, and  security configurations (including patch management). While this  information is helpful and provides insight on the scope of the rating,  inspectors general were not requested to comment on the quality or  effectiveness of these items. Additionally, not all inspectors general  considered the same aspects in reviewing the certification and  accreditation process, yet all were allowed to provide the same rating.  Without clear guidelines for rating these processes, OMB and Congress  may not have a consistent basis for comparing the progress of an agency  over time or against other agencies.", "In its report to Congress for fiscal year 2008, OMB did not fully summarize  the findings from the inspectors general independent evaluations or  identify significant deficiencies in agencies\u2019 information security practices.  FISMA requires OMB to provide a summary of the findings of agencies\u2019  independent evaluations and significant deficiencies in agencies\u2019  information security practices. Inspectors general often document their  findings and significant information security control deficiencies in  reports that support their evaluations. However, OMB did not summarize  and present this information in its annual report to Congress. Most of the  inspectors general information summarized in the annual report was taken  from the \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d responses or from questions having a  predetermined range of percentages as stipulated by OMB\u2019s reporting  template. Thus, important information about the implementation of agency  information security programs and the vulnerabilities and risks associated  with federal information systems was not provided to Congress in OMB\u2019s  annual report. This information could be useful in determining whether  agencies are effectively implementing information security policies,  procedures, and practices. As a result, Congress may not be fully informed  about the state of federal information security.", "OMB also did not approve or disapprove agencies\u2019 information security  programs. FISMA requires OMB to review agencies\u2019 information security  programs at least annually and approve or disapprove them. OMB  representatives informed us that they review agencies\u2019 FISMA reports and  interact with agencies whenever an issue arises that requires their  oversight. However, representatives stated that they do not explicitly or  publicly declare that an agency\u2019s information security program has been  approved or disapproved. As a result, a mechanism for establishing  accountability and holding agencies accountable for implementing  effective programs was not used."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["Weaknesses in information security controls continue to threaten the  confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the sensitive data maintained  by federal agencies. These weaknesses, including those for access  controls, configuration management, and segregation of duties, leave  federal agency systems and information vulnerable to external as well as  internal threats. The White House, OMB, and federal agencies have  initiated actions intended to enhance information security at federal  agencies. However, until agencies fully and effectively implement  information security programs and address the hundreds of  recommendations that we and agency inspectors general have made,  federal systems will remain at an increased and unnecessary risk of attack  or compromise.", "Despite these weaknesses, federal agencies have continued to report  progress in implementing key information security requirements. While  NIST, inspectors general, and OMB have all made progress toward  fulfilling their statutory requirements, the current reporting process does  not produce information to accurately gauge the effectiveness of federal  information security activities. OMB\u2019s annual reporting instructions did  not cover key security activities and were not always clear. Finally, OMB  did not include key information about findings and significant deficiencies  identified by inspectors general in its governmentwide report to Congress  and did not approve or disapprove agency information security programs.  Shortcomings in reporting and oversight can result in insufficient  information being provided to Congress and diminish its ability to monitor  and assist federal agencies in improving the state of federal information  security."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["We recommend that the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  take the following four actions:    Update annual reporting instructions to request inspectors general to  report on the effectiveness of agencies\u2019 processes for developing  inventories, monitoring contractor operations, and providing specialized  security training.", "Clarify and enhance reporting instructions to inspectors general for  certification and accreditation evaluations by providing them with  guidance on the requirements for each rating category.", "Include in OMB\u2019s report to Congress, a summary of the findings from the  annual independent evaluations and significant deficiencies in information  security practices.", "Approve or disapprove agency information security programs after review."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["In written comments on a draft of this report, the Federal Chief  Information Officer (CIO) generally agreed with our overall assessment  of information security at the agencies.

These actions are consistent with  the intent of two of our recommendations, that OMB clarify and enhance  reporting instructions and request inspectors general to report on  additional measures of effectiveness.", "The Federal CIO did not address our recommendation to include a  summary of the findings and significant security deficiencies in its report  to Congress and did not concur with GAO\u2019s conclusion that OMB does not  approve or disapprove agencies\u2019 information security management  programs on an annual basis. He indicated that OMB reviews all agency  and IG FISMA reports annually; reviews quarterly information on the  major agencies\u2019 security programs; and uses this information, and other  reporting, to evaluate agencies security programs. The Federal CIO  advised that concerns are communicated directly to the agencies. We  acknowledge that these are important oversight activities. However, as we  reported, OMB did not demonstrate that it approved or disapproved  agency information security programs, as required by FISMA.
