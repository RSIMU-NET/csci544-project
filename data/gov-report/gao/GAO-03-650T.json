GAO's long-term budget simulations show that, absent meaningful entitlement reforms, demographic trends and rising health care spending will drive escalating federal deficits and debt. Neither slowing the growth of discretionary spending nor allowing the 2001 tax reductions to sunset will eliminate the imbalance. While additional economic growth will help ease our burden, the potential fiscal gap is too great to grow our way out of the problem. The application of basic health insurance principles to any proposed benefit could help moderate the cost for both beneficiaries and taxpayers. These include beneficiary protections against the risk of catastrophic medical expenses and premium contributions and cost-sharing arrangements that encourage beneficiaries to be cost conscious.

Recent  estimates suggest that, at any point in time, about a third of Medicare  beneficiaries lack prescription drug coverage. The rest have at least some  drug coverage through various sources\u2014most commonly employer- sponsored health plans\u2014although recent evidence indicates that this  coverage is beginning to erode.", "At the same time, however, the recent publication of the 2003 Trustees\u2019  annual report reminds us that Medicare in its current condition\u2014with no  prescription drug benefit\u2014already faces a huge projected financial  imbalance that has worsened significantly in the past year. Furthermore,  as the Medicare Trustees made clear over 10 years ago, the current  Medicare program is not fiscally sustainable in its present form.", "In 10 years, Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund outlays will begin to  exceed tax receipts, and by 2026 the HI trust fund will be exhausted.  However, trust fund insolvency does not mean the program will cease to  exist; program tax revenues will continue to cover a portion of projected  annual expenditures.", "The huge fiscal pressures created by the retirement of the baby boom  generation and rising health care costs are on our 10-year budget horizon.  Between now and 2035, the number of people age 65 and older will double.  Federal health and retirement spending are expected to surge as people  live longer and spend more time in retirement. In addition, advances in  medical technology are likely to keep pushing up the cost of providing  health care. Moreover, the baby boomers will have fewer workers to  support them in retirement.", "We must also remember that Medicare has grown substantially as a  percent of the federal budget since its enactment in 1965. In addition, it is  expected to represent an increasing percentage of the federal budget in  the years ahead. After a brief slowdown in the late 1990s, Medicare  spending growth has recently accelerated. In fiscal year 2001, growth in  program spending reached nearly 9 percent, with spending on certain  services increasing much more rapidly. For example, spending for home  health services grew about 30 percent and spending for skilled nursing  facility care grew slightly over 20 percent. For the first 5 months of fiscal  year 2003, Medicare spending has been growing at 7.6 percent.", "A significant problem that hobbles Medicare\u2019s ability to achieve a  desirable degree of efficiency is that the program too often pays overly  generous rates for certain services and products. For example, for certain  services, our recent work has shown substantially higher Medicare  payments relative to providers\u2019 costs\u2014as much as 35 percent higher for  home health care and 19 percent higher for skilled nursing facility care.  Similarly, Medicare has overpaid for various medical products. In 2001, we  reported that Medicare paid over $1 billion more than other purchasers in  2000 for certain outpatient drugs that the program covers. Excessive  payments hurt not only the taxpayers but also the program\u2019s beneficiaries  or their supplemental insurers, as beneficiaries are generally liable for  copayments equal to 20 percent of Medicare\u2019s approved fee. For certain  outpatient drugs, Medicare\u2019s payments to providers were so high that the  beneficiaries\u2019 copayments exceeded the price at which providers could  buy the drugs. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has  not acted on our recommendation that Medicare establish payment levels  for drugs more closely related to actual market transaction costs, using  information available to other public programs that pay at lower rates.", "In the face of these short-term and long-term cost pressures, I continue to  maintain that substantive financing and programmatic reforms are  necessary to put Medicare on a sustainable footing for the future. These  fundamental reforms are vital to reducing the program\u2019s growth, which  threatens to absorb ever-increasing shares of the nation\u2019s budgetary and  economic resources. Thus, any proposals to help seniors with the costs of  prescription drugs would need to be carefully crafted to avoid further  erosion of the projected financial condition of the Medicare program.

Long before the HI Trust Fund is projected to  be insolvent, pressures on the rest of the federal budget will grow as HI\u2019s  projected cash flow turns negative and the gap between program tax  revenues and expenditures escalates.

Like Social Security, HI has  always been largely a pay-as-you-go system. SMI, which pays for physician  and outpatient hospital services, diagnostic tests, and certain other  medical services, is financed by a combination of general revenues and  beneficiary premiums. Beneficiary premiums pay for about one-fourth of  SMI benefits, with the remainder financed by general revenues. These  complex financing arrangements mean that current workers\u2019 taxes  primarily pay for current retirees\u2019 benefits except for those financed by  SMI premiums.", "As a result, the relative numbers of workers and beneficiaries have a major  impact on Medicare\u2019s financing. The ratio, however, is changing. In the  future, relatively fewer workers will be available to shoulder Medicare\u2019s  financial burden. In 2002 there were 4.9 working-age persons (18 to 64  years) per elderly person, but by 2030, this ratio is projected to decline to  2.8.

As the baby boom generation ages, the  share of the population age 65 and over will escalate rapidly. A falling  fertility rate is the other principal factor underlying the growth in the  elderly\u2019s share of the population. In the 1960s, the fertility rate was an  average of 3 children per woman. Today it is a little over 2, and by 2030 it  is expected to fall to 1.95\u2014a rate that is below replacement. The  combination of the aging of the baby boom generation, increased  longevity, and a lower fertility rate will drive the elderly as a share of total  population from today\u2019s 12 percent to almost 20 percent in 2030.", "Taken together, these trends threaten both the financial solvency and  fiscal sustainability of this important program. Labor force growth will  continue to decline and by 2025 is expected to be less than a third of what  it is today. (See fig. 2.)

Without a major  increase in productivity, low labor force growth will lead to slower growth  in the economy and slower growth of federal revenues. This in turn will  only accentuate the overall pressure on the federal budget. This slowing  labor force growth is not always recognized as part of the Medicare  debate, but it is expected to affect the ability of the federal budget and the  economy to sustain Medicare\u2019s projected spending in the coming years.", "The demographic trends I have described will affect both Medicare and  Social Security, but Medicare presents a much greater, more complex, and  more urgent challenge. Unlike Social Security, Medicare spending growth  rates reflect not only a burgeoning beneficiary population, but also the  escalation of health care costs at rates well exceeding general rates of  inflation. The growth of medical technology has contributed to increases  in the number and quality of health care services. Moreover, the actual  costs of health care consumption are not transparent. Third-party payers  largely insulate covered consumers from the cost of health care decisions.

Today, the HI Trust Fund takes  in more in taxes than it spends. Largely because of the known  demographic trends I have described, this situation will change. Under the  Trustees\u2019 2003 intermediate assumptions, program outlays are expected to  begin to exceed program tax revenues in 2013. (See fig. 3.) To finance  these cash deficits, HI will need to draw on the special-issue Treasury  securities acquired during the years of cash surpluses. For HI to \u201credeem\u201d  its securities, the government will need to obtain cash through some  combination of increased taxes, spending cuts, and/or increased  borrowing from the public (or, if the unified budget is in surplus, less debt  reduction than would otherwise have been the case). Neither the decline  in the cash surpluses nor the cash deficits will affect the payment of  benefits, but the negative cash flow will place increased pressure on the  federal budget to raise the resources necessary to meet the program\u2019s  ongoing costs. This pressure will only increase when Social Security also  experiences negative cash flow and joins HI as a net claimant on the rest  of the budget.", "The gap between HI income and costs shows the severity of HI\u2019s financing  problem over the longer term.

This  means that to bring the HI Trust Fund into balance over the 75-year  period, either program outlays would have to be immediately reduced by  42 percent or program income immediately increased by 71 percent, or  some combination of the two. These estimates of what it would take to  achieve 75-year trust fund solvency understate the extent of the problem  because the program\u2019s financial imbalance gets worse in the 76th and  subsequent years.

Under the Trustees\u2019 2003 intermediate  estimates, the HI Trust Fund is projected to exhaust its assets in 2026. This  solvency indicator provides information about HI\u2019s financial condition, but  it is not an adequate measure of Medicare\u2019s sustainability for several  reasons. In fact, the solvency measure can be misleading and can serve to  give a false sense of security as to Medicare\u2019s true financial condition.  Specifically, HI Trust Fund balances do not provide meaningful  information on the government\u2019s fiscal capacity to pay benefits when  program cash inflows fall below program outlays. As I have described, the  government would need to come up with cash from other sources to pay  for benefits once outlays exceeded program tax income.", "In addition, the HI Trust Fund measure provides no information on SMI.  SMI\u2019s expenditures, which currently account for about 43 percent of total  Medicare spending, are projected to grow even faster than those of HI in  the near future. Moreover, Medicare\u2019s complex structure and financing  arrangements mean that a shift of expenditures from HI to SMI can extend  the solvency of the HI Trust Fund, creating the appearance of an  improvement in the program\u2019s financial condition. For example, the  Balanced Budget Act of 1997 modified the home health benefit, which  resulted in shifting a portion of home health spending from the HI Trust  Fund to SMI. Although this shift extended HI Trust Fund solvency, it  increased the draw on general revenues and beneficiary SMI premiums  while generating little net savings.", "Ultimately, the critical question is not how much a trust fund has in assets,  but whether the government as a whole and the economy can afford the  promised benefits now and in the future and at what cost to other claims  on available resources. To better monitor and communicate changes in  future total program spending, new measures of Medicare\u2019s sustainability  are needed. As program changes are made, a continued need will exist for  measures of program sustainability that can signal potential future fiscal  imbalance. Such measures might include the percentage of program  funding provided by general revenues, the percentage of total federal  revenues or gross domestic product (GDP) devoted to Medicare, or  program spending per enrollee. As such measures are developed,  questions would need to be asked about actions to be taken if projections  showed that program expenditures would exceed the chosen level."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Absent Reform of Medicare and Other Entitlements for the Elderly, Budgetary Flexibility Will Disappear", "paragraphs": ["Taken together, Medicare\u2019s HI and SMI expenditures are expected to  increase dramatically, rising from about 12 percent of federal revenues in  2002 to more than one-quarter by midcentury.

Assuming,  for example, that the tax reductions enacted in 2001 do not sunset and  discretionary spending keeps pace with the economy, by midcentury  federal revenues may not even be adequate to pay Social Security and  interest on the federal debt. Spending for the current Medicare program\u2014 without any additional new benefits\u2014is projected to account for more  than one-quarter of all federal revenues.

While these programs dominate the long-term outlook, they  are not the only federal programs or activities that bind the future. The  federal government undertakes a wide range of programs, responsibilities,  and activities that obligate it to future spending or create an expectation  for spending. A recent GAO report describes the range and measurement  of such fiscal exposures\u2014from explicit liabilities such as environmental  cleanup requirements to the more implicit obligations presented by life- cycle costs of capital acquisition or disaster assistance. Making  government fit the challenges of the future will require not only dealing  with the drivers\u2014such as entitlements for the elderly\u2014but also looking at  the range of other federal activities.

Health plans can steer their beneficiaries\u2019  purchases to specific drugs through the use of a formulary\u2014that is, a list  of prescription drugs that health plans encourage physicians to prescribe  and beneficiaries to use. Determining whether a drug should be on the  formulary involves clinical evaluations based on a drug\u2019s safety and  effectiveness, and decisions on whether several drugs are therapeutically  equivalent. Restricting the formulary to fewer drugs within a therapeutic  class can provide the PBMs with greater leverage in negotiating higher  rebates because they can help increase the manufacturer\u2019s market share  for certain drugs. However, a restricted formulary provides beneficiaries  with fewer preferred drug alternatives and makes the policies governing  coverage of nonformulary drugs or the cost sharing for them critical to  beneficiaries.", "The FEHBP plans and PBMs we reviewed provided enrollees with  generally nonrestrictive drug formularies across a broad range of drugs  and therapeutic categories. The manufacturer rebates that the PBMs  passed through to the FEHBP plans effectively reduced plans\u2019 annual  spending on prescription drugs by a range of 3 percent to 9 percent. The  share of rebates PBMs passed through to the FEHBP plans varied subject  to contractual agreements negotiated between the plans and the PBMs.", "PBMs also assisted the FEHBP plans by providing a less expensive mail- order drug option. Mail-order prices for the FEHBP plans we reviewed  averaged about 27 percent lower than cash-paying customers would pay  for the same quantity at retail pharmacies for 14 brand-name drugs and 53  percent lower for 4 generic drugs. The FEHBP plans generally had lower  cost-sharing requirements for drugs purchased through mail order,  particularly for more expensive brand-name drugs or maintenance  medications for chronic conditions.", "The claims and information processing capabilities PBMs offered also  helped the FEHBP plans to manage drug costs and monitor quality of care.  PBMs maintain a centralized database on each enrollee\u2019s drug history that  can be used to review for potential adverse drug interactions or potentially  less expensive alternative medications. They also use claims data to  monitor patterns of patient use, physician prescribing practices, and  pharmacy dispensing practices. Their systems provide \u201creal-time\u201d claims  adjudication capabilities that allow a customer\u2019s claim for a drug purchase  to be approved or denied at the time the pharmacist begins the process of  filling a prescription. Two plans in our FEHBP study reported savings  ranging from 6 to 9 percent of the plan\u2019s annual drug spending; the savings  were associated primarily with real-time claims denials preventing early  drug refills and safety advisories cautioning pharmacists about potential  adverse interactions or therapy duplications."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Use of Private-Sector Strategies in Medicare Would Represent Departure from Traditional Policies and Practices", "paragraphs": ["While Medicare\u2019s sheer size would provide it with significant leverage in  negotiating with pharmacies and drug manufacturers, doing so would  represent a departure from traditional Medicare. Medicare beneficiaries  represent less than 15 percent of the population but a disproportionately  higher share\u2014about 40 percent\u2014of prescription drug spending. However,  because of Medicare\u2019s design and obligations as a public program, its  current purchasing strategies vary considerably from those of the private  sector.", "Any willing provider. In contrast with private payers\u2019 reliance on  selective contracting with providers and suppliers, the traditional  Medicare program has generally allowed any hospital, physician, or other  provider willing to accept Medicare\u2019s reimbursements and requirements to  participate in the program. With respect to drug purchasing in particular,  private plans determine the extent of their enrollees\u2019 access by the choices  they make about the size of their participating pharmacy network and  breadth of their drug formulary. Allowing any pharmacy willing to meet  Medicare\u2019s terms to participate or allowing all therapeutically equivalent  drugs equal coverage on a formulary would restrict the program\u2019s ability to  secure advantageous prices. Moreover, health plans and PBMs currently  make formulary determinations privately. In contrast, Medicare\u2019s policies  have historically been open to public comment.", "Administrative rate-setting. Whereas private health plans typically rely  on price negotiations to establish payment rates, Medicare generally  establishes payment rates administratively. As discussed earlier,  Medicare\u2019s rates often exceed market prices and this is the case for some  of the few outpatient prescription drugs covered by Medicare. The  program\u2019s method of paying for these drugs is prescribed in statute: In  essence, Medicare pays 95 percent of a drug\u2019s \u201caverage wholesale price\u201d  (AWP). Despite its name, however, AWP is not necessarily a price that  wholesalers charge and is not based on the price of any actual sale of  drugs by a manufacturer. AWPs are published by manufacturers in drug  price compendia, and Medicare bases providers\u2019 payments on these  published AWPs. Other public and private purchasers typically use the  leverage of volume and competition to secure better prices. By statute,  Medicaid, the nation\u2019s health insurance program for certain low-income  Americans, is guaranteed manufacturers\u2019 rebates based on prices charged  other purchasers. Certain other public payers can pay at rates set in the  federal supply schedule, which uses verifiable confidential information on  the prices drug manufacturers charge their \u201cmost favored\u201d private  customers. Manufacturers agree to these prices, in part, in exchange for  the right to sell drugs to the more than 40 million Medicaid beneficiaries.", "Low-budget program administration. Duplicating the type of controls  PBMs have exercised over private-sector drug benefits would likely  involve devoting a larger share of total expenditures to administration  than is spent by Medicare currently. Medicare\u2019s administrative costs  historically have been extremely low, averaging about 2 percent of the  cost of the services themselves. This level of expenditure may not be  consistent with the level needed to review the volumes of claims data  associated with prescription drugs for the elderly or acquire and maintain  the on-line systems and databases PBMs use to employ such utilization  controls as real-time claims adjudication. The number of prescriptions for  Medicare beneficiaries could easily exceed the current number of claims  for all other services combined, or over 1 billion annually."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Decisions about the Extent of Latitude and Competition Allowed Are Critical to Administering a Medicare Drug Benefit", "paragraphs": ["Medicare would undoubtedly need assistance from external entities to  administer a drug benefit, just as it has used insurers to process claims in  the traditional program and Medicare+Choice plans to go further by also  managing services and assuming risk. Decisions about the roles assigned  an entity or entities and the latitude allowed them in carrying out those  roles would be critical. These decisions would undoubtedly affect the  benefit\u2019s value to beneficiaries and the efficiencies and savings secured for  both beneficiaries and taxpayers. Some of these decisions parallel those  made by FEHBP plans that I discussed\u2014trade-offs about beneficiaries\u2019  interests in broad pharmacy networks and formularies versus potential  savings. Others stem from the uniqueness of Medicare, its likely  disproportionate share of the drug market, and its position as a public  program requiring transparency and fairness.", "Insurers and PBMs have been successful in securing some savings on drug  purchases by leveraging their volume to move market share from one  product to another. Medicare\u2019s leverage, given that purchases by the  elderly constitute about 40 percent of the drug market, could be  considerable. Yet the large market share may also be likely to attract  considerable attention. The administration of a Medicare drug benefit  could then be subject to the same intensity of external pressures from  interested parties regarding program prices and rules that can often inhibit  the program from operating efficiently today. The potential for  micromanagement could compromise trying to use the very flexibility  PBMs have employed in negotiating prices and selecting preferred  providers in order to generate savings. An alternative would be to sacrifice  some of the program\u2019s leverage and grant flexibility to multiple PBMs or  similar entities so that any one entity would be responsible for  administering only a share of the market.", "Contracting with multiple PBMs or similar entities, however, would pose  other challenges. If each had exclusive responsibility for a geographic  area, beneficiaries who wanted certain drugs could be advantaged or  disadvantaged merely because they lived in a particular area. To minimize  inequities, Medicare could, like some private sector purchasers, specify  core benefit characteristics or maintain clinical control over formulary  decisions instead of delegating those decisions to its contractors.", "If multiple PBMs or similar entities operated in a designated area,  beneficiaries could choose among them to administer their drug benefits.  These organizations would compete for consumers directly on the basis of  differences in their drug benefit offerings and administration. This  contrasts with the private sector where drug benefits are typically part of  an overall insurance plan, and PBMs typically compete for contracts with  insurers or other purchasers. Competition could be favorable to  beneficiaries if they were adequately informed about differences among  competing entities offering drug benefits and shared in the savings.  However, adequate oversight would need to be in place to ensure that fair  and effective competition was maintained. For example, a means to ensure  that beneficiaries received comprehensive user-friendly information about  policy and benefit differences among competing entities would be  necessary. Monitoring marketing and customer recruitment strategies and  holding entities accountable for complying with federal requirements  would require adequate investment. The contracting entities could need  protections as well. Some mechanism would be needed to risk adjust  payments for differences in beneficiaries\u2019 health status so that those  entities enrolling a disproportionate share of high-use beneficiaries would  not be disadvantaged."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Concluding Observations", "paragraphs": ["Medicare\u2019s financial challenge is very real and growing.

The future costs of serving the baby boomers are already  becoming a factor in CBO\u2019s short-term cost projections.", "Frankly, we know that incorporating a prescription drug benefit into the  existing Medicare program will add hundreds of billions of dollars to  program spending over just the next 10 years. For this reason, I cannot  overstate the importance of adopting meaningful reforms to ensure that  Medicare remains viable for future generations. Adding a drug benefit to  Medicare requires serious consideration of how that benefit will affect  overall program spending. If competing private entities are to be used to  administer a drug benefit, it is important to understand how these entities  can be used in the Medicare context to provide a benefit that balances  beneficiary needs and cost containment.", "Medicare reform would be done best with considerable lead time to phase  in changes and before the changes that are needed become dramatic and  disruptive. Given the size of Medicare\u2019s financial challenge, it is only  realistic to expect that reforms intended to bring down future costs will  have to proceed incrementally. We should begin this now, when retirees  are still a far smaller proportion of the population than they will be in the  future.
