Interviews with industry representatives highlighted a variety of general challenges related to operating in the Arctic, such as geography, extreme weather, and hard-to-predict ice floes. Industry-specific factors were also cited as contributing to limited commercial activity. For example, shipping companies noted higher costs with Arctic transit; cruise industry groups noted a lack of demand for Arctic cruises from the mainstream cruise-consumer base, and oil companies last drilled offshore exploratory wells in the U.S. Arctic in 2012.", "Although the activity will likely be limited, federal, state, and local stakeholders have taken some actions to plan for future maritime-infrastructure investments. Some of these actions address factors that, as identified by industry representatives, contribute to the current and expected limited maritime activity in the U.S. Arctic. For example, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE), in collaboration with the State of Alaska, has taken steps to study the development of an Arctic deepwater port; the lack of which is a factor identified by mining representatives as contributing to the expected limited mining activity in the U.S. Arctic. The U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) is in the preliminary phase of seeking to acquire a new polar icebreaker, which could be used for emergency response, research assistance, or patrols. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the Alaska government are working to improve mapping, charting, and weather information for the U.S. Arctic.", "The Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) published the U.S. Arctic Marine Transportation System: Overview and Priorities for Action in July 2013, which prioritized actions for developing Arctic maritime infrastructure and identified the lead agency for each action.

Record low levels of sea ice over the past decade could have potential  impacts on access to natural resources, the people who inhabit the  region, and the U.S. economy. For example, diminishing sea ice has  made some Arctic waters navigable for longer periods of time and, as a  result, may contribute to new economic opportunities in commercial  shipping, cruises, commercial fishing, oil, and mining.

See figure 1. The Bering Strait provides the  only access to the Arctic Ocean from the Pacific Ocean, which lies south  of the Aleutian Islands. Federal waters typically extend from 3 to 200  nautical miles offshore, and state waters for coastal states such as Alaska  generally extend from the state coastline up to 3 nautical miles offshore.  Within the complex array of federal and state maritime boundaries, all  navigable waters of the United States are subject to some type of federal  jurisdiction.", "There is evidence that the Arctic sea ice cover has diminished, which has  increased interest in shipping into and through the U.S. Arctic during the  summer months. As seasonal sea ice diminishes, the time and extent to  which vessel traffic can use Arctic waters increases. There are two types  of shipping that occur in the U.S. Arctic: \u201cdestinational\u201d and \u201ctrans-Arctic.\u201d  Currently, most shipping in the U.S. Arctic is destinational. Destinational  shipping refers to shipping into or out of the Arctic, mainly in support of  commercial activity. It includes, for example, shipping that supports  seasonal oil-drilling operations in U.S. Arctic waters and tugs and barges  that provide diesel oil and other commodities to remote Alaskan villages.  Destinational shipping to the U.S. Arctic coast through the Bering Strait  usually begins in July and ends by mid-October.", "Trans-Arctic shipping refers to use of the Arctic as a route between two  destinations outside of the Arctic. There are two primary trans-Arctic sea  routes. The Northwest Passage follows the northern coasts of Alaska and  Canada, connecting the east coasts of Canada and Asia. The Northern  Sea Route follows the northern border of Russia, connecting Asia and  Europe. Increased trans-Arctic use of the Northern Sea Route could  affect the U.S. Arctic because the eastern entry/exit point passes through  the Bering Strait. According to USCG data, vessel transits through the  Bering Strait, for both northbound and southbound destinational and  trans-Arctic traffic, ranged from 217 to 484 transits annually from 2008 to  2013.

There is one rail line  running 500 miles from the south central region of the state to the interior  (from Seward and Whittier to Fairbanks, Alaska). Many Alaskan cities  and villages are accessible only by air or water.

The Administration  issued the Arctic Region Policy in 2009, which addresses issues related  to national security, international governance, international scientific  cooperation, economic issues, environmental protection, and maritime  transportation in the Arctic region. It specified that priorities for maritime  transportation include safe navigation, protection of maritime commerce,  and protection of the environment. It recognized the need for  infrastructure to support shipping activity, and search and rescue  capabilities, among others. The White House National Ocean Council  issued the National Ocean Policy Implementation Plan in April 2013.  While this plan is broader than the Arctic region, it specifically identifies  the need for improvements to communications, environmental response  to marine pollution and oil spills, the ability to observe and forecast sea- ice, and the accuracy of charts and maps of the region. In May 2013, the  White House issued a National Strategy for the Arctic Region.

Tanker companies have not used the Northwest Passage for trans- Arctic shipping.", "Shipping industry representatives we spoke with highlighted a number of  contributing factors that can affect plans for trans-Arctic shipping,  including higher costs, specialized vessel requirements, and the lack of  reliability in terms of weather and ice\u2014particularly the sea ice presence in  the Northwest Passage. First, using Arctic routes would incur additional  costs that may not outweigh the benefits. For example, the shipping  industry uses a network of ports, but there is not a U.S. port in the  network north of the Bering Strait. A representative from a major  container shipping company stated that even if a port were built, since the  passages are not open year-round, it would require companies to modify  their schedules for those months the Arctic is open, which could be  expensive and disruptive. Second, transiting Arctic routes would require  ice-strengthened vessels, which have less shipping capacity due to  increased weight. In particular, the shallower waters along the  Northwest Passage can only accommodate a smaller vessel, which may  not present the necessary economies of scale to warrant shipping  companies modifying their schedules to use an Arctic route. Finally,  shipping representatives told us that the consistent presence of sea ice,  bad visibility, high winds, and uncharted waters all raise the risk of  transiting the Arctic. A container ship company representative stated that  the container-shipping industry is reliant on strict schedules, and the  unpredictability of sea ice and weather makes the trans-Arctic passages  less reliable. A tanker-shipping industry representative added that ship  captains are not willing to take vessels loaded with oil through uncharted  waters, such as those in much of the Arctic. Similarly, a recent study  published by MARAD stated that the availability of an Arctic route seems  unlikely over the next 10 to 20 years due to uncertainties surrounding the  rate at which sea ice will diminish; the lack of U.S. trade lanes that would  provide sufficiently shorter sailing distances to make an Arctic route  relevant; and the investments needed for escort vessels, staging ports,  and channel preparations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Cruises", "paragraphs": ["A handful of cruises each year sail in the U.S. Arctic, and the number is  expected to remain relatively stable through the next 10 years.

By comparison, mainstream cruise  vessels, which operate in southeast Alaska, can carry more than 1,000  passengers each.", "Cruise industry representatives we spoke with expect cruise tourism in  the Northwest Passage to remain limited to adventure cruises for the next  10 to 15 years. The representatives did not believe that mainstream  cruise companies would offer U.S. Arctic tours in the foreseeable future or  that additional charting or mapping, icebreakers, or search and rescue  capabilities in the Arctic would increase cruise traffic in the Northwest  Passage. According to representatives from a cruise association, the  primary reason for the limited number of Arctic cruises is a lack of  demand from the mainstream cruise consumer base.

None of the three companies chose to conduct exploratory offshore  drilling for the 2013 drilling season, but instead conducted site-surveying  activities such as \u201cbathymetric\u201d mapping.", "In the next 10 years, oil exploration activity is expected to be limited and  the impact on the levels of maritime traffic appears uncertain.  Representatives from two companies said that they had not decided  when they will resume exploration and that they are awaiting DOI\u2019s  proposed rule for Alaska Outer Continental Shelf drilling before  determining their plans for the 2014 drilling season. A third company  recently decided to stop its exploration program for Alaska in 2014 citing  unresolved legal issues stemming from a January 2014 decision of the  U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, affecting proposed DOI oil and  gas leases in the Chukchi Sea off the northwest coast of Alaska, that,  among other things, remanded the case to the U.S. District Court for the  District of Alaska for further proceedings. Several factors create  uncertainty about how future oil exploration activities may affect maritime  traffic. First, it is unknown when and whether U.S. Arctic offshore oil  production will begin. One industry representative we spoke with  estimated 10 years or more until oil production can begin. The  production stage could increase seasonal, destinational traffic due to the  increase in support vessels. Second, even if companies eventually begin  producing oil in the U.S. Arctic, an industry association and company  representatives stated that the oil would likely be transported through a  sub-sea pipeline to land where it would then connect to the Trans-Alaska  Pipeline System, rather than being transported by tanker. According to  an oil-industry association representative, transporting the oil by tanker is  not the preferred option because it presents a greater risk for spills  because of floating ice, shallow waters, and potential collisions with other  vessels. Finally, uncertainty regarding oil prices and variable industry  trends also can affect the oil industry activity in the U.S. Arctic. For oil  companies, the U.S. Arctic presents one potential oil production  opportunity that must be weighed against other potential sites. According  to an oil industry association representative, oil companies focus on those  areas and production sites that provide the best business opportunities.

Bringing in outside workers drives up the cost of a project  because, in the absence of existing housing facilities, temporary  camps are needed.", "Short construction season: Alaska has an approximately 4-month  construction season, along with extreme temperature ranges. While  some types of construction can be done in the winter, such as  excavating in permafrost and bogs, other types of construction  cannot, such as erecting steel structures.", "Largely due to the above factors, maritime infrastructure development in  the Arctic is generally considered to be more expensive than similar  construction in the continental United States. During our interviews with  Arctic stakeholders with expertise in engineering and construction, we  heard estimates of higher costs for Arctic maritime infrastructure  components that ranged from 15 percent to 500 percent higher than for  infrastructure constructed in the contiguous states. However, according to  USACE officials, data do not exist to show specifically how much more  expensive Arctic construction would be for different types of infrastructure  projects.

The identification,  prioritization and vetting of Arctic maritime infrastructure plans and near  term actions for federal agencies were important steps to addressing  Arctic maritime infrastructure needs. Given the level of uncertainty around  the development of the Arctic and the challenges and high costs to  developing Arctic maritime infrastructure, it is important that federal  agencies with responsibility for infrastructure components incorporate  Arctic maritime infrastructure priorities and identified actions into their  agency\u2019s overall planning and investment decisions. Furthermore, since  implementing recommended actions is at the discretion of the agencies  and the Arctic Report is considered a \u201cliving document\u201d with potentially  changing priorities and actions, monitoring agencies\u2019 progress in  addressing recommended actions is an important step in planning,  developing, and investing in Arctic maritime infrastructure.
