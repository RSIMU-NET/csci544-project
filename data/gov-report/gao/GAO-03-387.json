Lifetime earnings factor directly into the Social Security benefit formula, which is designed to replace a larger proportion of pre-retirement-covered earnings for low-income earners than for higher-income earners. Additionally, the probability of being on the Disability Insurance rolls affects the expected value of benefits. People who are disabled start receiving benefits earlier. The third factor, mortality, affects the benefits received relative to taxes paid because it determines the number of years a person will pay taxes and receive benefits. Differences by race in the relationship between taxes paid and benefits received under Social Security are due mainly to differences in lifetime earnings, the incidence of disability, and mortality among the groups. In the aggregate, blacks and Hispanics have higher disability rates and lower lifetime earnings, and thus as a group tend to receive greater benefits relative to taxes than whites. However, whites with low lifetime earnings or high disability rates also receive greater benefits relative to taxes than their higher-income or nondisabled counterparts.

The benefit-reduction-only benchmarks gradually phase in  reductions from 2005 to 2035; the reductions are accomplished by  changing the parameters of the benefit formula in various ways to achieve  either progressive or proportional reductions. The proportional benefit cut  reduces the benefit formula factors proportionally across all earnings  levels, while the progressive benefit cut reduces the benefit formula  factors by smaller scales for lower earners. To conduct our analyses, we  asked SSA\u2019s Office of Policy to apply the three scenarios to the latest  version of its microsimulation model, Modeling Income in the Near Term  (MINT3). The MINT3 model includes some dependent and survivor  beneficiaries, such as current and divorced spouses, as well as widows,  but does not include child beneficiaries. The model does, however, control  for the exclusion of children. The MINT3 examines four birth cohorts:  1931-40, 1941-45, 1946-55, and 1956-64. In our analysis, we used three  measures of equity\u2014the extent to which returns are commensurate with  contributions: lifetime benefit-to-tax ratios, net lifetime benefits (benefits  minus taxes), and real internal rates of return.

The program provides cash benefits to retired and  disabled workers and their dependents and survivors. The Congress  designed Social Security benefits, at least implicitly, with a focus on  replacing lost wages. Because the program is financed on a modified pay- as-you-go basis, payroll tax contributions of those currently working are  transferred to current beneficiaries. Current beneficiaries include insured  workers who are entitled to retirement or disability benefits, and their  dependents, as well as survivors of deceased insured workers. The  progressive benefit structure effectively provides greater insurance  protection relative to contributions to earners with lower wages than to  high-wage earners. Workers become eligible when they have enough  quarters of coverage under Social Security, (i.e., quarters of the year with  earnings from which Social Security taxes are deducted); they and their  employers pay payroll taxes on those covered earnings to finance  benefits. In 2002, 153 million people had earnings covered by Social  Security, and 46.4 million people received approximately $454 billion in  OASDI benefits.", "Social Security was originally an old-age retirement program. However,  the Social Security Amendments of 1939 added two new categories of  benefits: dependent benefits paid to the spouse and minor children of a  retired worker, and survivor benefits paid to the family after the death of a  covered worker. In calendar year 2002, about 10 million people received  approximately $106 billion in survivor and dependent benefits. Further,  the amount of Old-Age and Survivors Insurance (OASI) benefits paid in  2002 totaled $388 billion for 39 million recipients.", "Established in 1956, Social Security Disability Insurance provides monthly  payments to eligible workers with disabilities who are under the normal  retirement age and to their dependents. To be eligible for DI benefits as  an adult, a person must have enough quarters of covered earnings and  must be unable to perform any substantial gainful activity by reason of a  medically determinable physical or mental impairment that is expected to  result in death or that has lasted or can be expected to last for a  continuous period of at least 12 months. As with retired worker benefits,  disability benefits are funded by payroll taxes paid by covered employees  and their employers. In calendar year 2002, about 7.2 million individuals  received approximately $65.6 billion in DI benefits.", "Our previous work on Social Security includes research on the effects of  Social Security reform on women, the disability insurance program, the  effects of increasing the retirement age, and adequacy issues associated  with the program.

The calculation of Social Security benefits is designed to replace a larger  proportion of the earnings of lower earners than it does for higher earners.  Thus, the benefit formula is progressive. For example, workers who retire  at the normal retirement age in 2003 with scaled, low lifetime covered  earnings will have benefits that replace approximately 56 percent of their  earnings. Workers with scaled, medium lifetime earnings will have about  42 percent of their earnings replaced, and workers with lifetime earnings  at the maximum taxable level will have approximately 30 percent  replaced.", "The probability of becoming disabled also affects the expected value of  Social Security benefits. DI recipients start drawing Social Security earlier  and simultaneously see their tax liability reduced; in general, they will  receive greater benefits in relation to the taxes they pay. DI benefits are  based on the same formula as OASI benefits, so that benefits for low- income workers replace a larger proportion of their earnings.

For example, if a nondisabled person dies before  retirement, that individual\u2019s benefit-to-tax ratio is expected to be lower  than the ratio for an individual who lives to receive retirement benefits.

As a group, blacks gain from Social Security\u2019s  progressive benefit formula, the early retirement option, and  comprehensive insurance plans.

Marital status is projected for each respondent until death. Work and  earnings are taken from the SER, and earnings are projected from 2000 to  2031. Spouse earnings are also based on the SER. Earnings of missing  spouses are imputed from similar survey respondents, and complete  earnings histories are imputed for respondents who did not report a Social  Security number. The MINT model provides SSA with the capability to  assess the distributional impact of changes to the Social Security program.", "MINT projects earnings histories for persons in the sample who have not  yet completed their careers. MINT also projects the year of initial receipt  of Social Security benefits and benefit amounts, in addition to other  sources of retirement income including pensions, asset income, and  earnings of working Social Security beneficiaries.", "Methodologically, we chose MINT3 for this report for  its capability to project marital changes, Social Security-covered work and  earnings, disability, retirement, and mortality;  its ability to prospectively assess and model various Social Security  programmatic alternatives;  its ability to examine a large portion of the Social Security population  (those born between 1931 and 1964, in the current analysis); and  its ability to examine various subgroups, notably by race and ethnicity; and  its use as a policy tool already employed by SSA;  While the MINT model provides data that are well-suited to our analysis,  there are some shortcomings of those data as well. First, the model  excludes a number of dependent and survivor beneficiaries in the  projections of benefits that are received on a primary insured worker\u2019s  record. Among the excluded groups are children of disabled, retired, or  deceased workers. In order to correct for this omission, SSA reduced the  OASI and DI tax rates\u2014both historical and prospective\u2014by the  percentage of program expenditures that were paid to those excluded  beneficiaries.", "As noted earlier, in our analysis, we use the \u201cshared\u201d measure of OASDI  taxes and benefits. For this measure, during years in which the individual  is unmarried\u2014either as a beneficiary or as a payroll taxpayer\u2014the full  measure of the individual\u2019s taxes paid or benefits received (regardless of  whose earnings those benefits are based upon) is counted. While the  individual is married, the taxes or benefits counted are half of the sum of  the individual\u2019s total payroll taxes or benefits plus the spouse\u2019s total  payroll taxes or benefits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Effects of Mortality", "paragraphs": ["The U.S. Census Bureau, under the Department of Commerce, publishes  population projections for the United States. Mortality assumptions are  represented as life tables for selected calendar years from 1999 to 2100  and are published by age, gender, race, and Hispanic origin. We used the  published 2001 life tables for the non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic Black,  and Hispanic populations to determine the number of years an individual,  age 20 in 2001, could expect to receive benefits. These tables are located  on the Bureau\u2019s website at:  http://www.census.gov/population/projections/nation/detail/lt99_10.a  Mortality affects the benefits received relative to taxes paid because it  determines the number of years a person will pay taxes and receive  benefits. Furthermore, mortality rates affect individuals\u2019 lifetime earnings  and their incidences of disability. Finally, mortality affects the amount of  benefits paid to survivors of deceased workers.", "Incorporating survivors who have a right to benefits on the decedent\u2019s  social security record complicates the impact of mortality on our  measures of social security benefits relative to taxes paid. For example,  dependent children and their surviving parents may begin to receive  survivor benefits. Aged (60 years or older) widows may begin to receive  benefits, or they may experience a change in the amount of benefits they  receive, as well as a change in whether the benefits are based on their own  or their deceased spouses\u2019 earnings.", "As noted above, Hispanics generally have the lowest mortality rates and  blacks have the highest. Earlier work using the MINT3 model shows that,  in practice, higher mortality tends to lower our measures of benefits  relative to taxes.
