According to TSA, in  fiscal year 2018, Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) screened more  than 804 million passengers at approximately 440 commercial airports  across the United States. TSOs are to follow standard operating  procedures that guide their screening processes and utilize technologies,  such as advanced imaging technology or walk-through metal detectors to  screen passengers, and x-ray and explosives detection technologies to  screen their belongings.", "TSA has a variety of training and development programs to help ensure  the TSO workforce has the skills and expertise needed to fulfill security  responsibilities.

In  accordance with the Aviation and Transportation Security Act, screeners  must complete a minimum of 40 hours of classroom instruction and 60  hours of on-the-job training, and must successfully complete an on-the- job training examination. Until 2016, new TSOs completed these  training requirements at or near their home airports through the New Hire  Training Program. In January 2016, TSA centralized this training under  the TSO Basic Training Program at the TSA Academy in Glynco,  Georgia. Further, in August 2018, TSA launched the first phases of TSO  Career Progression, in which new hire screeners receive local training  and gain experience in a limited number of screening functions before  advancing to the next stage of training at the TSA Academy, roughly  around the four-month mark.", "In 2015, in response to the DHS Office of Inspector General covert test  findings that highlighted areas of concern in the passenger screening  process, TSA implemented a TSO re-training effort, beginning with a  nationwide training called \u201cMission Essentials\u2014Threat Mitigation.\u201d  According to TSA, this training provided the opportunity for the TSO  workforce to become familiar with the threat information that underlies  TSA\u2019s use of checkpoint technologies and operational procedures to  mitigate risks."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Federal Training Evaluation Requirements and Training Evaluation Models", "paragraphs": ["In 2009, OPM developed and published regulations that require agencies  to evaluate training programs annually.

According to T&D data from May 2015 through June 2019, T&D  officials reviewed 62 risks that warranted a review for a potential change  to training, and 56 of the risks led officials to make training changes  across its TSO curriculum. Overall, T&D made changes affecting 40  different training courses.", "Based on our review of TSO training curriculum from May 2015 through  June 2019, we found that changes T&D made to its TSO training took  many forms. In some cases, T&D changed training to place additional  emphasis on a certain aspect of a current standard operating procedure  or provide context on the importance of following it. For example, in 2019,  T&D updated its instructor-led course\u2014\u201dMission Essentials: Resolution  Tools and Procedures\u201d\u2014to address covert tests where TSOs failed to  detect simulated explosive devices hidden in bags or concealed on  individuals at checkpoints. The training included a review of methods  terrorists may use to plan and carry out attacks in order to emphasize the  importance of following the standard operating procedure. The updated  training also included leading practices for searching belongings and a  discussion of issues that may affect a TSO\u2019s ability to detect threat items  hidden in belongings or on individuals. In fiscal year 2019, T&D also  updated instructor-led courses on its explosives detection system for  checked baggage to respond to covert test findings that TSOs failed to  detect certain simulated explosive devices. The updated training included  images of simulated explosives hidden in checked bags that replicated  scenarios similar to the failed covert tests.", "In other cases, T&D developed TSO training in response to new or  updated standard operating procedures for using technologies. T&D  officials said that for this type of TSO training, they wait until TSA\u2019s  Requirements, Capabilities, and Analysis office updates or establishes  new standard operating procedures for using new technologies and then  develops training based on the revisions. For example, T&D developed  TSO training to cover the differences between a prior and updated  version of the standard operating procedure for screening passengers  and belongings at security checkpoints. T&D included curriculum to cover  the major changes in the standard operating procedure and incorporated  additional training to address a covert test in which TSOs failed to detect  a simulated explosive device at a screening checkpoint. T&D also  developed training for TSOs who check passenger IDs and travel  documents. The training focused on updates to the standard operating  procedure and included procedures specific to the 2005 REAL ID Act,  which TSA will fully implement in 2020. Additionally, T&D incorporated  this new training to address covert tests that had found issues with  identifying false or fraudulent travel documents.", "In addition to updating or developing new training involving instructor-led  courses, TSA responded to identified risks by developing or updating job  aids or briefings for TSOs. For example, TSA developed the \u201cIt\u2019s Not the  Container\u201d briefing in 2017 to address risks highlighted by an attempted  attack in Australia and included tactics used to conceal explosives in  benign items.

Specifically:  Methods to quickly update training. In alignment with the leading  practice that agencies should have a process to enable quick updates to  training to respond to changing conditions, T&D has alternative processes  to develop and deliver training to TSOs faster than the approximately 6  months its standard process takes to develop or revise training. For  example, in 2018, T&D formalized a set of alternative processes to rapidly  develop and deliver training to TSOs. One such alternative is for T&D to  use its Rapid Response process, which allows for a response time to the  field of 72 hours. Additional options include the Rapid Update/Revision or  Rapid Development (Priority Training) processes to allow for a new  training to be issued in approximately 30 days. T&D officials said that the  rapid development processes are used when an issue, such as an  emerging threat, requires a response in days or weeks. T&D\u2019s guidance  outlines situations when these processes are appropriate for use and  provides checklists to help T&D personnel follow key steps.", "Mechanisms to help ensure evaluations of training effectiveness.  T&D has mechanisms for ensuring it evaluates the effectiveness of its  TSO training programs.

T&D is also to plan course  evaluations for each training during the curriculum development process,  determine the formal review cycle, and include it in the curriculum  development paperwork. According to its policy, T&D must complete a  curriculum review at least once every 5 years, but may do so at shorter  intervals. During the curriculum review, T&D examines the training to  confirm the content is valid with respect to the applicable listing of tasks  and competencies, current law, policy, procedures, and equipment.

For example, T&D officials said they updated participant evaluations for  TSO training they changed during this time period to address risks  identified by covert testing and reports on emerging threats. These  officials told us that they had not yet formally analyzed the results of the  evaluations. This progress is in line with T&D policy, which requires a  review of each training every 5 years. We verified this by obtaining  evaluations T&D collected for the six selected sample courses we  reviewed. T&D provided us level 1 survey responses it had collected that  measure training participants\u2019 reaction to, and satisfaction with, the  training programs for four of the courses.
