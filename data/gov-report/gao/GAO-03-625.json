VA does not know whether medical centers have adopted VA's national requirements for supervision of residents' diagnosis, treatment, or discharge of patients. VA officials require a review of only one specific requirement that is intended to ensure availability of supervision when a supervising physician does not need to be in the operating or procedural suite while a resident performs a diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. Four of 11 network officials we interviewed had not conducted this review, and the requirement at one medical center in one of these four networks was less stringent than VA's national requirement. To obtain more complete information about adherence to its national supervision requirements, VA plans to have external peer reviewers examine documentation of supervision in patients' medical records. VA's plans for this review have not been finalized. For example, as of May 2003, VA had not decided whether reviewers would examine records from VA's new outpatients. Without records from new patients, reviewers will not be able to assess documentation of residents' supervision during a veteran's first outpatient visit. To improve its oversight, VA is making efforts to obtain information from accrediting bodies and residents about the quality of resident supervision. For example, VA has taken steps to obtain direct access to letters from accrediting bodies that contain evaluations of the GME programs in which its medical centers participate. To solicit feedback from residents, VA implemented a national survey, but was unable to send this survey to a representative sample of residents from each VA medical center because it does not have a complete central list of its residents. VA is taking action to obtain this information. In addition, VA uses information from its broader programs for monitoring the quality and outcomes of patient care, such as its patient safety and surgical quality improvement programs, to identify and correct problems with resident supervision.

Residents are medical school graduates who receive supervised  training in a medical specialty (such as internal medicine or surgery) prior  to providing care without supervision. As a provider of GME, VA faces the  dual challenges of ensuring the safety and quality of the health care its  patients receive from residents while simultaneously providing residents  with appropriate educational opportunities. Supervision of residents by  qualified physicians is central to balancing these patient care and  educational goals, and responsibility for the care provided by a resident to  any patient belongs to the licensed physician who supervises that  resident. Through observation and direction, supervising physicians are to  impart knowledge and skills to residents while making sure that patients  receive appropriate, timely, and effective care.", "Effective oversight is necessary if VA is to assure the adequacy of resident  supervision. Key components of oversight include procedures to assess  the supervision residents receive and to initiate corrective action when  there is a problem. Information from multiple, complementary sources can  be used to assess supervision; such information includes evidence of  whether residents receive required supervision, evaluations of the  adequacy of supervision by organizations that accredit GME programs and  by residents, and analyses of the quality and outcomes of care provided by  residents. In 1986 and 1992, we reported that VA headquarters officials had  not adequately overseen resident supervision and that the documentation  of resident supervision at some medical centers was inadequate. Although  documentation does not fully communicate the extent or quality of  supervision, it is an important record of whether a supervising physician  was involved in a patient\u2019s care.", "Responsibilities for resident supervision and its oversight are distributed  across multiple VA organizational components and are shared by VA\u2019s  affiliated medical schools and teaching hospitals. VA headquarters  established national requirements for supervision of residents\u2019 health care  activities\u2014including diagnosis, treatment, and discharge of patients\u2014and  for oversight of supervision. Responsibilities for implementing these  requirements are assigned to the administrators of its regional networks  of medical facilities, medical center managers, and supervising physicians.  Most residency training within VA medical centers is conducted through  GME programs run by medical schools or other teaching hospitals, which  are known as sponsoring institutions. GME accrediting bodies hold the  sponsoring institutions responsible for the quality of the GME program in  each medical specialty. As a result, VA medical centers share  responsibility for ensuring the adequacy of residents\u2019 supervision with  these affiliated sponsoring institutions.", "Concerned that overlapping authority for residents\u2019 activities could allow  problems with resident supervision to go undetected or uncorrected, you  asked us to examine the adequacy of VA\u2019s oversight of resident  supervision. In response to your request, we examined VA\u2019s procedures  for (1) monitoring VA medical centers\u2019 adherence to VA\u2019s requirements for  resident supervision, (2) using evaluations of supervision by GME  accrediting bodies and residents, and (3) using information about resident  supervision drawn from VA\u2019s programs for monitoring the quality and  outcomes of patient care.", "To address these objectives, we examined VA\u2019s policy for resident  supervision and reviewed relevant documents from VA headquarters  offices, networks, and medical centers. We analyzed annual reports on  residency training submitted to VA headquarters for the 2000/2001  academic year by VA\u2019s regional networks and 114 of the approximately   130 VA medical centers that provide GME training. We interviewed VA  officials, as well as GME experts and officials of accrediting bodies,  medical associations, and other stakeholder groups. We also interviewed  GME managers from 11 of VA\u2019s 21 regional networks and 11 medical  centers. The sample included one medical center from each sampled  network and was designed to cover a range in total number of residency  positions and number of medical specialties in which training occurred.  We reviewed information from three additional medical centers involved  in GME programs that, as of May 2002, had been placed on probationary  accreditation or for which accreditation was to be withdrawn. We visited  two of those medical centers. Our work covered VA\u2019s oversight of resident  supervision and did not include an evaluation of the quality of care  provided by residents or the quality of the supervision provided to  residents. We conducted our work from September 2001 through June  2003 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

For the 2002/2003 academic year, VA supported  almost 8,800 residency slots, about 9 percent of all residency training  positions in the United States. Moreover, because several residents  typically rotate through each slot, VA estimates that it provides graduate  medical training to more than 28,000 residents each year, or as many as  one-third of the nation\u2019s residents. The number of residency slots VA  allocates to individual medical centers involved in GME ranges from less  than 1 to more than 200. Although about half of VA\u2019s residency positions  are in primary care, VA supports GME in 45 recognized medical specialties  and subspecialties; individual medical centers provide training in from 1 to  more than 30 specialties.", "VA headquarters officials have ultimate oversight responsibility for the  activities of residents within VA medical centers, and several different  headquarters offices have monitoring functions that relate to resident  supervision. VA\u2019s Office of Academic Affiliations (OAA) has responsibility  for developing and overseeing policies for resident supervision,  monitoring VA\u2019s GME activities, and allocating residency slots. Under the  Patient Safety Program VA implemented in January 2002, VA\u2019s National  Center for Patient Safety collects and analyzes information from VA  medical centers about patient risk events and their causes. Medical  centers are required to report all patient safety events\u2014including adverse  events and close calls\u2014to the National Center for Patient Safety. In  addition, medical centers are required to determine the root causes of  patient safety incidents with severe or potentially severe outcomes and  develop plans to prevent them in the future. The success of this program  will depend on the extent to which VA is able to establish a culture in  which employees feel safe to make these reports. VA\u2019s Office of Patient  Care Services establishes and monitors health care programs. For  example, its National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (NSQIP)  examines postoperative outcomes. Additional oversight of resident  supervision is provided by VA\u2019s Office of Inspector General.", "Because VA\u2019s health care system is decentralized, responsibilities for  implementing VA\u2019s national policy for resident supervision are assigned to  networks and medical centers. Network officials are to provide medical  centers with the resources necessary to ensure that residents are  supervised in accordance with VA\u2019s national policy and are to evaluate the  strengths and weaknesses of medical centers\u2019 GME activities. Medical  center directors are responsible for establishing facility policies for  resident supervision that fulfill the requirements of VA\u2019s national policy,  and medical center chiefs of staff are responsible for the educational and  patient care activities of all residents within the facility. In addition, a  physician in each medical specialty is responsible for ensuring that the  residents training in that specialty are supervised as required.", "VA medical centers typically also share responsibility for the oversight of  residents with affiliated institutions that sponsor GME programs. VA  participates in more than 1,900 distinct GME programs, 29 of which are  sponsored by VA medical centers. The rest are sponsored by about 120  medical schools and teaching hospitals with which VA medical centers are  affiliated. The majority of VA medical centers work with one GME  sponsoring institution, but individual VA medical centers participate in the  GME programs of up to four different sponsors. When a VA medical center  serves as a training site for residents, but is not the sponsoring institution,  it is known as a participating institution. GME accrediting bodies hold  sponsoring institutions responsible for all aspects of their educational  programs, including aspects conducted within participating institutions.  GME accrediting bodies do not separately accredit participating  institutions and do not evaluate the extent to which supervision that  occurs within participating institutions, such as VA medical centers, meets  requirements set by those participating institutions.", "VA requires accreditation of each GME program through which its  residents obtain training. More than 98 percent of VA\u2019s residency slots are  filled by residents in GME programs that are subject to accreditation  review by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education  (ACGME); the remaining slots are filled by residents in osteopathic  programs that are subject to accreditation review by the American  Osteopathic Association. GME accreditation status indicates an overall  assessment of the quality of an educational program in a particular  medical specialty. Accrediting bodies evaluate several aspects of each  GME program, including provisions for the supervision and safety of  residents, the adequacy of institutional resources, educational curriculum,  and the extent to which the program meets that specialty\u2019s specific  training requirements. A program can be fully accredited, or a program can  be granted accreditation with notification of problems that must be  corrected. Accreditation can also be withdrawn. A program\u2019s accreditation  status is made public, but to safeguard confidential information, specific  problems with the program or its training sites are described in letters sent  only to the sponsoring institution. Accrediting bodies have not been  sending these letters to participating institutions.", "Accrediting bodies state that the quality of patient care must remain the  highest priority of GME programs. Health care organizations that provide  GME must ensure that qualified staff physicians supervise residents and  that the same standards for the quality and safety of patient care apply  when residents are involved in health care delivery as when they are not.  GME accrediting bodies require that supervising physicians adjust the  level of supervision to meet the educational goal of increasing residents\u2019  competence by giving them appropriate opportunities to assume greater  independence in their patient-care activities, that is, allowing residents to  assume graduated responsibilities. The supervising physician relies on his  or her professional judgment and knowledge of the patient\u2019s medical  condition and the resident\u2019s level of mastery to determine the degree of  independence of the resident\u2019s patient-care responsibilities.", "VA\u2019s national policy on resident supervision is detailed in a handbook that  establishes specific requirements for (1) the involvement of supervising  physicians in the care provided by residents who diagnose, treat, or  discharge patients and (2) the documentation of that involvement.

Network GME  managers are supposed to review and approve this requirement; they are  not required to report the results of their reviews to OAA.

We found that the requirement of a medical  center in one of the four networks that had not conducted this review was  less stringent than the requirement in VA\u2019s handbook for supervision of  diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The written policy at this medical  center stated that the supervising physician can be immediately available  by telephone rather than requiring him or her to be immediately available  in the facility or on campus. One network GME manager who did review  this requirement for supervision of diagnostic and therapeutic procedures  told us that in 2002, he identified three medical centers that had written  requirements for supervision of these procedures that were less stringent  than the requirement in VA\u2019s handbook and that he instructed each of  these facilities to change its policy to be consistent with VA\u2019s national  requirement."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "VA Headquarters Monitors Medical Center and Network Oversight of Resident Supervision through Annual Reports", "paragraphs": ["To learn what medical centers and networks do to monitor whether  supervision is consistent with VA\u2019s resident supervision handbook, VA has  required annual reports on residency training programs beginning with the  1999/2000 academic year.

More than three-fourths of medical centers\u2019  annual reports included a description of an independent review of the  documentation of supervision of at least one aspect of care provided by  residents, but most medical centers did not describe reviews of all four  domains of residents\u2019 health care activities. For each of three domains\u2014 inpatient care, outpatient care, and diagnostic and therapeutic  procedures\u2014over half the medical centers described a process for an  independent review of at least one element of the documentation of  resident supervision, that is, a review by someone other than a physician  with related supervisory responsibilities (see table 3). For example, the  quality management office at one medical center reviews medical records  each month to determine whether documentation indicates that inpatients  were seen by supervising physicians within 24 hours of admission. As  shown in table 3, few medical centers, however, described such a process  for review of supervisory documentation when residents provide  consultations to patients\u2019 primary physicians.", "In addition, medical centers\u2019 annual reports did not always include clear,  detailed descriptions of the documentation requirements they monitor.  Few specifically mentioned monitoring particular VA-wide requirements,  such as the requirement for documentation of supervisory involvement at  the time of each new outpatient\u2019s first visit. In some instances, medical  centers described a less systematic review process or one that was used  for only some services provided by residents. For diagnostic and  therapeutic procedures, for example, some medical centers described  processes for reviewing only selected procedures, such as endoscopies or  major surgeries.", "About half of the 91 medical centers that reported having an independent  review process indicated they found deficiencies with the documentation  of resident supervision, and all but one discussed actions they took to  correct these problems. For example, officials from one medical center  told us that they implemented a program to discipline individual  physicians who consistently do not meet the medical center\u2019s  requirements for documenting supervision. The acting chief of staff there  told us that during the 2001/2002 academic year, three physicians had each  been suspended without pay for 1 day for not consistently meeting  documentation requirements and that there had been significant  improvement in the documentation of resident supervision since this  disciplinary program went into effect.

In their annual reports, two of these  three medical centers stated that there were no adverse patient events  involving resident supervision. The third did not state whether there had  been any adverse patient outcomes. In the first instance, the medical  center reported that its review of documentation indicated that some staff  physicians provided a \u201clow level\u201d of supervision to residents in the  inpatient surgical setting. Medical center officials responded by meeting  with those physicians and conducting a follow-up review to monitor the  level of supervision. In the second instance, the medical center reported  that its supervision of residents was generally satisfactory, but that it had  found through its documentation review one episode in which the  attending surgeon had left the city during a procedure that he was  supposed to be supervising. This medical center reported that the surgeon  was formally reprimanded. In the third instance, a medical center reported  that through its documentation review, it identified two specialties\u2014 urology and plastic surgery\u2014for which it wanted to increase the number  of procedures performed with the staff physician physically present and  directly involved in the surgery. The medical center reported that its  management was working with the surgery service chief to achieve this  goal.", "We also identified a few medical centers that described independent  processes for monitoring resident supervision that went beyond reviewing  documentation.

For example, if a resident participated in the care of an  inpatient or an outpatient during the current academic year, the external  reviewer is to determine whether documentation of supervision in the  patient\u2019s medical record met the requirements in VA\u2019s national handbook.

In February 2003, VA signed a  memorandum of understanding with ACGME that lays the foundation for  OAA to receive copies of accreditation letters. According to this  memorandum, VA must now obtain revised affiliation agreements between  VA medical centers and GME sponsors that authorize ACGME to provide  OAA with its accreditation letters. VA is taking steps to ensure that these  revised agreements will be in place by July 2004. OAA has come to a  similar agreement with the American Osteopathic Association.", "As a further step to obtain information about, and monitor responses to,  GME issues\u2014including accreditation concerns\u2014OAA reissued a policy  requiring VA medical centers to establish an affiliation partnership council  and submit minutes of council meetings to OAA.

Residents are also asked to evaluate their satisfaction with the  degree of supervision and degree of autonomy they experienced.", "In 2001 and 2002, VA headquarters could not send the survey to a random,  representative sample of residents from each of its medical centers  involved in GME because it did not have a complete list of its trainees.  OAA was able to obtain feedback from many residents who did receive the  survey and gave those results to medical centers and networks.

VA\u2019s  monitoring programs include its new Patient Safety Program and NSQIP.  Reviews of paid tort claims by VA\u2019s Chief Patient Care Officer provide  another mechanism for identifying problems with resident supervision.  OAA monitors medical centers\u2019 use of these programs through the annual  reports on residency training. In their annual reports for the 2000/2001  academic year, most medical centers indicated that they monitor patient  care information to determine whether resident supervision affected the  quality or outcomes of patient care.", "The system for reporting adverse events and close calls established by  VA\u2019s Patient Safety Program has the potential to capture information about  instances in which inadequate resident supervision contributed to  heightened risk of adverse health care outcomes. Based on analysis of the  17,000 reports of adverse events and close calls filed with VA\u2019s National  Center for Patient Safety as of April 2002, its director estimated that  resident supervision was mentioned\u2014in any context\u2014in less than 0.1  percent of the incidents reported by VA medical centers and that  inadequate supervision was a causal factor in very few of those cases.", "Analyses of postoperative outcomes recorded in the NSQIP database,  including mortality and morbidity, provide VA with a way to study the  effects of residents\u2019 involvement in surgical procedures. NSQIP personnel  analyze nationwide data from major surgeries, provide site-specific reports  to medical centers and networks, and conduct site visits at medical  centers. A NSQIP official told us that these data are routinely examined  for signs that supervision of residents might be inadequate. For example,  NSQIP analysts review the data to ensure that residents are not  performing surgeries that are more advanced than would be appropriate  for their level of training. In addition to reviewing NSQIP reports,  headquarters officials who oversee VA\u2019s surgical services monitor the  frequency with which supervising physicians are in the operating or  procedural suite when residents perform surgeries.", "Medical center and network officials have used NSQIP reports to help  monitor resident supervision. For example, a team of experts selected by  NSQIP visited one medical center at its request in February 2002 to help it  evaluate the efficiency of its operating rooms. During its visit, the team  noted inadequate supervision of surgeries performed by urology  residents. The medical center corrected this problem by arranging for  urologists to spend more time at the medical center and ensuring that they  understood VA\u2019s requirements for supervision. In another instance, a  network GME manager observed that NSQIP data indicated that  orthopedic surgery outcomes at a particular medical center were less  favorable than expected. After a site visit, network officials concluded that  the medical center could not support complex surgeries and determined  that continued training of orthopedic residents at that medical center  would require a decrease in the complexity of cases and greater  involvement by supervising physicians. When the sponsoring institution  decided that the medical center would not meet its training needs under  those conditions, VA officials chose to transfer patients with complex  surgical needs to VA\u2019s tertiary hospitals in the network and shift its two  VA-funded residency slots in orthopedic surgery to a different VA medical  center.", "Researchers using the NSQIP database have studied ways in which  participation in GME affects postoperative outcomes. To determine  whether residency training places surgical patients at risk for worse  outcomes, researchers using the NSQIP database compared risk-adjusted  mortality rates in VA\u2019s teaching and nonteaching hospitals and found that  they did not differ, although the patients who underwent surgeries at  teaching hospitals had a higher prevalence of risk factors, underwent more  complex operations, and had longer operation times. Morbidity rates were  higher in teaching than nonteaching hospitals for some surgical specialties  that were studied. On the basis of their analyses, the authors suggested  that differences in morbidity rates could reflect incomplete adjustment for  risks, such as severity of illness, or the more complex systems of managing  and coordinating care that characterize teaching hospitals, and not  necessarily the involvement of residents. Another study begun in  September 2001 is designed to use the NSQIP database to clarify the  relationship between residents\u2019 working conditions and surgical  outcomes, with data from 90 VA hospitals and 3 nonfederal hospitals in  which surgical residents are trained.", "Tort claims also provide information that VA uses to identify problems  with resident supervision that affected patient care. Review of paid tort  claims by VA\u2019s Chief Patient Care Services Officer resulted in clarification  of VA\u2019s written requirements for resident supervision when patients are  admitted to inpatient units. In the specific case that led to this change, a  supervising physician did not come to the hospital during a weekend to  see a patient who had been admitted by a resident; the patient died on  Monday. At that time, the resident supervision policy of the VA hospital in  which the incident occurred did not specifically require supervising  physicians to come in on weekends. As a result of this case, in October  2001 an explicit reference to weekends and holidays was added to the  handbook\u2019s requirement that each new inpatient be seen by the  supervising physician within 24 hours of admission.", "OAA monitors incidents in which resident supervision contributed to  adverse events or patient risks through the annual reports it requires from  medical centers. In their 2000/2001 annual reports on residency training,  all but 11 of 114 medical centers indicated that they monitored patient  safety events associated with residents. They used a variety of processes  to collect this information, including root cause analyses and tort claim  reviews, as well as additional processes such as mortality and morbidity  conferences and reviews triggered by unexpected events, such as  readmission within 10 days of discharge from the medical center. Annual  reports indicated that reviews of at least 18 actual or potential adverse  patient outcomes at a total of 14 medical centers identified resident  supervision as a possible contributing factor or led medical center officials  to strengthen supervision to minimize the chance of future problems. For  example, one medical center established a requirement for greater  involvement by supervising physicians before a resident initiates  chemotherapy orders. Medical centers described taking corrective actions  in response to these reviews."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["VA cannot assure that the residents who provide care in its facilities  receive adequate supervision because its current procedures for  monitoring supervision are insufficient. To oversee the supervision of its  residents, VA needs various types of information, including information  regarding supervising physicians\u2019 adherence to VA\u2019s requirements for  resident supervision, accrediting bodies\u2019 and residents\u2019 concerns about  supervision, and whether the quality or outcomes of patient care indicate  problems with supervision. Systematic monitoring of each of these types  of information would help ensure that problems with resident supervision  are detected and corrected by the various officials of VA medical centers  and affiliated institutions who have responsibilities for residents\u2019  activities.", "Although VA issued a handbook that established specific standards for  resident supervision, VA does not know what its medical centers\u2019  supervision requirements are and does not ensure that its national  requirements are adopted at each medical center where residents train.  Moreover, VA does not know whether the supervision its residents receive  adheres to its national requirements. VA\u2019s current plans for external peer  review of documentation have the potential to enhance its oversight  capability, but these plans have not been finalized. For example, as of May  2003, VA had not decided whether external reviewers would examine  documentation of supervision for VA\u2019s new outpatients, who make up a  significant and growing number of VA\u2019s patients. Including these new  outpatients in the external review could help ensure adequate supervision  of residents during a patient\u2019s first visit to VA.", "To further improve its oversight of resident supervision, VA will need to  complete its initiatives to obtain timely access to evaluations by  accrediting bodies and residents. VA will also need to continue to take  advantage of its programs for monitoring the quality and outcomes of  patient care. VA officials have generally acted to improve supervision  when faced with evidence of problems, and better access to information  will enhance their ability to monitor and improve resident supervision.", "By strengthening its oversight capabilities, VA could help promote both  the quality of the health care in its facilities and the education its residents  receive.
