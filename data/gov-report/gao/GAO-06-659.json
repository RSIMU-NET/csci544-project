An effective management structure is the  starting point for coordinating and communicating the continuous cycle of  information security activities, while providing guidance and oversight for  the security of the entity as a whole. One mechanism organizations can  adopt to achieve effective coordination and communication, particularly in  organizations where information security management is decentralized, is  to establish a central security management office or group to serve as a  facilitator to individual business units and senior management. A central  security group serves as a locus of knowledge and expertise on information  security and coordinates agencywide security-related activities.

Consequently, the various organizations responsible for  implementing information security did not have a good understanding or  adequate visibility of the activities that other groups performed, nor did  they always make appropriate decisions about information security for the  network environment as a whole. As a result, there was no enterprisewide  view of information security, and decisions regarding information security  activities were not always optimal or based on a full understanding of the  shared network environment supporting the Treasury auction process. For  example,  one IT group responsible for database operations made information  security decisions regarding the distributed-based auction applications  on the concept that they were operating in a \u201ctrusted network,\u201d which  resulted in the omission of controls that should have been in place;   one IT group made decisions about the operations and maintenance of  the distributed-based auction applications without full or accurate  knowledge of the relevant computing environment;  no IT group had responsibility for making a decision to upgrade the  distributed-based auction database product, although all concerned  agreed that an upgrade was needed; and  servers that support the distributed-based auction applications were  supposed to be identical to ensure real-time continuity of operations,  but our testing showed that, as implemented, they were not identical.", "The Federal Reserve recognizes that a need exists for comprehensive  approaches to managing information security, and that the management  structure and processes that served its mainframe-centric environment in  the past are not adequate for the distributed, interconnected environment  supporting its various lines of business today.

We have already taken corrective actions to remediate many of the findings in  the report, and we will continue to apply our risk-based assessment framework to determine  appropriate information security controls or compensating measures to address remaining  findings.", "The Reserve Banks are taking action to address systemic and organizational  issues that contributed to the report\u2019s findings.  We met with the GAO review team several times  to discuss our plans to further strengthen our information security architecture and to correct the  root causes of the findings so that we avoid recurring weakness in controls.  The report  recognizes that successful implementation of the strengthened architecture could improve our  ability to manage our information security operational and technical environments.  We have  also taken actions to improve our ability to coordinate and oversee our complex IT systems  effectively.  The Reserve Banks recently realigned their information security governance  structure and designated the Director of the Reserve Banks\u2019 Federal Reserve Information  Technology organization (FRIT) as the focal point for enterprise-wide information security.  All  operational units within the Federal Reserve Banks are responsible for confirming compliance  with established information security operational practices and information security policies and  standards with the Director of FRIT.  As part of this realignment, FRIT established a new  function, National Information Security Assurance (NISA), which is responsible for monitoring  end-to-end information security compliance with security standards, including software  currency, across the Federal Reserve.  Further, NISA will maintain an aggregate view of  information security risk across all risk management programs, including internal audit and  external sources, such as the GAO.", "The Treasury auction applications reviewed in this report were developed starting  in 1998 when web technology, tools, and development practices were substantially less evolved  than those available today.  While security methods for web-based applications have improved,  so has the sophistication of criminals attempting to compromise them.  The Treasury and the  Federal Reserve are currently undertaking a significant development initiative to replace the  existing applications and operational infrastructure by year-end 2007.  The design of the new  application and infrastructure is based on current sound practices that will ensure a well- managed and well-controlled operating environment.  The Federal Reserve and Treasury plan to  validate the integrity of the application and infrastructure at several points in the project using  internal and external technical resources.  A key aspect of this validation is ensuring the GAO\u2019s  findings are addressed.  The new auction applications will be operated within the Federal  Reserve\u2019s strengthened information security architecture, and information security compliance  will be monitored through our improved information security governance structure.", "As your report notes, this review specifically focused on information security  controls in the distributed computing and network environments supporting the Treasury auction  process.  The GAO\u2019s review did not consider the end-to-end risk control environment that would  include management and business operational controls.  This additional layer of control is critical  to ensuring the integrity of the Schedules of Federal Debt.  The information security  vulnerabilities the GAO identified did not affect its opinion in its report titled Financial Audit:  Bureau of the Public Debt\u2019s Fiscal Years 2004 and 2005 Schedules of Federal Debt. That report  noted that effective internal controls over financial reporting and compliance with applicable  laws and regulations were maintained.  Although we consider the information security control  vulnerabilities identified in the Treasury auction system report significant and warranting our  serious attention, they should not be construed as allowing successful circumvention of Treasury  auction management and business operational controls.", "We appreciate the quality of the GAO technical review and the time taken by the  review team to brief Federal Reserve and Treasury staff thoroughly on the results of the review. The GAO team has also contributed to our remediation efforts by consulting with various  Federal Reserve technical and management staff on the technical details underlying the findings  in the report."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "GAO Contacts and Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contacts", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the individuals named above, Ed Alexander, Lon Chin,  Edward Glagola, David Hayes, Hal Lewis, Duc Ngo, Dawn Simpson, and  Jenniffer Wilson, Assistant Directors, and Mark Canter, Dean Carpenter,  Jason Carroll, West Coile, Debra Conner, Neil Doherty, Nancy Glover,  Sharon Kittrell, Eugene Stevens, Henry Sutanto, Amos Tevelow, and Chris  Warweg made key contributions to this report."], "subsections": []}]}], "fastfact": []}
