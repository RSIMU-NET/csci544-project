GAO has previously identified the need for DOD to improve its oversight of contractors by non-acquisition personnel, such as CORs, and Congress has addressed this issue in legislation. CORs act as the liaisons between the contractor, the contracting officer, and the unit receiving support.", "Following up on previous GAO work on this topic, GAO determined the extent to which (1) DOD\u0092s required training prepares CORs to perform their contract management and oversight duties, (2) CORs have the subject area-related technical expertise needed to oversee contracts, and (3) the number of CORs is sufficient to oversee the contracts in Afghanistan. GAO conducted field work in Afghanistan and the United States and focused on the preparedness of CORs to manage and oversee contracts in the CENTCOM area of responsibility."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) has taken steps to enhance its existing training program for contracting officer\u0092s representatives (CORs), but the required training does not fully prepare them to perform their contract oversight duties in contingency areas such as Afghanistan. DOD requires that CORs be qualified by training and experience commensurate with the responsibilities to be delegated to them. DOD took several actions to enhance its training program, such as developing a CORs training course with a focus on contingency operations. However, GAO found that CORs are not prepared to oversee contracts because the required training does not include specifics on how to complete written statements of work and how to operate in Afghanistan\u0092s unique contracting environment. For example, DOD contracting personnel told GAO about opening delays and additional expenses related to the construction of a dining facility, which was originally constructed without a kitchen because it was not included in the original statement of work. In some cases, contract-specific training was not provided at all. In addition, not all oversight personnel such as commanders and senior leaders receive training to perform contract oversight and management duties in Afghanistan because such training is not required of them. Because DOD\u0092s required training does not prepare CORs and other oversight personnel to oversee contracts, units cannot be assured that they receive what they paid for.", "CORs do not always have the necessary subject area-related technical expertise to oversee U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) contracts they were assigned to. Contracting officials noted, for example, that the staircases on guard towers at a forward operating base were poorly constructed and unsafe to climb. The COR assigned to that contract had inadequate subject area-related technical expertise, preventing the early identification of the defective welding on the staircases. According to contracting officials, situations like this often occurred due to the shortage of CORs with expertise in construction. Also, at the time of GAO\u0092s field work, CORs for contracts written by CENTCOM contracting officers did not have access to subject matter experts, particularly those with construction experience. According to contracting personnel, because CORs do not have the subject area-related technical expertise needed to oversee contracts or access to subject matter experts, facilities were sometimes deficient and had to be reconstructed at great additional expense to the taxpayer.", "DOD does not have a sufficient number of CORs to oversee the numerous contracts in Afghanistan. CENTCOM requires CORs to be nominated for all service contracts over $2,500 that, unless exempted, require significant ongoing technical advice and surveillance from requirements personnel. However, there is no guidance on the number of contracts a single COR should oversee. According to contracting officials and CORs GAO interviewed in Afghanistan, some CORs were responsible for providing oversight to multiple contracts in addition to carrying out their primary military duty. For example, one COR GAO interviewed was assigned to more than a dozen construction projects. According to that COR, it was impossible to be at each construction site during key phases of the project because the projects were occurring almost simultaneously at different locations. Consequently, according to officials, in situations like these, construction was completed without sufficient government oversight and problems were sometimes identified after facilities had been completed."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DOD enhance the current strategy for managing and overseeing contracts in contingency areas such as Afghanistan by, for example, developing training standards for providing operational contract support (OCS), fully institutionalizing OCS in professional military education, and developing standards regarding the number of contracts that CORs can oversee based on the technical nature and complexity of the contract. DOD concurred with all of GAO\u0092s recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Department of Defense (DOD) reported that it had obligated over $16  billion in fiscal year 2011 for contracts that were executed primarily in  Afghanistan and that, as of October 2011, contractors made up 49  percent of the department\u2019s workforce there\u2014101,789 DOD contractors  compared with approximately 104,900 U.S. military personnel.  Contractors support the military during contingency operations by, for  example, managing dining facilities; washing uniforms; guarding military  bases; constructing roads to schools; transporting supplies; and building  facilities, such as guard towers, water treatment plants, and hospitals.  Since 1997, we have reported on DOD\u2019s use of contractors to support  contingency operations. For example, we reported in July 2004 that DOD  did not always have sufficient contract oversight personnel to manage  and oversee its logistics support contracts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In  December 2006, we noted that without an adequate number of trained  oversight personnel DOD could not be assured that contractors could  meet contract requirements efficiently and effectively. Effective contract  management is essential for ensuring that U.S. military personnel receive  the support they need and that controls are in place to prevent fraud,  waste, and abuse. Ultimately, failure to manage contracts effectively  could undermine U.S. policy objectives and threaten the safety of U.S.  forces.", "It takes a wide range of people to execute an acquisition from start to  finish including personnel outside of the acquisition workforce such as  contracting officer\u2019s representatives (CORs). CORs are military or civilian  DOD personnel that manage and oversee contracts by acting as the eyes  and the ears of DOD\u2019s contracting officers and by serving as the liaisons  between the contractor, the contracting officer, and the unit receiving  support or services. The contracting officer is ultimately responsible for  ensuring that contractors meet the requirements as set forth in the  contract. However, the CORs are non-acquisition personnel that have  acquisition-related responsibilities\u2014particularly those related to contract  management and oversight of service and product acquisitions.", "We and other oversight entities have identified the need for DOD to  improve the management and oversight of contractors by non-acquisition  personnel, such as the CORs. Congress addressed the need to improve  the management and oversight of non-acquisition personnel, in  legislation. Specifically, Congress included provisions relating to  contingency contracting in the John Warner National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007 and the National Defense  Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, codified at section 2333 of Title  10, United States Code. The National Defense Authorization Act for  Fiscal Year 2008 amended section 2333 to require that certain DOD joint  policy provide for training of military personnel outside the acquisition  workforce expected to have acquisition responsibility, including oversight  duties during combat operations, post-conflict operations, and  contingency operations. Further, section 2333 requires that the training  be sufficient to ensure that such military personnel understand the scope  and scale of contractor support that they will experience in contingency  operations and are prepared for their roles and responsibilities in regard  to requirements definition, program management (including contractor  oversight), and contingency contracting, which are aspects of operational  contract support (OCS). Specific concerns have been raised about the  training, expertise, and the sufficiency of the number of CORs providing  contract management and oversight. For example, in 2007, the  Commission on Army Acquisition and Program Management in  Expeditionary Operations (known as the Gansler Report) found that  CORs usually had no experience managing contracts and received  contract management training that was not relevant to the Afghanistan  contracting environment. Further, in June 2009, the Commission on  Wartime Contracting reported shortfalls in the number of qualified  oversight personnel in Afghanistan, specifically CORs, and a general lack  of COR training. Then, in August 2011, the Commission on Wartime  Contracting reported that poor planning and oversight by the government  and poor performance by contractors had resulted in wasted resources,  missions not being achieved, and the loss of lives. A recent U.S. Army  Contracting Command article noted that many deploying units were  either unaware of, or simply ignored, a certain Army road map for units to  follow to successfully integrate OCS training, including training CORs into  its pre-deployment preparations; the article concluded that units  continued to deploy unprepared to execute their OCS mission.

However,  contracting officers are frequently not located in the area or at the  installation where the services are being provided. For that reason,  contracting officers designate CORs via an appointment letter to assist  with the technical monitoring or administration of a contract on their  behalf. CORs serve as the eyes and ears for the contracting officer and  act as the liaisons between the contractor, the contracting officer, and the  unit receiving support or services. CORs are responsible for tasks  identified in the contracting officer\u2019s appointment letter that may include  (1) providing daily contract oversight, (2) performing quality assurance  reviews, (3) monitoring contract performance, and (4) assessing technical  performance. CORs cannot direct the contractor by making commitments  or changes that affect price, quality, quantity, delivery, or other terms and  conditions of the contract. have also been tasked with other contract-related duties such as  preparing statements of work, which provide the requirements or  specifications of the contract, developing requirements approval  paperwork, and preparing funding documents.

When DCMA is not designated responsibility for administrative  oversight of a contract, the contracting officer who awarded the contract is  responsible for the administration, management, and oversight of the  contract. These contracting officers, such as those from the CENTCOM  Joint Theater Support Contracting Command often appoint CORs to  monitor contractor performance. CORs appointed by the CENTCOM  Joint Theater Support Contracting Command are typically drawn from  units receiving contractor-provided services. In Afghanistan, CORs that  have been appointed to contracts administered by DCMA report oversight  results to DCMA personnel. For contracts not administered by DCMA,  CORs provide oversight information to the contracting officer. In  Afghanistan, the CENTCOM Joint Theater Support Contracting  Command directs requiring activities (units receiving contractor-provided  goods and services) to nominate CORs for all service contracts valued at  more than $2,500 with significant technical requirements that require  ongoing advice and surveillance from technical/requirements personnel.  The contracting officer may exempt service contracts from this  requirement when the following three conditions are all met:  (1) The contract will be awarded using simplified acquisition procedures;  (2) The requirement is not complex; and  (3) The contracting officer documents the file, in writing, as to why the  appointment of a COR is unnecessary."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "DOD Took Steps to Enhance Existing Training Program, but Existing Training Does Not Fully Prepare CORs for Contract Management and Oversight Duties", "paragraphs": ["Although DOD requires CORs to receive training and took some actions  to enhance training programs, CORs we met with in Afghanistan do not  always receive adequate training to prepare them for their contract  management and oversight duties.

According to DOD officials, the current training might  qualify CORs to monitor contractor performance generally, but it does not  necessarily make them sufficiently capable for their particular  assignments. DOD officials have acknowledged gaps in training. For  example, required DOD training taken by CORs did not fully address the  unique contracting environment that exists in Afghanistan, which includes  large numbers of Afghan contractors with limited experience and  qualifications.

For example, the training for CORs is generally focused on low- risk contract operations in Afghanistan and does not fully address the  unique contracting environment that exists there, such as the extent of  inexperience of Afghan contractors, the remote and insecure locations of  project sites, the underdeveloped infrastructure, and constraints on the  movement and deployment of oversight personnel, especially acquisition  personnel. More specifically, the required CORs training does not include  information about important issue areas like the Afghan First Program,  which encourages an increased use of local personnel and vendors for  supplies and services as part of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy,  and working with private security contractors. Some CORs in Afghanistan  told us they were unaware of the challenges in working with Afghan  contractors and thought contracting with them would be similar to  contracting with U.S. vendors. However, according to some of the CORs  and other contracting personnel we interviewed, providing oversight of  Afghan contractors was more challenging than was the case with other  vendors because the Afghan contractors often did not meet the timelines  specified in the contract, did not provide the quality products and the  services the units had anticipated, and did not necessarily have a working  knowledge of English. Further, these officials told us that Afghan  contractors were not always familiar with the business standards and  processes of the U.S. government. For example, one COR told us during  our visit in February 2011 that a unit was still waiting for barriers that it  had contracted for in May 2010. According to that COR, while some of the  barriers had been delivered, the unit had not received all of the barriers it  required even though the contract delivery date had passed. Other CORs,  contracting officials, and commanders described similar situations in  which services were either not provided as anticipated or were not  provided at all. Because of gaps in training, CORs did not always  understand the full scope of their responsibilities and did not always  ensure that the contractor was meeting all contract requirements. As a  result, according to contracting officials, items such as portable toilets,  gates, water, and other items or services were not available when  needed, raising concerns about security, readiness, and morale.", "Contracting officials from over 30 defense organizations and units in  Bagram, Kabul, Kandahar, and Camp Leatherneck whom we spoke with  noted similar problems with construction contracts awarded to Afghan  contractors. For example, according to another COR, an Afghan  contractor was awarded a $70,000 contract to build a latrine, shower, and  sink unit. The COR told us that the contractor was unable to satisfactorily  complete the project and so another contract was awarded for  approximately $130,000 to bring the latrine, shower, and sink unit to a  usable condition. Because of inadequacies in training, CORs did not  always understand that they had the responsibility to ensure that the  terms of the contract were met and therefore did not bring contractors\u2019  performance issues to the contracting officer\u2019s attention for resolution.  Similarly, DOD contracting officials provided us with documentation of  other construction problems, including a shower/toilet facility built without  holes in the walls or floors for plumbing and drain (fig. 1), and facilities  that were constructed with poor-quality materials such as crumbling  cement blocks (fig. 2). The Special Inspector General for Afghanistan  Reconstruction has also reported significant construction deficiencies  related to contracting in Afghanistan, including poorly formed and  crumbling cement structures attributable to the lack of CORs training and  oversight.", "Because of the nature and sensitivity of security contracts, CORs for  private security contractors\u2019 contracts have unique responsibilities. For  example, during the period of our review, under guidance in place prior to  June 2011, CORs were responsible for compiling a monthly weapons  discharge report and for ensuring contractor adherence to contractual  obligations on topics such as civilian arming requirements, personnel  reporting systems, property accountability, and identification badges.  According to a senior military officer with U.S. Forces Afghanistan\u2019s  private security contractor task force, because of gaps in training, CORs  did not always understand the full scope of their responsibilities and so  did not always ensure that a contractor was meeting all contract  requirements. He noted that CORs did not always understand that they  had the responsibility to ensure that the terms of the contract were met  and therefore did not bring contractors\u2019 performance issues to the  contracting officer\u2019s attention for resolution. As a result, DOD may pay  contractors for poor performance and installations might not receive the  level of security contracted for.", "Further, we found that the training programs lacked specifics on the  preparation of statements of work or documents required for acquisition  review boards\u2014two contract management responsibilities that CORs in  Afghanistan were routinely tasked to do. Although the development of a  statement of work involves a variety of participants from the contracting  process, a COR may be uniquely suited to have an early impact on the  development of a complete and accurate statement of work. The Defense  Contingency Contracting Officer\u2019s Representative Handbook describes  statements of work as specifying the basic top-level objectives of the  acquisition as well as the detailed requirements of the government. The  statement of work can provide the contractor with \u201chow to\u201d instructions to  accomplish the required work. It could provide a detailed description of  what is expected of the contractor and forms part of the basis for  successful performance by the contractor and effective oversight of  contracts by the government. Well-written statements of work are needed  to ensure that units get the services and goods needed in the required  time frame. As we reported in 2000 and 2004, poorly written statements  of work can also increase costs and the number of substandard supplies  and services provided by the contractor. Based on discussions with  contracting personnel from four major bases in Afghanistan responsible  for reviewing these documents, statements of work prepared by CORs  were vague and lacked the specifics needed to provide units with what  they wanted. We were told by multiple DOD officials that some CORs  routinely cut and paste information from previous statements of work into  their current document without adapting it as needed, resulting in errors  that have to be corrected and further extending the time involved in  procuring a good or service. Contracting personnel told us of instances in  which statements of work had to be rewritten because the original  statements of work did not include all the required contractor actions, or  because they included incorrect requirements. Although there are other  DOD contracting personnel involved in the requirement and procurement  process, CORs can help to ensure that well-articulated needs are more  fully documented at an early stage. DOD contracting personnel  responsible for reviewing and approving requests for contract support told  us that poorly written statements of work were a principal reason units do  not receive the operational contract support they need for sustaining  military operations. Because of gaps in training, CORs were unable to  prepare well-articulated statements of work that clearly define the  warfighters\u2019 needs. For example, DOD contracting personnel told us  about a dining facility in Afghanistan that was built without a kitchen  because it was not included in the original statement of work, resulting in  DOD having to generate a separate statement of work for the kitchen.  According to contracting officials and commanders, poorly written  statements of work increase the procurement process time, the workload  burden on the DOD contracting personnel, and delays and disruptions in  critical supplies and services needed for the mission.", "Moreover, according to DOD, one of the acquisition review boards in  Afghanistan, known as the Joint Acquisition Review Board, reviews and  recommends approval or disapproval of proposed acquisitions to ensure  efficiency and cost effectiveness. DOD contracting personnel  responsible for reviewing acquisition proposals told us that delays and  disruptions in supplies and services needed by the unit have been  attributed to incomplete or incorrect documents, such as statements of  work. Since CORs in Afghanistan are heavily relied upon by their units  and the acquisition personnel in the development of these documents, it  is important that they understand what paperwork is required and how to  properly complete it in order to obtain needed goods and services in a  timely manner. Contracting officials acknowledge the challenges with  preparing complete/correct statements of work and DOD is making some  effort to address the gaps in training. For example, the Defense  Acquisition University provides a training course on preparing  requirements documents such as statements of work; however, it is not a  DOD requirement for CORs and contracting personnel to complete this  training before assuming their contract-related roles and responsibilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Not All CORs Receive Required Training", "paragraphs": ["DOD contracting personnel and CORs in Afghanistan told us that the  CENTCOM Joint Theater Support Contracting Command contracting  officers were frequently unable to provide the required contract-specific  training (Phase II) for CORs because they were busy awarding contracts.  For instance, a COR whom we interviewed in Afghanistan was directing a  contractor to perform construction work or correct deficiencies in  performance without authorization from or communication with the  contracting officer. Because the COR had never received the required  training from the contracting officer, he was not aware that this practice  was potentially unauthorized. Without the follow-on Phase II training from  the contracting officer, CORs may lack a clear and full understanding of  the scope of their contract duties and responsibilities. In contrast, DCMA\u2019s  contracting personnel provide specific contract training and mentoring to  its CORs because DCMA has full-time quality assurance personnel who  have been tasked with providing COR training and assistance. According  to DCMA officials, certified quality assurance representatives continue to  mentor CORs after their formal training has been completed.", "Moreover, in addition to CORs, other personnel expected to perform  contract oversight and management duties in Afghanistan are not always  being trained. Joint Publication 4-10 states that military departments are  responsible for ensuring that military personnel outside the acquisition  workforce who are expected to have acquisition responsibility, including  oversight duties associated with contracts or contractors are properly  trained. The Joint Publication also highlights the key role of  commanders and senior leaders in operational contract support oversight.  However, contracting personnel that we interviewed in Afghanistan told  us that military personnel such as commanders and senior leaders did not  always receive training on their contract management and oversight  duties in Afghanistan and that commanders, particularly those in combat  units, do not perceive operational contract support as a warfighter task.", "Although some contracting-related training is available for commanders  and senior leaders, it is not required before deployment. DOD has not  expanded the professional military education curriculum by increasing the  number of training offerings on operational contract support with a  particular emphasis on contingency operations to fully institutionalize  operational contract support in professional military education. Based on  our previous findings, it is essential that commanders and senior leaders  complete operational contract support training before deployment to avoid  confusion regarding their contract role and responsibilities in managing  and overseeing contractors, and nominating qualified CORs. In 2006, we  recommended that operational contract support training be included in the  professional military education to ensure that all military personnel  expected to perform contract management duties, including commanders  and senior leaders, receive training prior to deployment. DOD has taken  some actions to implement this recommendation by developing some  Programs of Instruction on contingency acquisition for their non- acquisition workforce to be taught at some of the military and senior staff  colleges.

Further, the Contracting Officer\u2019s  Representative Handbook notes that CORs should have technical  expertise related to the requirements covered by the contract.", "However, according to CORs and contracting personnel we interviewed in  Afghanistan, CORs did not have the subject area-related technical  expertise necessary to monitor contract performance for the contracts  they were assigned to oversee. For example, many of these CORs were  appointed to oversee construction contracts without the necessary  engineering or construction experience, in part because their units lacked  personnel with those technical skills. While DCMA had subject matter  experts in key areas such as fire safety available for CORs needing  technical assistance, CORs for contracts written by the CENTCOM Joint  Theater Support Contracting Command did not have subject matter  experts to turn to for assistance, particularly in the construction trades  during the time of our visit. As a result, according to officials, there were  newly constructed buildings that had to be repaired or rebuilt before being  used by U.S. and Afghan troops because the CORs providing the  oversight were not able to adequately ensure proper construction.  According to personnel we interviewed, these practices resulted in  wasted resources, low morale, and risks to the safety of base and  installation personnel where the deficient guard towers, fire stations, and  gates were constructed. Officials stated that it is not uncommon for a  COR to accept a portion of the contractor\u2019s work only to find later upon  further examination that the work was not in accordance with the contract  and substandard. Similarly, officials stated that the LOGCAP personnel  did not accept responsibility for maintenance of a facility that had been  constructed by Afghan contractors until LOGCAP contractors first  repaired or replaced wiring and plumbing to meet building codes.  Although the CORs were not solely responsible for contract oversight, or  for the implications identified above, they could have provided an early  verification of contractor performance. More importantly, in the  Afghanistan contracting environment the DOD contracting personnel  ultimately responsible for oversight\u2014such as contracting officers\u2014were  often removed or absent from the remote locations where the work was  performed and had no ability to communicate electronically. This results  in greater reliance on CORs and reduces the opportunity for CORs to  identify problems early in the process. The following were cases that  further illustrate the impact of CORs not having the technical skills or  support needed to perform contract management and oversight. Although  the CORs did not necessarily bear the sole responsibility for  consequences identified below, a well-trained COR might have been able  to prevent or mitigate the effects of the problems.", "According to officials, a COR prepared a statement of work for a  contract to build floors and install tents but failed to include any power  requirements necessary to run air conditioners, heaters, and lights  because the COR and unit personnel did not have the electrical  technical expertise to properly and safely specify the correct power  converter package with the original request. Thus, the tents were  unusable until the unit used a field ordering officer to order, at an  additional cost, the correct power converters so that the tents were  usable and completed in a timely fashion.", "Contracting officials told us that guard towers at a forward operating  base were poorly constructed and unsafe to occupy. As shown in  figure 3, the staircase was unstable and not strong enough for  climbing; it had to be torn down and reconstructed.

The COR did  not have the subject area-related technical expertise or access to  subject matter experts necessary to properly inspect and reject  substandard cement block walls. For example, the contracting official  noted large holes in a cement block wall that remained after the wood  scaffolding was removed, which rendered the wall unstable (fig. 4).", "A dining facility expected to service 1,000 military personnel was  unused for a year due to emergent construction deficiencies such as  electrical and plumbing issues. Contracting officials attributed the  construction issues to the shortage of oversight personnel with subject  area-related technical expertise or access to subject matter experts in  construction. As a result, according to contracting personnel, repair  work to correct the deficiencies was acquired under LOGCAP for  $190,000 in addition to the original cost of the contract.", "The issue of CORs not having adequate subject area-related technical  expertise has been a longstanding problem in DOD. For example, we  have previously reported in 2006, 2008, and again in 2010 that CORs do  not always have the subject area-related technical expertise necessary to  oversee contracts. More recently in November and August 2011, the  Congressional Research Service and the Commission on Wartime  Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan reported that DOD is still in need of  non-acquisition personnel with the necessary technical and subject matter  expertise to perform contractor oversight, respectively. The Special  Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction has also reported  significant construction deficiencies with contracting in Afghanistan as a  result of inadequate subject area-related technical expertise on the part of  CORs and other contract oversight personnel. Problem areas identified  by the Inspector General included low-quality concrete (similar to  conditions depicted in fig. 2 and fig. 4) and inadequate roofing  installations, which were similar to other deficiencies we identified.", "Further, based on DOD documentation, the nature of contract work in  Afghanistan has become more technical and complex, increasing the  number of CORs needed, the amount of time needed to award contracts,  and the number of errors during the early stages of the contracting  process (e.g., the requirements determination process). Due to the  complexity of construction projects in Afghanistan, DOD established an  initiative in April 2011 to assign construction inspectors to assist CORs in  managing and overseeing construction projects. According to a DOD  memorandum, contracting officers should appoint construction  inspectors, in addition to CORs, when the nature of the project requires  technical assistance to ensure proper performance of work and when  such assistance is available. Because this program was not in effect  during the time of our visit in February 2011, we are unable to assess the  effectiveness of the use of construction inspectors. However, based on  our observations in Afghanistan, there is a shortage of subject area- related technical experts that can serve as construction inspectors in  Afghanistan. CORs and other personnel that we interviewed in  Afghanistan acknowledged the benefit of having subject matter experts in  construction as well as other specialty areas such as food-, fuel-, and  electricity-related services."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Number of CORs Is Not Sufficient to Adequately Oversee the Contracts in Afghanistan", "paragraphs": ["DOD does not have a sufficient number of CORs to oversee the  numerous contracts in Afghanistan and, according to some government  officials, there are not enough CORs in theatre to conduct adequate  oversight. The CENTCOM Joint Theater Support Contracting Command  requires the nomination of CORs for all service contracts worth over  $2,500 with significant technical requirements that require on-going  advice and surveillance from technical or requirements personnel, unless  exempted by the contracting officer. Although there is no specific  guidance on the number of contracts a single COR should manage, the  CENTCOM Joint Theater Support Contracting Command requires that  CORs nominations signed by the unit commander contain a statement  verifying that the CORs will have sufficient time to perform assigned  tasks. Similarly, the Defense Contingency Contracting Officer\u2019s  Representative Handbook states that the requiring unit must allow  adequate resources (time, products, equipment, and opportunity) for the  CORs to perform their functions. In 2004, 2006, and again in 2010, we  reported that the DOD did not have a sufficient number of trained  oversight personnel, and during the course of our review we noted that  this situation persisted. Further, we found that CORs do not always have  the time needed to complete their oversight responsibilities. While  available data do not enable us to determine the precise number of  contracts that require CORs, in fiscal year 2011, DOD completed over  35,000 contracting actions on over 24,600 contracts and orders that were  executed primarily in Afghanistan.CORs we interviewed in Afghanistan, some CORs are responsible for  providing oversight to multiple contracts in addition to performing their  primary military duty. For example, one COR we interviewed was  assigned to more than a dozen construction projects. According to the  COR, it was impossible to be at each construction site during key phases  of the project, such as for the concrete pouring of building footings, wiring  installation, or plumbing. Consequently, according to contracting officials,  construction on these multiple projects was completed without sufficient  government oversight and problems were not always identified until the  building was completed. This often resulted in significant rework, at a cost  to the U.S. taxpayer.", "According to contracting officials and  In another instance, an entire compound of five buildings was built in the  wrong location. According to DOD, based on the statement of work, the  compound should have been constructed on base behind the security  walls but instead was constructed outside the perimeter of the base in a  non-secure location. Contracting officials we spoke with in Afghanistan  attributed the problem to the numerous contracts managed by the COR  and the lack of time to perform contract oversight duties. As a result,  according to officials, the buildings (shown in fig. 5) could not be used.  The cost of the compound including the five buildings was $2.4 million.", "In addition, in some cases units did not assign enough CORs to provide  oversight. For example, we were told by one unit that it did not have a  sufficient number of CORs to provide proper oversight of dining facility  services, including ordering and inspecting food and supplies. Although  the unit was able to provide one COR for each dining facility, the dining  facilities operate 24 hours a day. Contracting officials expressed concern  that there were not enough CORs to provide sufficient oversight of the  dining facilities 24 hours a day during all shifts of operation."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["DOD and the services have taken some steps, such as developing a new  CORs training course with a focus on contingency operations to improve  oversight of contracts in contingency operations, such as in Afghanistan;  other more general efforts, such as the COR certification program for  services\u2019 acquisitions, may also lead to improvement. However, in our  work in Afghanistan we found that CORs are still not fully prepared to  oversee the multitude of contracts for which they are assigned, potentially  resulting in a significant waste of taxpayer dollars and an increased risk to  the success of operations. The current mechanism for training CORs that  also perform duties related to the requirements determination process  and to the development of requirements documentation continues to have  weaknesses because DOD has not yet developed training standards to  ensure that these personnel fully understand Joint Operational Area  specific issues such as the Afghan First program, the Counterinsurgency  Contracting Guidance, and the details on the preparation of statements of  work and documents required by the contract review boards. As noted in  an Army Contracting Command publication, what contracting  organizations do and how they do it cannot be foreign to the warfighter.  Military personnel such as commanders, senior leaders, CORs, and other  personnel expected to have a role in operational contract support are  often not familiar with their contract roles and responsibilities until they  reach theater because DOD has not sufficiently expanded the  professional military education curriculum and provided more training on  contract support with a particular emphasis on contingency operations.  Further, having an insufficient number of CORs with the appropriate  subject area-related technical expertise or access to dedicated subject  matter experts in specialty areas hinders DOD\u2019s ability to ensure that  operational units obtain vital supplies and services when needed.  Moreover, contract management and oversight has become more  challenging due to a shortage of oversight personnel, an increase in the  number of contracts, a high personnel turnover rate, training burden  challenges, and an increase in the complexity of the work contracted. All  of these have resulted in delays and errors in the procurement process.  Further, as a result of these workload constraints, military personnel  serving as CORs are limited in the number of contracts that they can  reasonably manage and oversee considering the technical nature and  complexity of each contract. Given DOD\u2019s heavy reliance on contractors  during operations in Afghanistan and given the unpredictability of  potential future contingencies, it is critical that DOD address these  challenges as soon as possible to mitigate the risk to the success of  operations, to obtain reasonable assurance that contractors are meeting  their contract requirements and that troops are getting what they need to  support contingency operations, and to help ensure that tax dollars are  not being wasted."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To provide for improved oversight of operational contract support, we are  recommending that DOD enhance the current strategy for providing  contract management and oversight in Afghanistan and other areas of  operations.

DOD stated that  CENTCOM has identified COR training in its pre-deployment requirement  for units and personnel being deployed to Afghanistan, referring to  fragmentary order 09-1700, which lists theater training requirements for  forces deploying to the CENTCOM area of responsibility. Although the  fragmentary order identifies COR training as a training requirement for  certain personnel, the wording in this order lacks the specificity to  adequately prepare CORs for contract support in Afghanistan. For  example, the fragmentary order does not require that CORs be trained on  how to use the Afghan First Program and the Counterinsurgency  Contracting Guidance and on how to prepare the statements of work and  other documents required by the contract review boards. DOD further  stated that CENTCOM reviewed and updated pre-deployment training  requirements during a conference in early January 2012, but did not  provide any specific information on what those updates entailed. DOD  also stated that the COR training requirement will remain as required pre- deployment training and that an updated version of the pre-deployment  requirement will be finalized and released no later than April 2012.  Because DOD did not provide any specific details on what, if any,  changes to training requirements will be included in its April 2012 update,  we are unable evaluate the extent to which DOD\u2019s proposed actions  would address our recommendations.", "DOD concurred with our recommendation that the Secretary of Defense  direct the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretaries of the  military departments to fully institutionalize OCS in professional military  education by increasing the number of training offerings with a particular  emphasis on contingency operations to ensure that CORs, commanders,  senior leaders, and other personnel expected to perform OCS duties are  prepared to do so. DOD stated that the Deputy Assistant Secretary of  Defense for Program Support in the Office of the Under Secretary of  Defense for Acquisition, Technology and Logistics and the Director of  Logistics in the Joint Staff are currently engaged in a study to develop a  strategy for OCS professional military education and that DOD recognizes  the need for a holistic view of the entire OCS education requirement.  DOD said it will assess existing professional military education to  recommend OCS learning objectives for appropriate places in existing  curricula. Additionally, DOD stated that the Army has recently taken major  steps to improve training for commanders, senior leaders, and personnel  expected to perform OCS duties. However, DOD did not describe what  specific steps DOD has taken to fully institutionalize OCS in professional  military education. Further, while it is commendable that DOD is  developing a strategy for the OCS professional military education, DOD  did not indicate when its strategy would be completed.
