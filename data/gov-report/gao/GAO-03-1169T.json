Generally speaking,  e-government refers to the use of information technology (IT),  including Web-based Internet applications, to enhance the access to  and delivery of government information and service to citizens,  business partners, and employees, and to improve the internal  efficiency and effectiveness of the federal government. A variety of  actions have been taken in recent years to enhance the  government\u2019s ability to realize the potential of e-government,  culminating in the enactment of the E-Government Act of 2002,  which includes provisions to promote the use of the Internet to  provide government services electronically, strengthen agency  information security, and manage the federal government\u2019s growing  IT human capital needs.", "The President has embraced e-government as one of five priorities  in his management agenda for making the federal government more  focused on citizens and results. Under the leadership of the Office of  Management and Budget (OMB), a set of high-profile initiatives was  identified to lead the drive toward e-government transformation.  These initiatives\u2014now numbering 25\u2014have ambitious goals,  including eliminating redundant, nonintegrated business operations  and systems and improving service to citizens by an order of  magnitude. Achieving these results, according to OMB, could  produce billions of dollars in savings from improved operational  efficiency. However, to realize such savings, it will be critically  important that these initiatives are well managed as the government  undertakes the challenging task of turning good ideas into real- world results.", "OPM, the President\u2019s agent and advisor for human capital matters, is  charged with overseeing the management of the federal  government\u2019s most important asset\u2014its people.

To support that priority, a task force, led  by OMB, was established in 2001 and charged with identifying  electronic government projects that could deliver significant  productivity and performance gains across government. The task  force analyzed the federal bureaucracy and identified areas of  significant overlap and redundancy in how federal agencies  provided services to the public. The task force found that multiple  agencies were conducting redundant operations within 30 major  functions and business lines in the executive branch. To address  these redundancies, the task force evaluated potential projects,  focusing on collaborative opportunities to integrate IT operations  and simplify processes within lines of business across agencies and  around citizen needs. As a result of this assessment, the task force  identified a set of high-profile e-government initiatives for  accelerated near-term implementation. These are now the 25 OMB- sponsored initiatives.", "The President\u2019s management agenda outlined the following results  expected as a result of e-government: provide high-quality customer services regardless of whether the  citizen contacts the agency by phone, in person, or on the Web;  reduce the expense and difficulty of doing business with the  government; cut government operating costs; provide citizens with readier access to government services;  increase access for persons with disabilities to agency Web sites and  e-government applications; and make government more transparent and accountable.", "OMB also established a portfolio management structure to help  oversee and guide the initiatives and facilitate a collaborative  working environment for each of them. This structure includes five  portfolios: \u201cgovernment to citizen,\u201d \u201cgovernment to business,\u201d  \u201cgovernment to government,\u201d \u201cinternal efficiency and effectiveness,\u201d  and \u201ccross-cutting.\u201d Each of the 25 initiatives is assigned to one of  these portfolios, according to the type of results the initiative is  intended to provide. Further, for each initiative, OMB designated a  specific agency to be the initiative\u2019s \u201cmanaging partner,\u201d responsible  for leading the initiative, and assigned other federal agencies as  \u201cpartners\u201d in carrying out the initiative. OPM was designated the  managing partner for five initiatives\u2014Recruitment One-Stop, which  is to provide a consolidated Web site for federal job applicants;  e-Clearance, which seeks to improve the process of granting  security clearances; Enterprise Human Resources Integration,  which is to replace paper personnel files with electronic records;  e-Training, which is to provide Internet-based training for federal  employees; and e-Payroll, which seeks to consolidate federal payroll  systems. The five initiatives are all part of the internal efficiency and  effectiveness portfolio.", "In developing this testimony, our objectives were to describe the  progress of the five e-government initiatives being managed by OPM  and identify key challenges associated with implementing them  successfully. To address these objectives, we analyzed relevant  documentation from OPM and interviewed project officials from  each of the initiatives. To assess progress to date and identify major  challenges to implementing the initiatives, we analyzed the reported  accomplishments and planned activities of the projects and  compared them with information provided in the initiatives\u2019 original  business cases.

Although we have not evaluated its  claim, OPM asserts that its e-government projects will save  approximately $2.6 billion over the life of the initiatives. These  savings are expected to derive not only from eliminating duplicative  personnel systems, such as payroll systems, but also from such  process improvements as reducing the amount of time it takes to  obtain a security clearance and streamlining the way in which  training is administered.

Full implementation of Recruitment  One-Stop is expected to benefit citizens by providing a more  efficient process for locating and applying for federal jobs, and to  assist federal agencies in hiring top talent in a competitive  marketplace. As we have previously reported, automation has the  potential to provide a variety of benefits in streamlining the hiring of  new employees. The specific objectives of Recruitment One-Stop  that will benefit federal job applicants include a single portal advertising federal job opportunities that supports  searching for jobs by type, location, salary, or level of experience; a  standard method for applying for federal positions that provides  immediate feedback on basic eligibility; and basic eligibility  screening that addresses issues such as citizenship, age, and special  occupational requirements, such as the need to carry firearms; standardized vacancy announcements with additional detailed  information available via electronic \u201chyperlinks\u201d;  tools to build and store an on-line resume, including a resume  template covering all information normally needed to make basic  qualifications and eligibility determinations; and   the ability to check on the status of federal job applications by  accessing basic information such as closing and/or cancellation  dates, dates of candidate referral, and points of selection.", "In addition, agencies are expected to be able to search and review  the resumes of consenting applicants in the USAJOBS database, a  process called applicant database mining. This feature will assist  agencies in locating candidates for hard-to-fill positions by capturing  \u201cpassive\u201d job seekers who have resumes on file, but who may not  have thought of looking for opportunities within a particular agency,  job field, or location.", "To date, the Recruitment One-Stop initiative has met several  planned milestones, including implementing enhancements to the  previously existing www.usajobs.opm.gov Web site in August 2003,  such as a resume builder to assist job applicants in developing up to  five versions of their resume with which to apply for federal jobs,  and a basic application status tracking tool to assist applicants in  finding the status of their federal applications. By the end of this  month, OPM plans to have all executive branch agencies using the  Web site to advertise their jobs. By December 2003, it intends to  begin working with agencies to shut down agency-unique job search  engines and resume builders.", "OPM has continued development of the enhanced USAJOBS Web  site despite a successful bid protest against its contract award for  implementing the enhancements. On January 16, 2003, OPM  awarded a contract to TMP Worldwide, Inc., to support  enhancements to the Web site. However, on January 24, 2003, a  competing vendor, Symplicity Corporation, protested the award. We  sustained Symplicity\u2019s protest on April 29, 2003, based on a  determination that OPM did not exercise certain necessary  evaluative controls in its review of the bids before awarding the  contract, resulting in errors in the bidding process that created an  unfair competitive environment. For example, we found that OPM  did not perform an analysis of whether the quoted services, labor  categories, and other direct costs included in TMP\u2019s quotation were  within the scope of TMP\u2019s approved GSA contract schedule. Based  on this finding, we recommended that OPM reopen discussions with  all vendors whose quotations were competitive and request and  reevaluate revised quotations. However, on July 21, 2003, OPM  informed us that it would not reopen discussions with vendors,  citing as one of its reasons the need to complete the system \u201cwithin  the government\u2019s required time frame.\u201d On August 5, 2003, we  submitted a report to Congress summarizing the protest decisions  and the circumstances of the failure of OPM to implement our  recommendation.", "OPM is planning to measure the performance of the enhanced Web  site and features with metrics such as cost per hire, time to fill  vacancies, and the percentage of federal job applicants using  Recruitment One-Stop. OPM expects that once Recruitment One- Stop is fully implemented, it will generate a total of $365 million in  savings through fiscal year 2012. According to project officials, the  expected cost savings were extrapolated from projected average  annual decreases in the cost of hiring each new federal employee.  By fiscal year 2005, OPM\u2019s goal is to reduce the cost per hire from  $2,790 to $2,678, reduce the time to fill job vacancies from 102 days  to 97, and increase the percentage of job applicants using  Recruitment One-Stop from 80 to 84 percent.", "The e-Clearance project is designed to improve processing of  security clearances for federal employees. It focuses on  consolidating and increasing access to information to improve the  efficiency of granting or locating previous clearances or  investigations. OPM intends the e-Clearance project to help  streamline data collection and case scheduling by making it easier  to locate existing investigations and clearances, providing for almost  immediate retrieval of archived records as they are needed. The  expected benefits include quicker granting of clearances,  elimination of redundant investigations, and financial savings from a  reduction in the overall costs of clearances. The initiative consists of  three modules:", "Electronic Questionnaires for Investigations Processing involves  the automation of the Questionnaire for National Security Positions  (Standard Form 86). This paper-based form requires at least 2 hours  to complete, and some federal employees are required to fill it out as  often as every few months to maintain their security clearances.  Since the current form is processed manually, it must be completed  each time from scratch. In contrast, the electronic version of the  form will be populated with previously submitted data, thereby  streamlining the application process. In addition, a new form has  been deployed that allows federal employees to indicate that there  have been no changes in the data provided on the most recently  filed Standard Form 86, or, where there are changes, to provide only  the newly changed information.", "Clearance Verification System consists of the development and  implementation of a cross-agency system to enable a single search  to locate investigative and clearance information from any agency.  This module requires civilian agencies to load their existing  clearance information into OPM\u2019s Security/Suitability Investigations  Index so that new clearance applications can be checked against  existing information. The module also includes developing a link to  the Department of Defense\u2019s Joint Personnel Adjudication System to  access comparable DOD information.", "Imaging includes the creation, storage, and retrieval of digital  images of investigative reports and other documents. Often, the  longest delay in an investigation can be the retrieval, copying, and  mailing of previous reports.

Release 3 is planned to incorporate  interfaces between OPM\u2019s Retirement System Modernization system  and e-Training and to allow two-way electronic transfer of personnel  data between agencies. The system functionality is to be  incrementally available between March and September 2004.", "OPM plans to improve performance for fiscal year 2004 in areas  such as personnel management, savings and cost avoidance, and  data reliability and quality. For example, it intends to alter  regulations, executive orders, and laws to enable the conversion of  records to an electronic format. Another planned measure involves  eliminating the need for agencies to develop new human capital  management capabilities. Other measures include a reduction in the  baseline data error rate and participation by 9 of the 18 partner  agencies in electronic workforce forecasting. OPM reported that  EHRI would save taxpayers around $235 million through fiscal year  2012.", "The purpose of the e-Training initiative is to create a government- wide e-Training environment\u2014the Gov On-line Learning Center  (www.golearn.gov)\u2014which is to support the development of the  federal workforce and provide a single source for on-line training  and strategic human capital development for all federal employees.  The Gov On-line Learning Center is designed to provide users access  to a broad range of products and services, including mandatory  government-wide training on topics such as computer security,  ethics, and preventing sexual harassment, as well as agency-specific  training and high-interest topics, such as homeland security. Some  of the courses are to be free, while others are to be available on a  fee-for-service basis.", "OPM also plans for the GoLearn Web site to provide tools that will  allow human capital specialists and employees to match an  employee\u2019s professional and individual development to available  courses and services. OPM expects that its initiative will allow  agencies to focus their own training efforts on unique needs, thus  maximizing the effectiveness of their expenditures on workforce  performance. Providing agencies with on-demand e-learning  services is expected to enable the government to better attract,  retain, manage, and continuously educate the highly skilled  professionals needed for a flexible and high-performing government  workforce.", "The e-Training initiative is intended to benefit the government and  federal workforce by encouraging e-training investments as part of a systematic and  continuous development of federal government human capital;   reducing redundancies in the development and purchase of  e-training content; achieving economies of scale through consolidated purchasing; offering easy, one-stop access to a robust, high quality e-training  leveraging components of existing e-training systems.", "The e-Training Initiative is composed of three developmental  modules. Module 1, launched in July 2002, included 37 free  commercial off-the-shelf training courses (on topics such as project  management, prevention of sexual harassment, using Microsoft  Excel spreadsheet software, and change management); \u201cSearch and  Select,\u201d a set of quick 5 to 7 minute learning segments; and \u201cE- Books,\u201d a collection of over 100 professional journals and books.  Module 2, launched in January 2003, added access to additional free  commercial and government courses, fee-for-service options for  e-training products and services, enhanced registration and  reporting, and blended learning options for law enforcement  training and executive and management training. Finally, Module 3,  originally scheduled for June 2003, recently became operational.  OPM states that this module will include a Merit Systems Principles  e-course, as well as competency-based workforce development  roadmaps specifically for IT workforce occupations. According to  OPM, future releases of the Gov Online Learning Center will move  from providing content to facilitation of learning. The agency also  plans to introduce knowledge domains, user communities of  practice, and virtual collaboration tools.", "OPM estimated that e-Training would save taxpayers about $784  million through 2012. These savings are expected from the lower  cost associated with providing on-line training, such as savings  resulting from less travel. OPM expects to have 30 customized Web  sites in operation for fiscal year 2004. Its goal is to have 77,000  courses completed and 48 sites developed. It is planning to measure  performance of the e-Training initiative through indicators such as  the number of eligible GoLearn users, the number of participating  entities, the number of GoLearn courses completed and the number  of custom sites.

The first major project deliverable\u2014 establishing governance\u2014was completed in April 2002 as  scheduled. OPM chose four agencies to be providers of payroll  services to all 116 executive branch agencies. The four selected  providers are the General Services Administration (GSA) and the  Departments of Defense, Interior, and Agriculture. The initiative is  divided into two major phases: migrating each of the 18 nonselected payroll system providers to  one of the four selected providers by September 2004, and merging the functions of the four selected payroll providers into just  two, while working to develop a single, integrated payroll system for  all executive branch agencies.", "Although providers have been selected and a migration schedule  established for nonselected agencies, other actions have been  delayed. Standardization of policies, originally scheduled for  completion in July 2002, is currently ongoing. The enterprise  architecture planning task and the initial phase of agency  consolidations were both scheduled to begin in October 2002 but  were not initiated until January 2003. According to the project  manager, these schedule deviations have not led to a significant  delay in the overall progress of the initiative toward the original goal  of consolidating the 22 payroll providers to 4 by September 2004.", "OPM reported that e-Payroll should save $1.1 billion through fiscal  year 2012. These savings would result from reducing operating  costs, eliminating duplicative systems investments, and simplifying  payroll processing. OPM plans to use several indicators to measure  performance and improvements regarding e-Payroll for fiscal year  2005, including reductions in payroll costs per W-2 per employee,  improvements in the accuracy of Treasury disbursements, and  reductions in response time. Currently, the cost of payroll services  per W-2 per employee can vary from $125 to $225. OPM\u2019s plan is to  lower these costs to $97.

The major factor in this decision was  the perceived need to make the planned gateway fully operational as  soon as possible. However, this accelerated schedule may be  difficult to achieve because it is based on an extremely short time  frame, in which the selected contractor must develop, test, and  deploy a fully operational gateway.", "In the case of the Geospatial One-Stop initiative, which aims to  establish a Web portal for locating and disseminating geospatial  information, the initiative\u2019s board of directors decided in early 2003  to make an award based on an unsolicited proposal rather than  continue a competitive procurement, largely because of a perceived  need to implement the Web portal as quickly as possible. The  change in acquisition plans has caused concern among many in the  geospatial information systems community that the contractor\u2019s  proprietary approach to developing the Web portal could make it  difficult for many potential contributors to share data with the  portal\u2014which would prevent the initiative from meeting its goal of  providing one-stop access to geospatial data.", "OPM has likewise taken a controversial step with its recent  Recruitment One-Stop acquisition. In its decision to continue with  its awarded contract for Recruitment One-Stop, despite a successful  bid protest by Symplicity Corporation, OPM officials perceived the  need to implement an e-government initiative as quickly as possible  to be one factor outweighing the importance of issues that we raised  concerning the conduct of the procurement. In its letter to us  explaining why it intended to proceed without implementing our  recommendation, OPM made clear that it was concerned about  implementing Recruitment One-Stop quickly: \u201cThe [Recruitment  One Stop] program is ready to become operational. National  security demands and critical domestic needs underlie the  Government\u2019s vital need for efficient recruitment and hiring  methods. No other contractor can complete the system within the  Government\u2019s required timeframe.\u201d However, in our report to  Congress, we noted that OPM did not provide any details to support  this claim. While it is important to adhere to agreed-upon schedules  and milestones, it is also important to follow established contracting  procedures, which are intended to ensure fair competition. A rapidly  chosen vendor may not represent the best value for the  government\u2019s investment.", "By leaving questions about the fairness of the Recruitment One-Stop  competition unresolved, OPM risks alienating potential supporters  of its e-government initiative. In order to ensure the ultimate  success of its initiatives, it is important that OPM\u2014as well as the  other managing partners of OMB-sponsored initiatives\u2014carefully  weigh the risks and benefits of making significant changes to its  planned acquisitions solely based on the need to produce results  quickly."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Achieving Governmentwide Consolidation of Common Electronic Functions", "paragraphs": ["Each of OPM\u2019s five initiatives aims to ultimately create a single  system or Web-based service to support a specific human capital  function across the federal government. In each case, agency-unique  systems and processes must be either replaced or integrated into  the planned single system. Clearly, one of OPM\u2019s biggest challenges  is managing the process of migrating agency-unique systems into  consolidated systems and services that are flexible enough to  effectively support the needs of virtually all federal agencies.", "Many current federal human capital systems are based on  proprietary systems that were originally developed for the narrowly  defined needs of a single agency or bureau. These systems were not  designed to be interoperable with external systems, and generally  were not built to government standards (which have not yet been  defined for many human capital functions). The development of  systems based on narrowly defined needs, combined with  traditional barriers to interorganizational cooperation, have led to  the current environment of duplicative, inefficient, nonintegrated  (\u201csiloed\u201d) operations.", "One way to encourage interagency cooperation on multiple systems  migrations is to develop a concerted strategy for managing change  and communicating effectively with all affected parties. In June  2002, OPM submitted to OMB its change management and  communication plan, which specified steps that OPM planned to  take in managing change and communications. In implementing its  plan, OPM established change management councils and delivered  presentations on its plans for specific initiatives, as well as for  governmentwide integration of human capital functions, to a range  of audiences, including high-level officials (such as the  e-Government committee of the President\u2019s Management Council  and the Chief Human Capital Officers Council) and line managers  (such as human resource managers).", "Effective change management and communication will be critical,  as agencies may be required to take positive action to both to shut  down existing redundant systems and invest in new technology to  connect with OPM\u2019s standardized systems. OPM is planning for  agencies to shut down a number of agency-unique systems and  applications. For example, the e-Payroll initiative is set to reduce  federal payroll providers from the current 22 to just two  partnerships of two providers each. Nonselected payroll providers  will be required to shut down operations. Another example is the  Recruitment One-Stop initiative, which envisions that agency on-line  resume building and job search engine capabilities will be shut  down in favor of OPM\u2019s centralized system. The e-Training initiative  also plans for agencies to shut down their unique systems in favor of  OPM\u2019s offering.", "Consolidation may also mean that agencies must make new  investments in order to connect with a new, integrated system. The  e-Clearance initiative, for example, requires all agencies with  archives of clearance investigations to make those materials  available electronically, thus necessitating agency expenses for new  imaging equipment. Likewise, EHRI will require agencies to make  modifications to their systems allowing electronic personnel records  to be transmitted to OPM\u2019s central repository. Getting cooperation  from all affected agencies in making these investments will be  challenging.", "OMB\u2019s support is a critical factor in facilitating these consolidations.  For several e-government initiatives, OMB has used its statutory  authority under the Clinger-Cohen Act of 1996 to direct agencies to  identify and halt funding of potentially redundant IT investments.  For example, OMB issued on January 10, 2003, a letter to federal  agencies directing them to halt spending on agency-specific payroll  modernization efforts not associated with migrating to the e-Payroll  initiative. A similar letter had been issued in April 2002 directing  agencies to load their security clearance information into  e-Clearance\u2019s Clearance Verification System.", "Beyond issues of organizational cooperation, technical integration  can also be very challenging. Developing a common set of standards  that are agreed to and used by all project partners is a key factor for  integrating disparate, noninteroperable systems and services.  Ensuring that processes are in place by which partners can select  and agree upon standards and that all partners are adopting them  are key factors in successfully establishing standards. Finally,  standardization within the framework of the emerging Federal  Enterprise Architecture is key to promoting compliant development  and implementation across the government. OPM officials said they  plan to use the Federal Enterprise Architecture to document  specific data requirements for the human capital functions  supported by their e-government initiatives.", "OPM has taken steps to involve its partners and other federal  agencies in the process of identifying opportunities for  standardization on the e-Payroll initiative. However, it still faces the  challenging task of getting federal agencies to reach agreement on a  single payroll standard that they all can use. As agencies migrate  ultimately to this single standard, changes may need to be made  either to provider payroll processes and standards\u2014so that the  various payroll mandates can be accommodated\u2014or to the  mandated requirements themselves, so that agencies can conform to  the single-payroll standard. For example, the Department of  Veterans Affairs\u2019 Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary for Finance  expressed concern that administering payroll systems under Title 38  of the United States Code\u2014the legislation that governs the  agency\u2019s payroll processes\u2014was very complex, and that significant  changes in payroll processing could be necessary as the agency  migrates to its new payroll provider. According to an OPM study, in  addition to Title 38, there are at least 13 other sets of legislated  federal payroll provisions that will need to be reviewed and  addressed before a single federal payroll system can be  implemented. Without agreement on standards, changes mandated  by OPM may not fully address agencies\u2019 individual payroll  processing requirements, increasing the risk that agencies will not  be able to migrate as planned to the chosen governmentwide  standard.", "OPM may face similar challenges in establishing standards for  official electronic personnel records, as part of EHRI. OPM officials  conducted an exercise to identify all the various types of data  captured by federal personnel forms. OPM officials identified 89  major data categories, with over 500 data elements. OPM officials  recognize the challenge they face in seeking agreement across  federal agencies on standardizing these data elements, a process  which is still in its early stages.", "While it is relatively easy to develop and implement Web sites that  facilitate exchange of information\u2014as some of OPM\u2019s initiatives  do\u2014the agency can expect greater challenges in getting cooperation  across the government to consolidate functions by shutting down  redundant systems, investing in new technologies, and committing  to new governmentwide standards. For several of OPM\u2019s  initiatives\u2014including e-Payroll and EHRI\u2014much of this process still  remains to be completed."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Estimating and Measuring Cost Savings", "paragraphs": ["One of the goals of OMB\u2019s e-government strategy includes achieving  cost savings as an outcome of implementing the 25 e-government  initiatives. For example, in its 2002 strategy OMB estimated that  these initiatives could generate several billion dollars in savings by  reducing operating inefficiencies, redundant spending, and  excessive paperwork, and it also estimated that the initiatives would  make available over $1 billion in savings from realigning redundant  investments. In addition, OMB has stated that the initiatives were  selected for inclusion in the e-government strategy because they  provided the most value to citizens while generating cost savings or  improving the effectiveness of the government.", "OPM has estimated substantial cost savings that officials believe can  be attributed to the e-government initiatives. Specifically, the agency  estimates that the total savings expected from all five of its  e-government initiatives will be more than $2.6 billion through fiscal  year 2012. Such savings would be realized through performance  enhancements that could reduce expenses such as costs per  application for security clearances, costs per transaction for payroll  processing, and costs associated with hiring new federal employees.  Table 3 provides an overview of the cost savings estimated by OPM  for its initiatives.", "OPM faces a significant challenge in realistically estimating the  financial savings to be derived from its e-government initiatives. In  many cases, estimated cost savings associated with process  improvements are only loosely based on measures that are  inherently abstract, such as the average cost of performing a certain  function across the government. For example, e-Training project  officials estimate that federal agencies can reduce training costs  substantially by substituting electronic courses taken through  e-Training\u2014which cost approximately $10 to $15 per training  instance\u2014for traditional courses, which cost on average $150 per  training instance, including travel. However, it is unclear the extent  to which this kind of substitution will actually take place, or how it  could lead to savings of $784 million through 2012, as forecast by  OPM. The e-Training project manager told us that the estimate was  based on cost avoidance for training tuition, travel, and economies  of scale in acquiring training software licenses.", "Similarly, for the Recruitment One-Stop initiative, project officials  predict that implementation will lead to a reduction in the average  cost of hiring a new federal employee of $112 in fiscal year 2005\u2014 from $2,790 to $2,678, or about 4 percent. With about 150,000 new  federal hires each year, the total savings through 2012 would  amount to about $168 million\u2014significantly less than the total cost  savings of $365 million over that period that OPM estimates.  According to OPM officials, the additional savings would be gained  through other factors contributing to future efficiencies, although  specific performance measures had not yet been established.", "OPM\u2019s method for projecting cost savings due to process  improvements may overstate the savings that can be reasonably  attributed to those improvements. Specifically, officials stated that  for at least one initiative, Recruitment One-Stop, estimated savings  included continuing annual efficiency gains due to such things as  expected \u201cpolicy improvements\u201d that would not be a direct result of  implementing the Recruitment One-Stop initiative.", "Further, OPM has not developed mechanisms to track actual  training expenditures at agencies to determine whether its  estimated governmentwide savings are being realized. With  estimated savings based on abstract, average governmentwide costs,  it will likely be very difficult to develop methods for documenting  the savings associated with process streamlining at each agency  across the federal government. In another example, e-Payroll is  planned to reduce the number of federal payroll service providers  from 22 to 4, and then consolidate those 4 to 2. Clearly, cost savings  can be found by reducing the number of payroll systems operated  and maintained by the federal government and avoiding the costs of  updating or modernizing those systems. However, OPM has not  clearly identified all the factors that would contribute to such  savings, or what measures will be used to measure them. Cost  savings from eliminating redundant systems is also a factor\u2014though  a smaller one\u2014in savings projected for Recruitment One-Stop and  e-Training.", "Effectively measuring e-government cost savings is a challenge for  all agencies engaged in efforts to streamline or transform  government processes through e-government. To be truly effective  in meeting the goals set out in OMB\u2019s e-government strategy,  agencies need to establish complete, meaningful, and quantitative  measures of cost savings. Until such measures can be implemented,  predicted cost savings will be difficult to confirm.", "In summary, OPM has made progress in moving forward with its five  e-government initiatives, which, if fully implemented, could have  significant benefits by providing more streamlined and seamless  federal personnel processes, and by saving the taxpayers millions  through eliminating redundant payroll and other systems. However,  OPM continues to face several challenges in implementing and  carrying out its e-government initiatives, including managing  acquisitions while working to meet accelerated e-government  project schedules; consolidating common, governmentwide human  resource-related functions; and realistically estimating and  measuring the cost savings that can be expected from these  initiatives.", "Mr. Chairman, this concludes my statement.
