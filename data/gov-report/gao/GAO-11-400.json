The shift from defined benefit (DB) pension plans to defined contribution (DC) plans also increases the responsibility for workers and retirees to make difficult decisions and manage their pension and other financial assets so that they have income throughout retirement. GAO was asked to review (1) strategies that experts recommend retirees employ to ensure income throughout retirement, (2) choices retirees have made for managing their pension and financial assets for generating income, and (3) policy options available to ensure income throughout retirement and their advantages and disadvantages. GAO interviewed experts about strategies retirees should take, including strategies for five households from different quintiles of net wealth (assets less debt); analyzed nationally representative data and studies about retirees' decisions; and interviewed experts and reviewed documents about related policy options."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Financial experts GAO interviewed typically recommended that retirees systematically draw down their savings and convert a portion of their savings into an income annuity to cover necessary expenses, or opt for the annuity provided by an employer-sponsored DB pension instead of a lump sum withdrawal. Experts also recommended that individuals delay receipt of Social Security benefits until reaching at least full retirement age and, in some cases, continue to work and save, if possible. For example, for the two middle net-wealth households GAO profiled with about $350,000 to $375,000 in net wealth, experts recommended purchase of annuities with a portion of savings, drawdown of savings at an annual rate, such as 4 percent of the initial balance, use of lifetime income from the DB plan, if applicable, and delay of Social Security. To navigate the difficult choices on income throughout retirement, they noted strategies depend on an individual's circumstances, such as anticipated expenses, income level, health, and each household's tolerance for risks, such as investment and longevity risk. Regarding the choices retirees have made, GAO found that most retirees rely primarily on Social Security and pass up opportunities for additional lifetime retirement income. Taking Social Security benefits when they turned 62, many retirees born in 1943, for example, passed up increases of at least 33 percent in their monthly inflation-adjusted Social Security benefit levels available at full retirement age of 66. Most retirees who left jobs with a DB pension received or deferred lifetime benefits, but only 6 percent of those with a DC plan chose or purchased an annuity at retirement. Those in the middle income group who had savings typically drew down those savings gradually. Nonetheless, an estimated 3.4 million people (9 percent) aged 65 or older in 2009 had incomes (excluding any noncash assistance) below the poverty level. Among people of all ages the poverty rate was 14.3 percent. To help people make these often difficult choices, policy options proposed by various groups concerning income throughout retirement include encouraging the availability of annuities in DC plans and promoting financial literacy. Certain proposed policies seek to increase access to annuities in DC plans, which may be able to provide them at lower cost for some individuals. However, some pension plan sponsors are reluctant to offer annuities for fear that their choice of annuity provider could make them vulnerable to litigation should problems occur. Other proposed options aim to improve individuals' financial literacy, especially to better understand risks and available choices for managing income throughout retirement in addition to the current emphasis on saving for retirement. Proposed options include additional federal publications and interactive tools, sponsor notices to plan participants on financial risks and choices they face during retirement, and estimates on lifetime annuity income on participants' benefit statements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["As the life expectancy of U.S. residents continues to increase, the risk that  retirees will outlive their assets is a growing challenge. Today, a husband  and wife both aged 65 have approximately a 47 percent chance that at  least one of them will live to his or her 90th birthday and a 20 percent  chance of living to his or her 95th birthday. In addition to the risk of  outliving one\u2019s assets, the sharp declines in financial markets and home  equity during the last few years and the continued increase in health care  costs have intensified workers\u2019 concerns about having enough savings and  how to best manage those savings in retirement.", "In addition, the shift among employer-sponsored pension plans from  defined benefit (DB) to defined contribution (DC) plans heightens the  responsibility for workers and retirees to manage their pension and other  financial assets so that their assets last throughout retirement.

In DC plans, participants are typically responsible for  investing and assuming investment risk.", "The Department of Labor (Labor) and the Department of the Treasury  (Treasury) regulate employer-sponsored pension plans in the private  sector.

What strategies do experts recommend retirees employ to ensure  income throughout retirement? 2.  What choices have retirees made for managing their pensions and  financial assets for generating income? 3.  What policy options are available to ensure income throughout  retirement and what are their advantages and disadvantages for  retirees?", "To identify the strategies that experts recommend retirees employ to  ensure income throughout retirement, we interviewed a judgmental  sample of a range of financial planners and other financial experts from  different academic and industry organizations and a retiree interest group,  which were from different geographic areas of the country. (See app. I.)  We focused our discussion on five households that we randomly selected  from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) in the lowest, middle, and  highest net wealth quintiles with different combinations of pension plans  in the middle and highest quintiles. See financial and nonfinancial  characteristics by quintile in appendix II, and the selected households\u2019  summary financial data in appendix III. We also reviewed company  specific financial product documentation and studies of retirement income  strategies such as those describing systematic withdrawals from  retirement savings. To review the choices retirees have made for managing  their pension and financial assets for generating income, we analyzed data  from the HRS, reviewed others\u2019 research, and analyzed data from the  Social Security Administration (SSA). We reviewed additional data from  the Employee Benefit Research Institute (EBRI), the Census Bureau and  the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). To identify policy options that are  available to ensure income throughout retirement, as well as their  advantages and disadvantages, we reviewed information from a variety of  academic, consumer, industry, and government sources. This included  selected submissions in response to the Labor and Treasury RFI, other  publications, and interviews with academic, consumer, industry, and  government officials. We conducted this performance audit from January  2010 through June 2011 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards. Those standards require that we plan and  perform the audit to obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a  reasonable basis for our findings and conclusions based on our audit  objectives.

In  aggregate, Social Security is the largest source of retirement income for  households with someone aged 65 or older, but other financial assets such  as pension income from DB and DC plans, private savings, and assets such  as home equity are important sources of retirement income for many.  (See fig. 1.) In 2008, the most recent year for which data were available,  among households with someone aged 55 to 60, the median net wealth for  the middle quintile of net wealth was $339,000. The median household  income for the middle net wealth quintile was about $70,000 in the  preceding year, according to the Health and Retirement Study. (See app.  II.) Earnings from work can be an important source of income for some  households with a member aged 65 or older because, for example, a  spouse younger than 65 may be working. Yet many people aged 65 or older  also work. In 2010, 29.1 percent of people aged 65 to 69 worked at least  part-time and 6.9 percent of people aged 75 or older were employed.", "Social Security benefits provide annually inflation-adjusted income for  life\u2014and in 2008 were on average the source of 64.8 percent of total  income for recipient households with someone aged 65 or older. Under  changes legislated in 1983, the retirement age for an unreduced benefit  (the full retirement age) is gradually increasing from age 65, beginning  with retirees born in 1938, and will reach age 67 for those born in 1960 or  later.", "Despite these changes, the cost of Social Security benefits is projected to  exceed sources of funding, and the program is projected to be unable to  pay a portion of scheduled benefits by 2036. In 2010, for the first time  since 1983, the Social Security trust funds began paying out more in  benefits than they received through payroll tax revenue, although trust  fund interest income more than covers the difference, according to the  2011 report of the Social Security trust funds\u2019 Board of Trustees.  However, changes to Social Security could eliminate or reduce the size of  this projected long-term shortfall.", "At retirement, DB plan participants are eligible for a specified payment for  life (either immediately or deferred, and with or without benefits for a  surviving spouse), but some DB plans also give participants a choice,  sometimes a difficult choice, to forego a lifetime annuity and instead take  a lump sum cash settlement (distribution) or roll over funds to an IRA. DC  participants face a number of difficult choices regarding their account  balances, such as leaving money in the plan, purchasing an annuity, or  transferring or rolling over their balance into an IRA. Employers who  sponsor qualified plans and enable departing participants to receive lump  sum distributions must also give participants the option to have these  amounts directly rolled over into an IRA or another employer\u2019s tax- qualified plan.", "Workers entering retirement today typically face greater responsibilities  for managing their retirement savings than those who retired in the past.  Social Security continues to provide a foundation of inflation-adjusted  income for life, but fewer retirees today have defined benefit plans  providing lifetime income. DC plans have become much more common  and they generally do not offer annuities, so retirees are left with  increasingly important decisions about managing their retirement  savings. Participants in DB plans also face similar decisions when the  plan offers a lump sum option, including not only whether to take the  annuity or lump sum, but decisions about managing these savings if a lump  sum is elected.", "For households with someone aged 65 or older with income from assets,  such as interest and dividends, the estimated median amount of asset  income for households in the third (middle) income quintile was $1,022 in  2008. For those in the highest income quintile the median was $8,050.  Financial assets provide income, but can also provide flexibility to draw  down funds as needed during retirement. For workers with a self-directed  lump sum or other retirement savings, the money can be taken in periodic  distributions for which there are strategies to help reduce the chance that  a retiree does not outlive his or her money. For example, retirees could  draw down a portion of their balance as a form of regular income to  supplement Social Security and possibly DB pension income, investing the  balance of savings in a diversified portfolio of mutual funds containing  equities and fixed income securities.", "An alternative to self-managing periodic distributions from savings is to  use one\u2019s savings to purchase an immediate annuity from an insurance  company that guarantees income for life. An immediate annuity can help  to protect a retiree against the risk of underperforming investments, the  risk of outliving one\u2019s assets (longevity risk) and, when an inflation- adjusted annuity is purchased, the risk of inflation diminishing one\u2019s  purchasing power. Researchers have concluded that annuities have  important benefits. For example, according to one association of  actuaries, it is more efficient to pool the risk of outliving one\u2019s assets than  to self-insure by accumulating enough assets to provide enough income in  case one lives to a very old age. Annuities provide income at a rate that  can help retirees avoid overspending their assets and provide a floor of  guaranteed income to prevent unnecessarily spending too little for fear of  outliving assets, according to one association. Annuities can also relieve  retirees of some of the burden of managing their investments at older ages  when their capacity to do so may diminish, which may also make them  susceptible to fraudulent sales. On the other hand, annuities may be  inappropriate or expensive for people who have predictably shorter-than- normal life expectancies. Likewise, funds used to purchase immediate  annuities are no longer available to cover large unplanned expenses. Also,  immediate annuities that provide for bequests have higher costs.", "There is little consensus about how much income constitutes \u201cenough\u201d  retirement income. Retirement income adequacy may be defined relative  to a standard of minimum needs, such as the poverty rate, or to the level of  spending households experienced during working years. Some economists  and financial advisors consider retirement income adequate if the ratio of  retirement income to preretirement income\u2014called the replacement  rate\u2014is from 65 to 85 percent, although some retirees may need  considerably less or more than this. Typically, however, retirees do not  need to replace 100 percent of preretirement income to maintain living  standards for several reasons. For example, retirees will no longer need to  save for retirement and their payroll and income tax liability will likely fall.  However, some researchers cite uncertainties about health and long-term  care costs as reasons a higher replacement rate may be necessary. Table  1 shows replacement rates from Social Security benefits for low and high  earners retiring in 2011, as well as the remaining amount of preretirement  income from other sources necessary to achieve a 75 percent replacement  rate.", "The Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) is the  primary statute governing private pension plans, including DB and DC  plans. It seeks to protect the interests of employee benefit plan  participants and their beneficiaries. Title I of ERISA, enforced by Labor,  sets standards of conduct and requires accountability for the people who  run or provide investment advice to plans, known as plan fiduciaries, and  requires administrators to provide participants with certain disclosures,  including periodic benefit statements as well as a summary plan  description. Title IV of ERISA created the Pension Benefit Guaranty  Corporation (PBGC) as a U.S. government corporation to provide plan  termination insurance for certain DB pension plans that are unable to pay  promised benefits. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), under Title II of  ERISA, and subsequent amendments to the Internal Revenue Code (the  Code), generally is responsible for ensuring that plans meet certain  requirements for tax qualification and for interpreting rules in Title I of  ERISA regarding participation, vesting, benefit accrual, and minimum  funding. Tax qualification enables employers to make tax-deductible  contributions and the plan to earn interest on a tax-deferred basis. The tax  advantages are intended to encourage employers to establish and maintain  pension plans for their employees and advance other public policy  objectives. For example, certain provisions of the Code set required  minimum distributions from tax-deferred accounts, such as traditional  IRAs and qualified plans, generally by April 1 in the year following the year  in which the account holder reaches age 70 \u00bd. These required minimum  distributions help to ensure that account holders withdraw tax-deferred  savings in retirement rather than accumulate savings for their estate.", "Once an individual withdraws his or her funds from either a DB or DC  plan, a myriad of laws and regulations typically applies, depending on the  investment decisions that the individual makes with those funds. In this  instance, the individual is no longer a plan participant governed by ERISA,  but is now essentially a retail investor governed by the laws and  regulations that are pertinent to the particular product or asset in which  he or she chooses to invest, and whether or not the funds are in an IRA.  The different laws, regulations, and agencies that may come into play vary  depending on the type of assets held.", "Various other federal and state agencies may regulate the investment or  insurance products offered in pension plans or outside of plans on the  retail market. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission  (SEC) regulates mutual funds, which are pooled investments in a portfolio  of securities. In addition, certain types of annuities may be regulated by  states, while other types may also be subject to federal securities laws and  thus regulation by the SEC. For example, the SEC, among others, regulates  variable annuities, including regulation of disclosure and sales practices.  (See app. V on selected retirement income arrangements and products.)  Insurance company annuities are generally regulated by state insurance  departments, which set reserve requirements for the insurance companies  offering annuities. More recently, states are also regulating sales and  marketing practices and policy terms and conditions to ensure that  consumers are treated fairly when they purchase insurance products and  file claims. Although each state has its own insurance regulator and laws,  the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) provides a  national forum for addressing and resolving major insurance issues and  for allowing regulators to develop consistent policies on the regulation of  insurance when consistency is deemed appropriate.", "State guaranty associations protect individuals with annuities up to  specified limits in the event of insurer insolvency. If an insurance company  becomes insolvent, guaranty associations assess solvent insurers to pay  covered claims to affected policyholders.

The drawdown  rate should preserve some liquidity\u2014immediately available funds\u2014in case  of unexpected events such as high medical costs. Such a drawdown  should be part of a larger strategy that includes a certain amount of  lifetime retirement income (such as Social Security, defined benefit, and  annuity income). Drawdowns should be taken from assets invested in a  broadly diversified portfolio comprised of medium exposure to stocks and  the balance in bonds and cash. However, drawing down assets invested in  stocks and bonds was recommended with the caveat that holding stocks  and bonds leaves households exposed to the uncertainty in financial  markets over an unknown number of retirement years.", "The systematic drawdown of financial assets can be based on a \u201csmooth\u201d  and sustainable level of income throughout retirement or on a retiree\u2019s  remaining life expectancy. The smooth drawdown approach takes annual  withdrawals based on assumptions about one\u2019s life expectancy and future  investment return. According to the Congressional Research Service  (CRS), an approach based on a retiree\u2019s remaining life expectancy could  involve withdrawing amounts in light of the retiree\u2019s remaining life  expectancy in the year that a withdrawal occurs. One example, under the  Code, would be required minimum distributions, which help to ensure that  account holders withdraw tax-deferred retirement savings in retirement  rather than for estate planning. The minimum distributions are calculated  based partly on life expectancy.", "The experts we spoke to recommended a smooth systematic drawdown  from retiree investments, but their recommendations varied on the rate of  drawdown, depending on retirees\u2019 acceptance of the risk of running out of  money and the experts\u2019 own assumptions about future investment returns.  For example, those we spoke to recommended annual withdrawals of 3 to  6 percent of the value of the investments in the first year of retirement,  with adjustments for inflation in subsequent years. These rates generally  comport with CRS estimates for assuring a lifelong source of income.", "Using historical rates of investment return on a limited selection of stocks  and bonds, CRS estimated that a drawdown rate of 4 percent on an  investment portfolio with 35 percent U.S. stocks and 65 percent in  corporate bonds would be 89.4 percent likely to last 35 years or more.  (See additional probabilities from the CRS estimates in table 3.)  Importantly, drawdown rates identified by CRS are based on historical  rates of return, and there is no assurance that future investment returns  will match historical returns.", "According to the experts we spoke to and literature we reviewed, another  factor that can affect the success of drawdown strategies is the sequence  of investment returns: if the drawdowns begin after the value of the  investments has declined, the income drawn would deplete a greater  proportion of the investments than if growth had occurred before the  income were drawn. If, for example, annual investment returns on  retirement savings are up 7 percent in the first year, then down 13 percent  in the following year, and then up 27 percent, with subsequent returns  throughout retirement a repetition of the first 3 years, the average return  would be 7 percent. If the sequence of returns in the second and third year  were reversed, holding all else constant, the average annual return would  be the same; yet if withdrawals are made each year, savings would be  depleted sooner with the first sequence of returns (see fig. 2)."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lifetime Retirement Income Sources and Increased Social Security Benefits Can Provide Additional Income Security", "paragraphs": ["Experts we spoke to generally recommended lifetime retirement income  from DB plans, when DB plans are available to workers, and income  annuities, in conjunction with systematic drawdown of other savings, to  provide a greater level of retirement income security.

However,  private sector DB plans do not typically provide inflation protection.  Without inflation protection, the value of the income may be greatly  diminished over a long retirement. For example, income of $1,000 per  month in 1980 would have purchasing power closer to $385 a month 30  years later in 2009. When a DB income stream does not adjust with  inflation, many experts recommended investing other savings in stocks  and bonds, which have on average returned above the rate of inflation.  Nevertheless, for retirees who want guaranteed income, experts we spoke  to considered lifetime retirement income from DB plans preferable over  purchasing an annuity with a lump sum distribution, since DB plans may  be able to provide payments at a higher rate than is available through an  insurance annuity outside of the plan."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Lifetime Retirement Income from Annuities", "paragraphs": ["The experts we spoke with also recommended that retirees enhance their  guaranteed income by purchasing an annuity with some limited portion of  their savings.

For those that want a  higher level of predictable income, an annuity can reduce the uncertainty  that comes with managing a portfolio of investments and systematically  drawing down income. The experts noted that retirees may have more  difficulty managing a portfolio of investments as they age.", "With regard to our sample of near-retirement households, the experts we  spoke to recommended that the middle quintile households purchase  annuities with a portion of their savings, but that the lowest quintile  household accumulate some precautionary cash savings before purchasing  an annuity or investing in securities. Furthermore, they suggested that the  two households in the highest quintile had sufficient resources to go  without annuities, unless the individuals were very risk averse and felt the  need for additional protection for longevity. With regard to the middle  quintile household without a DB plan, experts specified that they should  consider using a portion, such as half, of their $191,000 in financial assets  to purchase an inflation-adjusted annuity. Based on current annuity rates,  a premium valued at half of $191,000 would provide an additional $355 per  month ($4,262 in the first year) until the death of the last surviving spouse,  and include annual increases tied to the Consumer Price Index. A  monthly payment in the first year at this rate would provide slightly more  than the annual income provided by a 4 percent drawdown. By  purchasing an annuity, this household would reduce its exposure to the  risks inherent in a drawdown strategy\u2014namely, the risks of longevity,  inflation, and market volatility. This household would also have some  liquidity by having kept half of its initial savings available to cover  unexpected expenses or to leave for a bequest.", "For all the advantages of annuities, however, some of the experts we  spoke to noted that there is commonly a psychological hurdle involved in  the difficult decision to exchange a large principal payment for an  unknown number of small monthly payments. In addition, some planners  tempered their recommendations for annuities, given what they viewed as  the credit risk of annuity insurance companies or the risk of defaulting on  their obligation to make annuity payments. On the other hand, an  economist and an actuary we spoke to\u2014who do not work for insurance  companies\u2014maintain that the credit risk is small relative to the risks  inherent in holding stocks and bonds.", "Annuities also carry some disadvantages with regard to estate and tax  planning. Regarding a retiree\u2019s estate, annuities are typically not  refundable upon death, whereas any funds that remain with the deceased\u2019s  systematic drawdown strategy could be left to beneficiaries.

While individuals may choose reduced Social Security benefits at  the early eligibility age of 62, the payments they will receive at full  retirement age (age 66 for those born from 1943 to 1954) will be higher,  and continue to increase incrementally the longer they wait, up to age 70.  The total estimated amount of benefits collected by electing to delay  receipt of benefits from age 62 up to age 70 is intended to be  approximately actuarially equivalent, but determinations of actuarial  equivalence at any particular time depend on assumptions as to current  and projected interest and mortality rates. The amount of money that a  retiree would forego by waiting to start benefits until age 66 is less than  the amount needed to purchase an annuity that would provide the  additional monthly income available by waiting until full retirement age. If,  for example, a person collects $12,000 per year at age 62 and every year  thereafter (with yearly adjustments for inflation), they could wait until age  66 and collect $16,000 per year (33 percent more with additional  adjustments for inflation from age 62 to 66) and every year thereafter. By  beginning to collect benefits at age 62 they would have collected a total of  $48,000 by age 66, and could then purchase an inflation-adjusted annuity to  provide income to make up the difference.

Additionally, this could help participants who would otherwise purchase  an annuity in the retail market on terms that might not be as favorable. For  example, annuities, especially in larger plans, might be available at  institutional prices and thus at lower prices than on the retail market.  Annuities at group rates typically have lower prices than individual  annuities.

Depending on the specific features of a policy change in this area, it could  have the effect of lessening protections and recourse for participants, as  compared to the current regulation. For example, some industry  respondents proposed eliminating, modifying, or providing specific criteria  for the condition in the safe harbor that requires sponsors to assess the  ability of an insurance company to make all future payments under an  annuity contract. Labor officials said that protecting participants against  the risk of insurer insolvency is a key issue as they consider revisions to  the safe harbor regulation, given that retirees may depend on annuities for  decades. The insolvency of Executive Life Insurance Company in the early  1990s is a case in point. While states are generally responsible for  insurance regulation including the solvency of insurers, the degree of  regulation can vary in some aspects. There is also variation in the  protections of state guaranty associations to cover policyholders. For  example, all state guaranty associations generally protect an annuity\u2019s  value up to at least $100,000. According to an official from the National  Organization of Life and Health Insurance Guaranty Associations, as of  May 2011, roughly two-thirds of the associations provide coverage of  $250,000 or more, and roughly one-third have limits of at least $100,000 for  annuities.

For example, in DB plans, QJSA requirements under the  Retirement Equity Act of 1984 and its implementing regulations sought to  ensure that spouses are aware and consent to a pension distribution other  than a joint annuity that would provide payments throughout their  retirement. The QJSA procedures for DB plans do not apply uniformly to  DC plans, and we have previously reported that spousal protections in DC  plans already have limitations. For example, a plan participant may  withdraw from or roll over an account balance without the consent of his  or her spouse.

Social Security benefits serve as the foundation of  income in retirement and a key source of lifetime retirement income, but  many older people claim benefits at the earliest age and pass up the  opportunity for a higher monthly benefit beginning at full retirement age  or later. By claiming benefits early, whether for health or other important  reasons, individuals take a smaller benefit when they could potentially  work longer and receive a higher monthly benefit.

For  example, for the lowest quintile, median net wealth was $2,000 so we  selected households with net wealth in the $1,800 to $2,200 range. Based  on data for the first (lowest) quintile (see app. III), we selected a single- person household with neither a DB nor a DC pension, two or three living  children (not necessarily living in the household), who reported being in  \u201cfair\u201d or \u201cgood health,\u201d and who did not own a house. Based on data for  the third (middle) quintile, we selected two households consisting of  married couples that owned their home, with either the respondent or  spouse in \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cvery good\u201d health, and with two living children. From  this quintile we selected one couple with only a DB pension and another  with only a DC pension. Based on data for the fifth (highest) quintile, we  selected two households consisting of married couples that owned their  home. We selected one with either the respondent or spouse in \u201cgood\u201d or  \u201cvery good\u201d health, two living children, and who had both a DB and a DC  pension. We selected another couple from this quintile with only a DB  pension, with members in \u201cfair\u201d, \u201cgood\u201d, or \u201cvery good\u201d health, and no  restriction concerning the number of their living children. This procedure  provided five households with characteristics approximately equal to  median values for their net wealth quintile in these respects, but may not  be in other ways.", "We shared data on these households with the experts we interviewed and  discussed the strategies that the experts would recommend these  households\u2019 utilize and their trade-offs. See the households\u2019 summary  financial data in appendix III. We also reviewed company-specific financial  product documentation and studies of retirement income strategies such  as those describing systematic withdrawals from retirement savings,  including the results of Monte Carlo simulations.", "To review the choices retirees have made for managing their pension and  financial assets for generating income, we analyzed data from the HRS,  reviewed others\u2019 analyses of the HRS, and analyzed data from the Social  Security Administration, compiled by the Office of the Chief Actuary. We  reviewed other data sources including data on retirement account  holdings from the Employee Benefit Research Institute, labor force  participation data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and poverty  estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s Current Population Survey.", "We analyzed data concerning the disposition of pensions using HRS data,  including data compiled by RAND and Gustman, et al. We restricted this  analysis to workers that reported leaving employment with a DB or DC  pension plan and retiring between 2000 through 2006. We also included  only respondents that were in the HRS data set during each wave, 2000  through 2006. Furthermore, we assembled and analyzed data for a subset  of these respondents that provided information concerning the availability  of a lump sum option for their DB pension in the same HRS wave in which  they reported a pension disposition.", "To identify policy options that are available to ensure income throughout  retirement as well as their advantages and disadvantages, we collected and  reviewed information representing a variety of academic, consumer,  industry, and government sources. We analyzed over 40 public comments  from diverse groups submitted in response to the Department of Labor\u2019s  (Labor) and the Department of the Treasury\u2019s (Treasury) 2010 request for  information (RFI) on lifetime income, and at relevant congressional and  Treasury-Labor department hearings. In addition to the RFI submissions,  we also reviewed other publications from a variety of academic,  consumer, and industry sources. We reviewed reports from Labor\u2019s  Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Advisory Council, and  financial literacy materials on retirement income available from federal  agencies including the online version of Labor\u2019s Taking the Mystery Out  Of Retirement Planning and the Financial Literacy and Education  Commission\u2019s Web site, www.MyMoney.gov. We conducted interviews  with a variety of academic, consumer, and industry sources. Interviews  with officials of federal government agencies included Labor, the  Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Treasury, the Internal  Revenue Service (IRS), and Treasury staff of the Financial Literacy and  Education Commission.
