Recently, some states have seen an increase in vendors called WIC-only vendors, who stock only WIC food and accept only WIC vouchers. Both vendor types accept WIC vouchers in exchange for a cash payment, or redemption, from WIC state agencies with U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant funds. To determine what effect WIC-only vendors' growth would have on program expenditures, in the absence of recent cost containment legislation, Congress asked GAO (1) what is known about WIC-only vendors' growth and their share of the WIC market in recent years, (2) to what extent do WIC-only and regular WIC vendors differ, and (3) what would WIC-only vendors' contribution to WIC program expenditures have been, if their market share increased. GAO analyzed national WIC vendor data, interviewed WIC state officials about vendors' business practices, and analyzed redemption data from California, Texas and Florida."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The number of WIC-only vendors has tripled since 1999, with growth concentrated in a few states. However, WIC-only vendors' share of the national WIC market was relatively small compared to that of regular WIC vendors in 2004. Nationally, WIC-only vendors increased in number from 394 in 1999 to 1,180 in 2004, but 84 percent of these vendors are in California, Texas, and Florida. Despite their growth, WIC-only vendors accounted for 3 percent of all WIC vendors nationwide, and their market share, that is, their percentage of all WIC redemptions nationally, was on average 6 percent in 2004. Because of limitations in the data, we were unable to calculate annual growth rates or analyze changes in market share over time. WIC-only and regular WIC vendors generally employed different business and marketing practices, largely in response to the two different customer groups they served, according to WIC state agency officials. Because WIC participants are not required to consider retail prices, WIC-only vendors competed for participants' business by emphasizing customer service, which participants seemed to value. On the other hand, regular WIC vendors served non-WIC consumers as well as WIC participants. Because these non-WIC consumers are price sensitive, regular WIC vendors competed for their business based on price and competitors' behavior. An important difference in these approaches was that because WIC participants were not price sensitive, they might choose the service offered by WIC-only vendors, regardless of price. Finally, WIC-only and regular WIC vendors used similar food purchasing practices, because the cost of food purchased for resale is related more to the volume purchased than to the type of vendor purchasing the food. Both WIC-only and regular WIC vendors were able to lower the average cost of food purchased for resale when they bought in volume, according to WIC state agency officials. If WIC-only vendors' market share in 2004 had doubled in California, Texas, and Florida, either about 3 percent--about 136,000--fewer participants could have been served in each state, or program food expenditures would have increased about 3 percent--about $50 million--according to our scenario estimates. The average value of all vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors in 2004 was higher than the average value of all vouchers redeemed at regular WIC vendors. Thus, if the number of vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors had increased and state food expenditures remained at 2004 levels, fewer vouchers could have been issued, and fewer participants served. Conversely, if the number of vouchers issued remained at 2004 levels, the higher average value of vouchers redeemed at WIC-only vendors would have resulted in increased program expenditures. However, the price and quantity of the individual food items that make up the vouchers were not available to us; therefore we could not determine if the higher average value of vouchers meant that prices for individual food items were higher at WIC-only vendors. Making price comparisons would require food item price and quantity data for both WIC-only and regular WIC vendors, at a minimum."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Each month, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,  Infants, and Children, better known as WIC, provides nutritious food,  nutrition education, and referrals to health care to more than 8 million  low-income women, infants, of Agriculture\u2019s (USDA) Food and Nutrition  Service (FNS) through WIC state and local agencies that implement the  program and manage the food delivery system. WIC is a discretionary  program, as Congress does not set aside funds to allow every eligible  individual to participate, and was funded at a level of more than $5 billion  in fiscal year 2005.", "In most states, WIC participants receive vouchers to exchange for food  from authorized retail grocery stores that are known as WIC vendors in the  program. These vouchers provide participants with a prescribed type and  quantity of supplemental WIC foods tailored to their health needs, such as  infant formula, milk, and peanut butter. Participants generally are not  required by the federal WIC program to obtain all items on a voucher.  However, they may not use the voucher to purchase items that are not  listed on it. Because participants receive food in exchange for their  vouchers, without exchanging any cash, their purchasing decisions are not  price sensitive, that is, they do not need to consider the prices WIC  vendors charge for the items. The vendors, which include independent  stores as well as national and local chains, accept the vouchers and  exchange them for a cash payment, or redemption, from the WIC state  agency. Until recently, retail grocery stores that commonly carry a variety  of foods including supplemental WIC foods\u2014or regular WIC vendors, as  they are referred to in this report\u2014represented 98 percent or more of the  stores each WIC state agency authorized as WIC vendors. However,  beginning in about fiscal year 2000, some WIC state agencies noticed an  increase in another type of authorized vendor in the WIC vendor market,  one that sells only WIC-authorized food items to program participants and  accepts only WIC vouchers. Prior to changes introduced by the Child  Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, these vendors were called  WIC-only vendors.  With data reported by the WIC state agencies, FNS has  tracked WIC-only vendors\u2019 redemptions since 1998, but little else is known  at the national level about the percentage of total WIC redemptions that  WIC-only vendors are receiving, that is, their market share, or about their  business practices.", "Questions have been raised about whether WIC-only vendors charge  higher prices than other vendors and therefore will place a higher demand  on overall program expenditures over time. If so, the WIC program may  need to restrict program participation or seek additional funding.  Concerned about the potential consequences of increasing claims on  program funds, in fiscal year 2004, Congress established cost containment  provisions to ensure that the WIC program is not charged more for food  items obtained at WIC-only vendors than it would be for the same items at  regular WIC vendors.  Also, in fiscal year 2005, Congress prohibited the  payment of administrative funds to any state agency that authorized any  new WIC-only vendors, unless deemed necessary to ensure participant  access, for 2 years. To determine what the effect of WIC-only vendors\u2019  growth on WIC program expenditures would have been without the recent  cost containment changes and the prohibition on authorizing new vendors,  and to better understand how they do business, you asked us (1) what is  known about WIC-only vendors\u2019 growth and their share of the WIC market  in recent years, (2) to what extent do the business and marketing practices  of WIC-only and regular WIC vendors differ, and (3) what would WIC-only  vendors\u2019 contribution to WIC program expenditures have been if their  market share increased.", "To find out what is known about WIC-only vendors\u2019 growth and their share  of the WIC market in recent years, we analyzed data from FNS\u2019s  administrative data files on the national WIC vendor population\u2014The  Integrity Profile (TIP)\u2014for fiscal years 1999-2004 to determine the number  and distribution of WIC-only vendors. We focused exclusively on data  from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, and excluded from our  analysis any vendor type other than WIC-only vendors and regular WIC  vendors. To determine WIC-only vendors\u2019 share of the WIC market, we  analyzed redemption data for an average month in fiscal year 2004 from  FNS\u2019s regional office files. However, because TIP does not record when  vendors enter or exit the WIC program, but instead records any vendor  that participated in WIC during the fiscal year, it may overstate the number  of vendors in operation at any point in time. As a result, we calculated the  number of WIC-only vendors in the program each year, but we were  unable to determine percentage-based growth from year to year. In  addition, because national redemption data for fiscal years 1999-2004 did  not meet GAO\u2019s data reliability standards, we could not use these data to  analyze changes in WIC-only vendors\u2019 share of the WIC market over time.  However, the fiscal year 1999-2004 TIP data on the number of vendors and  FNS regional office redemption data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To determine the difference in WIC-only vendors and regular WIC vendors\u2019  business and marketing practices, we interviewed WIC state agency  officials in seven of the eight states that had authorized more than 10 WIC- only vendors in fiscal year 2004: Alabama, Arkansas, California, Florida,  Georgia, North Carolina, and Texas. To complement these telephone  interviews, we visited 4 WIC-only vendors and 4 regular WIC vendors in  California, Texas, and Florida, for a total of 24 site visits. Our vendor  selection criteria included urban and rural locations, years in operation,  and redemption practices. WIC state officials\u2019 accounts and the site visits  to vendors provided insight into the distinctions in WIC-only and regular  WIC vendors\u2019 business behavior, but were not quantifiable or applicable  beyond the states and vendors they represented.", "To calculate the contribution of WIC-only vendors to WIC program  expenditures, we obtained administrative data from the California, Texas,  and Florida WIC state agencies on the redemption value for every voucher  redeemed in those states in fiscal year 2004. We selected these three states  because they represent more than 80 percent of the national WIC-only  vendor market. Because we needed data on both the price and the quantity  of WIC food items purchased from WIC-only and regular WIC vendors to  isolate the effect of WIC-only vendors\u2019 prices on program expenditures,  and both of those data elements were not available from any existing data  source, we developed a scenario analysis that used redemption data. We  used the redemption data to determine the actual number of vouchers  redeemed and to calculate the average value of all vouchers redeemed in  each of the states by WIC-only and by regular WIC vendors. We applied the  number of vouchers redeemed and the average value of all vouchers  redeemed to the scenario analysis to estimate the effect on program  participation and expenditures of successive increases in WIC-only  vendors\u2019 market share. However, because redemption data do not break  out the price and quantity of the individual food items on each voucher,  we could not determine whether prices of individual food items were  higher at WIC-only vendors than at regular WIC vendors. Thus, even  though we were able to calculate the average value of all vouchers  redeemed by both types of vendors, we were not able to explain why the  values may have been different.", "Appendix I provides a detailed description of our methodology and its  limitations.

WIC is not an entitlement program that allows every eligible individual to  participate; rather, it is a federal discretionary grant program for which  Congress authorizes a specific amount of funds each year.

The  nutrition services and administration grant covers the cost of certifying  participants and determining nutrition risks; providing outreach and  nutrition education services, including breastfeeding promotion; and  printing vouchers and administering the food delivery system. FNS also  determines WIC program policy and guidance, provides technical  assistance to the WIC state agencies and sponsors research on program  issues.

Each WIC  state agency designs its own vouchers and usually issues vouchers that  contain a combination of WIC food items.  For example, one frequently  used voucher contains eggs, juice, cereal, cheese, milk, and beans.   However, some vouchers contain only one food item, such as formula or  cereal.  (See app. IV.)  Most participants receive multiple vouchers each  month for all of the food they are prescribed. However they may not use  the voucher to purchase items that are not listed on it.

For example, the Food Stamp and WIC Farmers\u2019  Market Nutrition Programs generally provide electronic benefits or  coupons that are used like cash at grocery stores or through farmers, and  which encourage participants to make cost-conscious decisions regarding  food choices. In contrast, because WIC participants purchase  supplemental foods with vouchers that prescribe the type and quantity of  foods a participant may receive, regardless of the prices charged by  vendors to the WIC program, WIC participants are not price sensitive, that  is, participants do not have an incentive to purchase their food benefit  from lower-priced vendors.", "The approximately 45,000 vendors in the WIC program accept vouchers  and exchange them for cash payment\u2014or redemption\u2014from their WIC  state agency. Vendors are subject to price limitations, often in the form of  an overall maximum, not-to-exceed amount for each voucher, determined  by WIC state agencies. As shown in figure 1, a state may clearly print the  not-to-exceed amount for the total amount charged on the voucher.", "Like other retail grocery stores, WIC vendors sell to participants small  quantities of food items that they typically purchase from manufacturers,  wholesalers, or, on occasion, other retailers.

Because federal legislation grants primary  responsibility for WIC vendor management to the WIC state agencies, WIC  state agencies have considerable flexibility in designing and implementing  their vendor management systems. FNS regulations require that WIC state  agencies\u2019 vendor management systems include six areas of activity:    authorization and reauthorization\u2014The authorization process begins  with a vendor\u2019s application and an on-site visit by WIC state agency  staff to verify the information provided in the application.

These cost containment  provisions require state agencies to implement a vendor peer group system  that groups stores according to similar characteristics, such as vendor size  and geographic location, in a manner that ensures that the WIC program  pays all authorized vendors competitive prices for supplemental foods.  FNS expects to complete certification of states\u2019 plans for cost containment  by September 2006.", "One cost containment provision created a new category of vendors  referred to as above 50 percent vendors, which include any vendor whose  revenue from the sale of WIC supplemental food is more than half of its  annual revenue from food sales.   In addition, the Act prohibited above 50  percent vendors from providing any incentive items, such as free diapers,  detergent, baby strollers, or bicycles, to participants unless the incentives  are of nominal value or were obtained at no cost. On November 29, 2005,  USDA issued an interim rule, effective on December 29, 2005, that  incorporated the cost containment provisions of the Act into program  regulations that are applicable to WIC state agencies. To help ensure that  vendors\u2019 prices are competitive, these regulations require states to collect  and review vendors\u2019 shelf prices at least every 6 months after  authorization.  The regulations also require state agencies to compare the  average cost of each type of food instrument redeemed by WIC-only  vendors against the average cost of the same type of food instrument  redeemed by regular vendors.", "In December of 2005, attorneys representing an association of WIC-only  vendors and three food companies, the plaintiffs, filed an action in federal  district court for the District of Columbia to stop implementation of FNS\u2019s  regulations.  Arguing that the regulations were contrary to the Act and to  congressional intent, the plaintiffs asserted that the cost containment  provisions concerning above-50-percent vendors would reduce their WIC  reimbursements to a level that would be unsustainable.  In describing  services that WIC-only vendors offered WIC participants, the plaintiffs  characterized WIC-only vendors as small businesses and acknowledged  that their cost of doing business was higher than that of large stores,  referred to as box stores, that purchased food in high volume at discount  prices. The plaintiffs estimated that WIC-only vendors\u2019 prices were about 8  to 15 percent higher than prices charged at box stores, on average.

However, we were unable to obtain the data needed to confirm these  views.", "Few WIC-only vendors used price-based incentives such as buy-one-get- one-free specials, sale items, or discount cards to attract WIC customers.   Because WIC participants purchase items with vouchers and are not price  sensitive, price discounts would not induce them to go to a store with  lower prices.  However, for this same reason, WIC-only vendors would not  risk losing WIC customers, even if their prices were higher.", "In the past, WIC-only vendors also have given away food and non-food  items, called incentives, to attract customers. For example, WIC-only  vendors gave away strollers and diapers in California and North Carolina,  cash in Arkansas, and gift certificates in Georgia, according to WIC state  agency officials. Because WIC-only vendors\u2019 main source of revenue was  the WIC benefit, paid for by the WIC program, offering such incentives  raised concerns about the use of federal funds. However, several WIC  state agency officials noted that the use of incentives by WIC-only vendors  has decreased as a result of rule changes required by the Child Nutrition  and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004.  In fact, the WIC state officials we  spoke with in California, North Carolina, and Arkansas said that WIC-only  vendors no longer give away most of the items they provided in the past.  None of the WIC-only vendors we observed on our site visits provided  such incentives, with the exception of one in California that gave  customers a small amount of free produce for purchasing a certain  quantity of food items.", "In contrast to WIC-only vendors, the retail grocers that we define as  regular WIC vendors targeted the population at large and did not focus on  customer service, according to WIC state agency officials.  Regular WIC  vendors served WIC participants, but their largest group of customers was  non-WIC consumers, who are price sensitive.  For the most part, regular  WIC vendors targeted their business practices on their non-WIC customers  and set prices in response to this group.  The regular WIC vendors we  observed on our site visits provided examples of their business practices  that contrast with those of WIC-only vendors. Of the 12 regular WIC  vendors we visited, none gathered the WIC food items listed on the  voucher for WIC customers and only 3 had food items authorized by the  WIC program placed together on an aisle shelf to assist participants in  finding the items on their vouchers.  Having to search store aisles and  shelves for the correct food type, brand, and size listed on their voucher  can make shopping for WIC food items at regular WIC vendors challenging  or uncomfortable for WIC participants.", "WIC state officials told us that regular WIC vendors\u2019 marketing practices  are price-based, that is, they competed in the market based on price and  their competitors\u2019 behavior. Regular WIC vendors commonly use buy-one- get-one-free specials, sale items, discount cards, and other price-based  incentives to attract a broad client base that is price sensitive. Since the  rule changes required by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act  of 2004, regular WIC vendors, who have sources of revenue other than  federal funds from their broad customer base, continue to provide higher- priced incentives to attract customers, according to several of the WIC  state agency officials and WIC vendor employees whom we interviewed.", "Despite these differences, WIC-only vendors and regular WIC vendors  used some similar business or marketing practices that did not involve  price-based incentives. For example, both employed checkout staff who  spoke one or more languages other than English, according to the majority  of WIC state agency officials interviewed, a practice we observed on our  site visits.

Because food  item price data and quantities of food items purchased were not available,  we were unable to construct analyses that would have isolated the effect  of actual prices charged by WIC-only and regular vendors on program  expenditures or participation. For example, some food vouchers in our  data were composed of a single item, but most of them contained multiple  food items, such as milk, cheese, and cereal. Because most of the  vouchers contained several types of WIC food and allowable quantities for  each food item, the value of an individual voucher was not the price a  vendor charged for an individual food item. The value of an individual food  voucher was the sum of the price of each food item on the voucher times  the quantity purchased. As a result, the difference in value between WIC- only and regular WIC vouchers could be due to differences in prices for  individual items or differences in the quantities redeemed or both. For  example, if some participant customers of regular WIC vendors select only  a portion of the food items on a voucher, regular WIC vendors\u2019 average  redemption value would be lower than WIC-only vendors\u2019, if their WIC  customers received all of the items on the voucher.

Although in some states the number  of WIC-only vendors has not grown, in others the number has grown  quickly and the future effect of the new cost containment requirements on  this growth is not known. Our scenario analyses suggest that continued  WIC-only vendor growth could have resulted in either fewer participants  being served or higher program costs. Moreover, given the current  program model that focuses on ensuring participants receive prescribed  foods without having to consider the costs of the commodities,  participants would likely continue to take advantage of the customer  service and convenient location offered by WIC-only vendors, even if  prices are higher.", "The lack of price and quantity data needed to explain the higher monthly  average redemptions of WIC-only vendors and the higher average value of  vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors leaves important questions  unanswered. We could not determine how WIC-only and regular WIC  vendors\u2019 prices differ. Our study was a first attempt to develop a national  picture of WIC-only vendors, to inform policy initiatives and practice.  However, absent a systematic analysis of vendor-level data, it is difficult to  determine with more certainty how changes in market share between WIC- only and regular WIC vendors would affect WIC program expenditures.", "The lack of price and quantity data on WIC food purchases also has  broader program implications. Although WIC state agencies have used  routine and high-risk vendor monitoring and voucher review to promote  accountability, for the most part they authorize and reimburse their WIC- only and regular WIC vendors without knowing precisely which prescribed  foods were purchased and in what quantities, what price the program was  being charged for food, and whether participants were receiving the whole  food package or only part of it. Collecting these data under the current  system would be costly and burdensome to states. Under the new interim  rule, WIC state agencies are required to collect vendors\u2019 shelf price data  but not the actual price charged the program or the quantity purchased.  However, two recent developments in the WIC program\u2014the  implementation of electronic benefits transfer and the redesign of the WIC  food package to include fruit and vegetables\u2014may lead to changes in the  WIC voucher and present WIC state agencies the opportunity to collect  price and quantity data during the WIC transaction in a cost-effective way.

However, they raised several concerns.  They asked us to make clear that the 2004 data we used to determine the  growth in the number of WIC-only vendors preceded the current  moratorium on approving new WIC-only vendors, and the data we used to  calculate the effect of additional growth on the program were gathered  before the full implementation of new cost containment provisions. These  provisions, enacted when the program was reauthorized in 2004, are  intended to help ensure that the program pays competitive prices to all  authorized vendors. We incorporated additional references to these recent  changes where appropriate.", "FNS officials also commented on our finding that although the average  value of all vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors in our three states in  2004 was higher than that of vouchers redeemed by regular WIC vendors  in these states, we could not determine with certainty whether prices  charged by WIC-only vendors are higher than those charged by regular  WIC vendors because we could not disaggregate price from quantity at the  level of purchase. Officials acknowledged the ongoing challenges in  collecting these data for foods provided under the WIC program. However,  they expressed concern that this finding would be misinterpreted to mean  there is no price difference between WIC-only and regular WIC vendors,  and our finding on the likely effect on the program of continued growth of  WIC-only vendors under 2004 conditions would be overlooked. We made  some minor technical revisions to our report wording to clarify our  findings and the limitations of available data on prices charged by WIC  vendors.", "Further, in the draft these officials read, we recommended that FNS  consider conducting a small-scale study to better understand how WIC- only vendor prices and operations contribute to program expenditures.  Officials did not believe this study would be necessary or cost-effective  because of the difficulty in collecting price and quantity data on WIC  purchases under the current paper-based system, and because program  regulations already require monitoring of shelf prices and redemption data  as a component of their vendor management. We understand that USDA  has limited funds available for research, with multiple demands on these  funds.  Since the cornerstones of the new legislative requirements are that  prices at above-50-percent vendors should be competitive with those  charged by regular vendors and that vendors that derive more than 50  percent of their revenue from WIC food instruments do not result in higher  food costs to the program than do other vendors, officials are hopeful that  the new cost containment provisions will ensure the program pays  competitive prices to all vendors. However, the cost containment  provisions are complex and entail significant changes for some states. We  believe it is important for FNS to closely monitor implementation of cost  containment provisions to help ensure that program costs are in fact  contained as intended. Moreover, as long as the program is structured so  that participants need not pay attention to price, and given the current  lack of available information on whether participants are actually  receiving their prescribed foods and at what price, we believe FNS should  proactively take advantage of all cost-effective ways of gathering data that  will help contain costs and ensure the program is meeting its overall goals.  In response, we have removed our recommendation for further study and  further clarified our recommendation for additional data collection on the  price and quantity of WIC food items purchased under a new EBT system.", "FNS also made additional technical comments, which we have  incorporated where appropriate.", "As arranged with your office, unless you publicly announce its contents  earlier, we plan no further distribution of this report until 30 days after the  date of this letter.

TIP is a database that includes information on all vendors authorized to  provide food benefits under the WIC program at any point during a fiscal  year. For each vendor entry, TIP identifies vendor type, location, and WIC  redemption amounts, among other data. TIP data is provided by 90 WIC  state agencies, representing all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Indian  Tribal Organizations (ITOs), and U.S. territories. WIC state agencies  submit electronic data to FNS on an annual basis in accordance with  instructions provided by FNS.

As a result, our analysis focused largely on TIP."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Data Collection", "paragraphs": ["As one step in our data reliability assessment process, we evaluated the  integrity of TIP data. This procedure revealed two primary limitations.  First, TIP does not report the actual date when a vendor enters or exits the  WIC program; rather, it only indicates whether a vendor was authorized by  a WIC state agency at any point during a fiscal year. As a result, TIP likely  overstates the number of vendors in operation on any given date. For  example, the number of WIC vendors in operation on the first day of a  particular fiscal year\u2014October 1\u2014is probably less than the number  reported by TIP for the same fiscal year, as TIP includes all WIC vendors  for that fiscal year that were authorized as of October 1, in addition to all  vendors that entered the program after that date. Thus, we could not  calculate a percentage-based growth rate from year to year using TIP.  Instead, we could only calculate the total number of WIC vendors of a  specific type in operation for at least 1 day during a particular fiscal year.", "The second limitation we identified was that national TIP redemption data  did not meet GAO\u2019s data reliability standards, based upon information  provided by FNS. Although FNS had requested that WIC state agencies  submit average monthly redemption data for all WIC vendors during fiscal  years 1999-2003, FNS officials determined subsequently that not all WIC  state agencies had followed these instructions. FNS officials concluded  that some WIC state agencies had submitted redemption data in formats  other than average monthly amounts, such as annual or quarterly figures,  but they were uncertain about the time period used by any particular WIC  state agency in reporting redemption data. In recognition of this problem,  for fiscal year 2004, FNS requested that WIC state agencies specify the  time period that their redemption figures covered when submitting TIP  data. FNS then annualized all redemption figures not submitted as annual  amounts by multiplying the figures that were other than annual by the  appropriate number of months. However, this process may have resulted  in overstated redemption figures for certain WIC vendors in fiscal year  2004, as FNS annualized the redemption figures for all WIC vendors that  did not have annual redemption amounts\u2014including those vendors that  were not authorized to participate in WIC for the entire fiscal year. As a  result of these issues, we determined that we could not use FNS\u2019s national  TIP data to report trends in redemption amounts over time, or to calculate  average annual redemption amounts by vendor type for any particular  fiscal year. However, because FNS had requested that WIC state agencies  specify the time period used in reporting redemption data for fiscal year  2004, we concluded that we could use the original state data files from that  year to calculate average monthly redemption figures.", "We converted redemption figures for all WIC-only and regular WIC  vendors with valid redemption data into average monthly redemption  amounts for any state that reported redemptions in a form other than  monthly (see table 5 for these other time periods reported by states to FNS  for fiscal year 2004). For example, for any state that reported redemption  amounts using quarterly figures, we divided each WIC vendor\u2019s  redemption total by three to create an average monthly figure. In  converting redemption amounts, we excluded vendors that were not  authorized to participate in the WIC program but that were sometimes  included in the state files. When such vendors appeared, they were clearly  identified as being unauthorized.", "In addition to eliminating specific analysis procedures due to data  reliability issues, we narrowed the focus of our analyses to certain  geographic areas and WIC vendor types. Because TIP includes data from  ITOs and U.S. territories in addition to the 50 states and the District of  Columbia, some WIC vendors may have been listed in more than one state  agency TIP file. For example, both a state and an ITO located within that  state may have authorized, and thus included in their data file submitted to  FNS, the same WIC vendor. To eliminate these potential data-reporting  redundancies, our analysis of TIP focused exclusively on the 50 states and  the District of Columbia. Concerning our vendor focus, TIP includes some  vendor types and additional food delivery systems that are not directly  comparable to WIC-only vendors. The noncomparable vendor types  include military commissaries, usually located on military installations,  and pharmacies, which often only provide infant formula and WIC-eligible  medical foods.

In order to answer that type of  detailed question, we would have needed additional information that was  not available because of the way data are collected by the states.  Specifically, we would have needed the price of the individual food items  listed on the voucher and the quantity of each food item purchased, in  addition to the total redeemed value. Figure 13 shows hypothetical  vouchers from two vendors that include the type of information that  would have been needed for such an analysis. It specifies that 2 gallons of  milk were purchased at $3.57 per gallon for a total expenditure of $7.14.  However, the data files we received did not contain either the price or the  quantity purchased for individual vouchers.", "Without information on the quantity and price of the items on food  vouchers, WIC participants would not know the value of the items they  received and could not be price sensitive. WIC agencies would also not be  able to determine the prices of the items they redeemed or whether  participants received the total quantity of products specified on the  voucher. Without this information, it is difficult to know why average  redemption values differ.", "Figure 13 illustrates why it is important to know the quantity actually  redeemed by the participant. For example, as shown in voucher 1 in the  figure, the participant received the full quantity of food specified on the  voucher. The average value of all items is $17.95. In voucher 2, the average  value of the voucher at $14.00 is less expensive. The participant, however,  did not buy eggs or cheese and did not receive the full quantity of food  specified on the voucher.

Without this information, it is not  possible to know whether the prices at one vendor are higher than prices  at another vendor. In voucher 2, the total value of the voucher is less than  in voucher 1, yet the price charged for a gallon of milk is significantly  higher.

For example, if milk is being sold as a loss leader at the  vendor represented by voucher 1, it is possible that the price on the shelf  is actually $7.00 per gallon even though the price on the voucher is $3.57  per gallon.", "We also would have needed information on such things as the size and  location of stores to further determine why prices and average values may  have varied between WIC-only and regular WIC vendors in the states."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The model", "paragraphs": ["To answer the questions presented in these two scenarios, we used the  following equation for the sum of WIC-only and regular WIC retail vendor  food expenditures:  1) (program food expenditures for WIC-only vendors) + (program food  expenditures for regular WIC vendors) = total WIC program food  expenditures, or:  2) qx + qx = Fq x = program food expenditures for WIC-only vendors where  q= number of vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors  x = average value of vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors  qx = program food expenditures for regular WIC vendors where  q = number of vouchers redeemed by regular WIC vendors  x= average value of vouchers redeemed by regular WIC vendors   ) equaled $13.15.

We did this by increasing the number  of vouchers redeemed at WIC-only vendors in the states in 2004 by a  hypothetical 10, 20, 30, 50, and 100 percent. Because we increased the  number of food vouchers redeemed at WIC-only vendors, and do not allow  total WIC program food expenditures to increase, the total number of  vouchers for WIC-only and regular WIC vendors that can be issued  depends, in part, on whether the average value of redeemed vouchers is  higher for WIC-only vendors. If the average value is higher, fewer food  vouchers could be issued under this scenario and thus fewer participants  could be served. This would be reflected in our scenario by a reduction in  the number of vouchers redeemed by regular WIC vendors. We calculated  this change in the number of vouchers redeemed by regular WIC vendors  by using equation 2a, which is equation 2 transformed.

For example, in California, a total of 69,611,000 vouchers were  redeemed in 2004 (table 6). As shown in table 7, for a doubling in the  number of vouchers redeemed by WIC-only vendors, we estimated a total  of 67,560,000 vouchers.", "In the absence of more specific information on participation, we simply  divided the total number of vouchers redeemed by the average number of  vouchers redeemed per participant for each of the states. For example, in  California we estimated 32.69 vouchers per participant. We used that  information to estimate that there were 2,130,000 participants in 2004,  (69,611,000 / 32.69). Conversely, as shown in table 8, if the redemptions of  vouchers by WIC-only vendors doubled, we estimated that 2,067,000  participants (67,559,000 / 32.69) would be affected.", "As shown in table 8, in California, the difference between the number of  participants in 2004 and the estimated number of participants if WIC-only  vendor redemptions increased 100 percent (2,067,000-2,130,000) indicated  a decline of 63,000 participants that could be served. In California, this  represented about 3 percent of the number of participants in 2004, ((63,000  / 2,130,000)*100).", "In the second scenario, we wanted to see how expenditures that had been  held constant in the previous scenario would have to change in order to  maintain the level of program participation constant at 2004 levels when  the market share of WIC-only vendors increased. As in the previous  scenario, we increased the number of redeemed food vouchers for WIC- only vendors (q) by a hypothetical 10, 20, 50, and 100 percent. While  keeping the total number of vouchers redeemed constant at 2004 levels,  we again used equation 2a to calculate the number of redeemed vouchers  for regular WIC vendors (q). We allowed total expenditures to increase  (FWIC-only vendors account for a much smaller share of the WIC market in  Texas and Florida than in California.

The value for California was calculated as $13.15,  while the value for regular WIC was $12.28, with a difference of $0.87  between the two types of vendors. In Texas, the average value of vouchers  redeemed at WIC-only vendors was calculated to be $31.55, while the  value for regular WIC vendors was $21.72\u2014a difference of $9.83. In  Florida, WIC-only voucher redemptions averaged $22.92 in value, while the  value for regular WIC was $18.50\u2014a difference of $4.42. In addition,  according to our analysis, the average value of vouchers redeemed at  regular WIC vendors was lowest in California, at $12.28, followed by  Florida at $18.50 and Texas at $21.72. The difference in the average value  of vouchers redeemed should be treated with a great deal of caution.   Because we used the average value of all food vouchers in our analysis  without knowing the price or quantity of the individual food items that  made up the vouchers, we could not determine if the higher average value  meant that prices for individual food items were higher at WIC-only  vendors. As described earlier, the data represent the average value of the  vouchers, not prices for specific food items. These data do not enable us  to make price comparisons between the two types of vendors. In addition,  this analysis does not allow us to determine why the average values in  vouchers redeemed may be higher. To do that, we would need enough  data on the costs vendors incurred in obtaining the food items as well as  an understanding of the factors affecting those costs, such as store size,  store location, marketing conditions and business practices, and any other  factors affecting food item prices, to identify the factors affecting voucher  values.", "The results of our calculation of the decline in the number of participants  due to the increase in WIC-only vendors\u2019 market share are presented in  table 10.

In order to more fully answer these questions, we would  have to know more about the actual prices and quantities of individual  food items on the redemption vouchers. Any price comparison would have  to be for similar products of similar quantity and quality. In addition, we  would also have to know the factors that may be influencing prices.

In addition, even if price  differences exist, certain factors affecting the store\u2019s costs\u2014the size of the  store, the location of the store, and the general market structure in which  the store operates\u2014may help explain the price differences. In the case of  the WIC market, the role of the program itself cannot be ignored; for  example, that participants are not price sensitive.
