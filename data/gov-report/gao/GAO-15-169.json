Along with the \u201cno wrong door\u201d  policy, CMS envisioned streamlined enrollment processes that include the  real-time transfer of applications between state Medicaid agencies and  the FFE, and immediate eligibility determinations. States are eligible to  use 90/10 funding for changes they make to their Medicaid IT systems  regardless of whether they are operating their own exchanges or using  the FFE. States may also receive a 75 percent matching rate for the  maintenance and any ongoing costs of operating an upgraded Medicaid  eligibility system. The 75 percent FFP is generally available when the  Medicaid eligibility system changes become operational, and unlike 90/10  funding, does not expire.", "To access 90/10 funding, states must first submit advanced planning  documents (APDs) to CMS\u2014the federal agency that oversees the  Medicaid program and provides guidance and technical assistance to  states related to Medicaid eligibility system changes. CMS reviews the APDs to ensure that certain technical and operational criteria are met  before states are eligible for 90/10 funding.

However, nearly a year after  the initial open enrollment period, a handful of states remain unable to  transfer applications. (See fig. 3.) CMS officials noted that they continue  to work with these states to ensure implementation as soon as possible.  However, the capability to conduct real time application transfers for  immediate eligibility determinations remains elusive in all states. While a  CMS official acknowledged that real time application transfers continue to  be a goal, he does not anticipate this occurring until 2015 or 2016, given  variability in states\u2019 abilities.", "Some of the states that we reviewed cited evolving technical  requirements from CMS as a challenge to their initial efforts to implement  this critical success factor. For example, CMS issued the initial technical  requirements for application transfers in April 2013 and then final  requirements two months later\u2014about three months before the open  enrollment period. Since CMS\u2019s technical requirements involve  thousands of lines of code, a CMS official acknowledged that changes to  the initial requirements created additional work for states that were  following them. A New Mexico official indicated that the state made some  initial assumptions in developing its system that later needed modifying  once CMS issued final requirements. A CMS official noted variation in  states\u2019 abilities to make such adjustments in a timely manner and that  some states began incorporating the initial requirements into their  systems, while other states purposely waited for the final requirements.", "The delay in FFE readiness to transfer applications to and from the states  further complicated efforts to implement this critical success factor. A  CMS official acknowledged that the FFE was not ready to send or receive  applications when open enrollment began. CMS was first able to receive  applications from states in mid-October 2013 and to send applications to  states in November 2013.

In such cases, the agency worked with states to send  applications to them incrementally until their systems were working  properly and were able to receive greater numbers of applications.", "Because states were not able to transfer applications in time for open  enrollment, CMS provided states with a subset of the information from the  applications submitted to the FFE in a simple excel spreadsheet, which  they called a \u201cflat file,\u201d beginning on October 16, 2013. While the flat file  did not necessarily advance state efforts toward developing the IT  connections needed to transfer applications, it did provide states with a  sense of the volume of applications they would receive from the FFE, and  allowed them to reach out to potentially eligible individuals to encourage  them to apply directly to the state\u2019s Medicaid office. Officials in some of  the states we reviewed, including New Mexico and Pennsylvania, did not  find the flat file useful in identifying and enrolling eligible individuals, citing  the limited information provided. However, CMS issued guidance on  November 29, 2013, that gave states the option to obtain a waiver  allowing them to enroll applicants into Medicaid using information from  the flat file. The states that we reviewed did not seek such a waiver;  however, six other states using the FFE did seek waivers.", "For the estimated 2.9 million Medicaid applications waiting for processing  in states cited in a June 2014 report, delayed implementation of the  application transfer function\u2014while not the sole factor behind delays\u2014did  have implications for enrollees\u2019 timely enrollment in Medicaid. For  example, Pennsylvania officials attributed some of its application backlog  of 60,000 Medicaid applications in spring 2014 to delays in receiving  applications from the FFE, but also noted other reasons, such as the  state\u2019s process for non-MAGI applications received from the FFE, which  may have required additional contact or verification by the state. As  another contributing factor to delayed enrollment, the initial open  enrollment period saw a surge of Medicaid applicants seeking health  insurance coverage, but the capacity of states to process this enrollment  surge varied. Incomplete or inconsistent application data also affected  states\u2019 ability to process applications in a timely manner. The officials  from the sample states we interviewed that established state-based  exchanges and were not using the FFE to transfer applications cited  backlogs due to technology challenges, as well as the volume of  applications received.

According to CMS officials, the expedited review enabled states to  access 90/10 funding more quickly, enabling them to issue RFPs for  consulting firms that will plan and implement the new technology for  Medicaid eligibility IT systems changes. CMS also provided states  with an APD checklist to minimize requests for additional information,  and streamlined its review and approval of RFPs and states\u2019 contracts  with consulting firms.", "Enhanced review of CMS-64: CMS added new lines to the CMS-64  for states to separately report state and contractor expenditures for  Medicaid eligibility IT system changes. To provide more timely  information on the amount of 90/10 funding that had been spent, CMS  implemented a new financial management process in 2013 to monitor  funding for Medicaid eligibility IT system changes each federal fiscal  year. According to CMS officials, this effort aligned states\u2019 approved  APD budgets with expenditure data in CMS\u2019s financial management  system to ensure that states did not exceed the amounts they were  approved for each fiscal year. If a state exceeded or did not spend its  budgeted amount, CMS would adjust the approved amount of 90/10  funding for the following year.", "In addition to modifying existing oversight practices, CMS followed new  practices defined by its Enterprise Life Cycle framework to review the  progress that states were making to implement Medicaid eligibility IT  system changes, which focus on incremental reviews at distinct stages, or  \u201cgates.\u201d These practices differ from CMS\u2019s practice of certifying MMIS IT  changes after the new system is operational for 60 days. To progress  through each of the three gates (planning, design, and implementation),  states were required to submit planning documents\u2014known as artifacts\u2014 to CMS for approval. For example,  to pass the planning gate, states provided the agency with finalized  financial management and performance measurement plans;  for the design gate, states submitted system design and change  management plans; and  for the implementation gate, states submitted a finalized information  security risk assessment plan.", "Depending on the scope of states\u2019 changes, the artifacts required by CMS  varied. CMS developed templates for many of these artifacts to facilitate  state development of them, and encouraged collaboration among states  by making documents available through the new Internet-based  repository known as the CALT. CMS intended this tool to be a vehicle for  collaboration among states, allowing them to share source code and  other information and make use of others\u2019 approaches as a model for  their own implementation. While Minnesota officials found that the CALT  fulfilled this purpose by assisting them in connecting with other states  using the same contractor, half the states we reviewed found it unwieldy  and difficult to navigate.", "As a final step in the implementation gate, CMS conducted an operational  readiness review wherein states demonstrated their new eligibility IT  systems and readiness to implement the critical success factors. Based  on these readiness reviews, CMS either approved the state\u2019s system or  granted a conditional approval pending additional state action. In some  states, CMS held more than one operational readiness review reflecting  the phased approach some states took to implement system changes.  For example, because New Mexico implemented its integrated eligibility  system in phases, CMS held two operational readiness reviews for the  state and granted conditional approval after the first review, requiring the  state to conduct further testing on its application transfer function. While  this incremental review facilitated implementation and reflected unique  circumstances of states\u2019 Medicaid programs, our prior work that focused  on the development of the FFE found that partial CMS reviews of system  changes did not ensure that required approvals occurred in a timely  fashion.", "State officials also identified challenges they experienced with aspects of  this new oversight framework, which were often exacerbated due to the  compressed timeframes that states had to implement the IT system  changes. For example, officials from Pennsylvania said that they received  little feedback from CMS on their gate presentations despite significant  time and resources that the state spent preparing for such gate reviews.  According to Pennsylvania officials, the CMS contractors who participated  in the gate reviews were unfamiliar with the state\u2019s IT system and thus  were unable to provide the state with actionable feedback during the early  gates reviews. Additionally, because the life cycle framework was a new  approach, some states we reviewed did not fully understand the  requirements. For example, New Mexico officials noted that they did not  always know what was required at each gate and likened the process to  \u201cbuilding a car as it is driving down the road.\u201d", "Overall, however, CMS\u2019s new approach for reviewing IT systems through  the Enterprise Life Cycle framework created some positive changes,  according to CMS and state officials. For example, prior to the framework,  CMS reviewed documents and monitored system functions after states  had implemented their new systems. Under these circumstances, any  deficiencies identified by CMS had to be adjusted before CMS would  approve any ongoing funding for system maintenance. According to CMS  and state officials, this retrospective review and certification was costly  and time consuming because it occurred after the changed systems were  operational. Officials from both New Mexico and Kansas agreed and  noted that the new gate review process allowed them to make technical  changes throughout the process rather than at the end, allowing for  improved project management. Officials from North Carolina, Kansas,  and New Mexico also noted that these reviews largely mirrored their  internal oversight processes, thus allowing them to use internal  documents to meet certain federal requirements and minimize duplicate  efforts."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this product to HHS for comment.
