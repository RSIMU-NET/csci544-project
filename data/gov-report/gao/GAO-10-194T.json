Although the board members had demonstrated active involvement in LSC through regular board meeting attendance and participation, we pointed out several areas where LSC's governance practices could be strengthened. LSC's management practices had also not kept up with the current practices for key processes in risk assessment, internal control, and financial reporting. We pointed out certain areas where management's practices could be strengthened. GAO concluded that a properly implemented governance and accountability structure might have prevented incidents, such as compensation rates in excess of statutory caps, questionable expenditures, and potential conflicts of interest. GAO made 12 recommendations - 8 to the board and 4 to management. LSC's management has implemented all 4 recommendations to improve its management practices. The board has fully implemented 3 recommendations, but it needs to take additional actions to fully implement the other 5 recommendations. For example, LSC's board has fully implemented the key recommendation to establish an audit committee. However, another key recommendation for the board to implement procedures to periodically evaluate key management processes has not yet been fully implemented. LSC told GAO that it plans to take additional actions to more fully address the five recommendations. In December 2007, GAO reported weaknesses in LSC's internal controls over grants management and oversight of grantees that negatively affected LSC's ability to provide assurance that grant funds were being used for their intended purposes in compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Effective internal controls over grants and grantee oversight are critical to accomplishing LSC's mission because it relies extensively on grantees to provide legal services to individuals who otherwise could not afford to pay for legal counsel. GAO made 5 recommendations to address these issues. LSC management fully implemented two of our report recommendations, including following up on identified improper or potentially improper uses of grants funds. However, LSC has only partially implemented three key recommendations, including only limited action to implement an approach for selecting grantees for review using consistently applied, risk-based criteria. In order to improve LSC's board and management's ability to maintain accountability over LSC's mission, it will be critical for LSC's board and management to maintain priority focus on fully implementing all remaining GAO recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["I am pleased to be here today to discuss our prior work on the Legal  Services Corporation\u2019s (LSC) governance, accountability, and grants  management practices and the status of LSC\u2019s efforts to address the  seventeen recommendations we made as a result of that work.", "Today I will highlight our key findings and conclusions from our prior  reports on LSC\u2019s governance and accountability practices, as well as the  internal control improvements needed in LSC grants management and  oversight. Our August and December 2007 reports contain a detailed  description of our findings, conclusions, and recommendations.

LSC pursues this mission by making grants to  legal service providers (grant recipients) who serve low-income members  of the community who would otherwise not be able to afford legal  assistance (clients). Established by a federal charter in 1974 as a federally  funded, private nonprofit corporation, LSC is highly dependent on federal  appropriations for its operations. LSC received $390 million in  appropriations for fiscal year 2009.

Governance can be described as the  process of providing leadership, direction, and accountability in fulfilling  the organization\u2019s mission, meeting objectives, and providing stewardship  of public resources, while establishing clear lines of responsibility for  results. Accountability represents the processes, mechanisms, and other  means\u2014including financial reporting and internal controls\u2014by which an  entity\u2019s management carries out its stewardship and responsibility for  resources and performance.

Those  standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain sufficient,  appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for our findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives. We believe the evidence  obtained provided a reasonable basis for our audit findings and  conclusions based on our audit objectives.

However, another key  recommendation directed at the board developing and implementing  procedures to periodically evaluate key management processes, has yet to  be developed and fully implemented. This recommendation is key in that it  contributes to establishing an effective, supporting internal control  environment at LSC as well as assists the board in fulfilling its oversight  duties.

The following summary highlights LSC actions and work that  remains to be done on the five recommendations that our analysis showed  were partially implemented.", "In response to our recommendation that the board establish and  implement a comprehensive orientation program, LSC created a \u201cwiki,\u201d  which contains relevant information for LSC board members. However,  LSC management informed us that they are waiting for the pending board  member nominations to be confirmed by the U.S. Senate prior to holding a  formal orientation program.  In response to our recommendation that the board develop a plan for  providing regular training. LSC\u2019s management informed us there have been  discussions about a training program and that the organizational updates  for training the board occurs during the quarterly board meetings and that  additional training needs of the board are determined by the self- assessments that the board members complete. LSC officials also stated  that since this is an overall experienced board, the recent self-assessments  did not indicate a need for training outside the organizational update.  Officials told us that LSC management is currently documenting a training  program, which we will evaluate when completed and implemented.", "We recommended that the board establish a compensation committee  function to oversee compensation matters including LSC officers and  LSC\u2019s overall compensation structure.

Such  an assessment provides a structure for implementing internal control and  other risk mitigation policies. In addition, senior management had not  established comprehensive policies or procedures regarding conflicts of  interest or other issues of ethical conduct. Without such policies and  procedures, LSC was at risk of not identifying potential conflicts of  interest and not taking appropriate actions to avoid potentially improper  transactions or actions on the part of LSC personnel.

At grantees we visited,  we also found poor fiscal practices and improper or potentially improper  expenditures that LSC could have identified with more effective oversight.  Although LSC has taken action to address two of the four  recommendations we made to management in our December 2007 report,  it has not yet implemented the two recommendations focused on oversight  of grantees use of funds. In order to strengthen the organizational  structure and governance of grantee oversight and monitoring, we made a  recommendation to the board to develop and implement policies that  clearly delineate organizational roles and responsibilities.", "In December 2007 we reported on weakness in LSC\u2019s control environment  regarding the lack of a clear definition of the authority and responsibilities  between two of the three organizational units that oversee the work of  grantees. At the time of our review, LSC management shared fiscal  oversight and monitoring of grantees with the OIG. Management\u2019s  oversight role was conducted through two offices\u2014the Office of Program  Performance (OPP) and the Office of Compliance and Enforcement  (OCE). We found that the roles and the division of responsibilities were  not clearly communicated between the OIG and OCE. The result was staff  confusion about the types and scope of grantee fiscal reviews that LSC  management could undertake on its initiative and strained relations  between management and the OIG. In addition, communication and  coordination between OCE and OPP was not sufficient to prevent gaps  and unnecessary duplication between the offices\u2019 respective oversight  activities.", "Regarding its oversight of grantees, the scope of LSC\u2019s control activities  for monitoring grantee fiscal compliance was limited and feedback to  grantees not timely. In determining the timing and scope of grantee  oversight visits, LSC did not employ a structured or systematic approach  for assessing the risk of noncompliance or financial control weaknesses  across its 137 grantees. Without an analytically sound basis for assessing  risk and distributing its oversight resources, LSC did not have a basis for  knowing whether its oversight resources were being used effectively to  mitigate and reduce risk among its grantees.", "LSC\u2019s monitoring of grantee internal control systems needed to be  strengthened, because the scope of work in OCE\u2019s fiscal reviews was not  sufficient in assessing grantee internal control and compliance for  purposes of achieving effective oversight. In the OCE site visits we  observed, staff did not follow up on questionable transactions and relied  heavily on information obtained through interviews. LSC also was not  timely in follow-up on an investigation into an alleged instance of  noncompliance referred to it by the OIG. Feedback to grantees was often  slow. As of September 2007, LSC had not yet issued reports to grantee  management for almost 19 percent (10 out of 53) of the 2006 site visits.  Without timely communications about the results of site visits, grantee  management does not have information about deficiencies and the related  corrective actions needed. In a grantee exit conference we observed, the  LSC review team did not communicate a number of findings they had  concluded were significant and in need of immediate attention. Effective  grantee monitoring is especially important for LSC because LSC has  limited options for sanctioning poorly performing grantees due to the  recurring nature of many of its grants.", "In the limited reviews we performed at 14 grantees, we identified internal  control weaknesses at 9 grantees that LSC could have identified with more  effective oversight reviews. While control deficiencies at the grantees were  the immediate cause of the improper expenditures we found, weaknesses  in LSC\u2019s controls over its oversight of grantees did not assure effective  monitoring of grantee controls and compliance or prevent the improper  expenditures. We also identified various weaknesses and improper  expenditures at grantees we visited. These weaknesses and improper  expenditures can result in a loss of credibility to the grantee and grantor  and also allow instances of fraud to take place if not addressed.", "Our December 2007 report recommendations to improve its internal  control and oversight of grantees, along with our views on the status of  LSC\u2019s efforts to implement those recommendations (as of October 20,  2009) are summarized in Table 3.", "As a result of our follow-up work conducted between May 2009 and  October 2009, we determined that LSC management had fully implemented  two of the four recommendations we made to management.

Although LSC officials told us that the risk- based criteria was issued, they have not provided us with sufficient  evidence to demonstrate that the criteria is consistently applied. We will  evaluate LSC\u2019s implementation as part of our current ongoing work.", "We recommended that LSC address three factors\u2014revise current  guidelines of fiscal compliance reviews to provide (1) a direct link of  results of OPP reviews and other audit findings, (2) guidance for  performing follow up responses during interviews, and (3) examples of  fiscal and internal control review procedures relative to individual risk  factors. LSC has updated its written guidelines for the fiscal component of  OCE\u2019s regulatory and compliance reviews; however, the updates do not  include the three factors. LSC officials told us they will analyze their  current manuals and incorporate interview guidelines and other  information as needed. We will reevaluate this recommendation after LSC  management completes its analysis.  In response to our recommendation that the board develop and implement  policies and procedures that clearly delineate organizational roles and  responsibilities for grantee oversight and monitoring, the board-approved  updated descriptions of organizational roles and responsibilities. However,  internal controls discussed in the board approved descriptions are limited  to fiscal internal controls and do not include operational or other internal  controls that OPP and OCE are responsible for monitoring. According to  LSC\u2019s management, the board\u2019s description combined with OPP and OCE  manuals and documents address more than fiscal internal controls.
