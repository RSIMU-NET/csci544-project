The International Labor Organization (ILO) adopted the Seafarers' Identity Documents Convention (ILO 185) to establish an international framework of seafarer identification documents and reduce their vulnerability to fraud and exploitation. GAO was asked to examine (1) measures federal agencies take to address risks posed by foreign seafarers and the challenges, if any, DHS faces; (2) the challenges, if any, DHS faces in tracking illegal entries by foreign seafarers and how it enforces penalties; and (3) the implementation status of ILO 185. GAO reviewed relevant requirements and agency documents on maritime security, interviewed federal and industry officials, and visited seven seaports based on volume of seafarer arrivals. The visits provided insights, but were not projectable to all seaports."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Federal agencies use a layered security strategy to address foreign seafarer risks, but opportunities exist to enhance DHS seafarer inspection methods. Federal actions include: (1) State Department screening of seafarer non-immigrant visa applicants overseas and (2) DHS advance screening of commercial vessels' seafarer manifests and admissibility inspections of all arriving seafarers. CBP conducts cargo vessel admissibility inspections on board the vessel without the benefit of tools to electronically verify a seafarer's identity or immigration status because of a lack of available connectivity to network communications in the maritime environment. DHS has prioritized the acquisition of a mobile version of this technology capability but expects it to take several years before the technology is developed and available. CBP agrees that obtaining this capability is important but has not assessed the risks of not having it. Until CBP obtains the capability, identifying the risks and options to address them could better position CBP in preventing illegal immigration at seaports. DHS faces challenges in ensuring it has reliable data on illegal entries by foreign seafarers at U.S. seaports and has not adjusted related civil monetary penalties. First, both CBP and Coast Guard track the frequency of absconder (a seafarer CBP has ordered detained on board a vessel in port, but who departs a vessel without permission) and deserter (a seafarer CBP grants permission to leave a vessel, but who does not return when required) incidents at U.S. seaports, but the records of these incidents varied considerably. The Coast Guard reported 73 percent more absconders and almost double the deserters compared to CBP for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. As a result, the data DHS uses to inform its strategic and tactical plans are of undetermined reliability. Second, CBP is responsible for imposing civil monetary penalties on vessel operators whose seafarers illegally enter the United States; however, as of December 2010, CBP and DOJ had not met legal requirements for adjusting the penalties for inflation. Officials reported taking steps to meet these requirements, but have not developed a plan with timelines for doing so. Such a plan would better position CBP and DOJ to demonstrate progress to comply with legal requirements. International implementation of ILO 185 has been limited--18 countries, representing 30 percent of the global seafarer supply, have ratified ILO 185--and key ILO mechanisms to promote compliance are not expected to be in place until later this year. As of January 2011, the United States had not ratified ILO 185 largely due to concerns over a provision for facilitating visa-free shore leave for foreign seafarers. Perspectives varied among the four federal agencies GAO interviewed within DHS and the departments of State, Transportation, and Labor. Within DHS, the Coast Guard reported that it supported U.S. ratification, while CBP stated that ILO 185's lack of oversight did not serve U.S. law enforcement interests. The U.S. has recently undertaken an interagency review to consider ratification but has no timeline for completion."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DHS assess risks of not electronically verifying cargo vessel seafarers for admissibility, identify reasons for absconder and deserter data variances, and, with the Department of Justice (DOJ), develop a plan with timelines to adjust civil monetary penalties for inflation.

In fiscal year 2009, maritime crew\u2014known as  seafarers\u2014made about 5 million entries into U.S. ports on commercial  cargo and cruise ship vessels. The overwhelming majority of the seafarers  entering U.S. ports are aliens. Because the U.S. government has no  control over foreign government seafarer credentialing practices,  concerns have been raised that extremists may fraudulently obtain  seafarer credentials as a way to gain entry into the United States or  conduct attacks against maritime vessels or port infrastructure. Although  there have been no reported terrorist attacks involving seafarers on  vessels transiting to U.S. seaports, the Department of Homeland Security  (DHS) considers the illegal entry of an alien through a U.S. seaport by  exploitation of maritime industry practices to be a key concern.", "Screening foreign seafarers to identify those who pose security threats to  the United States is a shared responsibility among federal stakeholders.  For example, overseas, State Department consular officers screen seafarer  applicants for non-immigrant visas\u2014a prerequisite to be eligible for a  permit to depart the vessel and enter the United States\u2014and may deny a  visa if, for example, they determine that an applicant poses a potential  security or immigration risk. Within DHS, U.S. Customs and Border  Protection (CBP), the unified federal agency responsible for border  security, inspects all seafarers arriving from foreign waters to determine  their admissibility into the United States and prevent illegal immigration at  U.S. seaports. CBP obtains key support from the Coast Guard, the lead  federal agency responsible for a wide array of maritime safety and security  activities.", "In 2003, the United States and other member states of the International  Labor Organization (ILO)\u2014a specialized agency of the United Nations\u2014 adopted the Seafarers\u2019 Identity Documents Convention (Revised) No. 185  (ILO 185). One goal of the Convention was to establish an international  framework for harmonizing seafarers\u2019 identity document (SID) issuance to  strengthen the reliability of the documents and reduce their potential  vulnerability to fraud and exploitation. To support this goal, among other  things, ILO 185 requires ratifying countries to adopt certain credential  features including fingerprint biometrics and issuance processes,  establishes database requirements to support validation of SIDs at ports of  entry, and establishes an oversight mechanism for assessing country  compliance.", "You requested that we review the security procedures federal agencies  take to identify and screen foreign seafarers arriving in U.S. seaports and  to analyze ILO 185 and its potential impact on U.S. maritime security. This  report answers three questions:    What measures do federal agencies take to address risks posed by foreign  seafarers transiting U.S. seaports, and what challenges, if any, does DHS  face in addressing these risks?", "What challenges, if any, has DHS faced in tracking incidents involving  illegal entry by foreign seafarers at U.S. seaports, and how does DHS  enforce penalties related to these incidents?", "What is the implementation status of ILO 185, including prospects for U.S.  ratification, and what are the perspectives of select international and  national stakeholders?", "To answer the first question, we analyzed relevant statutes, such as  provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) and the Maritime  Transportation Security Act (MTSA),  plus relevant regulations\u2014such as  DHS\u2019s Advanced Passenger Information System (APIS) rule and Coast  Guard\u2019s Advanced Notice of Arrival (ANOA) rule\u2014that set out  requirements for how DHS identifies, screens, inspects, and determines  admission of aliens to the United States. We also reviewed documentation  issued by the State Department and DHS for screening and inspecting  seafarers, including guidance and policy, memoranda, and strategic and  operational plans, as well as risk assessments prepared by DHS  components that detail threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences  associated with foreign seafarers on board vessels arriving at U.S.  seaports. To obtain information on federal screening and inspection  practices and intelligence information on risks identified, we interviewed  headquarters officials at relevant federal agencies at the State Department  (Consular Affairs) and DHS (CBP, Coast Guard, Immigration and Customs  Enforcement, Office of Policy, and Science and Technology Directorate).  We also visited or held teleconferences with CBP seaport field unit  officials and Coast Guard Sector officials responsible for security at a non- probability sample of eight domestic seaport areas. We visited officials at  seven of these locations (Baltimore, Maryland; Jacksonville, Florida; Los  Angeles/Long Beach, California; Miami, FL; New York/New Jersey;  Oakland/San Francisco, California; and Seattle/Tacoma, Washington) and  held a teleconference with officials from one additional port  (Houston/Galveston, Texas). We selected these eight seaports based on  the variety of foreign seafarer arrival activity (collectively, CBP reported  these ports received approximately 35 percent of fiscal year 2009 foreign  seafarer arrivals) and commercial vessel activity at the port\u2014i.e., cargo  and/or cruise vessel. During these visits, we interviewed CBP field unit and  Coast Guard Sector officials responsible for advance-screening and  seafarer inspections, and observed port operations, including seafarer  inspection activities. While the information we obtained from personnel at  these locations cannot be generalized across all U.S. seaports, it provided  us with a perspective on the potential risks posed by foreign seafarers  transiting to U.S. seaports and actions taken by federal agencies to address  those risks.", "To answer the second question, we reviewed and compared fiscal year  2005 through 2009 data of seafarer illegal immigration incidents at  seaports reported by (1) CBP headquarters and the eight CBP seaport field  units we contacted, and (2) Coast Guard headquarters and the eight  Sectors we contacted, as well as Coast Guard\u2019s two regional intelligence  centers that track maritime-security related events that occur in the  Pacific area and the Atlantic and Gulf Coast area. We then reviewed  guidance and memoranda issued by CBP and Coast Guard that detail  reporting and collection methods for the data, and challenges faced in  doing both. We interviewed headquarters and field officials about their  data collection and reporting methods and compared them with criteria in  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government, DHS policy  guidance for internal agency coordination and information sharing, and  the CBP and Coast Guard instructions for collecting and tracking data on  illegal seafarer entries. We assessed the reliability of these data by  reviewing CBP and Coast Guard data management practices for the data,  but found the data to be of undetermined reliability as discussed later in  this report. In addition, we reviewed statutes that apply to CBP and  Department of Justice authorities to issue and adjust civil monetary  penalties in cases involving illegal seafarer entries in violation of the INA,  and spoke with officials from both agencies about these authorities. We  reviewed the Federal Register to determine when the U.S. government last  adjusted the civil monetary penalties for cases involving seafarer-related  violations of the INA. We also reviewed CBP records of civil monetary  penalties assessed and collected for seafarer-related violations of the INA,  for fiscal years 2005 through 2009. We calculated what the difference in  these amounts would have been had the civil monetary penalties been  adjusted for inflation every 4 years, as required by law.", "To answer the third question, we reviewed ILO documents and  interviewed officials from the ILO and relevant federal agencies, including  the State Department, CBP, Coast Guard, the Department of Labor  (Labor), and the Department of Transportation\u2019s Maritime Administration  (DOT MARAD). We also developed and used a survey instrument to obtain  information from four foreign governments regarding views on ILO 185  and their practices for issuing identification or other credentials to  seafarers. We selected these countries based on two factors: (1) those that  are among the top 10 nations that supply seafarers on vessels transiting to  the United States and (2) a mix of nations that have ratified and not  ratified ILO 185. The results of our survey are not generalizable, but  provide perspectives from specific countries. Finally, we reviewed  documents and interviewed representatives from seven industry  organizations, including shipping companies and associations representing  ship owners and/or operators, and three labor organizations about issues  including their positions on ILO 185, standard practices for vetting and  hiring seafarers, and issues related to seafarer rights and access to shore  leave. In part, we selected these groups based on their involvement with  the ILO.", "We conducted this performance audit from December 2009 through  December 2010 in accordance with generally accepted government  auditing standards.

In  addition, millions of individuals transit U.S. seaports annually on cruise  ships, making the cruise industry a source of major economic activity. For  example, direct spending for goods and services by the cruise lines and  their passengers in the United States was about $19.1 billion in 2008. The  global labor supply of seafarers who work on commercial vessels to  support these types of activities is estimated at 1.2 to 2 million individuals.  This figure encompasses individuals required for normal operation and  service on board commercial vessels, including hospitality-related  occupations on cruise ships such as food servers and entertainers.", "Compared to the total number of arrivals at U.S. land and air ports of  entry, the number of foreign seafarers arriving in U.S. seaports is small.

This is because individual cruise ship routes typically  account for regular, frequent arrivals, and cruise ships typically employ  hundreds of seafarers, while cargo ships often have just a few dozen  seafarers on board. As a result, the seaports receiving the largest  numbers of seafarers were generally those that had cruise vessel  operations.

He further  noted that there is precedent for Coast Guard and other DHS agencies to  coordinate in tracking data that may provide both law enforcement and  intelligence value\u2014which may benefit both agencies in their absconder  and deserter reporting. For example, Coast Guard participates in an  existing interagency forum for coordinating data related to narcotics  seizures made in the maritime domain.

However, some organizations cited the cost of  developing SID systems as a significant obstacle to ratification for some  countries, particularly if the United States does not recognize the ILO 185  SIDs for shore leave."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Key Seafarer Suppliers Support Convention", "paragraphs": ["Officials from the four foreign governments we contacted\u2014which  collectively account for almost 30 percent of the supply of seafarers  transiting to U.S. ports\u2014reported that they support the Convention in  general. Of these four foreign governments, two have ratified the  Convention and two have not, although all issue specialized credentials to  their seafarers. The two non-ratifying countries reported that they are  considering ratification pending legal reviews. All four countries cited  greater facilitation of shore leave for seafarers as a benefit of the  Convention. This allowance, according to the countries, is an important  safety consideration and can also increase worker productivity. Officials  from these countries also cited the increased security features of cards,  more robust background checks of SID applicants, and potential access to  seafarer databases as benefits of the Convention.", "The increased cost of new SID systems is especially important given the  relatively low number of countries that have ratified the Convention to  date. For example, one country that ratified the Convention reported to us  that it had not yet begun to issue the more secure SIDs because the  positions on ILO 185 in a number of important countries are still unknown.  If holding an ILO 185 SID does not afford seafarers any greater benefit  than an older credential, particularly while in significant port countries  like the United States, there is a disincentive for countries to spend funds  upgrading their systems, according to officials from this country.

DHS guidance recommends components use both physical and electronic  methods for immigration inspections, but technology limitations have  reportedly been the primary challenge to implementing this guidance on  board cargo vessels. CBP has reported that electronic verification of  immigration status or travel documents is an important objective. While  this capability is unlikely to be available for several years, opportunities  exist for CBP action. By assessing the risks of relying on physical  inspection when conducting seafarer admissibility inspections on board  cargo vessels and identifying options to address these risks and their  costs, CBP could be in a better position to determine its course of action  for addressing these risks until the technology becomes available. In  addition, both CBP and Coast Guard have reported challenges with  respect to their reporting and tracking of the illegal entry events by  seafarers, known as absconders and deserters, and based on our overall  assessment, we found their data to be of undetermined reliability.  Moreover, Coast Guard and CBP records of these incidents vary  considerably, and consequently, DHS has no accurate and reliable  estimate to gauge the extent of the incidents. For each agency, (1)  conducting a study of reporting methods and challenges faced, including  why their records vary so considerably\u2014within and among the agencies\u2014 and (2) moving forward, establishing a process for the two agencies to  regularly share and reconcile these records could better position DHS in  developing a stronger maritime security strategy. Finally, CBP has not  increased its civil monetary penalties for seafarer-related immigration  violations, as required by law, in over a decade. Civil monetary penalties  are an important element of regulatory enforcement and can lose their  ability to deter if unadjusted for inflation. While CBP and DOJ reported  taking steps to meet requirements for inflation adjustment, the agencies  have not developed a plan including timelines for issuing required  regulation. Providing a plan with timelines for when this regulation will be  issued could provide DHS leadership and Congress with key information  and help ensure CBP fulfills regulatory requirements."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To facilitate better agency understanding of the potential need and  feasibility of expanding electronic verification of seafarers, to improve  data collection and sharing, and to comply with the Inflation Adjustment  Act, we are making four recommendations.", "We recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security:    direct the Commissioner of CBP to assess the national-security and other  risks faced by CBP in the absence of technology to provide electronic  verification as part of CBP\u2019s admissibility inspections for cargo vessel  seafarers and identify options for addressing these risks and their costs;    direct the Commandant of the Coast Guard and Commissioner of CBP to:    determine the reasons that absconder and deserter data varies between  headquarters and field units, and between the Coast Guard and CBP  and determine any actions necessary to address any variance; and  jointly establish an interagency process for sharing and reconciling  records of absconder and deserter incidents occurring at U.S. seaports.", "We further recommend that the Secretary of Homeland Security and the  Attorney General of the United States develop a plan with timelines for  issuing regulations, as required by the Inflation Adjustment Act, to adjust  civil monetary penalties associated with violations of the Immigration and  Nationality Act involving foreign seafarers gaining illegal entry into the  United States and provide this plan to Congress."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments and Our Evaluation", "paragraphs": ["We provided a draft of this report to the departments of State, Labor,  Transportation, Justice, and Homeland Security for their review and  comment.

DHS stated that CBP and the  Coast Guard would begin to asses the appropriate offices within each  component involved in the review and to establish a working group to  evaluate the current reporting process within each component, and  between CBP and Coast Guard. Further, in its technical comments, DHS  noted that it was working to co-locate the Coast Guard\u2019s ICC Coastwatch  and CBP\u2019s National Targeting Center-Passenger and that this would help  to eliminate many of the absconder- and deserter-reporting  inconsistencies GAO identified between Coast Guard and CBP.", "Regarding our recommendation that the Secretary of Homeland Security  and the Attorney General of the United States develop a plan with  timelines for issuing regulations, as required by the Inflation Adjustment  Act, to adjust civil monetary penalties associated with violations of the  Immigration and Nationality Act involving foreign seafarers gaining illegal  entry into the United States and provide this plan to Congress, both DHS  and DOJ concurred.

This screening process is designed to identify  individuals with potential terrorism links or criminal warrants and those  passengers and crew with potential immigration admissibility problems.  NTC-P uses an automated system\u2014known as the Automated Targeting  System-Passenger (ATS-P)\u2014to screen individuals against various data  sources.  If NTC-P identifies a potential match to a TSDB record during its  targeting, NTC-P refers the potential match to the FBI\u2019s Terrorist  Screening Center (TSC) for further vetting and confirmation. The TSC will  make the final determination that the individual is a positive or negative  match to the terrorist watchlist record. According to CBP officials, the  number of terrorist-positive matches are extremely small in the maritime  environment compared to those transiting to air and land ports of entry in  large part due to the relatively smaller population of travelers arriving at  seaports.", "Also at the national level, Coast Guard\u2019s ICC performs central screening of  the Advance Notice of Arrival (ANOA) to identify potential ties to criminal  or terrorist activity. Should the ICC identify potential ties, it will  disseminate the results of its screening to the Coast Guard at the seaport  location where the vessel will be arriving\u2014which will then be shared with  the local CBP field unit at that location.", "At the local seaport level, CBP field units also conduct advance-targeting  of crew and passenger manifest information. CBP Passenger Analysis  Units (PAU) review arrival manifests using the ATS-P to identify  individuals who pose security risks and warrant additional inspection. The  screening process by NTC-P and the PAU identifies persons of interest  prior to the inspection and provides support to the CBP field officer to  determine if a seafarer can be authorized temporary landing privileges in  the United States. PAU officers interact with both the NTC-P and the local  Coast Guard Sector if they identify seafarers posing potential security  concerns. Coast Guard Sectors rely on the ICC and CBP for information  regarding any persons of interest and guidance on what actions to take  based on the nature of the concern.", "CBP NTC-P officials reported that while NTC-P and local PAU\u2019s generally  reviewed similar information, they played complementary roles in  identifying potential crewmember risks. For example, NTC-P has access to  more terrorist-screening resources than do most local PAU\u2019s and the NTC- P is staffed with officials from other law enforcement agencies, such as  the FBI.
