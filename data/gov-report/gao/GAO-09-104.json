Receiving nearly 30 million calls in 2007, 1-800-MEDICARE, operated by a contractor, is the most common way members of the public get program information. The help line provides services both to English-speaking and limited English proficiency (LEP) callers. In this report, GAO describes (1) the extent to which access performance standards and targets have been met by the current contractor, (2) the efforts by CMS to provide LEP callers access to help line services and wait times experienced by these callers, and (3) CMS's oversight of callers' access to 1-800-MEDICARE and the information's accuracy. To conduct this work, GAO reviewed documents and analyzed help line data through July 2008. In addition, GAO interviewed agency staff, industry experts, and officials at four federal agencies with high call volume contact centers."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The 1-800-MEDICARE contractor met most standards and some targets for the required telephone performance metrics and indicators CMS designed to ensure callers' access--from July 2007 through July 2008. The 1-800-MEDICARE contractor's performance met the standard for each of the three access-related metrics--the average amount of time callers wait to reach customer service representatives (CSR), the percent of unhandled calls, such as abandoned calls, and the percent of calls transferred among CSRs--in 10 of 13 months analyzed. Because of waivers granted by CMS, the contractor was considered by the agency to have met the standards in 12 of 13 months. During that time, the contractor met the target for only one of three access-related indicators--the percent of CSRs answering calls. Other indicators were the average amount of time needed to respond to callers' inquiries and the accuracy of CSR call volume forecasting. CMS's efforts to provide LEP callers with access have led to shorter average wait times for Spanish-speaking callers, but are not consistent with all elements of the HHS LEP Plan. CMS requires its help line contractor to provide services to Spanish-speaking callers by employing bilingual CSRs and to provide interpretation services for other LEP callers, which the contractor does by using telephone interpreters. In 20 of the 32 months reviewed, Spanish-speaking callers waited less time, on average, to reach a CSR than English-speaking callers. CMS officials with primary responsibility for 1-800-MEDICARE said they were not aware of the LEP Plan when awarding the current contract, and CMS has not identified an office responsible for acting as a point of contact for management of the LEP Plan. Without a responsible office or official, an internal control for federal agencies, CMS staff lack a source of guidance to assist them in taking steps consistent with the LEP Plan when considering the needs of people with LEP. However, CMS has taken steps consistent with some elements of the agency's adopted LEP Plan, such as the element related to oral language assistance, but not others, such as the element identifying the need for complaint mechanisms for language issues. To oversee 1-800-MEDICARE callers' access to services and accurate information, CMS uses all six commonly used contact center management practices. Based on GAO's review of the literature and interviews with federal agencies and industry experts, these management practices are: (1) clearly defining performance metrics, (2) performing accurate capacity planning, (3) conducting customer satisfaction surveys, (4) ensuring information for CSRs to reference is accurate, (5) evaluating CSRs' interaction with callers, and (6) validating contact center performance reports. These practices are addressed in the current 1-800-MEDICARE contract and reflected in CMS's ongoing contract oversight."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The nearly 45 million elderly and disabled Medicare beneficiaries face a  complex set of coverage choices. For example, they must choose whether  to participate in the original Medicare fee-for-service program or obtain  coverage from private health plans that contract with Medicare, and  whether to obtain Medicare coverage for outpatient prescription drugs.  These choices require them to obtain information about the comparative  benefits, costs, and quality of available options. Additionally, once enrolled  and receiving services, Medicare beneficiaries may seek additional  information about their coverage, such as the status of payments for  services or whether their health plan benefits have changed.", "The Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 (HHS) Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers  Medicare, is responsible for providing clear, accurate, and timely  information about this complex program. In March 1999, CMS  implemented a nationwide toll-free telephone help line\u20141-800- MEDICARE\u2014that beneficiaries, their families, and other members of the  public can call to ask questions about Medicare. 1-800-MEDICARE, which  is operated by a contractor, is now the most common way beneficiaries  and other interested members of the public get information from CMS  about Medicare, with the help line receiving more than 30 million calls in  2007. The help line operates 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, with calls first  answered by an automated system and then routed to a customer service  representative (CSR), if requested, for more specific inquiries about  Medicare benefits.", "The 1-800-MEDICARE help line provides assistance both to English- and  non-English-speaking callers\u2014in 2007, approximately 1 million callers of  the more than 30 million total callers were assisted in a language other  than English. Among non-English-speaking callers, Spanish was the most  requested language, representing about 98 percent of all non-English- speaking callers to 1-800-MEDICARE in 2007. HHS, like other federal  agencies, is required by Executive Order 13166 to examine the services it  provides and develop and implement a system by which people with  limited English proficiency (LEP) can meaningfully access federally  conducted programs and activities, such as the 1-800-MEDICARE help  line. The executive order also requires federal agencies, including HHS, to  prepare a plan identifying the steps they will take to ensure meaningful  access by people with LEP to such activities.", "Since the launch of the help line in 1999, changes to the Medicare program  have required CMS to provide more information through 1-800- MEDICARE. For example, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement,  and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) created a voluntary outpatient  prescription drug program for Medicare beneficiaries and required  information on this new program to be made available through 1-800- MEDICARE. This and other changes to the Medicare program have  resulted in increases in the number of calls received by 1-800-MEDICARE.  Additionally, while in the past two contractors operated 1-800-MEDICARE,  in October 2006 CMS opted to begin using a single contractor in an effort  to be more efficient, according to CMS officials. This single contractor  assumed responsibility for 1-800-MEDICARE operations as of October 30,  2006. CMS monitors the contractor\u2019s performance using metrics and  indicators with corresponding performance standards and targets.", "Given the complexity of Medicare benefits, it is important that callers  contacting 1-800-MEDICARE be able to access timely and accurate  information as they make health care decisions. You asked us to provide  information on the extent to which 1-800-MEDICARE provides timely  services to callers, including LEP callers, and how CMS oversees the  current 1-800-MEDICARE contractor. In this report, we describe (1) the  extent to which performance standards and targets designed by CMS to  ensure caller access have been met by the current 1-800-MEDICARE  contractor and the extent to which the time a caller waits to reach a CSR  has varied, (2) the efforts by CMS to provide LEP callers access to 1-800- MEDICARE services and the wait times experienced by these callers, and  (3) CMS\u2019s oversight of callers\u2019 access to 1-800-MEDICARE and the  accuracy of the information provided.", "To describe the extent to which performance standards and targets  designed by CMS to ensure caller access have been met by the current   1-800-MEDICARE contractor and the extent of efforts by CMS to provide  LEP callers access to 1-800-MEDICARE, we reviewed documents related  to 1-800-MEDICARE access requirements, including both the prior and  current 1-800-MEDICARE contract and other related contracts. We also  interviewed staff from the CMS office with primary responsibility for   1-800-MEDICARE. We used these documents and interviews to identify the  metrics and indicators and their corresponding standards and targets\u2014 criteria used to measure the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor\u2019s performance\u2014 that we considered to be most closely associated with caller access. In  conducting our work, we focused on telephone services provided by 1-800- MEDICARE and did not review requirements for information provided  through other communication channels, such as e-mail. Using data from  CMS\u2019s National Data Warehouse (NDW) on calls received by 1-800- MEDICARE, we compared the selected performance metrics and  indicators to the contractor\u2019s actual performance. We also used these data  to examine changes in the amount of time callers waited to reach a CSR.  To assess the reliability of the NDW data used, we reviewed CMS  documents describing how the data are collected and CMS\u2019s efforts to  ensure data reliability. We also interviewed CMS officials responsible for  collecting and analyzing the data and conducted a series of tests on the  data files CMS provided. We determined the data were sufficiently reliable  for the purposes of this report and reviewed data for three primary  periods:    December 2005 through July 2008.

We also interviewed staff from  the HHS Office for Civil Rights and the CMS Office of Equal Opportunity  and Civil Rights. Additionally, we reviewed GAO work related to internal  control standards when considering implementation of the LEP Plan.  While we reviewed certain 1-800-MEDICARE activities to identify steps  consistent with the LEP Plan, we did not review all CMS and 1-800- MEDICARE activities for consistency with the LEP Plan.", "To describe how CMS oversees callers\u2019 access to, and the accuracy of  information provided by, 1-800-MEDICARE, we identified six common  oversight practices used by contact centers to ensure both caller access  and information accuracy. To identify these practices, we reviewed prior  GAO work and federal publications related to contact centers and  conducted interviews with four federal agencies that receive inquiries  about their services by telephone and with contact center industry  experts. We selected federal agency contact centers to interview based  on our review of prior related GAO work, selecting those that had annual  call volumes greater than 5 million calls and other characteristics similar  to those of 1-800-MEDICARE, such as a comparable population, extended  hours, periods of particularly high call volume, and service provision in  multiple languages. Using our review of publications and the interviews  with our selected federal contact centers, we identified the six common  oversight practices, which we then confirmed in interviews with industry  experts and an industry publication. To determine whether CMS used  these common oversight practices, we reviewed documents related to  CMS\u2019s oversight of the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor, including meeting  minutes, policies and procedures, and contractor evaluations, and  interviewed CMS officials. We also conducted a site visit to one of the five  1-800-MEDICARE contact center sites to gain a better understanding of  how the centers function. In addition, we reviewed a contract awarded by  CMS in December 2007 to a separate contractor\u2014referred to as the  Training, Quality, and Content (TQC) contractor\u2014responsible for  developing CSR training materials and for conducting quality assurance  efforts for 1-800-MEDICARE. We interviewed officials both from CMS and  the current 1-800-MEDICARE contractor to determine steps the TQC  contractor is taking to assume responsibility for these activities.

CMS granted the waiver for  one month\u2019s unhandled CSR call rate standard because of changes during  that month in its expectations of the contractor\u2019s performance. Though the  performance metric standard was not changed, CMS encouraged the  contractor to keep its average wait time below 8 minutes. To do this, the  contractor increased the number of callbacks\u2014instances in which callers  are called back within 48 hours rather than remaining on hold. Because  CMS includes callbacks in the unhandled CSR call metric, in this month  the contractor exceeded the unhandled CSR call standard. An expert in  federal call centers indicated that the unhandled call rate standard used by  CMS was high compared to some other federal agencies, but that these  performance standards are usually based on what level of service an  agency can afford to purchase with its contact center budget.", "Transfer rate. Transfers from one CSR to another occurred for no more  than 20 percent of calls in each of the 13 months of data we analyzed,  meeting the contractually required performance standard. While CMS  officials said that they expect some transfers to occur normally, they also  said a monthly transfer rate that exceeds 20 percent may imply that CSRs  are inappropriately transferring callers. CSRs transferred nearly 13 percent  of calls in July 2007, but the transfer rate increased to just under   20 percent by October 2007. Since October 2007, the transfer rate has  generally decreased, with the lowest percentage of transferred calls of the  10 months we studied occurring in June 2008.

These practices are addressed in  the current 1-800-MEDICARE contract and reflected in CMS\u2019s ongoing  oversight of the help line. For example, CMS awarded some of the  available award fee to the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor for meeting certain  performance metrics and used CSR feedback to improve the oversight of  information CSRs provide to beneficiaries. In addition, CMS used  customer satisfaction surveys to identify areas for improvement, including  the IVR, and worked with the contractor to improve call volume  forecasting in an effort to ensure appropriate staffing levels to meet  callers\u2019 needs.", "Clearly defining performance metrics and indicators. The  performance metrics and indicators that CMS officials said they designed  to encourage improved performance and correct identified problems are  clearly defined in the 1-800-MEDICARE contract. The current 1-800- MEDICARE contract identifies each metric and indicator, provides a  definition for these measures, and sets a standard or target for each  measure. CMS uses these measures to evaluate contractor performance  three times a year and to provide an award fee if the contractor performs  at or above set levels. Because the contractor did not meet all standards  and targets for any evaluation period as of May 2008, CMS has awarded  only part of the possible award fee to date, in accordance with the award  guidance in the 1-800-MEDICARE contract. Award fees are based on a  scoring system, in which a percentage of the award fee is distributed  depending on CMS\u2019s rating of the contractor\u2019s performance, ranging from  the lowest rating, substandard, to the highest rating, superior. CMS rated  the contractor as good or very good from the start of the current contract  through May 2008.", "CMS also uses the performance metrics and indicators on a continuous  basis to monitor and evaluate callers\u2019 ability to access information from   1-800-MEDICARE. For example, CMS officials said they receive updates  from the contractor on the average wait times\u2014a measure of caller  access\u2014through daily e-mails. If callers\u2019 average wait time exceeds   5 minutes, CMS officials receive e-mail notification every half hour. During  that time, CMS officials said the contractor also notifies them of actions it  is taking to improve caller wait times.", "Customer satisfaction surveys. CMS officials said they use the results  of customer satisfaction surveys to gain insight into callers\u2019 experiences  with 1-800-MEDICARE services and to identify opportunities for  improving services. In June 2008, the TQC contractor assumed  responsibility for conducting a customer satisfaction survey of 20 percent  of randomly selected 1-800-MEDICARE callers. The TQC contractor will  provide CMS with the results from this survey on an ongoing basis;  however, initial results were not available as of May 2008. Prior to June  2008, CMS required the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor to call back  randomly selected beneficiaries who contacted 1-800-MEDICARE and  administer a customer satisfaction survey developed by CMS. CMS  officials said they used the information from the surveys to make changes  to 1-800-MEDICARE. For example, based on survey participant concerns  about the IVR, which is used by 18 to 20 percent of callers to resolve their  inquiries, CMS officials indicated they made changes to the IVR prompts to  make them easier to follow. CMS officials said that they anticipate future  callers to 1-800-MEDICARE will be more willing to use technologies such  as the IVR to obtain information. However, as of November 2008, only  limited testing and focus groups had been conducted to confirm this  anticipated trend.", "Ensuring accurate information. To ensure that beneficiaries receive  consistent and accurate program information, CSRs are required to use  scripts approved by the agency and CMS, and contractor officials reported  taking steps designed to make correct scripts easier for CSRs to identify  and to make scripts easier to understand. In April 2008, the TQC  contractor began developing content for 1-800-MEDICARE scripts, which  previously had been developed by the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor and  reviewed by CMS. The TQC contractor employs staff with expertise in  Medicare who develop and revise scripts as needed. CMS reviews and  approves all scripts before making them available to CSRs. According to  CMS officials, in August 2008 the TQC contractor began quarterly script  reviews for accuracy as well as legislative, program, or policy changes. In  addition to reviews conducted by the TQC contractor, CMS officials said  that they have used the results of customer satisfaction surveys and call  evaluations to assess how well scripts meet the needs of callers and how  easy scripts are for CSRs to find. CMS can also access a computer  application that captures CSR feedback on scripts, including how easy  scripts are to understand, an issue identified in previous GAO work.", "Evaluating CSR interaction with callers. To assess whether callers  receive consistent and accurate information from 1-800-MEDICARE, CMS  requires both the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor and the TQC contractor to  evaluate CSRs\u2019 interactions with callers through call monitoring. The   1-800-MEDICARE contractor listens to four calls a month for each CSR,  evaluating the CSRs\u2019 performance on customer service skills identified by  CMS, including tone, using scripts appropriately, and completeness of  information provided. CMS officials said they designed the 1-800- MEDICARE contractor\u2019s call evaluation process for contractor supervisors  to coach CSRs on their performance and to help improve CSRs\u2019 ability to  use software to find appropriate scripts. The 1-800-MEDICARE contractor  has reported on the required evaluations monthly. Using these evaluation  reports, CMS officials said, they worked with the 1-800-MEDICARE  contractor to identify and correct trends or issues with scripts, software,  or CSR training. For example, CMS used the call evaluation process to  determine the reasons why callers may need to be transferred to a more  experienced CSR or place another call to 1-800-MEDICARE. This analysis  was part of the \u201cFirst Call Resolution Initiative,\u201d an effort to increase the  number of callers who have their inquiries resolved with one phone call  rather than many. However, in its evaluation of the 1-800-MEDICARE  contractor for the period ending May 2008, CMS reported that it observed  callers receiving poor service from CSRs who received perfect call  evaluation scores from the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor for those calls.  CMS noted the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor needed to improve  consistency between actual CSR call evaluation scores and the quality of  service callers receive.", "In addition, since April 1, 2008, CMS has required the TQC contractor each  month to monitor and evaluate 600 randomly selected calls in English and  225 randomly selected calls in Spanish. This call sample is designed to  allow CMS to generalize trends that emerge from this sample to the call  volume of 1-800-MEDICARE as a whole. CMS officials said they anticipate  analyzing any trends identified from this call monitoring to note areas for  improvement to the 1-800-MEDICARE help line. CMS officials also said  that they will use the results of the TQC scores as part of the 1-800- MEDICARE contractor\u2019s regular performance evaluation and resulting  award payment beginning in October 2008. In addition, CMS officials  reported monitoring calls themselves and meeting weekly with the 1-800- MEDICARE and TQC contractors to listen to and rate recorded calls as a  group. CMS officials said that these meetings help to ensure that the  contractors understand the standard of service CMS expects callers to  receive. CMS officials also planned to perform similar evaluations on calls  for which customer satisfaction survey information is available\u2014a  practice identified by an industry expert as a method to improve contact  center service.", "Capacity planning. CMS officials said they work with the 1-800- MEDICARE contractor to create short- and long-term call volume  forecasts and to determine whether systems and staffing can handle call  volume, taking into account Medicare\u2019s annual coordinated election and  open enrollment periods when inquiries peak. CMS requires the 1-800- MEDICARE contractor to produce call volume forecasts that are accurate  within 10 percent of actual call volumes for the forecasted period. CMS  oversight of the contractor\u2019s forecasting efforts has identified significant  differences between the long-term forecasts and actual monthly volume of  calls going to CSRs\u2014forecasting up to 35 percent more calls than were  actually received by CSRs for the performance period ending January 2008  and causing projected staffing costs for this period to be overstated. In its  evaluation of the performance period ending January 2008, CMS notified  the contractor that performance in this area needed to improve and stated  that it wanted the contractor to identify methods of ensuring consistent  and accurate forecasts. However, CMS noted that when the forecasted call  volume was not realized, the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor adjusted its  staffing so that only the number of CSRs needed to meet the performance  standard related to average wait times were available. In its evaluation for  the period ending May 2008, CMS noted a significant improvement in long- term forecasting and indicated that the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor had a  better understanding of events that affected call volume throughout the  year.", "To ensure that 1-800-MEDICARE systems, such as phone lines and  desktop software, are available to handle forecasted call volumes, CMS  requires the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor to notify the agency of systems  outage incidents that affect callers\u2019 access. In the evaluation period ending  January 2008, CMS identified inconsistencies in the outage reporting  process, which caused key information to be omitted from reports about  systems outage incidents. In its evaluation for the period ending May 2008,  CMS noted some improvement in reporting systems outage incidents, but  indicated that the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor needed to improve the  consistency of its reporting practices in the future. CMS officials said they  are working with the contractor to address this issue and reported  finalizing a process for reporting systems outages in early November 2008.", "Validation of contractor reports. CMS officials said they validate  contractor reports\u2014many of which are used to determine contract award  fees\u2014by analyzing data captured by 1-800-MEDICARE computer systems  and having regular meetings with their contractors. To ensure the integrity  of data collected by 1-800-MEDICARE systems, CMS collects and stores  these data in the NDW, which is managed by a separate contractor. CMS  officials compare data from the NDW on the actual call center  performance to reports submitted by the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor,  such as the long-term call volume forecasts. Using this method of  validating reports, CMS determined that the 1-800-MEDICARE contractor\u2019s  forecasting reports were inaccurate and required the contractor to  improve in this area, which the contractor did over the next evaluation  period. In addition to validating contractor reports through the NDW, CMS  officials said they used weekly and monthly status reports, meetings with  contractors, and visits to 1-800-MEDICARE contractor sites to monitor  contractor performance between periodic evaluations."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["To date, the current 1-800-MEDICARE contractor has met most of CMS\u2019s  performance standards and some of the performance targets designed to  ensure callers\u2019 access to services from the help line.

The agency reiterated that  these issues were affected by the transition, completed in 2007, of claims  calls previously answered by FFS contractors to 1-800-MEDICARE. CMS  also stated that its intent is to try to fully answer callers\u2019 questions rather  than focusing exclusively on reducing average handle time\u2014the average  amount of time CSRs take to respond to callers\u2019 inquiries. Additionally,  CMS stated that while it has not specifically evaluated the number or  proportion of LEP beneficiaries who are Medicare eligible and enrolled, it  continues to review demand and consider other opportunities to best  serve LEP callers. Finally, CMS noted that some information regarding the  1-800-MEDICARE contractor\u2019s operations and contract with the agency  are considered proprietary.", "As agreed with your office, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date.
