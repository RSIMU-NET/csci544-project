These practices were intended to address  what the committee termed a poor level of protection afforded to  privacy under then-existing law, and they underlie the major  provisions of the Privacy Act, which was enacted the followin g year.  A revised version of the Fair Information Practices was developed in  1980 by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and  Development (OECD) and has been widely adopted. This version of  tecting  the principles was reaffirmed by OECD ministers in a 1998  declaration and further endorsed in a 2006 OECD report.

The act describes a \u201crecord\u201d as any item, collection, or  grouping of information about an individual that is maintained by an  agency and contains his or her name or another personal identifier.  It also defines a \u201csystem of records\u201d as a group of records under the  control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the  name of the individual or by an individual identifier. The Privacy Act  requires that when agencies establish or make changes to a system  of records, they must notify the public through a system-of-records  notice in the Federal Register that identifies, among other things,  the categories of data collected, the categories of individuals about  whom information is collected, the intended \u201croutine\u201d uses of data,  and procedures that individuals can use to review and correct  personally identifiable information.", "Several provisions of the act require agencies to define and limit  collection and use to predefined purposes. For example, the act  requires that, to the greatest extent practicable, personal  information should be collected directly from the subject individual  when it may affect that individual\u2019s rights or benefits under a federal  program. The act also requires that an agency inform individuals  whom it asks to supply information of (1) the authority for soliciting  the information and whether disclosure of such information is  mandatory or voluntary; (2) the principal purposes for which the  information is intended to be used; (3) the routine uses that may be  made of the information; and (4) the effects on the individual, if any,  of not providing the information. According to OMB, this  requirement is based on the assumption that individuals should be  provided with sufficient information about the request to make a  decision about whether to respond.", "In handling collected information, agencies are generally required by  the Privacy Act to, among other things, allow individuals to  (1) review their records (meaning any information pertaining to  them that is contained in the system of records), (2) request a copy  of their record or information from the system of records, and  (3) request corrections to their information.", "Agencies are allowed to claim exemptions from some of the  provisions of the Privacy Act if the records are used for certain  purposes. For example, records compiled by law enforcement  agencies for criminal law enforcement purposes can be exempt  from a number of provisions, including (1) the requirement to notify  individuals of the purposes and uses of the information at the time  of collection and (2) the requirement to ensure the accuracy,  relevance, timeliness, and completeness of records. A broader  category of investigative records compiled for criminal or civil law  enforcement purposes can also be exempted from a somewhat  smaller number of Privacy Act provisions, including the requirement  to provide individuals with access to their records and to inform the  public of the categories of sources of records. In general, the  exemptions for law enforcement purposes are intended to prevent  the disclosure of information collected as part of an ongoing  investigation that could impair the investigation or allow those  under investigation to change their behavior or take other actions to  escape prosecution.", "In 2002, Congress enacted the E-Government Act to, among other  things, enhance protection for personal information in government  information systems or information collections by requiring that  agencies conduct privacy impact assessments, which are analyses of  how personal information is collected, stored, shared, and managed  in a federal system.", "In addition, the Paperwork Reduction Act applies to federal  information collections and was designed to help ensure that when  the government asks the public for information, the burden of  providing this information is as small as possible and the  information itself is used effectively. Among the act\u2019s provisions is  the requirement that agencies not establish information collections  without having them approved by OMB, and that before submitting  them for approval, agencies\u2019 chief information officers certify that  the collections meet 10 specified standards. The law also requires  agencies both to publish notices in the Federal Register and to  otherwise consult with the public about their planned collections.", "Privacy is also addressed in the legal framework for the emerging  information sharing environment. As directed by the Intelligence  Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, the administration  has taken steps, beginning in 2005, to establish an information  sharing environment to facilitate the sharing of terrorism-related  information. The move was driven by the recognition that before  the attacks of September 11, 2001, federal agencies had been unable  to effectively share information about suspected terrorists and their  activities. In addressing this problem, the National Commission on  Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States (9/11 Commission)  recommended that the sharing and uses of information be guided by  a set of practical policy guidelines that would simultaneously  empower and constrain officials, closely circumscribing what types  of information they would be permitted to share as well as the types  of information they would need to protect. Exchanging terrorism- related information continues to be a significant challenge for  federal, state, and local governments\u2014one that we recognize is not  easily addressed.

There are several different ways in which  federal collection and use of personally identifiable information  could be outside of such a construct and thus not receive the  Privacy Act\u2019s protections, as shown by the following examples:  Personally identifiable information held by the government is  not  always retrieved by identifier. The Privacy Act defines a system of  records as \u201ca group of records\u201d that is \u201cunder the control of any  agency from which information is retrieved by the name of the  individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or other  identifying particular assigned to the individual.\u201d If personally  identifiable information (records) is not retrieved by identifier but  instead accessed through some other method or criteria\u2014for  example, by searching for all individuals who have a certain medical  condition or who applied for benefits on a certain date\u2014the system  would not meet the Privacy Act\u2019s system-of-records definition and  therefore would not be governed by the act\u2019s protections.

A key characteristic of agencies\u2019 systems  of records at the time was that a large proportion of them were  electronic, reflecting the government\u2019s significant use of computers  and the Internet to collect and share personal information. Based on  survey responses from 25 agencies in 2002, we estimated that 70  percent of the agencies\u2019 systems of records contained electronic  records and that 11 percent of information systems in use at those  agencies contained personal information that was outside a Privacy  Act system of records. We also reported that among the agencies we  surveyed, the most frequently cited reason for systems not being  considered Privacy Act systems of records was that the agency did  not use a personal identifier to retrieve the personal information.\u25cf  The Privacy Act\u2019s protections may not apply to contemporary data  processing technologies and applications. In today\u2019s highly  interconnected environment, information can be gathered from  many different sources, analyzed, and redistributed in very dy unstructured ways that may have little to do with the file-oriente concept of a Privacy Act system of records. For example, data  mining, a prevalent technique used by federal agencies for  extracting useful information from large volumes of data, may  escape the purview of the Privacy Act\u2019s protections. Speci data-mining system that performs analysis by looking for patter personal information located in other systems of records or that  performs subject-based queries across multiple data sources may  not constitute a system of records under the act.", "In recent years, reports required by law on data mining have  described activities that had not been identified as systems of  records covered by the Privacy Act. In one example, DHS rep that all the data sources for the planned Analysis Dissemination  Visualization Insight and Semantic Enhancement (ADVISE) data  mining program were covered by existing system-of-records noti however, the system itself was not covered, and no system of  records notice was created specifically to document protections  under the Privacy Act governing the specific activities of the  system.

The Federal Register Web site does not  provide a ready means of determining what system-of-records  notices are current, when they were last updated, or which ones  apply to any specific governmental function. Officials agreed that it  can be difficult to locate a system-of-records notice on the Federal  Register Web site, even when the name of the relevant system of  records is known in advance. Privacy experts at our forum likewise  agreed that the Federal Register is probably not effective with the  general public and that a more effective technique for reaching a  wide audience in today\u2019s environment is via consolidated  publication on a governmentwide Web site devoted to privacy. Both  agency officials and privacy experts also agreed, however, that the  Federal Register serves a separate but important role as the official  public record of federal agencies and as the official basis for  soliciting comments from the public on proposed systems of  records.", "Based on discussions with privacy experts, agency officials, and  analysis of laws and related guidance, a number of options ex improving public notice regarding federal collection and use of  personal information:   Require layered public notices in conjunction with system-of- records notices. Layering involves providing only the most  important summary facts up front\u2014often in a graphically orient format\u2014followed by on e or more lengthier, more narrative versions.", "By offering both types of notices, the benefits of each can be  realized: long notices offer completeness, while brief notice ease of understanding.", "Set requirements to ensure that purpose, collection limitations,  and use limitations are better addressed in the content of pr ivacy  notices. These could include requirements for a specific descriptionof the planned purpose  of a system, what data needs to be collected  to serve that purpose, and how its use will be limited to that  purpose, including descriptions of primary and secondary uses of  information. Setting these requirements could spur agencies to  prepare notices that include more meaningful descriptions of the  intents and purposes of their systems of records.", "Make all notices available on a governmentwide privacy Web site Relevant privacy notices could be published at a central  governmentwide location, with an address such as  www.privacy.gov, and at corresponding standard  agency Web sites with addresses of the form  www.agency.gov/privacy.

Regarding alternatives for revising the scope of laws to cover all  personally identifiable information collected, used, and main by the federal government, OMB stated that it would be import for Congress to evaluate fully the potential implications of revisio ns  such as amending the Privacy Act\u2019s system-of-records definition. Webelieve that, given that the Privacy Act\u2019s controls on the collection, use, and disclosure of personally identifiable information do not  consistently protect such information in all circumstances of its  collection and use throughout the federal government, amending theact\u2019s definition of a system of records is an important alternative  for  Congress to consider.", "We agree with OMB, however, that any consideration of  amendments to the Privacy Act and E-Government Act should be  considered thoroughly and within the context of all existing laws.
