HCFA\u2019s leadership in this area is important. The agency is responsible for approving all of the information that MCOs distribute and has the authority to set standards for that information. By successfully fulfilling this responsibility, HCFA can help make certain that MCOs provide the information that beneficiaries need to make informed health plan choices and understand their rights under Medicare managed care.", "MCOs\u2019 Medicare plans differ from one another in the services they cover and the fees they charge. At a minimum, plans must provide all Medicare-covered services, but many plans cover additional services, such as outpatient prescription drugs and routine physical examinations. Some plans charge a monthly premium (in addition to Medicare\u2019s part B premium), but others do not. Although the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) required HCFA to make available some basic comparative plan information, the membership literature that MCOs distribute remains the only source of detailed information that beneficiaries have about plans\u2019 fees and covered services. This information helps beneficiaries select a plan that fits their needs. Once they are enrolled, this information helps shape their understanding of their plan\u2019s obligations to its members. In addition, MCOs distribute other plan information that can affect the extent to which beneficiaries understand their rights, such as complaints about plan care. Consequently, it is vital that beneficiaries trust the plan information that they receive from MCOs and that HCFA ensures that their trust is not misplaced. currently enrolled in managed care plans. Informed choices will be particularly important as BBA phases out the opportunity for beneficiaries to disenroll from a plan on a monthly basis and moves toward the private sector practice of annual reconsideration of plan choice.", "My comments today will focus on (1) the accuracy, completeness, and usefulness of the information Medicare MCOs distribute about their plans\u2019 benefit packages; (2) the extent to which MCOs inform beneficiaries of their plan appeal rights and the appeals process; and (3) HCFA\u2019s review, approval, and oversight of the plan information that MCOs distribute. My remarks are based on two recently released reports done for this Committee.", "In brief, we found problems with the benefit information distributed by all of the 16 MCOs we reviewed. For example, although HCFA had reviewed and approved all of the information we examined, some MCOs misstated the coverage they were required by Medicare or their contracts to offer. One MCO advertised a substantially less generous prescription drug benefit than it had specified in its Medicare contract. In addition, some MCOs provided complete benefit information only after a beneficiary enrolled; others never provided full descriptions of benefits and restrictions. Finally, as we have reported previously, it is difficult to compare available options using literature provided to beneficiaries because MCOs use different formats and terminology to describe the benefit packages being offered. The variation in Medicare plan literature contrasts sharply with the uniformity of plan information distributed by MCOs that participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP). MCOs participating in FEHBP are required to provide prospective enrollees with a single, comprehensive, and comparable brochure to facilitate informed choice. skilled nursing care. This delay can increase a beneficiary\u2019s potential financial liability should the beneficiary appeal the plan\u2019s decision and lose.", "Many of the information problems we identified regarding plan benefit packages and beneficiaries\u2019 appeal rights went uncorrected because of shortcomings in HCFA\u2019s review practices. In addition, HCFA has not exercised its authority to require MCOs to distribute plan information that is more complete, timely, and comparable. Agency officials recognize many of the shortcomings we identified and are beginning efforts to address them. However, we believe that the agency could do more. In our two accompanying reports, we recommend that HCFA undertake a variety of additional actions including (1) following the lead of FEHBP and requiring Medicare MCOs to distribute brochures that fully describe\u2014using a prescribed format and terminology\u2014plan benefits, fees, and coverage restrictions; and (2) setting standards for when MCOs distribute certain information and that the agency improve the consistency and thoroughness of its oversight practices.

Another MCO, which used the same documents to promote its four plans, stated in its handbook that all plan members were entitled to prescription drug coverage.
