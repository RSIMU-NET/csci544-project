The overall goals of the program are to extend U.S. technological leadership in high performance computing and provide wide dissemination and application of the technologies to speed the pace of innovation and to improve national economic competitiveness, national security, education, health care, and the global environment; and provide key parts of the foundation for the national information infrastructure (NII) and demonstrate selected NII applications.", "Four agencies\u2014the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the Department of Energy (DOE), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), and the National Science Foundation (NSF)\u2014developed the original program plan for HPCC in 1989, and they remain the program\u2019s dominant participants. In fiscal year 1995 these agencies together will spend more than $900 million, or 81 percent of the official budget. Led by the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), programs at each of these agencies were drawn together to form the governmentwide HPCC program. Ten federal agencies currently participate in the HPCC program.", "OSTP has designated the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) to oversee the HPCC program, through its Committee on Information and Communications. The NSTC, a cabinet-level organization created by the President in November 1993, is intended to serve, in part, as a mechanism for coordinating research and development strategies across the government and for monitoring agency research and development spending plans. Since the NSTC has only recently been established, it is still too early to gauge its impact on the HPCC program. Table 1.1 presents an overview of reported HPCC spending to date and budgeted amounts for fiscal year 1995 by participating agency.", "The 1989 program plan laid out the original framework and parameters for the government\u2019s investment in HPCC, proposing that the program grow in even increments from a base of approximately $500 million to approximately $1.1 billion in its fifth year. In budgeting for the actual program, HPCC managers have adhered closely to these original targets. Spending is anticipated to continue at over $1 billion annually until 1998.", "To date, the HPCC program and its predecessor agency programs have been highly successful. Participating agencies have been instrumental in establishing more than a dozen high performance computing research centers throughout the U.S. Efforts to provide nationwide access to these centers through interconnected high-speed data networks have led to dramatic increases in the use of those networks. The computing research centers and networks have, in turn, allowed scientists to make significant advances in addressing the highly complex, scientific problems that are collectively referred to as \u201cgrand challenges.\u201d Grand challenges include such problems as understanding global climate change, analyzing nuclear reactions, and mapping the human genetic structure.", "In September 1992, OSTP established a National Coordination Office (NCO) to coordinate the activities of the agencies participating in HPCC and to serve as liaison to Congress, industry, academia, and the public. The office\u2019s director serves part-time; this individual is also director of the National Library of Medicine. The NCO provides administrative support, disseminates information, and chairs coordination meetings attended by officials of the participating agencies. The NCO does not assess agency HPCC programs or provide guidance to the agencies on their programs. It also does not review or have approval authority regarding agency HPCC budgets."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency HPCC Programs Vary Considerably", "paragraphs": ["Since HPCC is structured as a consortium of federal research agencies with independent programs and budgets, participating agencies can\u2014and do\u2014have widely varying approaches to research and development. The programs of the four major participants reveal the diversity of these agencies\u2019 approaches. ARPA and NSF\u2014the major participants in terms of expenditures\u2014are quite different from NASA and DOE. ARPA and NSF concentrate more heavily on basic research, although all four agencies fund scientists working on practical applications of HPCC technologies.", "ARPA has been at the forefront of research into critical technologies, such as computer time-sharing, computer graphics, computer networks, and artificial intelligence, for many years. The agency has had a high performance computing program since the early 1980s. ARPA funds some 200 or more HPCC projects, most of which are relatively small-scale efforts costing between $100,000 and $500,000. Having no laboratories or centers of its own, ARPA funds projects that are run half by academic researchers and half by industry and other government researchers. It also funds the placement of HPCC computers and networks at research sites for use on a variety of research problems.", "NSF, like ARPA, funds a large number of relatively small-scale research projects in a wide range of scientific disciplines. NSF also is similar to ARPA in providing HPCC computing and communications infrastructure for a range of research uses. NSF does this by providing base funding for four national supercomputer centers that, in turn, support research in a range of disciplines, such as biotechnology, global change studies, and manufacturing design.", "NASA and DOE, in contrast to ARPA and NSF, are involved in HPCC primarily because of the potential for HPCC technology to enhance their ability to carry out agency missions. NASA\u2019s projects, for example, are all linked to either (1) design and simulation of aerospace vehicles or (2) earth and space sciences research. Rather than investing heavily in research to design new computer architectures and build new systems, NASA concentrates on the use and evaluation of HPCC systems in the context of its mission needs. DOE similarly emphasizes the role of being an early user of advanced systems and providing feedback to the systems\u2019 developers, rather than attempting to develop new system architectures on its own. Both NASA and DOE have laboratories and centers with extensive HPCC resources. Much of their HPCC funding goes to projects at these sites."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recent Changes in Program Direction", "paragraphs": ["In February 1993, the new administration issued a document outlining its strategy for investing in advanced technology. In the document, the administration rejected the traditional approach of limiting the federal government\u2019s technology development spending to support of basic science and mission-oriented research in the Department of Defense (DOD), NASA, and other agencies. The document stated that challenges facing the U.S. were too profound to rely on the government\u2019s investments in defense and space technology to trickle down to the private sector. Instead, it called for direct support of private sector technology development efforts.", "In keeping with this new thinking, the administration sought to align the HPCC program more closely with broader applications that could be developed and commercialized in the private sector. Specifically, HPCC was linked to the development of a national information infrastructure (NII). OSTP envisions the NII, which is commonly referred to as the \u201cinformation superhighway,\u201d as a nationwide infrastructure of high performance computing hardware and massive computer databases, all linked together by high-speed communications networks and new software that allows trained users to access and use the information contained therein.", "The HPCC program\u2019s technology support for the NII is contained in a new program component added for fiscal year 1994, called Information Infrastructure Technology and Applications (IITA). The new component is intended to (1) develop the technology base for the NII and (2) work with industry in using this technology to develop and demonstrate new applications for the NII.

However, the potential for continued increases in speed is reaching the limits imposed by the physical properties of the materials used to build the processor. Consequently, an entirely new kind of computer design is needed if speed and performance improvements are to continue.", "Computer scientists see development of parallel processing systems as the only way to achieve the dramatic improvements in computer speed that will be needed to address large, complex scientific problems. Parallel processing means breaking computational problems into many separate parts and having a large number of processors tackle those parts simultaneously. Greatly increased processing speed is achieved largely through the sheer number of processors operating simultaneously, rather than through any exceptional power in each processor. Massively parallel processing (MPP) refers to large machines that include many cooperating processors.

The Advanced Software Technology and Algorithms component of the HPCC program targets software development to make MPP and other high performance computer systems useful in addressing grand challenges.", "Radically new system software and software tools are needed to operate MPP and other parallel systems. Most potential users have not yet adopted parallel systems because of the high cost and risk of developing software for their specific applications, and because system software for current parallel systems is still rather primitive.

In addition, the major participating agencies\u2014ARPA, DOE, NASA, and NSF\u2014had conducted successful research and development programs related to HPCC for some years prior to the establishment of the joint program.

The agency program managers are members of a committee called the High Performance Computing, Communications, and Information Technology (HPCCIT) committee. This committee, which is chaired by the NCO, meets on a monthly basis to coordinate HPCC activities. A number of researchers told us that, to date, this arrangement has worked reasonably well. HPCC managers are generally given high marks by researchers for sharing information and coordinating their activities.

However, the administration now argues that the challenges facing the U.S. are too profound to rely on the government\u2019s investments in defense and space technology to trickle down to the private sector. The administration intends the HPCC program to play a key role in a more focused approach to stimulating commercial development and application of new technologies.", "Measuring progress within the program remains an informal process.

Although some large database technology research is going on within the HPCC program, no determination has yet been made about whether it is a priority area that should be emphasized. Outside commentators on the HPCC program have proposed a range of specific technology areas, such as this, that could be targeted as a way of accelerating development of the NII.", "Rather than targeting specific technology areas for accelerated development, the HPCC program has pursued research in many different aspects of advanced parallel computing. The program has had two broad technical goals, which it originally set out to achieve by 1996. One is to gain a thousand-fold improvement in useful computing capability and the other is to achieve a hundredfold improvement in computer communications capability. The program has aimed to address the full spectrum of hardware, software, networking, and training issues associated with developing this radically new breed of parallel computers.", "Although much faster computers and networks are certainly a basic need, particularly to enable scientists to address grand challenge problems, these goals are all-encompassing and do not give enough technical focus to the program. Because they are so broad, controversy and confusion have sometimes arisen as to what the \u201creal\u201d goals of the program are. For example, university and industry experts have observed that, in its original form, the program appeared to be concentrating heavily on developing new hardware architectures, with relatively little attention being paid to software issues, thus leaving systems difficult to use. More recently, the addition of the NII-oriented IITA component has further broadened the technology spectrum to be addressed by HPCC. Both participants and outside observers have questioned the extent to which the program is actually shifting its emphasis toward NII technology issues, given that the level of funding for IITA projects to develop applications in areas such as education and health care is minimal compared with funding for hardware systems development.", "No official prioritization has yet been made. The program\u2019s annual report to the Congress describes ongoing work in a number of technical areas, but does not prioritize among competing technical goals. For example, the annual report states that the five broad component areas of the program are considered equally important. Within the new IITA component, the document identifies a range of technologies that will be needed for the NII, but does not prioritize them or offer an overall strategy for developing them.", "An explicit technical agenda, identifying and prioritizing specific technology challenges and establishing a framework of expected costs and results, could go a long way toward better defining the program\u2019s direction. This agenda could also provide the needed management framework for focusing on technologies in support of the NII. Although it could take a variety of forms, an official technical agenda would specify a target amount of resources to be invested in each priority area and the major results that are expected.

These applications include remote medical diagnosis by specialists and experts anywhere in the nation; the delivery and use of environmental information for a broad range of users, such as agriculture workers and truckers; and enhanced educational opportunities in which students could perform science experiments in collaboration with scientists at the national laboratories or visit museums and research centers without leaving their classrooms. In each case, it is envisioned that these applications will be developed by the private sector, with some level of government support.

At ARPA alone, for example, 43 percent of the HPCC budget goes to companies that have successfully responded to ARPA\u2019s requests for research proposals in specific technological areas. DOE also has established cooperative agreements with numerous partners from industry. Nevertheless, HPCC managers have generally not involved industry in planning the HPCC program. At the governmentwide level, a mechanism for obtaining nonfederal advice and evaluation was mandated by the High Performance Computing Act, which directed the President to establish an advisory committee including representatives from industry. According to OSTP officials, the administration is working to get the advisory committee appointed, although concerns about potential conflict-of-interest have slowed the effort.", "Many HPCC agencies have their own advisory committees that review their HPCC programs. These committees have been helpful in planning effective agency programs. A case in point is NASA\u2019s program, which was reviewed in 1993 by a NASA Advisory Council Task Force. The task force reported that the priorities in the agency\u2019s HPCC plan did not address the research problems that the aerospace industry considered most critical.

Aerospace industry representatives told us they are encouraged that a revised plan will more fully reflect their interests and concerns.", "The NCO, which was established in part to serve as a point of entry for industry into the program, disseminates general information about the program as well as funding opportunities. The NCO recently made this information available electronically over the Internet. In addition, the NCO has been involved in numerous liaison activities with industry, academia, and the public. These activities have included meetings, workshops, and conferences. The NCO has also allowed groups of industry representatives to attend certain designated portions of the HPCC program managers\u2019 regular meetings and give brief presentations of their views.", "Industry representatives whom we contacted agreed that all of these activities are valuable. However, they seek greater opportunities for close collaboration between government and industry in planning program direction. They have proposed that the NCO cooperate in arranging for the HPCC program to participate officially in symposia, in order for industry and academic representatives to meet with program managers to air their views on the direction and priorities of the program.

Earth and environmental scientists, likewise, will profit from various HPCC projects supported by NASA, NSF, DOE, and ARPA.

We, however, do not agree that a significant shift in emphasis has yet occurred. While the implementation plan recognizes that greater focus on software tools will be required to encourage industry involvement in developing applications, a small percentage of the budget for the advanced software technology and applications component is allocated to this area. We believe that the program could better leverage federal funding by devoting more resources to activities that would make it easier for private industry to develop a broader range of applications.", "In its interim report, the National Research Council\u2019s HPCC study committee expressed concerns similar to ours.
