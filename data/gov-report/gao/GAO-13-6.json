The add-on payments increased payments for transports in urban, rural, and super-rural (the least densely populated) areas by $175 million in calendar year 2011, according to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. In 2007, GAO reported a decline in transports by beneficiaries in super-rural areas and recommended that the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) monitor beneficiary use of ambulance transports to ensure access to services, particularly in super-rural areas. The Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012 required GAO to update the 2007 report. GAO examined, for 2010 (the most recent year complete data were available when GAO began the study), (1) ground ambulance provider costs for transports, (2) the relationship between Medicare payments and provider costs, and (3) beneficiary use of ground ambulance transports. To do this work, GAO sent a survey to a sample of eligible providers based on the 2007 report sample asking for provider costs and characteristics. The sample is representative of all ground ambulance providers that billed Medicare in 2003 and 2010, were operational in 2012, and did not share costs with nonambulance services or air ambulance services. GAO also performed a regression analysis to examine factors that affect costs, analyzed Medicare claims and enrollment data, and interviewed representatives of ambulance provider organizations. CMS reviewed a draft of this report and had no comments."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["Ground ambulance providers' costs per transport for 2010 varied widely. The median cost per transport for the providers in GAO's sample was $429, ranging from $224 to $2,204 per transport. Provider characteristics that affected cost per transport were volume of transports (including both Medicare and non-Medicare transports), intensity of transports (the proportion of Medicare transports that were nonemergency), and the extent to which providers received government subsidies. Higher volume of transports, higher proportions of nonemergency transports, and lower government subsidies were associated with lower costs per transport. Providers reported that personnel cost was the largest cost component in their 2010 total costs and the biggest contributor to increases in their total costs from 2009 to 2010.", "The median Medicare margin, including add-on payments, was about +2 percent in 2010 (meaning that providers' Medicare payments per transport exceeded their overall costs per transport) for the providers in GAO's sample, but Medicare margins varied widely for those providers. When GAO removed the add-on payments, payments decreased for the providers in the sample, resulting in a lower median Medicare margin of -1 percent. Due to the wide variability of Medicare margins for providers in the sample, GAO cannot determine whether the median provider among the providers in the population that the sample represents had a negative or positive margin. The median Medicare margin with add-on payments ranged from about -2 percent to +9 percent, while the median Medicare margin without add-on payments ranged from about -8 percent to +5 percent.", "Ground ambulance transports for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries grew 33 percent from 2004 to 2010. Transports by beneficiaries nationwide grew the most in super-rural areas (41 percent) relative to urban and rural areas. The increase overall is attributable primarily to an increase of 59 percent over this period in basic life support (BLS) nonemergency transports, which include noninvasive interventions, such as administering oxygen. In comparing this growth by service area, BLS nonemergency transports in super-rural areas grew the most--by 82 percent. Representatives from an ambulance provider organization suggested the increase in transports may be from increased billing by local governments. Some local governments that used to provide Medicare transports free of charge may bill Medicare now because of increased budgetary pressures. The Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has cited improper payments--which can be the result of billing mistakes--as one potential cause for increases in Medicare ambulance utilization and has stated that the Medicare ambulance transport benefit is highly vulnerable to abuse, with some payments for transports not meeting program requirements."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["Since 2004, Medicare payments to ambulance providers have been  augmented by supplemental temporary payments. These supplemental  payments, called \u201cadd-on\u201d payments, increased payments for ground  ambulance transports by $175 million for calendar year 2011, according  to estimates from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. In  calendar year 2010, the most recent year for which complete data were  available when we began this study, ambulance providers furnished  almost 16.6 million ground ambulance transports for approximately   5.1 million Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries. The Centers for  Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), which administers the Medicare  program, paid ground ambulance providers approximately $5.2 billion for  these transports, which includes the add-on payments.", "We reported in 2007 that the costs of providing ground ambulance  transports varied greatly across providers, as did Medicare margins (the  relationship between the cost of providing a transport and the Medicare  payment for a transport). This variation reflected differences in provider  and community characteristics, such as the provider\u2019s volume of  transports and the service area it predominantly serves. We also found  that in super-rural areas (where the population density is the lowest of the  rural areas), the number of ground transports per 1,000 Medicare  beneficiaries declined from 2001 to 2004. We recommended that CMS  monitor the utilization of ambulance transports to ensure that  beneficiaries had access to services, particularly in super-rural areas.  Subsequently, Congress increased payments for urban and rural  transports.", "Because Congress would like information about the adequacy of  Medicare payments to ambulance providers and the need to continue  authorizing the add-on payments, the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job  Creation Act of 2012 required us to update the information in our 2007   We examined (1) 2010 ground ambulance providers\u2019 costs for  report. furnishing transports, (2) the relationship between 2010 Medicare  payments and ground ambulance providers\u2019 costs, and (3) Medicare  beneficiaries\u2019 use of ground ambulance transports in 2010.", "Pub.

We received  completed surveys from 154 providers, for a response rate of 52 percent.  Our sample was based on our 2007 report\u2019s sampling frame, which was  representative of all ground ambulance providers that billed Medicare in  2003. Because we found previously that cost data from ambulance  providers that shared operational costs with other services, such as those  provided by fire departments or air ambulance services, were unreliable,  we excluded these providers from our current sample, as was done in the  2007 report; however, unlike the sample for the 2007 report, we also  excluded providers that shared operational costs with a hospital.", "Therefore, our sample is representative of the population of  approximately 2,900 ground ambulance providers that billed Medicare in  2003 and in 2010, were still operational in 2012, and did not share costs  with nonambulance services or air ambulance services (an estimated   26 percent of the ambulance industry in 2010). We selected these  providers because they do not have to estimate costs across multiple  business lines and represent mature organizations, void of potentially  expensive start-up costs.", "Using the survey data, we calculated providers\u2019 costs per transport and  examined how costs per transport varied across providers. We also  determined which of the following cost components most contributed to  providers\u2019 total cost, as well as to increases in total cost: personnel;  vehicle; fuel; medical supplies, equipment, and communications;  building or facility; overhead and administration; or other. We performed  a regression analysis to investigate the relationship between providers\u2019  total cost and characteristics such as service area (urban, rural, or super- rural), volume of transports, mix and intensity of Medicare transports,  level of government subsidies received, use of volunteer staff, and type  of ownership. We divided predicted total cost by total transports to derive  cost per transport.", "To ensure the reliability of the survey data, we incorporated internal data  checks in the survey instrument, contacted providers that submitted  inconsistent or incomplete data, and excluded three providers with  reported costs per transport that were more than three standard  deviations from the mean of the lognormal distribution for survey  respondents. Using Medicare claims data for all survey recipients, we  were able to test for potential nonresponse bias for the characteristics  contained in the claims data. The nonresponse analysis did not find any  statistically measurable bias that would affect our analyses of providers\u2019  costs.", "The survey data had some important limitations. We assumed that  providers\u2019 total cost per transport was equivalent to their Medicare cost  per transport. This may introduce some bias since the mix and intensity of  ambulance services used by Medicare beneficiaries may be different than  those used by non-Medicare beneficiaries, and this could affect providers\u2019  Medicare cost per transport. Similarly, providers generally do not track  costs by urban, rural, or super-rural transports. Therefore, we classified  providers by their predominant service area and there is likely to be some  measurement error in identifying the full effect of service area on costs.  Cost data reported in the survey are subject to some variability depending  on the accounting methodology used by ambulance providers. In  addition, the survey data were self-reported. Also, the small sample size  and variability of self-reported costs limit the precision with which we can  generalize our results.", "To provide context for the factors associated with the costs of providing  ambulance services, we reviewed wage and workers\u2019 compensation  insurance data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, health insurance data  from the Kaiser Family Foundation, and fuel data from the Department of  Energy, and interviewed an official of the National Association of State  EMS Officials (NASEMSO).", "To determine the relationship of 2010 Medicare payments to ground  ambulance providers\u2019 costs, we used Medicare claims data to calculate  Medicare payments in 2010 for the providers in our sample, and we  calculated Medicare margins\u2014the percentage difference between the  Medicare payment per transport and cost per transport. Using the  Medicare ambulance fee schedule and claims data, we calculated each  provider\u2019s Medicare payment per transport with and without the add-on  payments. We then calculated the Medicare margin for each provider by  subtracting its cost per transport (as calculated in the methodology for  objective 1) from its Medicare payment per transport and dividing this  amount by its Medicare payment per transport.", "To examine Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries\u2019 use of ground  ambulance transports in 2010, we analyzed 2010 Medicare claims and  beneficiary enrollment data to calculate the number of transports per  1,000 beneficiaries. We also analyzed 2004 Medicare claims and  beneficiary enrollment data to determine the change in beneficiaries\u2019 use  of ground ambulance transports from 2004 to 2010.

Some local governments that  provided ambulance transports free of charge had been reluctant in the  past to bill insurers such as Medicare because patients would then be  financially responsible for out-of-pocket insurance costs, such as  deductibles and copayments.

For example, the regression results suggest that  ambulance providers that receive a greater proportion of government  subsidies tend to have higher costs. The representatives theorized that  providers with higher costs seek additional government support and did  not think this finding was consistent with how their industry operates. As  described in the report, the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission  found an association between increased resources and increased costs  in the hospital industry and theorizes that such hospitals face less  pressure to control costs. We found an association in the ambulance  industry but determining causality was beyond the scope of our work.  AAA representatives also questioned the regression analysis results that  indicated that providers\u2019 use of volunteer staff did not significantly  contribute to differences in providers\u2019 total costs, because our survey data  indicated that personnel costs were, on average, 61 percent of providers\u2019  total costs. The results may be a consequence of the relatively small  sample size and, in addition, a small proportion of providers in our sample  using volunteer staff (21 percent).", "Finally, the AAA representatives commented that ground ambulance  providers\u2019 current Medicare payments are lower than those we calculated  for 2010 because of the expiration of a required temporary increase in  Medicare payments for certain geographic areas, the implementation of  a policy for reporting fractional mileage, and the introduction of a  productivity adjustment relative to the annual inflation adjustment of the  fee schedule.

Provider characteristics included in our model were: (1) volume of  transports, (2) cost of doing business, (3) mix of Medicare transports,   (4) intensity of Medicare transports, (5) service area, (6) use of volunteer  staff, (7) receipt of government subsidies, and (8) ownership type. We  used those results to produce a graph illustrating the relationship between  cost per transport and volume of transports. We also used the results of  the regression analysis to estimate the effect on providers\u2019 cost per  transport of reducing the value of each of two variables that were  significant in the regression. See table 5 for the characteristics included in  the model, how each characteristic was measured, and the data source  for each characteristic.", "Our regression analysis modeled total cost at the provider level as a  function of the provider characteristics described above. We used  ordinary least squares to model the log of total costs for a provider.model was specified in log-log form to conform to standard  microeconomic theory regarding cost functions. The two continuous  independent variables\u2014transport volume and geographic practice cost  index (GPCI)\u2014were entered in log form. The remaining variables were  not entered in log form because they were either indicator variables  (value of 0 or 1) or percentage variables (values ranging from 0 to 1.00).  Three of the explanatory variables in the regression were statistically  significant at the 1 percent or better level in explaining the variation in  providers\u2019 total costs: total transports, percentage of revenues from   The  government subsidies, and percentage of Medicare transports that were  nonemergency. Table 6 shows the regression results.", "We used the regression results to predict the log of total cost and then  converted it to total cost by taking the antilog. We applied an adjustment  to the resulting prediction of total cost to account for the fact that our  regression was for log total cost rather than total cost. We then divided  total cost by total transports to derive cost per transport. We used this  method to produce predictions of cost per transport for the range of 1 to  20,000 transports shown in figure 2 of the report.", "We also used the regression results to estimate the effect on cost per  transport of a reduced percentage of revenues from government  subsidies and a reduced percentage of nonemergency transports. In each  case, we held the other variables in the regression model at their  regression sample mean and calculated cost per transport for the sample  two ways: one with the value of the variable of interest set at its sample  average and another with it set at a value 25 percent less.
