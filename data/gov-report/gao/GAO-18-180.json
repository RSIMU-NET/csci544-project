TSA is the primary federal agency responsible for securing surface transportation in the United States.", "GAO was asked to review TSA surface inspector activities. This report addresses (1) how TSA surface inspectors implement the agency's surface transportation security mission, and (2) the extent to which TSA has used a risk-based approach to prioritize and implement surface inspector activities. GAO analyzed TSA data on surface inspector activities from fiscal year 2013 through March 24, 2017, reviewed TSA program and risk documents and guidance, and observed surface inspectors conducting multiple activities.

GAO found that, according to TSA data, inspectors reported spending approximately 80 percent of their time on these activities.", "In addition to mission-related activities, surface inspectors can assist with aviation-related activities. However, GAO found that TSA has incomplete information on the total time surface inspectors spend on these activities because of limitations in TSA's data system. Addressing these limitations would provide TSA with complete information when making decisions about inspector activities.", "GAO also found that TSA prioritized inspector activities in the surface transportation mode with the lowest risk because TSA did not incorporate risk assessment results when planning and monitoring activities. Specifically, in fiscal year 2016, the last full year for which data on inspectors' activities in the surface modes was available, surface inspectors reported spending more than twice as much time on the lowest risk surface transportation mode according to TSA risk assessments than on the highest risk surface transportation mode. Incorporating risk assessment results when prioritizing inspector activities would help TSA ensure that its surface security resources address the highest risks.", "In fiscal year 2017, TSA fully implemented a new risk mitigation program\u2014Risk Mitigation Activities for Surface Transportation (RMAST)\u2014intended to focus time and resources on high-risk surface transportation entities and locations. However, GAO found that TSA has not identified or prioritized these high-risk entities and locations, or defined the RMAST program's objectives and associated activities in a measurable and clear way. According to TSA officials, they have not done so because there are too many potential entities to list them all for prioritization and TSA has not identified an approach for determining the effectiveness of activities under the program. However, prioritizing high-risk entities, such as by type, characteristics, or location does not require a complete list of entities. By identifying and prioritizing high-risk entities and locations for RMAST, and clearly defining the program's activities and objectives, TSA would be better able to implement RMAST activities in a risk-based manner and measure their effectiveness.", "This is a public version of a sensitive report that GAO issued in October 2017.

The surface transportation network includes  passenger rail, mass transit, freight rail, highway, pipeline, and maritime  modes. Surface transportation systems generally rely on an open  infrastructure that is difficult to monitor and secure due to its multiple  access points, hubs serving multiple carriers, and in some cases, lack of  access barriers. Securing these systems is further complicated by the  number of private and public stakeholders involved in operating and  protecting the system and the need to balance security with the  expeditious flow of people and goods. According to the Mineta Institute  for Transportation, terrorist attacks against surface transportation are  becoming more frequent and the overall risk for a surface transportation  attack has increased over the past 40 years. According to the  Transportation Security Administration (TSA), an attack on a surface  transportation system in the United States could potentially lead to  significant casualties and economic damage and disruption worth billions  of dollars.", "TSA, within the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), is the  primary U.S. federal agency responsible for securing all four general  modes of land-based transportation \u2013 mass transit and passenger rail,  freight rail, highway and motor carrier, and pipeline \u2013 and supports  maritime security efforts by deploying 222 surface transportation security  inspectors, known as surface inspectors, in 49 locations throughout the  country. TSA\u2019s surface domain includes nearly 140,000 miles of railroad  track, over 2.5 million miles of pipeline, and 4 million miles of roads, that  facilitate 10 billion annual passenger trips on mass transit systems,  school bus transport for 24 million students riding school buses each day,  and nearly 800,000 daily shipments of hazardous material. TSA has an  annual surface security operating budget of around $111 million, which  represents approximately 3 percent of TSA\u2019s total budget, while the  remainder of the budget is dedicated primarily to aviation operations,  according to TSA. TSA\u2019s role in surface transportation security varies by  mode. For example, TSA plays a regulatory role in freight rail, passenger  rail, and maritime facility security. TSA also provides guidance and  encourages voluntary implementation of security best practices to surface  transportation entities, and relies on cooperation from system operators,  and local, state, and federal security partners.", "DHS and TSA officials have stated that they use risk-based security to  deliver the most effective security in the most efficient manner. We have  previously reviewed TSA surface transportation initiatives, and in March  2009 reported that TSA had not conducted a comprehensive risk  assessment for securing mass transit and passenger rail. We  recommended that TSA conduct a risk assessment that included all  elements of risk, and TSA took actions to implement the  recommendation, including developing the Transportation Sector Security  Risk Assessment (TSSRA) in 2010, which examines and assesses the  terrorism risk for all transportation modes for which TSA is responsible.", "You asked us to review the activities that TSA surface inspectors perform  in support of TSA\u2019s surface security mission.

We also  observed inspectors conducting program activities including a Baseline  Assessment for Security Enhancement (BASE) review, a regional  Intermodal \u2013 Security Training and Exercise Program (I-STEP) exercise,  and an Exercise Information System (EXIS) exercise. We used the results  of our analysis of PARIS data to describe the number of each type of  regulatory inspection surface inspectors conducted from fiscal years 2013  to 2017, regulatory compliance rates for those inspections, and how  surface inspectors reported spending their time on all activities in the  surface module of PARIS. To evaluate the effects of this limitation on  TSA\u2019s implementation of its surface activities, we compared the results of  our data analysis and our interviews with TSA officials to Standards for  Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "To further address our second objective, we analyzed TSA risk guidance  and examined TSA\u2019s cross-modal risk assessments in the TSSRA from  fiscal years 2013 to 2016. To evaluate the extent to which TSA  considered risk when it staffed TSA surface inspectors, we reviewed  TSA\u2019s fiscal year 2017 surface inspector staffing model\u2014the only model  TSA used during the period we examined\u2014and interviewed TSA officials  responsible for developing and executing staffing, and compared that  process to TSA risk guidance. To determine the extent to which TSA  prioritized surface inspector activities based on risk we compared surface  inspector work plan requirements and the work plan development  process, as described by TSA officials, to risk information, including  results from the TSSRA and TSA risk guidance. See appendix I for more  information on the risk information we used to assess the surface  inspector work plans. To determine the extent to which TSA\u2019s  implementation of surface inspector activities aligned with risk, we  compared the results of our analysis of PARIS surface module data on  the time surface inspectors spent in each surface mode to the results of  the TSSRA cross-modal risk assessments from fiscal years 2013 to 2017.  We also identified the types of information TSA used in its fiscal year  2015 analysis of surface inspector time and activities to determine what  TSA considered when it monitored how surface inspector activities were  implemented. Furthermore, to evaluate the extent to which TSA\u2019s Risk  Mitigation Activities for Surface Transportation (RMAST) program was  risk-based and TSA had established measurable goals for the program,  we compared the results of our analysis of PARIS surface module data,  program descriptions, and interviews with TSA officials responsible for  planning and implementing the program to TSA\u2019s risk guidance and  Standards for Internal Control in the Federal Government.", "The performance audit upon which this report is based was conducted  from April 2016 to October 2017 in accordance with generally accepted  government auditing standards.

To inform its security strategy, TSA assesses risk  within and across the aviation, freight rail, passenger rail/mass transit,  highway, and pipeline modes approximately every 2 years using the  TSSRA. According to the TSSRA\u2019s cross-modal risk assessments  between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, one particular surface mode  consistently posed the highest risk, and another consistently posed the  lowest risk out of all surface transportation modes. For example, in fiscal  year 2016, TSA found that the lowest risk mode posed approximately 6  percent of domestic total risk while the highest risk mode posed 27  percent of domestic total risk.

Representatives from two  maritime companies, one highway company, and three public  transportation systems told us that they wanted TSA surface inspectors to  do more. Additionally, a representative for one national industry  organization stated that his organization was concerned that TSA is  mainly focused on freight rail when the principal threat resides in the  passenger and mass transit modes, and suggested that TSA deploy  inspection resources from the freight rail mode to support more non- regulatory initiatives in the passenger rail/mass transit mode.", "According to TSA, the agency employs a risk-based approach \u2013 which  the DHS Risk Lexicon defines as using the assessment of risk as the  primary decision driver \u2013 to all operations to identify, manage, and  mitigate risk in all TSA lines of business.

Further, TSA officials told us that TSA has not  provided any guidance to the field beyond the work plan on how to  identify appropriate entities for RMASTs, but that they rely on surface field  offices to identify the highest-risk entities in their own areas. Officials from  three field offices told us that inspectors try to conduct RMASTs based on  threat information or previous BASE scores, but inspectors in one of  those offices said that the intelligence information they receive from TSA  is insufficient to help them identify threats and conduct outreach for  RMASTs.

While TSA uses information on some surface inspector  activities to monitor and make decisions on these activities, limitations in  the PARIS data system prevent TSA from readily accessing complete  information on how much time inspectors spend working in support of  aviation. Without addressing these limitations TSA is limited in its ability to  make informed future decisions on annual resource needs for surface  inspectors, which will be especially important as TSA take steps to  expand its inspection activities with the promulgation of new surface  security regulations. Given that TSA spends only about 3 percent of its  budget on surface activities, it is crucial that the agency have complete  information on how resources are being used in order to best allocate  these limited federal surface transportation security resources.", "According to TSA, the agency implements risk-based security \u2013 security  activities that are driven primarily by the assessment of risk \u2013 to deliver  the most effective security in the most efficient manner.

Managed by the U.S. Federal  Air Marshal Service and conducted by TSA personnel, which may include surface  inspectors.  2006  A voluntary review in which surface inspectors evaluate the security programs of  transportation entities, offer technical assistance, and share best practices. TSA  uses BASE to, among other things, determine priorities for allocating mass transit  and passenger rail security grants, such as those provided through the  Transportation Security Grant Program.  2006  Local field assessments of critical infrastructure, station and other facilities for mass  transit, passenger rail, and commuter rail and bus systems. Station profiles provide  detailed information of specific station-related intelligence, such as the locations of  exits, telephones, CCTV, electrical power, station mangers etc.   2007  Inspectors verify that Toxic Inhalation Hazard (TIH) rail cars at rail yards within high- threat urban areas that transport TIH on a regular and reoccurring basis are being  attended by railroad personnel. Inspectors also conduct \u201cwildcard\u201d RRS, during  which they observe locations which do not normally handle TIH on a regular and  recurring basis to determine if TIH cars are present, and if they are being attended  by railroad personnel.   2008  Detailed assessments that focus on the vulnerabilities of high-population areas  where TIH materials are moved by rail in significant quantities, and that provide site- specific mitigation strategies and lessons learned.  2008  I-STEP, which is managed through the Office of Security Policy and Industry  Engagement, consists of contractor-facilitated exercises designed to help multimodal  surface transportation entities closely examine their security programs and  operational efforts. TSA facilitates I-STEP exercises across all surface transportation  modes to help operators, law enforcement, first responders, and related entities test  and evaluate their security plans, including prevention and preparedness  capabilities, ability to respond to threats, and interagency coordination. TSA updates  I-STEP scenarios as new threats emerge, helping industry partners prepare to  implement the most appropriate countermeasures.  2014  Quality assurance assessments of Transportation Worker Identification Credential  (TWIC) enrollment centers to, according to TSA officials, review contractor  performance.  2015  EXIS consists of exercises facilitated by surface inspectors that utilize software  developed by TSA for stakeholder use, generally focus on one entity, and are  intended to build on the findings of a previously completed BASE assessment."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "Start Date (fiscal year)", "paragraphs": ["2017  A program intended to focus time and resources on high-risk and critical assets,  facilities and other infrastructure through the following activities: (1) public  observation to identify suspicious activities, security vulnerabilities and/or suspicious  behaviors that could be indicative of pre-operational planning related to terrorism; (2)  site security observation to determine if the physical security measures and  operational deterrence components are in place to effectively mitigate risk, and (3)  stakeholder engagement including TSA\u2019s public security awareness programs and  improvised explosive device (IED) and intelligence briefings.", "In this table, passenger rail and rail transit systems consist of: each passenger railroad carrier,  including each carrier operating light rail or heavy rail transit service on track that is part of the  general railroad system of transportation, each carrier operating or providing intercity passenger train  service or commuter or other short-haul railroad passenger service in a metropolitan or suburban  area (as described by 49 U.S.C. \u00a7 20102), and each public authority operating passenger train  service; (b) each passenger railroad carrier hosting an operation described in paragraph (a) of this  section; (c) each tourist, scenic, historic, and excursion rail operator, whether operating on or off the  general railroad system of transportation; (d) each operator of private cars, including business/office  cars and circus trains, on or connected to the general railroad system of transportation, and (e) each  operator of a rail transit system that is not operating on track that is part of the general railroad  system of transportation, including heavy rail transit, light rail transit, automated guideway, cable car,  inclined plane, funicular, and monorail systems. 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1580.200."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Appendix III: Surface Inspector Time Spent on Activities Reported in the Surface Module of PARIS for Fiscal Years 2013 to 2017", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix IV: Comments from the U.S Department of Homeland Security", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Appendix V: GAO Contact and Staff Acknowledgements", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "GAO Contact", "paragraphs": ["Jennifer Grover (202) 512-7141 or groverj@gao.gov."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Staff Acknowledgments", "paragraphs": ["In addition to the contact named above, Christopher E.
