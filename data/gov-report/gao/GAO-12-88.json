DCAA audits are intended to help provide reasonable assurance that defense company policies for safeguarding assets and complying with contractual requirements are fulfilled. Defense companies also maintain their own internal audit departments to monitor policies, procedures, and business systems related to their government contracts. GAO was asked to assess the role of defense companies' internal audit departments and their ability to provide DCAA with information on their internal controls. GAO assessed (1) selected defense companies' adherence to standards for internal audits, (2) the extent to which those companies' internal audit reports address defense contract management internal controls, and (3) DCAA's ability to examine internal audits and use information from these audits. GAO reviewed a nongeneralizable sample of seven major defense companies including the five largest defense contractors and two smaller contractors; analyzed information on their 2008 and 2009 internal audits, which were the latest available when GAO began its assessment; and reviewed DCAA's ability to examine and use the audits in carrying out its oversight."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The seven internal audit departments GAO reviewed generally adhered to Institute of Internal Auditors standards for organizing their internal audit departments. These standards include maintaining independence and having a proficient workforce. For example, all seven companies are organized so that the internal audit department is independent of company management. For performing individual audits, the majority of the companies followed the standards in areas such as planning the audit work and obtaining evidence. In its examination of evidentiary workpapers, GAO found documentation of the internal auditors' testing to show the level of compliance with company policies. The selected companies' internal audit reports cover a broad spectrum of policies, business systems, and programs that are relevant to DCAA audits. Each company performs audits with scope and objectives specific to that company and its individual businesses, such as audits about defense programs or audits that review a company's accounting system. In addition, some audits are common across companies, such as reviews of purchase card transactions or controls over information technology. In 2008 and 2009, the seven companies conducted 1,125 internal audits. GAO determined that of these, 520 were related to the defense contract control environment and one or more areas reviewed by DCAA, such as overall internal control functions and specific business systems. DCAA's access to and use of internal audit information from reports and workpapers is limited, in part, because of company interpretations of court decisions concerning DCAA's access to documents. Consequently, the seven companies GAO reviewed have developed differing policies and procedures for providing internal audit information to DCAA but ultimately provide DCAA access to internal audit reports and workpapers on a case-by-case basis. (1) Six of the companies have policies that provide for DCAA access to at least some internal audits reports upon request. Of the six, four have policies for providing access to supporting workpapers for their internal audits upon request. The other two companies have policies of not providing DCAA with access to supporting workpapers. (2) One company has a policy of not providing DCAA with access to internal audits or workpapers. DCAA's use of its access authority has been addressed in two court decisions. The courts held that DCAA does not have unlimited power to demand access to all internal company materials, but they also held that DCAA may demand access to materials relevant to its audit responsibilities. However, DCAA does not generally track its requests or denials for internal audit reports. GAO found that the number of DCAA requests for internal audit reports is small relative to the number of internal audits GAO identified as relevant to defense contract oversight. In explaining why few reports are requested, DCAA auditors noted obstacles such as not being able to identify internal audits relevant to their work and uncertainty as to how useful those reports could be. By not routinely obtaining access to relevant company internal audits, DCAA auditors are hindered in their ability to effectively plan work and meet auditing standards for evaluating internal controls."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO recommends that DCAA take steps to facilitate access to internal audits and assess periodically whether other actions are needed.

As part of its  efforts, DCAA performs audits of companies\u2019 overall internal controls,  which are intended to provide reasonable assurance that company  policies for safeguarding assets and complying with contractual  requirements are being carried out. In addition, major defense companies  have internal audit departments to monitor policies and procedures  established by their management to ensure the integrity of their business  systems, including those related to their government contracts. Taken  together, DCAA and the internal audit departments measure company  performance against quality and reliability standards in support of  government contracts as part of the overall internal controls.", "You requested that we assess the role of defense company internal audit  departments and their ability to provide DCAA with information on  company internal controls, business systems, and policies affecting  government contracts. In response, we assessed (1) the adherence of  selected major defense companies to internal auditing standards for  organizations and individual audits, (2) the extent to which the internal  audit reports of those companies address internal controls for the  management of defense contracts and associated business systems, and  (3) DCAA\u2019s ability to examine and use those reports in carrying out its  oversight responsibilities.", "We used the following methodologies to address our objectives:", "To assess defense company adherence to internal audit standards,  we selected a nongeneralizable sample of seven major defense  companies.

We analyzed the information and determined that 520 internal audits  were related to contracting with the federal government. We then  asked to examine all 520 reports. Six of the seven companies agreed  to provide us their audit reports. We reviewed 470 reports to  determine the findings, corrective actions, and any connection to a  DCAA audit. We also requested that each company provide us with  workpaper sets from five internal audits, which we selected based on  a nongeneralizable random sample. Five of the seven companies  agreed to provide us access to their workpaper sets. We examined  the 25 sets of documents to verify that the workpapers contained  evidence for the findings and corrective actions identified in the  internal audit reports. The seven companies we reviewed are listed in  our full scope and methodology in appendix I, together with details on  the extent to which the companies provided us with the information we  requested. When materials were not provided for our review, we  obtained the company\u2019s rationale for documenting purposes. These  rationales include the limitations on access to company internal  documents discussed in two court cases and ownership of the  workpapers by a third party.

One of the principal authorities  on the standards and practices of internal auditing is the Institute of  Internal Auditors (the Institute). The Institute is a non-profit professional  organization that provides guidance on assessing, maintaining, and  improving the quality of internal auditing within the profession.  Importantly, the Institute provides guidance for the profession through its  International Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing.  These standards include requirements at the organizational level such as  independence and objectivity, as well as for conducting audits, including  planning, performing fieldwork, communicating results, and following up  on corrective actions.

These standards require evaluation and testing of  the overall internal controls including the work of the contractor\u2019s internal  audit activity, specific controls, and business systems. These standards  and associated principles govern the audit planning and evidence  required to conduct a GAGAS-compliant audit. DCAA\u2019s procedures for  adhering to GAGAS in conducting different types of audits, such as audits  of internal controls or company business systems, are contained in its  Contract Audit Manual (CAM). According to the CAM, DCAA is required  periodically to examine the contractor\u2019s internal controls, as well as  contractor policies and procedures. It also states that in the process of  planning an audit, auditors should consider the company\u2019s self  governance programs when assessing the adequacy of the internal  controls to determine the scope of their audit. Further, the CAM states  that audits of individual business systems are to include an evaluation of  the internal control activities applicable to that system.guidance for audit procedures states that auditors should consider a  company\u2019s internal audit activities to determine the adequacy of its  internal controls when performing an audit of the company\u2019s control  environment and accounting system.", "Lastly, DCAA  To conduct its audits, DCAA relies on the examination of contractor  financial, accounting, and other data.

These  organizational standards include maintaining independence and  objectivity, constructing a risk-based audit plan, employing and  maintaining a skilled, professional audit staff, and completing an external  assessment. Similarly, based on our examination of internal audit reports  and audit documentation (generally referred to as workpapers), we found  that the majority of companies followed the standards for performing  individual audits. These standards include assessing risks during audit planning, including the risk of fraud, obtaining evidence for findings to  include testing and documenting evidence, and following up on audit  issues. However, some companies did not provide sufficient information  on how they conduct individual audits for us to determine if the standards  for performance were met. Figure 1 shows the applicable Institute  standards and the number of companies in our review that followed them.", "Our analysis indicates that five of the seven companies we evaluated  generally conformed to five Institute standards for internal audit  organizations. The remaining two companies did not provide for an  external quality assurance review as required under the Institute\u2019s  standards. The five standards are:  Independence and objectivity\u2014According to the organizational charts  of the seven selected companies, their Vice Presidents of Internal  Audit, also called the Chief Audit Executives (CAE), report directly to  the Audit Committees of the Board of Directors for matters related to  internal audits. For administrative matters such as payroll and office  space, the internal audit departments can be linked to the Chief  Financial Officer or another department. This organizational feature  allows the internal audit activity to be independent of company  management, as called for under the Institute\u2019s standards. To further  ensure independence and objectivity, most audit executives we met  with stated that they encourage an attitude of objectivity in their staff.  For example, one CAE said that if staff from other divisions of the  company are assigned to the internal audit department, those staff do  not audit their former division\u2019s activities to mitigate conflict of interest  risks.", "Risk-based audit plan\u2014All seven companies we reviewed developed  audit plans using risk-based assessments consistent with the  Institute\u2019s standards. Audit plans are used by companies\u2019 internal  audit departments to schedule their audits throughout the year so that  the highest risk issues the company is facing are covered. According  to the Institute\u2019s standards, internal audit departments should base  audit plans on an annual evaluation of multiple risk factors, prioritized  to ensure coverage of the highest risk areas. In reviewing how the  companies develop their audit plans, we found that they receive input  from management and the board of directors and consider a variety of  factors such as changes in government regulations, review of high- risk areas identified in previous risk assessments, the potential for  financial misstatement, and external factors facing the company.  Once the information is compiled, the seven internal audit  departments plan specific audits across company businesses and  product lines, taking into account the likelihood of the risk  materializing and the damage to the company should the risk  materialize. Sometimes companies conduct a follow-up audit for high- risk issues highlighted in a previous year. Follow-up audits allow the  internal audit department to track high-risk findings to ensure they are  corrected.", "Proficiency\u2014The Institute\u2019s standards require that internal auditors  have sufficient expertise. We found that although internal audit  departments\u2019 staff varies in number, the staff are comparable in  professional qualifications. Six of the company internal audit  departments are staffed by company employees, while the seventh  company contracts with an accounting firm to conduct its audits.  Based on information provided by the companies, we found that the  staff from six companies have a wide range of professional  credentials including certified public accountants, certified fraud  examiners, certified internal auditors, and certified information  systems auditors. In addition, more than half of the staff members  have advanced degrees, such as a masters of business  administration. Table 1 shows the audit staff experience and the  average number of auditors with certifications for six companies.", "For the seventh company that retains an outside accounting firm to  perform its internal audits, the audit directors and the staff of the  accounting firm combined have a range of professional certifications  and advanced degrees comparable to the other companies. Company  officials informed us that their practice enhances the audit function\u2019s  independence since the audit staff is not employed by the company  and ensures the availability of specialists, if needed. Another  company in our review previously outsourced its internal audit function  but stopped doing so, according to a senior internal audit official, to  save money, provide an in-house talent pool, and enhance the  connection between the auditors and the company.", "Continuing professional development\u2014The Institute\u2019s standards  require certified internal auditors to complete 80 hours of continuing  professional education (CPE) every 2 years to ensure that they  maintain and update their knowledge and skills. We found that the  companies take a variety of measures to enhance auditors\u2019  knowledge and skills. For example, one company provides 100 hours  of annual training, covers the cost of professional certifications,  provides financial incentives for their completion, and expects auditors  to obtain an additional 100 hours of training on their own. In addition  to CPE requirements and professional certifications, officials at three  companies stated they have training programs that allow staff from  other departments or business units to rotate through the internal  audit department for a limited time.", "External assessments\u2014Institute standards require that internal audit  departments must be subjected to external assessments at least once  every 5 years. Five of the selected companies have had external  quality assurance reviews of their organization and audit performance  within the previous 5 years.

We also found that some workpapers contained  assessments of the fraud risks specific to the audit\u2019s scope. For  example, one workpaper set we reviewed reported that the audit team  met with the legal department about fraud risks and ethics  considerations for that particular audit. Another set of workpapers  showed that a risk assessment chart was used to identify areas to be  included in the audit\u2019s scope along with a rationale for its inclusion.", "Conducting fieldwork including testing\u2014The Institute\u2019s standards  require internal auditors to conduct sufficient analysis and document  information to support the audit. The workpapers we reviewed  contained extensive documentation of the fieldwork, such as  interviews with company officials, and testing, such as comparing  company actions to policies and procedures to determine the extent of  compliance. The audit reports we reviewed from the six companies  showed evidence of substantive testing and provided analysis of the  testing showing the level of compliance with company policies,  procedures, business systems, and defense contracts. When testing  was conducted, it was cited in the reports as support for reportable  issues. Some testing relied on judgmental samples, but for certain  audits, such as audits of purchase card transactions, all of the  transactions were examined. In addition, we traced identified findings  through the workpapers to track the testing and the inclusion of the  work in the audit planning. By tracing the findings back to their origin  in the audit objectives, we verified that the findings reported were  supported by sufficient audit work.", "Reporting findings\u2014The audit reports we reviewed followed the  Institute\u2019s standards for reporting results of the audit work by providing  reports to upper management and the audited party. The audit reports  provided the objectives and scope of the audit work and the findings  or issues discovered through the audit work. While the companies do  not follow GAGAS standards, the reports, although brief, contained a  clear explanation of the findings often citing criteria, condition, cause,  and effect as defined in GAGAS. Audit officials at one company  stated that they include only those findings they consider to be the  most important in their reports because that is what company  management has indicated has the most value to them. Officials said  that highlighting the most important issues allows them to prioritize  their resources and take appropriate actions to correct them. In  contrast, some companies include nearly every finding discovered  during the audit work. Illustrative of these different approaches, the  company that only reports on the highest risk issues routinely had 2 to  4 findings per report, while other companies had multiple reports with  more than 10 findings per report.", "Tracking corrective actions\u2014The Institute\u2019s standards require that the  CAE establish a process for the internal audit department to track  corrective actions to ensure they have been implemented or that  management has accepted the risk of not taking the corrective action.  We found that five companies documented the corrective actions they  had taken or intended to take to fix the problems identified in the audit  reports. Usually, the responsibility and accountability for implementing  the corrective actions were assigned to specific individuals and were  generally required to be implemented within a certain time period.  According to officials at one company, if corrective actions are not  taken or completed in a timely manner internal audit management and  company management are notified.

As a  result, the CAC does not necessarily know how frequently or what type of  internal audit information field audit offices are requesting. One of these  CACs noted that the CAC is informed when DCAA teams are denied  access, but otherwise the CAC does not track requests or company  responses. In the case of the one company that has multiple locations but  does not have a CAC, the DCAA audit team does not coordinate internal  audit requests to the company. As a result, the audit team does not know  how many requests for internal audit information are made to company,  what type of information is being requested, or whether the requests are  fulfilled or denied.", "Although DCAA does not generally track requests or denials for internal  audit reports and, therefore, cannot say how many audit reports it asks for  or receives, the companies we reviewed maintain such information with  varying degrees of specificity. Based primarily on information from these  companies, we determined that for the most part, DCAA audit teams  request a small number of company internal audits, even though a  significant number of internal audits pertain to internal controls and  systems that are subject to DCAA audits. The companies provided us  with estimates or specific counts of how many internal audits were  requested by DCAA since 2008. In most cases, the number of reports  requested was significantly fewer than the number of reports we  determined were related to DOD contract oversight. The companies  estimated that DCAA requested 115 audit reports over the 2-year period  while we determined that 520 audit reports were related to some aspect  of oversight of DOD contracts. Information on the number of reports  requested from each of the companies and the number of reports we  determined to be related to oversight of government contracts is  summarized in table 2.", "DCAA auditors we spoke with identified several factors that could affect  the number of internal audits they request.", "Auditors from four DCAA audit teams told us they have difficulty  determining which internal audit reports are relevant to their own  audit work because descriptions of internal audits they receive from  the companies are often too brief to assess the relevancy to ongoing  or planned DCAA audits. Our review of the lists of audits provided to  DCAA confirmed that five of the companies provide only brief titles of  audits, while two provide more detailed summaries that included the  purpose, potential risks, and scope.", "DCAA auditors stated when they request an internal audit report, the  company usually requires them to justify their request by linking it to a  planned or ongoing DCAA audit of a particular contract or proposal.", "As a result, DCAA auditors believe they are limited to requesting only  those reports related to a specific planned or ongoing DCAA audit,  even if the company has other internal audit reports related to  another system or program that DCAA is responsible for auditing.", "Auditors from three DCAA audit teams stated that they did not believe  that access to contractor internal audit information is critical to their  own audit work and that the internal audit reports do not have enough  detail to be helpful. They also stated that they are restricted by  auditing standards in relying on the work of others. However, auditing  standards do not restrict auditors from relying on the work of other  auditors, including internal audit functions. While not reducing the  level of work to be performed by DCAA auditors, consideration of  relevant internal audit reports in planning related DCAA audits and  performing risk assessments can provide useful information for  planning DCAA\u2019s scope of work and audit procedures.", "DCAA has issued significantly fewer audit reports since 2008. The  annual number of DCAA audits of the seven companies selected for  this review decreased by almost 50 percent from 2008 to 2010. The  number of internal control audits DCAA performed on the companies  decreased from 128 to 62 in the same period. A DCAA policy official  noted that DCAA decreased its number of control environment audits  because it was waiting for a regulatory change that would redefine  critical business systems for contractors. As a result of this  decrease, the number of internal audits necessary to supplement  DCAA\u2019s audit work also decreased during this time period.", "Auditors from the DCAA audit teams we spoke with confirmed that while  they request relatively few internal audits, when they are provided access  to the audit reports, they use them primarily to help assess the  companies\u2019 internal controls and to determine whether companies took  corrective action to address reported issues. Other uses of internal audits  that DCAA auditors identified included: assessing the risk associated with a given DCAA audit, identifying the amount of testing needed for a given area, and determining whether company audit report findings identify  unallowable costs that affect government contracts.", "DCAA officials have acknowledged that getting access to internal audit  information has been an issue with some of the major defense  contractors and, at best, they have access on a case-by-case basis. They  also acknowledge that they have not used their subpoena authority to get  access to internal audits or other company documents since the Newport  News decisions were issued in 1988 in part because the Fourth Circuit  Court of Appeals held that the language in the statutes did not generally  include internal audit reports unrelated to a specific contract or proposal.They also stated that the court\u2019s decisions may have resulted in some  DCAA auditors limiting their requests for internal audit information. A  DCAA official noted that they have implemented a pilot program with one  major defense contractor that could be a model for how the agency  disseminates and coordinates internal information. The pilot program  consolidates authority and communication among various field offices  throughout the country that are responsible for auditing the contractor into  one regional audit team. DCAA auditors and company representatives  told us that the pilot provided enhanced communications and efficiency  between DCAA and the company. While the pilot does not specifically  address requests for internal audits, a senior DCAA official suggested  that the model could be applied to the process of requesting and  distributing company internal audit information as well."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["The internal audits conducted by the seven companies we reviewed  generally were conducted in accordance with recognized professional  organizational standards. For individual company audits, the audit reports  and workpapers from five companies demonstrate that they likewise  adhere to recognized professional standards. The audit reports assess  the controls and systems for managing defense contracts that DCAA is  charged with auditing and contain information and analysis that DCAA  could find useful as it conducts its own work. However, DCAA is not  making full use of internal audits to help accomplish its critical oversight  role. This is attributable, in part, to company limits on access to internal  audit information based on their interpretations of DCAA\u2019s access  authority and related court cases. While the courts have held that DCAA  does not have unlimited power to demand access to all internal company  materials, the courts have also made it clear that DCAA may demand  access to materials that are relevant to carrying out its audit  responsibilities. There are other issues that also account for DCAA\u2019s  limited use of internal audit reports. Specifically, DCAA auditors do not  routinely request access to the reports due to limited visibility into the  scope and objectives of internal audits and uncertainty as to how relevant  internal audits can be used. DCAA management lacks insight into the  limited access and use of internal audits because DCAA does not  centrally track requests and denials for access to documents that could  improve its ability to carry out its mission.", "When companies do not provide DCAA with access to internal audits or  DCAA auditors do not request them, DCAA auditors do not have  information that may be relevant for audit planning and risk assessment.  Conversely, greater access to internal audit information could improve  DCAA\u2019s efficiency. DCAA auditors could either conduct a full audit of all  components of internal control, or in instances in which internal auditors  have conducted related work, DCAA auditors could examine the audit  reports and workpapers, if needed, and adjust their planning accordingly.  Moreover, we believe that by not routinely obtaining access to relevant  company internal audits that can inform their audits of the companies\u2019  control environments, as well as audits of specific business systems and  contracts, DCAA auditors are hindered in their ability to meet the GAGAS  requirement for assessing internal controls. The work of the internal  auditors by no means replaces the work of DCAA auditors, but it could  provide DCAA auditors with a basis for making a judgment about a  company\u2019s internal controls and help inform their audit planning, thereby  making more effective and efficient use of DCAA audits."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["To increase DCAA\u2019s access to and use of internal audits, we recommend  that the Secretary of Defense direct that the Director of DCAA take the  following three actions:", "Ensure that DCAA\u2019s central point of contact for each company  coordinates issues pertaining to internal audits.

Coordination responsibilities should include obtaining sufficient information from the companies on their  internal audit reports so DCAA auditors can better identify and  request relevant audit reports and workpapers and  tracking DCAA auditors\u2019 requests for access to internal audit  reports and workpapers and the companies\u2019 disposition of those  requests.", "Periodically assess information compiled by the central points of  contact regarding the number of requests for internal audits and their  disposition to determine whether additional actions are needed.

DOD stated, however, that doing so for smaller  companies may not be feasible or beneficial, as some smaller contractors  may not have sophisticated internal audit functions. DOD further  expressed skepticism that implementing the recommended actions alone  would fully ensure that DCAA would have complete and full access to  contractor internal audits, citing the limits that companies have placed on  DCAA\u2019s access to internal audits and prior legal precedence.", "We agree that for companies without internal audit functions that produce  reports that may be relevant to DCAA\u2019s audit responsibilities, designated  coordinators would not be necessary. We, therefore, revised our original  recommendation to provide for such an exception. We agree that  implementing these recommendations alone may not be sufficient to  provide DCAA with full and complete access to internal audit reports in all  instances. However, implementation of the recommendations is a  necessary step for DCAA to obtain the information needed to determine  the extent to which DCAA is or is not getting access and how that is  affecting DCAA\u2019s ability to fulfill efficiently its oversight responsibilities.  After taking such steps, DOD may be in a better position to identify and  pursue other remedies for ensuring DCAA\u2019s access to internal audit  reports.", "We also provided a draft of the report to the Chief Audit Executives of the  seven selected companies for their review and comment.
