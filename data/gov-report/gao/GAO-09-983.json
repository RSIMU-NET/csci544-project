In 2004, GAO identified a set of key protection practices that include: allocating resources using risk management, leveraging technology, information sharing and coordination, performance measurement and testing, and strategic management of human capital. As requested, GAO determined whether the Park Service's security efforts for national icons and parks reflected key practices. To meet this objective, GAO used its key practices as criteria, reviewed five icons and parks to gain firsthand knowledge, analyzed Interior documents, and interviewed Interior officials."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service has implemented a range of security improvements since the September 11 terrorist attacks and has worked to integrate security into its primary mission to preserve national icons and parks for the public's enjoyment. For example, it has established a senior-level security manager position and taken steps to strengthen security at the icons, and is developing a risk management program for small parks. These efforts exhibit some aspects of the key protection practices, but GAO found limitations in each of the areas. The Park Service does not allocate resources using risk management servicewide or cost-effectively leverage technology. While the Park Service, with assistance from Interior, has conducted risk assessments and implemented countermeasures to enhance security at the icons, some critical vulnerabilities remain. Moreover, the Park Service has not advanced this risk management approach for icons to the rest of its national parks. Without a servicewide risk management approach, the Park Service lacks assurance that security efforts are focused where they are needed. Furthermore, while icons and parks may use a variety of security technologies and other countermeasures, they do not have guidance for evaluating the cost-effectiveness of these investments, thus limiting assurances of efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, the Park Service faces limitations with sharing and coordinating information internally and lacks a servicewide approach for routine performance measurement and testing. Although the Park Service collaborates with external organizations, it lacks comparable arrangements for internal security communications and, as a result, parks are not equipped to share information with one another on common security problems and solutions. Furthermore, the Park Service has not established security performance measures and lacks an analysis tool that could be used to evaluate program effectiveness and inform an overall risk management strategy. Thus, icons and parks have little information on the status and performance of security that they can use to manage daily activities or that Park Service management can use to manage security throughout the organization. Finally, strategic human capital management is an area of concern because of the Park Service's lack of clearly defined security roles and a security training curriculum. For example, staff that are assigned security duties are generally not required to meet qualifications or undergo specialized training. Absent a security training curriculum, there is less assurance that staff are well-equipped to effectively identify and mitigate risks at national icons and parks."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The September 11 terrorist attacks have heightened concerns about the  security of the nation\u2019s icons and parks, which millions of people visit  every year. Attacks on these assets could have profound psychological and  economic effects. The National Park Service (Park Service), within the  Department of the Interior (Interior), is responsible for protecting close to  400 park units that include 5 units Interior has identified as national icons  and other types of parks. While the Park Service has taken some steps to  enhance security, especially at icons and parks along the southwest  border, protecting these treasured assets can be a complex and  contentious task for the agency, which must also ensure that the public  has access to them. In 2002, the Secretary of the Interior established the  Office of Law Enforcement and Security (OLES) to oversee Interior\u2019s  security efforts and to ensure their consistent application across its  bureaus and offices. OLES and the Park Service identified five national  icons as critical assets as part of the government\u2019s homeland security  initiatives.

The key practices essentially form  the foundation of a comprehensive, strategic approach to park protection.  We have used these key practices as criteria to evaluate how the  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Smithsonian Institution  (Smithsonian) secure their assets. Furthermore, the Interagency Security  Committee (ISC), chaired by DHS, is using our key protection practices to  guide its priorities and work activities. The following are the key practices  we used for this review:    Allocation of resources using risk management: Identify threats, assess  vulnerabilities, and determine critical assets to protect; use information on  these and other elements to develop countermeasures; and prioritize the  allocation of resources as conditions change.", "Leveraging of technology: Select technologies to enhance asset security  through methods like access control, detection, and surveillance systems.

We interviewed Interior  officials at the national, regional, and asset levels, including officials from  the Office of the Inspector General (IG), OLES, Park Service, and Park  Police. We reviewed five icons and parks to learn firsthand how the Park  Service protects highly visible assets. We selected these assets because  they have high public visitation, present other potential security  considerations such as recent or planned facility construction, and are  geographically diverse.

After  September 11, the Secretary of the Interior took steps to address serious  organizational and management problems in the law enforcement and  security components of the department. Of particular concern, according  to the Interior IG, was the lack of coordination among these components  and the absence of a meaningful single point of contact that the Secretary  and senior managers could depend upon for reliable information and  advice. The Secretary approved a Deputy Assistant Secretary for Law  Enforcement and Security in July 2002, and established OLES to oversee  the department\u2019s law enforcement and security efforts and ensure their  consistent application across Interior\u2019s bureaus and offices. Specific to  icon protection, in 2003, Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7  (HSPD-7) designated Interior as the sector-specific agency for the National  Monuments and Icons critical infrastructure sector, and Interior selected  OLES to carry out sector responsibilities. To fulfill its duties, OLES  officials developed a national monuments and icons sector-specific plan in  which they defined national icons as: (1) monuments, physical structures,  or objects; (2) recognized both nationally and internationally as  representing the nation\u2019s heritage, traditions, and/or values or are  recognized for their national, cultural, religious, historical, or political  significance; and (3) serve the primary purpose of memorializing or  representing significant aspects of our nation\u2019s heritage, traditions, or  values and serve as points of interest for visitors and educational  activities. In accordance with its assigned duties, OLES officials also  developed a uniform risk assessment and ranking methodology to quantify  risk, identify needed security enhancements, and measure risk-reduction  benefits at icons. OLES officials used this methodology to assess risks at  the icons during 2004 and 2006. OLES has also issued sector annual  reports and established a sector government coordinating council.", "The Park Service\u2019s mission is the unimpaired preservation of the natural  and cultural resources and values of the national park system. The Park  Service is responsible for managing the national icons and the national  park system. In 2008, the Park Service welcomed almost 275 million  visitors to its nearly 400 national park units throughout the United States,  American Samoa, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands. Within the  Visitor and Resource Protection division of the Park Service, the Law  Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Services branch provides policy  formulation, oversight, support services, guidance, and leadership to assist  park managers and law enforcement staff in accomplishing the Park  Service\u2019s visitor protection goals and objectives. This branch is led by a  chief and has one position dedicated to security and intelligence  management. Park superintendents and rangers manage and provide  security and law enforcement services at icons and parks throughout the  United States in conjunction with their other duties. These other duties  include the management of public use, dissemination of scientific and  historical information, and protection and management of natural and  cultural resources. The Park Police, which is a Park Service component,  provides law enforcement and security services for national icons and  parks in Washington, D.C.; New York City; and San Francisco. The Park  Police has also staffed law enforcement specialists in four of seven Park  Service regions including the National Capital, Northeast, Intermountain,  and Pacific West regions.", "We have identified a set of six key protection practices from the collective  practices of federal agencies to provide a framework for guiding agencies\u2019  protection efforts and addressing challenges.

For example, in 2007, we  found that while the Smithsonian follows key practices to protect its  assets, it faces challenges related to ensuring that museum and facility  directors are aware of information on security and funding constraints.  Similarly, in 2005, we found that federal agencies on the National Mall\u2014 the Park Service, Smithsonian, National Gallery of Art, Department of  Agriculture, and U.S. Botanic Garden\u2014were using five of the six key  practices to implement security enhancements. Also, in 2007, we reported  that DHS had taken actions intended to improve the security of its  facilities, but its efforts fell short in certain key areas, such as DHS  components not fully implementing risk management.", "Moreover, the ISC\u2014a body that addresses the quality and effectiveness of  security requirements for federal facilities through developing and  evaluating security standards for federal facilities\u2014is using our key  protection practices as key management practices to guide its priorities  and work activities.

Furthermore, although  icon and park officials have acquired a variety of technologies to enhance  security, they do not have guidance to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of  proposed or actual countermeasures."], "subsections": [{"section_title": "The Park Service Has Focused Risk Management Efforts on Icons and Border Parks but Vulnerabilities Remain", "paragraphs": ["We have reported that most risk management approaches generally  involve identifying the assets that are most critical to protect in terms of  mission and significance, identifying potential threats, assessing  vulnerabilities, and evaluating mitigation alternatives for their likely effect  on risk and their cost. The Park Service and OLES generally employed  such an approach in identifying five icons as critical assets to protect,  assessing risks, and implementing countermeasures. Specifically, OLES  conducted its first round of icon risk assessments during 2004, through  which it identified vulnerabilities that the icons shared. Officials at the  icons worked on implementing the assessments\u2019 recommendations;  therefore OLES\u2019s 2006 icon risk assessments and 2007 compliance reviews  noted significant security improvements, including new surveillance and  monitoring equipment, some barriers installed to protect against vehicle  explosions, and enhanced visitor screening stations and procedures.", "In addition to prioritizing icon security, during 2008 the Secretary of the  Interior directed the Park Service to focus on border park security through  its \u201cSafe Borderlands\u201d initiative, and as a result, the Park Service has also  taken steps to balance security and public access at southwest border  parks. About 41 percent of the land along the U.S. southwest border is  under the control and custody of Interior\u2019s land management bureaus,  including five parks that are under the Park Service. These border parks  face security challenges related to drug smuggling and other unlawful  activities in the area, which have also caused significant environmental  damage. The Safe Borderlands initiative aims to strengthen Interior\u2019s\u2014 including the Park Service\u2019s\u2014law enforcement capabilities, improve its  radio communications, and lessen the environmental impact of illegal  activities. The Park Service and other Interior bureaus have assessed risks  and increased staffing along the southwest border, and have installed  security features, such as vehicle barricades and sensors at certain border  locations, in an effort to prevent illegal aliens and drug smugglers from  entering. According to Park Service officials from the Intermountain  Region, all border parks in their region have ground sensors to detect  illegal traffic and some have alarm systems.", "Despite the significant improvements made in icon security, we noted  some cases in which recommended security countermeasures were not  implemented and vulnerabilities remain. Park officials at the Statue of  Liberty told us that the icon security plan had not been updated since its  creation in 2002; however, later in our review, Park Police officials told us  they updated this plan during 2008. Park officials at the Gateway Arch  have also made notable security improvements, such as moving the  dispatch center away from the arch. However, vulnerabilities still exist at  the park, and security breaches have occurred. Officials from both icons  told us that, while they identify and prioritize security needs, security  projects compete with other operational needs, and these officials must  prioritize and balance competing interests as best they can."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Park Service Lacks a Systematic Approach for Allocating Resources Using Risk Management", "paragraphs": ["Park Service officials at the national, regional, icon, and park levels told us  that security awareness has increased throughout the organization, largely  because of Interior\u2019s initiative to assess security risks at the icons, and the  resources the Park Service has allocated to address these concerns; yet  the Park Service has not formally applied risk management principles for  the rest of its national parks inventory. We have reported that allocating  resources using risk management is a systematic and analytical process to  consider the likelihood that a threat will endanger an asset\u2014structure,  individual, or function\u2014and identify, evaluate, select, and implement  actions that reduce the risk or mitigate the consequences of an event.  However, the Park Service does not require that other parks undergo risk  assessments and therefore there has been no comprehensive servicewide  assessment, prioritization, and mitigation of vulnerabilities. Instead, Park  Service officials use their discretion to request risk assessments from the  Park Service or another entity, and as a result, risk assessments can vary  in their scope and methodology from park to park. Even if Park Service  officials obtain risk assessments, they may not use them to guide park  operations, or they may find it challenging to interpret and implement  recommended actions because they are unfamiliar with the risk  assessment process. Of the three parks we reviewed, only the African  Burial Ground had received a comprehensive risk assessment because it is  in a high-security federal facility that is under the control and custody of  the General Services Administration (GSA) and is protected by the Federal  Protective Service (FPS). The risk assessments of the other two parks  were limited in scope.", "The African Burial Ground is adjacent to a high security multitenant  federal building in New York City and the visitor center is inside the  building. Therefore, the Park Service authorized FPS to provide law  enforcement and security services\u2014such as conducting security  assessments and recommending countermeasures through a memorandum  of understanding. Furthermore, because the Park Service is a tenant in a  GSA building, it receives certain protection services from GSA. For  example, FPS, GSA, and the Park Service collaborated to identify  perimeter fencing for GSA to install around the monument that maintained  park aesthetics and provided protection based on FPS and GSA security  standards (see fig. 1). Also, according to the Northeast regional chief  ranger, the former regional physical security specialist completed a risk  assessment of the park in 2006. In accordance with the memorandum, FPS  will continue to address security vulnerabilities at the African Burial  Ground, such as visitor screening, in collaboration with the park.", "In 2008, the Gettysburg Foundation\u2014a private, nonprofit educational  organization working with the Park Service at Gettysburg\u2014hired a  security consulting firm to complete a risk assessment specifically for the  new visitor center and museum that it constructed on its land within the  park. The assessment included recommendations for protecting artifacts,  infrastructure, visitors, and staff, and the Gettysburg Foundation  implemented some of the countermeasures. For example, the Gettysburg  Foundation purchased surveillance cameras, and Park Service rangers  monitor them. The Park Service is responsible for protecting visitors and  providing a safe environment for visitors and staff. Moreover, the risk  assessment was only for the visitor center and museum, not the park as a  whole. According to the chief ranger, the park faces security challenges  from the numerous roads leading into it and its open borders.", "In 2006, Park Service officials at the Grand Canyon\u2014with more than 4  million visitors annually\u2014requested a risk assessment through their  participation in the Arizona Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF). The  Arizona Counter Terrorism Information Center fulfilled the request and  identified points of vulnerability and potential security improvements at  the park. The center\u2019s assessment cited concerns with the location of the  dispatch center and wiring system, and Park Service officials are taking  steps to mitigate these risks, such as moving the dispatch center to a more  secure location and upgrading the wiring. Additionally, Park Service  officials enhanced security for the fee collection booths by having  surveillance cameras installed. However, even though the assessment  contained actionable items, the chief ranger told us it lacked details that  would have made it more helpful. The chief ranger considered assigning a  Park Service staff person to the center to learn more about the risk  assessment methodology, but the time commitment was prohibitive.", "In addition to lacking a systematic approach for assessing risk throughout  its inventory, the Park Service lacks guidance and tools that officials at  icons and parks can use to develop risk management strategies. The Park  Service\u2019s 40-chapter law enforcement manual, which was updated in 2008,  focuses primarily on law enforcement policies and responsibilities. One  chapter on physical security broadly outlines the duties of the physical  security coordinator and delineates closed-circuit television policy, but  does not include other guidance such as risk assessment procedures and  how to use technology to enhance security. Park Service officials we  spoke with had mixed views on the manual. Officials from three of the  four regions we spoke with said the manual lacks comprehensive physical  security information and guidance, while officials from the fourth region  considered the manual to be useful. While officials at the Gateway Arch  and Gettysburg told us that they used the manual and found it useful for  physical security, officials at the Statue of Liberty and the Grand Canyon  said they did not use the manual to guide park security operations. The  superintendent at the African Burial Ground told us that other Park  Service staff advising the park refer to the manual. Park Police officials  told us that they do not use the Park Service\u2019s law enforcement manual.  Instead, they rely on the Park Police law enforcement manual for security  guidance at locations where the Park Police are responsible for physical  security, such as the Statue of Liberty.", "The Park Service also relies on Interior\u2019s physical security manual which  sets forth the policies designed to safeguard Interior personnel and  facilities, including buildings, grounds, and other property. OLES  developed the manual using the Department of Justice\u2019s facility security  level standards and minimum security countermeasure standards. OLES  officials told us that they adopted ISC\u2019s updated facility security level  standards, and notified bureau security managers of changes. The Park  Service\u2019s Acting Chief of the Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency  Services division and the Security and Intelligence Program Manager told  us that they are developing a process for updating icons\u2019 and parks\u2019  individual facility security levels based on the revised standards. However,  the department-level physical security manual is focused on general  facility protection and officials from the regions, icons, and parks told us it  would be more useful if it were tailored to park-specific security issues.  For example, officials from two of the regions we spoke with found the  manual unhelpful, though officials from the other two regions considered  the manual the main driver for security policy. Park Service officials at the  icons and parks we spoke with had mixed reviews as well. For example,  officials at the Gateway Arch and Gettysburg told us that they used the  manual and found it useful\u2014much as they did the Park Service\u2019s law  enforcement manual\u2014while officials at the Statue of Liberty and the  Grand Canyon said they did not use the manual to guide park security  operations.", "While officials at icons and parks are required to develop and implement  physical security plans and conduct physical security surveys, there is no  standardized approach, tools, or guidance for carrying out these  responsibilities. In the absence of a standardized approach, some Park  Service officials from the regions are developing their own risk assessment  tools and guidance for parks to use. Although officials from the regions are  taking actions that could help parks allocate resources using risk  management in accordance with the key practice, these initiatives are  being developed independently without a servicewide strategy.", "The Intermountain regional office has provided parks with a physical  security plan template and workbook with guidance on how to assess risk  and identify appropriate countermeasures.", "The Midwest regional office is updating a small parks assessment program  that it originally created during 2002 by developing a physical security  assessment checklist for Park Service rangers to identify deficiencies at  parks.", "The Northeast regional office plans to create a team made up of rangers  and cultural staff that they can send to parks to work with staff to assess  security and develop strategies to mitigate vulnerabilities.", "At the national level, the Park Service recognizes that parks should have  tools available to help them assess risks and that physical security plans  and assessments should be standardized. Therefore, the Park Service is  developing a physical security handbook to standardize physical  assessment processes servicewide. Park Service officials are using a U.S.  Geological Survey physical security handbook and Interior\u2019s physical  security manual to develop the Park Service\u2019s physical security handbook.  The Park Service is also developing a small park assessment program  based on the Midwest Region\u2019s program, which it intends to test in one  region before implementing it servicewide. However, the Park Service has  not considered the other regions\u2019 approaches and is therefore missing an  opportunity to leverage best practices and lessons learned, and create buy- in for a new security program. For example, the Acting Chief of the Law  Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Services division and the Security  and Intelligence Program Manager were unfamiliar with the Intermountain  Region\u2019s physical security template and workbook, explaining that  officials at each regional office take their own approach to physical  security.", "Lacking a systematic approach for assessing risk throughout the Park  Service\u2019s inventory of icons and parks has negative effects. First and  foremost, the Park Service lacks assurance that decisions about security  are based on an assessment of potential threats and countermeasures.  Although highly visible icons are the most plausible terrorist targets, it is  not unreasonable to presume that parks with high visitor volumes or other  national parks, monuments, memorials, and facilities that have symbolic  value may also be targets. Second, risk management practices provide the  foundation for a comprehensive protection program. Hence, efforts in the  other key practice areas\u2014leveraging technology, information sharing and  coordination, performance measurement and testing, and human capital  management\u2014are diminished if they are not part of a risk management  approach which can be the vehicle for using these practices. Lastly, as  previously discussed, individual efforts by officials at regions, icons, and  parks to develop risk management tools and security approaches in the  absence of overarching guidance are not conducive to sharing lessons  learned and leveraging efficiencies."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Park Service Does Not Have Guidance or Standards That Would Assist Icons and Parks in Leveraging Technology", "paragraphs": ["Officials at icons and parks use a variety of technologies and other  countermeasures\u2014such as video and surveillance monitoring equipment,  visitor screening equipment, vehicle barriers, and door locks\u2014to enhance  security operations (see table 1). We have reported that by efficiently  using technology to supplement and reinforce other security measures,  agencies can more effectively address vulnerabilities identified through  the risk management process with appropriate countermeasures.", "Additionally, officials at icons we reviewed are partnering with other  agencies to test and obtain security technologies. By pooling resources  and sharing equipment, officials at icons are leveraging expertise and cost- effectively enhancing their security. As we have reported, technology  implementation costs can be high, and the type of technology used should  be carefully analyzed to ensure its effectiveness and efficiency. For  example, at the Statue of Liberty, the U.S. Air Force used the park as a  testing ground for emerging technologies, and the arrangement allowed  the Park Service to keep the equipment. For example, according to Park  Service officials, the U.S. Air Force has tested wireless cameras, weather  stations, and chemical, radiological, biological, nuclear, and explosives  detection systems on Liberty Island. Park Service and Park Police officials  told us that the weather stations are particularly useful to them since the  Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requires weather data for fining  aircraft that violate airspace rules near the Statue of Liberty. According to  the Park Police, this partnership has been extended into 2010.", "Despite icon and park officials\u2019 use of various technologies and other  countermeasures to enhance security, the Park Service has not developed  guidance on how to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of proposed or actual  security investments. We have recognized that having an approach that  allows for cost-effectively leveraging technology to supplement and  reinforce other measures would represent an advanced security approach  in this area. Without such guidance, icon and park officials rely on other  methods to identify systems and equipment that best suit their needs. This,  however, is an inefficient way to enhance security, particularly in light of  icon and park officials\u2019 competing resource demands and regular  developments in technology that necessitate upgrades. For example,  officials from two Park Service regions told us that parks contact them for  assistance in identifying security equipment. Officials at the icons we  reviewed cited instances of using a trial and error approach to identify  cost-effective and suitable technologies. For example, officials at both the  Statue of Liberty and the Gateway Arch use magnetometers and X-ray  machines to screen visitors and their belongings. After several years of  purchasing security equipment, Park Police officials at the Statue of  Liberty have realized that they can acquire new and more effective space- saving visitor screening equipment faster through leasing agreements.  Park Police officials told us that they intend to lease equipment in the  future to stay current with emerging technologies and ensure equipment is  maintained. Moreover, in its 2007 compliance review, OLES recommended  that park officials lease equipment because such an approach would allow  for quicker and less costly upgrades as new technology is developed. In  contrast, Park Service officials at the Gateway Arch plan to continue  purchasing this equipment. Officials at both icons have made these  decisions based on preference without formal cost-benefit analysis.  Officials from the Midwest Regional Office, Statue of Liberty, and Gateway  Arch suggested that the Park Service could better assist icon and park  officials in making informed decisions about security technologies and  other countermeasures."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "The Park Service Lacks a Servicewide Approach to Sharing Information Internally and Measuring Performance", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service has information sharing and coordination arrangements  with external organizations at the national, regional, icon, and park levels,  but lacks comparable arrangements for internal security communications  that would allow icon and park officials to share information with one  another on common security problems and solutions.

Specifically, an information  sharing practice that we have found to be an important success factor in  protecting critical infrastructure is holding regularly scheduled meetings  during which participants can share security management practices,  discuss emerging technologies, and create committees to perform specific  tasks such as policy setting. However, the Park Service\u2019s use of regularly  scheduled security meetings is limited, and security discussions typically  occur on an as-needed basis. The Park Service\u2019s Law Enforcement,  Security, and Emergency Services branch holds a monthly conference call  with regional chief rangers, which covers a variety of topics and is not  solely focused on security. Regional officials we spoke with said they meet  with icon and park officials to discuss security issues on an as-needed  basis. Icon and park officials can contact Park Service regional law  enforcement or even the Park Service\u2019s Intelligence and Security Program  Manager for security assistance as needed.", "Icon and park officials could access needed information anytime through a  Park Service security Web portal, but this tool does not exist servicewide  and is instead under development. We have reported that secure Web  portals are another important success factor in protecting critical  infrastructure and can ensure effective and timely communication among  an organization\u2019s members. Web portals can be used to (1) disseminate  all types of information, including alerts, advisories, reports, and other  analysis; (2) provide methods for members to ask each other about  particular incidents, vulnerabilities, or potential solutions; and (3) share  sensitive information. For example, GSA\u2019s security division is developing  a Web portal to track incidents, share threat information, post security  policies and other related documents, and enable virtual security  discussions. The Park Service recognizes a need to improve its use of  technology to disseminate security information through mechanisms such  as a Web site and Web conferencing, thereby enhancing its application of  the information sharing and coordination key practice. However, the Park  Service\u2019s security Web portal is still under development without a  timetable for completion. According to OLES officials, Interior\u2019s Office of  Emergency Management maintains a secure Web site known as  SAFETALK, where sensitive information and policies can be exchanged  and stored. However, only authorized individuals are allowed to access the  portal, and over the course of our review, no Park Service or Park Police  officials we spoke to at the national, regional, icon, or park levels cited  this Web site as a primary security information source. Without its own  Web portal, the Park Service is limited in its ability to disseminate key icon  and park-specific security information and guidance to icons and parks  efficiently and raise security awareness overall.", "In the absence of a servicewide secure Web portal, some Park Service  regional offices have developed law enforcement and security Web sites,  but the functionality, content, and usage of these sites vary from region to  region. For example, while officials from the Intermountain regional office  said that they regularly update their Web site with security resources,  officials from the Midwest and Pacific West regions said their law  enforcement and security Web sites were used infrequently and not to  their fullest extent. The Midwest regional chief ranger told us that officials  from the region\u2019s icons and parks make limited use of the regional Web  site, instead preferring to contact someone in the regional office for  assistance or to obtain policy documents. Officials from the Midwest and  Pacific West regions acknowledged that more could be done to enhance  the content of their Web sites and promote greater usage. For example, the  Pacific West regional chief ranger cited the inability of parks to  communicate with one another as a limitation on the usefulness of the  regional Web site as a tool for protecting visitors and resources. The Web  site offers one-way communication from the region to the field, but the  region is trying to increase the site\u2019s functionality and usage by adding  discussion threads and message boards, and displaying successful park  security strategies and plans. Also, the Northeast regional chief ranger told  us the office is considering creating a Web site to post security-related  lessons learned and security assessment templates."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Park Service Lacks a Servicewide Approach for Routine Performance Measurement and Testing", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service\u2014at the national level\u2014has no standardized performance  measures, evaluation mechanisms, or a testing program for security  servicewide.

Linking goals to a security program can be used to hold  agencies and program offices accountable for achieving those goals.  Furthermore, we reported that such alignment increases the usefulness of  performance information to decision makers.", "Although the Park Service requires icon and park officials to report  security incidents, it has no centralized reporting and analysis mechanism,  thus these Park Service units have created their own incident-tracking  tools. The Park Service began developing an incident reporting and  analysis tool in 2003, but Interior decided to transfer the project to OLES  and leverage it for the whole department. Interior\u2019s intent is that all  bureaus\u2014including the Park Service\u2014will use the Incident Management  Analysis and Reporting System for a variety of security performance  measurement and management activities, such as reporting incidents,  identifying training and resource needs, justifying resource requests and  expenditures, measuring program performance, and tracking training.  These functions coincide with some of the uses and results of  performance measurement that we have recognized, such as assessing the  change in the total number of security incidents to evaluate program  effectiveness and inform the overall risk management approach, as shown  in figure 2. However, Interior expects that this tool will not be available  until 2011 or 2012, therefore, until the new system is implemented, the  Park Service will continue to be limited in its ability to identify common  threats and incidents\u2014information which it could use to evaluate risk  management strategies and countermeasures, identify problems, and  develop solutions.", "Regional officials may perform two to three park law enforcement  operational evaluations annually by selecting parks for evaluation or  responding to a park\u2019s request for an evaluation. These assessments have a  small security component, but are not security evaluations. For example,  the Midwest regional chief ranger examines the security of park fee  collections and the types of locks on windows and doors of park facilities,  according to this official. Officials from some of the icons and parks we  reviewed recognized a need for standardized performance measures and  testing. For example, Park Police officials at the Statue of Liberty told us  they would like a standardized testing and evaluation program for security  technologies, instead of solely relying on informal testing efforts such as  the Park Police\u2019s collaboration with TSA to test visitor screening  equipment. Similarly, Park Service officials from the Gateway Arch  expressed an interest in coordinated reviews of the park\u2019s security that  would incorporate markers for achievement. Because performance is  measured and tested occasionally and inconsistently, officials from icons  and parks have limited opportunities for sharing lessons learned or using  performance data to manage security from a broader perspective.", "We have reported that performance measurement can help achieve broad  program goals and improve security at the individual asset level. Without  effective performance measurement data, decision makers may have  insufficient information to evaluate whether their investments have  improved security or reduced vulnerabilities to threats such as terrorism  or crime. We have also reported that active testing, using methods such as  on-site security assessments, can provide data on the effectiveness of  efforts to reduce vulnerabilities. Because the Park Service\u2019s performance  management and testing capability is limited, the agency has little  information on the status and performance of security activities at the  icons and parks it can use to manage day-to-day activities or that Park  Service management can use to strategize security efforts throughout the  organization. Absent a formal performance measurement system and  testing program, officials at icons and parks individually identify security  program components to test, such as focusing on equipment and  procedural knowledge. We have reported that testing methods include  conducting inspections to ensure that adequate levels of protection are  employed, testing the effectiveness of security measures such as structural  enhancements and physical barriers, and assessing preparedness through  training exercises and drills. We found some examples of tests, exercises,  and drills that park officials use to assess security performance at icons  and parks (see table 3). For example, officials at the Grand Canyon said  that they analyze law enforcement and security incidents to shape patrol  strategies, and officials at the Statue of Liberty told us they hold  emergency exercises with the New York Police Department and FBI."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Human Capital Management Lacks a Security Focus", "paragraphs": ["The Park Service assigns security duties to selected regional staff and  requires that icon and park superintendents designate physical security  coordinators, but it does not require these staff to have physical security  experience or expertise, and it does not provide them with specialized  security training.

At the national level, the Park Service has  established a Security and Intelligence Program Manager position within  its Law Enforcement, Security, and Emergency Services division. This  position was created in 2003, in response to a 2002 Interior IG  recommendation that Interior bureaus install full-time security managers.  We have also recognized the importance of having a chief security officer  position and the security industry maintains that such a position is  essential in organizations with large numbers of mission-critical assets.

The Security and Intelligence  Program Manager performs a variety of duties, such as liaising with DHS  to improve security within the southwest border parks, coordinating with  OLES to develop semiannual security workshops, conducting risk  assessments when parks request them, and gathering, analyzing, and  disseminating intelligence information. This official also oversees some of  the national initiatives we have previously described, such as the small  parks assessment program and the security Web portal.

Of the four regional offices we  reviewed, only the Northeast Regional Office, had a full-time position  dedicated to security. From 2002 to 2007, the regional office employed a  physical security and intelligence specialist who performed a variety of  activities such as conducting risk assessments, establishing technology- sharing relationships with other federal agencies, and analyzing and  disseminating intelligence throughout the agency. This position was  vacated in 2007, but the regional chief ranger is trying to staff this position  again and is revising the position description to focus on physical security.  Park Police law enforcement specialists are staffed to the National Capital,  Northeast, Intermountain, and Pacific West regional offices and can  provide security assistance.

These staff may conduct risk assessments or  help identify security technologies or other countermeasures, as shown in  table 4.", "The Park Service requires icon and park superintendents to designate  physical security coordinators and expects them to develop and  implement park physical security plans and conduct physical security  surveys of all structures. Park Service officials told us that, typically,  physical security coordinators are park rangers or maintenance managers,  who have other duties and responsibilities in addition to security.  Moreover, because of the small size of some parks, one person may serve  as the physical security coordinator for several parks. For example, the  Intermountain Regional Chief Ranger told us that the region has 41  physical security coordinators positioned at about 56 of its 78 parks. We  found that physical security coordinators perform a variety of duties, such  as overseeing dispatch center operations and reviewing video surveillance  images, as shown in table 5. Additionally, Park Service law enforcement  rangers and Park Police staff at icons and parks have some security  responsibilities in addition to law enforcement duties.", "Despite the range of security duties assigned to regional staff, physical  security coordinators, law enforcement rangers, and Park Police staff, the  Park Service does not provide them with specialized training. Moreover,  senior Park Service officials told us that they do not have an inventory of  all the physical security coordinators servicewide, and they do not track  their duties. We have noted that the effectiveness of a risk management  approach depends on the involvement of experienced and professional  security personnel and that the chances of omitting major steps in the risk  management process increase if personnel are not well trained in applying  risk management. Without training for security staff, or evaluations of  their security activities, there is little assurance that risks are identified  and mitigated and that staff are held accountable for results.", "Though the Park Service lacks a physical security training program, it has  partnered with OLES to organize security workshops at icons and other  critical assets such as the Hoover Dam (see table 6). Park Service and Park  Police staff are invited to attend, but attendance is contingent upon time  and resource availability. For example, staff from the icons we reviewed  and the regions we interviewed had attended some of these workshops,  but no staff from the African Burial Ground, Gettysburg, or the Grand  Canyon had attended. Officials at regions, icons, and parks may also  develop security training internally or in collaboration with external  agencies. We have reported that (1) training exercises are useful in  assessing preparedness,(2) effective security entails having well-trained  staff that follow and enforce policies and procedures, and (3) good  training and practice are essential to successfully implementing policies by  ensuring that personnel exercise good judgment in following security  procedures.", "Additionally, Park Service rangers can try to enroll in two physical  security courses that are offered at the Federal Law Enforcement Training  Center (FLETC)\u2014the physical security training program and the critical  infrastructure protection training program.

For example, the physical security  specialist at the Gateway Arch tried to enroll in the physical security  course for more than 18 months before gaining admission and completing  the course in 2008.  According to Park Service officials, this specialist may  also be able to attend the critical infrastructure training. No park staff  from the Statue of Liberty have completed the physical security course  since 2001. Moreover, Park Service officials told us that no staff from the  African Burial Ground, Gettysburg, or Grand Canyon have completed  either of the two FLETC training courses.

We have  reported that it is widely recognized that there is a need for competent  professionals who can effectively manage complex security programs that  are designed to reduce threats to people and assets. Clearly defining  roles and responsibilities and ensuring that security personnel are  adequately trained are central aspects of this key practice. In its 2008  assessment of the Park Police, the IG recommended that the Park Service  hire a qualified senior-level certified security professional to oversee Park  Service security operations at all icons, including those that are mana by the Park Police, but the Park Service does not believe such action is  necessary.

According to OLES officials, the Park Service  security manager meets the minimum security training requirements for  senior-level security managers that OLES established in 2009. The  Interior IG also recognized that this manager has been through extensive  physical security training. Although the Park Police created an Homeland  Security Division in October 2008 and established a security manager  position in accordance with the IG\u2019s 2002 recommendation, the IG  reported in 2009 that the appointee to this position\u2014a Deputy Chief\u2014had  no background in physical security and had only been through a basic 2  week critical infrastructure protection course at FLETC. According to  the Park Police, the Deputy Chief is qualified for the position having  (1)  attended a 2 week DHS program on critical infrastructure and key  resource protection in August 2008, (2) worked on icon protection issues  for 4 years, (3) designed security upgrades at the Washington Monument,  and, (4) over the course of 25 years, worked on security system alarm  issues in Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.  Furthermore, the Park  Police told us that the Deputy Chief received a certification after  completing DHS\u2019s Critical Infrastructure and Key Resources Protection  course. OLES officials also told us that the Deputy Chief has met the  department\u2019s minimum training requirements.", "The Interior IG and OLES officials are also concerned about the Park  Service\u2019s management of security operations at individual icons. In its  2003 icon protection report, the IG suggested that icons with the most  significant threat potential should have trained and certified security  managers on-site, and in 2008, recommended that the Park Service install  trained and certified security professionals at each icon park to work  under the direction of the security manager the IG had recommended for  all of the icons. In its 2006 icon risk assessment and 2007 icon  compliance reviews, OLES recommended that Independence National  Historic Park and the Statue of Liberty hire security managers. While  officials at these two icons have identified hiring security managers as a  priority, they had yet to fill the positions at the time of our review. While  park officials at the Statue of Liberty have identified hiring a security  manager as a top priority, they have not determined whether the Park  Service or the Park Police will fund the position. In 2007, the Park Pol hired a security manager for the National Capital Region. The Deputy  Chief of the Icon Protection Division told us that the Park Police intends  to hire a technical assistant for this manager who can, for example, repair  security equipment.", "Of the five icons, only the Gateway Arch has a full-time physical security  specialist\u2014a need the park identified on its own and filled with a qualified  professional. Park officials at the Gateway Arch created and staffed this  position during 2006 and had to give up one law enforcement position to  do so. The park\u2019s assistant chief rangers, who are law enforcement  officers, told us they believe the tradeoff was justified and the specialist\u2019s  efforts may increase awareness among staff. The physical security  specialist has undertaken a number of initiatives, such as conducting a  risk assessment of the facility where park officials wanted to locate its  dispatch center, testing security alarms in the visitor center, sending park  employees security awareness e-mails, and forming partnerships with area  federal departments and agencies such as DHS, the Department of Justice,  and the U.S. Postal Service to enhance surveillance capabilities, acquire  interoperable communications technology, and assess mail handling.  Moreover, the Midwest Region has leveraged the specialist\u2019s expertise to  help the region develop a risk assessment tool for its small parks security  program. OLES officials told us that of the five icons, the Gateway Arch  had the highest security policy compliance rating in 2007, and although  they did not attribute this rating to the physical security specialist\u2019s work,  it is worthwhile to note that the Gateway Arch is the only icon that has a  full-time position dedicated solely to physical security."], "subsections": []}]}, {"section_title": "Conclusions", "paragraphs": ["In addition to its primary mission to preserve the natural and cultural  resources and values of the national park system for the enjoyment,  education, and inspiration of those who visit them, the Park Service has a  critical role related to security at national icons and parks and has taken  important steps to improve the security of nearly 400 national icons and  parks.

For the second recommendation to  develop guidance and standards to leverage security technology, Interior  cited some examples of the partnerships it has with other federal agencies  and acknowledged that guidance and standards for leveraging technology,  coupled with an effective communications strategy, would add to the  effectiveness and efficiency of its security program for icons and parks.  With respect to the third recommendation, Interior stated that a more  formal internal communications strategy would enhance the effectiveness  of its security program for icons and parks and noted that such a strategy  should acknowledge the critical importance of the communication  networks icons and parks establish at the asset level. For the fourth  recommendation to develop and implement a servicewide performance  management and testing program, Interior stated that while its current  approach has been effective in some situations, applying a servicewide  approach would benefit all icons and parks in the system.

While these  other security courses may be helpful, as we reported, not all Park Service  personnel that have security responsibilities are able to attend these  training classes due to the space limitations of the entities offering these  courses and resource constraints on the part of individual icons and parks.  Furthermore, as we reported, the Park Service does not have a special  training curriculum for its designated physical security coordinators.
