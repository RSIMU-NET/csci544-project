However, State did not report to the Congress on the results of this review until December 1996 (after it was asked to comment on a draft of our report). State officials told us the review consisted of a series of interagency meetings to discuss raw assessment data provided by the key U.S. stakeholders in the organizations, but that they did not prepare a formal record of the review or at that time prioritize funding by organization. State officials said that assigning a priority to each organization would have been very difficult, given the differences in their size, mission, cost, and program effectiveness.", "Nonetheless, as a result of its review, in December 1995 State informed three entities\u2014the International Cotton Advisory Committee (ICAC), the Pan American Railway Congress Association, and the World Tourism Organization\u2014that the United States intended to withdraw from them. State acknowledged that the withdrawals were budget driven, but it also justified the withdrawals on the basis that the private industries that were the focus of these organizations were already adequately served. A State official said that while there may be other organizations that the United States could withdraw from in the future, decisions on withdrawal would likely continue to be hindered by a lack of quantitative performance indicators for each organization and by objections raised by the organizations\u2019 political supporters and constituency groups.", "In testifying on the administration\u2019s fiscal year 1997 budget request before a House Subcommittee on May 2, 1996, the U.S. Permanent Representative to the United Nations said the criteria that are applied in determining whether to retain membership in international organizations are (1) the level of direct U.S. benefit in political, strategic, or economic terms determined on the basis of consultations with end users; (2) the percentage of the organization\u2019s budget that is devoted to activities that benefit the United States; (3) the scope and depth of the U.S. constituency; (4) the relevancy of the organization\u2019s mandate to contemporary global issues; (5) the organization\u2019s program effectiveness and quality of management; (6) the organization\u2019s budgetary restraint and transparency; and (7) the organization\u2019s responsiveness to the U.S. government\u2019s overall reform efforts.", "State\u2019s December 1996 report to the Congress assembled the 50 organizations, including the 27 discussed in this report, into 3 broad cluster groups according to a priority ranking based on the importance of their mandates to the U.S. national interest and their cost-effectiveness. These cluster groups, in order of priority, were (1) peace and security; (2) health, safety, and economic well-being; and (3) selective interest. Our analysis indicated that none of the 27 organizations discussed in this report were included in State\u2019s top priority category (peace and security); 4 were in State\u2019s second priority category (health, safety, and economic well-being); 20 were in State\u2019s third priority category (selective interest); and 3 were no longer being funded by State. As a further delineation of priority, State\u2019s report showed that, of the four organizations discussed in our report that fell within the second priority category, contributions to one would be reduced by 18 percent and contributions to three would be reduced 19 percent from the full requirement for fiscal year 1997. Similarly, of the 20 organizations discussed in this report that were in State\u2019s third priority category, contributions to 11 would be reduced by 19 percent; 1 would be reduced by 21 percent; 7 would be reduced by 23 percent; and 1 would receive no funding for fiscal year 1997.

U.S. government officials also stated that in many cases the organizations serve specific U.S. government or commercial interests that cannot be served as efficiently by other means. Further, they considered most of the organizations\u2019 program focus to be generally clear, valid, and in conformity with U.S. interests, but some primarily benefited their related industries. U.S. officials in many instances were active and influential participants in the organizations\u2014often serving on their governing boards and with some Americans serving in top management posts.", "In general, U.S. government participation in these organizations is designed to help ensure that U.S. interests are fairly and equitably considered in international commercial activities and disputes, and that the United States has access to vital public health, transportation safety, and other information. U.S. participation also allows active engagement in exchanging and promoting ideas for reducing trade barriers, unifying common standards of business trading practice (such as weights, measurements, and quality control), influencing environmental policy and providing voluntary support for conservation programs and sustaining endangered natural resources, and deliberating other issues of broad public interest. These are matters that officials from the relevant agencies told us the U.S. government either cannot do alone or cannot address as effectively through other bilateral or multilateral means.", "Nonetheless, there may be opportunities for cost savings in some of the organizations. For example, the assessed U.S. rates for two organizations (the Customs Cooperation Council and the International Center for the Study, Preservation, and Restoration of Cultural Property), both based on U.N. formulas at 25 percent, are significantly higher than most of the other special-purpose international organizations. Although U.S. officials see no viable alternative at this time to membership in the customs organization to support the broad trade interests it serves, its work is closely tied to that of the World Trade Organization to which the United States pays a much lower (15 percent) assessment rate. The cultural property organization by contrast has a narrow and important national historic (but not foreign policy-related) constituency and, though U.S. officials generally consider it to be well managed, the benefits are difficult to quantify and some officials believe that they do not appear to be proportionate to the cost.", "Our review also found that State has addressed to some extent the issue of whether functions or organizations could be combined or whether similar services were available from other sources that could eliminate possible areas of overlap and duplication. For example, a possible merger of some functions between organizations (including the IBWM/IOLM and IARC/World Health Organization) had been identified and was being examined by the respective organizations as a way to achieve cost savings. Also, rapid technological change may soon permit private sector sources to translate customs tariff schedules at less cost than IBPCT, and we found some areas of possible overlap between certain organizations, such as those involving the tropical timber (ITTO) and vine and wine (IOVW) groups and the Food and Agriculture Organization that U.S. officials had not fully addressed or resolved.", "We noted that five commodity organizations\u2014four that produce and disseminate market data and one that helps stabilize raw material supplies and prices through a stock fund\u2014were all designed to primarily benefit their related industries; and officials we interviewed indicated that three others in which the U.S. government participated had minimal benefits.

Nonetheless, there are benefits to U.S. membership. According to government officials we interviewed, the information the organizations develop on worldwide production and consumption of the respective commodity is objective and current, and generally not available elsewhere. In addition, the organizations provide a useful forum for encouraging or promoting intergovernmental and business cooperation and exchanging views on matters of joint interest without violating antitrust laws. However, based on the criteria adopted by State, the question appears to be whether government or public interests are sufficiently served by membership in these organizations to justify continued financing of activities that primarily benefit specific U.S. industries.", "U.S. membership in the organizations seems to be especially important to specific industry groups, which participate actively in them at their own expense. They send representatives to parliamentary meetings and working group sessions (their experts have been selected to serve on technical study groups), and they finance cooperative projects, and generate subscriptions and other fees that reduce the cost to member countries."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The International Natural Rubber Organization", "paragraphs": ["The International Natural Rubber Organization administers an international natural rubber agreement, which the United States has participated in since it took effect in 1979. The agreement was designed to reduce price volatility and ensure an adequate supply of natural rubber by managing a buffer stock. In September 1996, the U.S. Senate ratified the agreement to participate for an additional 4 years. As the world\u2019s largest consumer of natural rubber and with just three countries\u2014Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia\u2014producing 75 percent of the world\u2019s rubber supply, the United States has a significant interest in assuring an adequate long-term supply of this commodity at reasonable and stable prices. The executive branch supported the agreement\u2019s extension, but expressed a preference for free market forces to operate in the belief that they better serve the interest of consumers and producers. However, it believed that the rubber industry needed more time to develop alternative institutions to manage market risk. Nevertheless, several unresolved issues emerged during the debate, including whether the agreement resulted in lower prices for U.S. consumers and whether the level of cash reserves used to support it\u2014the current U.S. share of which is about $80 million\u2014is needed and adequately safeguarded.

Membership gives congressional delegates the opportunity to discuss with foreign colleagues\u2014especially those from emerging democracies\u2014U.S. principles of multiparty democracy and rule of law. IPU also enables them to share their experiences relating to the legislative process and executive-legislative-judiciary relations.", "However, Members of Congress have not been active IPU participants in recent years. We found that no Senator has attended any IPU meeting since 1989, and no Representative has attended any IPU meeting since March 1994. State officials and congressional staff attributed the inactive U.S. participation in the organization in recent years to changes in the Congress and inconvenient scheduling of IPU meetings (its meetings are normally held in April and September when the Congress is in session, making it inconvenient for members to attend). IPU also sought to raise the U.S. assessment rate from 12.58 percent ($1.1 million in 1995) to 15 percent, or above a statutory limitation of 13.61 percent.", "The administrative responsibility for IPU shifts with each Congress and, for the 104th Congress, it rested with the House of Representatives (administered by the Clerk\u2019s Office). Fiscal year 1996 appropriations legislation initially held up IPU funding until IPU agreed to reverse the proposed assessment increase and adjust its schedule to better accommodate U.S. participation.

The United States joined BIE in 1968, 40 years after its creation, with the aim of ending a then-existing proliferation of officially sanctioned expositions and assisting U.S. cities that were bidding to host them. Since then, the frequency of expositions has been drastically reduced and no U.S. city is currently seeking to host any scheduled international exposition. Moreover, recent funding for U.S. pavilions at expositions has been provided entirely from the private sector. The U.S.-assessed contribution for BIE is modest ($33,000 in 1995), but it pays the highest assessment rate (8.9 percent) of any member nation. The assessment rate is based in part on the U.N. scale of assessments and on the member states\u2019 size and economic production. State and other agency officials said that there was strong sentiment both in favor of and in opposition to U.S. membership in BIE. Proponents argue that the membership could be justified if the federal government seeks to continue to officially support and maintain an active role in determining where and how future world\u2019s fairs are to be held. They further contend that it might be in the public interest to assist potential sponsors in attaining the rights to hold future events since memberships are limited to national governments and BIE members are in more advantageous policy decision-making positions.

In response to reform efforts encouraged and led by Mexico and the United States, IAII installed a new director in 1996 who is reported to be making positive structural changes in the organization. In the meantime, State has adopted a \u201cwait-and-see\u201d approach regarding future U.S. funding and participation. The United States does not recognize IAII\u2019s assessment rates, which are based on outdated Indian population figures. Instead, it has capped its annual assessment contribution at  $120,000 annually, which in 1995 represented 44 percent of IAII\u2019s budget. Although the rate is high relative to other participants (Mexico paid 30 percent in 1995, with no other country paying more than 4 percent; Canada is not a member), it is less than what the United States would have to pay if the assessment rate were based on the current OAS scale (59 percent) or on gross national product data (estimated at 80 percent).

Thus, they have attempted to link funding decisions for the small special-purpose international organizations to performance indicators, established a more systematic budget review and coordination process, and tried to secure increased private sector funding for the organizations in an effort to keep assessed contributions low. State\u2019s Bureau for International Organization Affairs is responsible for these efforts and is assisted by the designated State contact point and interagency group that have the lead or significant program responsibility for U.S. interests in the international organization\u2019s work. Travel and accreditation to conferences are handled by State\u2019s Office of International Conferences.", "In June 1995, State\u2019s Bureau for International Organization Affairs revised its budget policy from one of having zero real growth for U.S. participation in international organizations (which had been in effect since 1986) to one of seeking actual reductions in the organizations\u2019 budgets through a combination of improved program management, structural reform, and indicators that can be used to measure management performance. Exceptions to this policy were to be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. According to Bureau officials, the budget review process has been facilitated by requiring the organizations to submit audited financial statements and closely coordinating U.S. budget positions with officials from the U.S. agencies having lead programming responsibility. Bureau officials make the final determination concerning the U.S. position on an organization\u2019s budget and provide instructions to U.S. delegates in advance of the organizations\u2019 budget conferences.", "U.S. delegates to these budget conferences are encouraged to seek out and build coalitions for consensus on cost-cutting and reinvention measures with other like-minded member nations for improved leverage. They are instructed to vote against or abstain from voting on program budgets if the U.S. budget targets are not met\u2014and they have done so. Over the past year, in consonance with State\u2019s new and more restrictive budget policy, U.S. delegates were obliged to cast negative votes on several organizational budgets\u2014including the International Agency for Research on Cancer, the International Copper Study Group, the International Seed Testing Association, and the International Bureau of the Permanent Court of Arbitration\u2014although other than signaling a U.S. determination to oppose unwarranted budget increases, it is not clear what impact these votes may have had. Nonetheless, U.S. delegates succeeded in rolling back some other proposed budget increases through consensus actions with other member states.", "Although not specifically related to assessments, State officials said they are also employing a more restrictive policy on sending delegates to the organizations\u2019 meetings. This should enable them to reduce travel costs for U.S. government delegates attending the organizations\u2019 meetings. Usually, State seeks to cover such meetings with staff that are assigned to local embassy posts or funds a single designated representative from the department or lead agency (which may fund travel for additional representatives out of its own budget). According to data provided by State\u2019s Office of International Conferences, as of March 1996, it had spent about $166,000 for staff travel to 15 of the 27 small organizations\u2019 functions during the preceding 18 months; it did not fund any travel to 10 of the organizations\u2019 conferences during this period.

State has interpreted this guidance as precluding it from accepting contributions for assessed dues to international organizations from private sources. A State official said that while State serves industry interests to some extent, especially in its efforts to increase U.S. exports, it must do so in an objective manner\u2014regardless of whether or not the donor has a stake in the outcome of any State action. Another State official told us that the use of gift contributions to fund such ongoing operational activities puts at risk State\u2019s long-range ability to plan and carry out promised actions. Officials from other U.S. government agencies dealing with these international organizations agreed with State\u2019s position.", "Nevertheless, State and other lead U.S. agencies have made some efforts to get private and nongovernmental organizations to contribute directly to these organizations with mixed results. For example, they have attempted to open or expand membership, on a nonvoting basis, to private sector participants. Some organizations (notably those engaged in conservation efforts such as the World Conservation Union and the International Center for the Study, Preservation, and Restoration of Cultural Property) currently receive a significant portion of their budgetary funds from associate memberships, revenue-producing activities, donations, and various sources other than assessed member state contributions. IGC, ICAC, and ISTA are all considering allowing industry organizations to be nonvoting members in an effort to raise additional revenue. However, there is opposition to these proposals in all three organizations. Most government members of ICAC oppose this idea, according to Department of Agriculture officials, because they fear industry representatives will then want to have a say in how the organization is run. Also, some IGC members have expressed concern over how the integrity of the organization would be maintained. They fear that IGC\u2019s work would no longer be unbiased if industry representatives were included in all meetings.", "Another way in which State and the other agencies have sought to increase the organizations\u2019 budgetary resources through private participation is to encourage interested private groups to contribute to voluntary programs or subscribe to publications or events that are run by some of the organizations. For example, U.S. industry and environmental groups have occasionally made small donations toward ITTO voluntary projects in which they were interested. However, there does not seem to be much organizational interest in expanding their contributions. Nonetheless, agency officials said that some organizations have had good success in raising revenue from projects or services, securing free office space and logistic support, and generating other extra-budgetary resources that have had the effect of reducing dues assessments to member countries. Other organizations, including ICSG, also do studies with private sector participation. Private participation also comes in nonfinancial forms. Representatives from industry and academia belong to the working groups and technical committees that do much of the work of ISTA and WRA, as well as providing advice and assistance in a number of other organizations.", "Private sector participation in these international organizations is usually conducted in uncompensated ways through the national delegation; the industry or trade associations bear the salaries and travel costs of its representatives. For some organizations, including IOE and WRA, non-U.S. government officials serve on the U.S. delegation as official members. For other organizations, industry officials attend as delegation observers, as in IOE, ICSG, and ILZSG, or can present their own positions as industry representatives, as in IOVW and ISTA. Private sector representatives also help formulate the U.S. delegation positions for international organizations. Industry representatives belong to interagency coordinating groups for many organizations. Industry and nongovernmental organizations also provide experts that serve other organizations where no formal coordinating group exists, such as CCC, ISTA, and ITTO.

However, given the likely decline in discretionary spending in the federal budget and the various proposals for reductions in State\u2019s budget, our draft report contained proposed recommendations that the Secretary of State (1) specifically and systematically apply the criteria announced in May 1996 for retaining membership in international organizations to the organizations discussed in this report; (2) from this process, establish priority groupings or a priority ranking for retaining membership; and (3) report this information to the Congress along with State\u2019s annual budget justifications.

In seeking to determine which organizations executive branch officials believe are more justified than others for continued government membership and participation, we relied primarily on the views of those government officials who had principal program responsibility for or contact with the organizations.
