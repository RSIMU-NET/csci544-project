The Congressional Budget Office estimates the cost of subsidies and related spending under PPACA at $37 billion for fiscal year 2015. GAO was asked to examine the enrollment process and verification controls of the federal Marketplace. For the act's first open-enrollment period ending in March 2014, this report (1) examines the extent to which applicant information is verified through an electronic system, and the extent to which the federal Marketplace resolved \u201cinconsistencies\u201d where applicant information does not match information from federal data sources and (2) describes, by means of undercover testing and related work, potential vulnerabilities to fraud in the federal Marketplace's application, enrollment, and eligibility verification processes. GAO analyzed 2014 data from the Marketplace and federal agencies, interviewed CMS officials, and conducted undercover testing.

The undercover results, while illustrative, cannot be generalized to the full population of enrollees."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) requires applicant information be verified to determine eligibility for enrollment or income-based subsidies. To implement this verification process, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) created an electronic system called the \u201cdata services hub\u201d (data hub), which, among other things, provides a single link to federal sources, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the Social Security Administration, to verify consumer application information. Although the data hub plays a key role in the eligibility and enrollment process, CMS does not, according to agency officials, track or analyze aggregate outcomes of data hub queries\u2014either the extent to which a responding agency delivers information responsive to a request, or whether an agency reports that information was not available. In not doing so, CMS foregoes information that could suggest potential program issues or potential vulnerabilities to fraud, as well as information that might be useful for enhancing program management. In addition, PPACA also establishes a process to resolve \u201cinconsistencies\u201d\u2014instances where individual applicant information does not match information from marketplace data sources. GAO found CMS did not have an effective process for resolving inconsistencies for individual applicants for the federal Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace). For example, according to GAO analysis of CMS data, about 431,000 applications from the 2014 enrollment period, with about $1.7 billion in associated subsidies for 2014, still had unresolved inconsistencies as of April 2015\u2014several months after close of the coverage year. In addition, CMS did not resolve Social Security number inconsistencies for about 35,000 applications (with about $154 million in associated subsidies) or incarceration inconsistencies for about 22,000 applications (with about $68 million in associated subsidies). With unresolved inconsistencies, CMS is at risk of granting eligibility to, and making subsidy payments on behalf of, individuals who are ineligible to enroll in qualified health plans. In addition, according to the Internal Revenue Service, accurate Social Security numbers are vital for income tax compliance and reconciliation of advance premium tax credits that can lower enrollee costs.", "During undercover testing, the federal Marketplace approved subsidized coverage under the act for 11 of 12 fictitious GAO phone or online applicants for 2014. The GAO applicants obtained a total of about $30,000 in annual advance premium tax credits, plus eligibility for lower costs at time of service. The fictitious enrollees maintained subsidized coverage throughout 2014, even though GAO sent fictitious documents, or no documents, to resolve application inconsistencies. While the subsidies, including those granted to GAO's fictitious applicants, are paid to health-care insurers, and not directly to enrolled consumers, they nevertheless represent a benefit to consumers and a cost to the government. GAO found CMS relies upon a contractor charged with document processing to report possible instances of fraud, even though CMS does not require the contractor to have any fraud detection capabilities. CMS has not performed a comprehensive fraud risk assessment\u2014a recommended best practice\u2014of the PPACA enrollment and eligibility process. Until such an assessment is done, CMS is unlikely to know whether existing control activities are suitably designed and implemented to reduce inherent fraud risk to an acceptable level."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Recommends", "paragraphs": ["GAO makes eight recommendations, including that CMS consider analyzing outcomes of the verification system, take steps to resolve inconsistencies, and conduct a risk assessment of the potential for fraud in Marketplace applications. The Department of Health and Human Services concurred with GAO's recommendations."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law  on March 23, 2010, expands the availability of subsidized health-care  coverage, and provides for the establishment of health-insurance  exchanges, or marketplaces, to assist consumers in comparing and  selecting among insurance plans offered by participating private issuers  of health-care coverage. Under PPACA, states may elect to operate their  own health-care marketplaces, or may rely on the federally facilitated  marketplace, or Health Insurance Marketplace, known to the public as  HealthCare.gov. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS),  a unit of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), is  responsible for overseeing the establishment of these online  marketplaces, and the agency maintains the federally facilitated  marketplace.", "PPACA provides subsidies to those eligible to purchase private health- insurance plans who meet certain income and other requirements. With  those subsidies and other costs, the act represents a significant, long- term fiscal commitment for the federal government. According to the  Congressional Budget Office, the estimated cost of subsidies and related  spending under the act is $37 billion for fiscal year 2015, rising to $105  billion for fiscal year 2025, and totaling $880 billion for fiscal years 2016\u2013 2025. While subsidies under the act are not paid directly to enrollees,  participants nevertheless benefit through reduced monthly premiums or  lower costs due at time of service, such as copayments. Because  subsidy costs are contingent on eligibility for coverage, enrollment  controls that help ensure only qualified applicants are approved for  coverage with subsidies are a key factor in determining federal  expenditures under the act. A central feature of the enrollment controls is  the federal \u201cdata services hub\u201d (data hub), which, among other things,  provides a vehicle to check applicant-provided information against a  variety of data sources.", "In light of the government\u2019s substantial fiscal commitment under the act,  you asked us to examine enrollment and verification controls of the  federal Health Insurance Marketplace (Marketplace). In July 2014, we  presented testimony on the results of our work up to that time, focused on  application for, and approval of, coverage for fictitious applicants for the  2014 coverage year. In July 2015, we further testified on results of that  work, including the maintenance of the fictitious applicant identities and  provision of coverage through 2014 and into 2015, and the Marketplace\u2019s  verification process for applicant documentation. In this review, we  1.  examine the extent to which applicant information is verified through  the data hub\u2014the primary means for verifying eligibility\u2014and the  extent to which the federal Marketplace resolved \u201cinconsistencies\u201d  where applicant information does not match information from federal  data sources available through the data hub; and  2.  describe, by means of undercover testing and related work, potential  vulnerabilities to fraud in the federal Marketplace\u2019s application,  enrollment, and eligibility verification processes, for the act\u2019s first  open-enrollment period, for 2014 coverage.", "To examine outcomes of the data hub applicant verification process, we  obtained summary data from key federal agencies involved in the  process\u2014the Social Security Administration (SSA), the Internal Revenue  Service (IRS), and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)\u2014on the  nature and extent of their responses to electronic inquiries made through  the data hub, for the 2014 and 2015 coverage years. We also  interviewed agency officials and reviewed statutes, regulations, and other  policy and related information. In addition, we obtained applicant data on  inconsistencies, subsidies awarded, and submission of required  verification documentation, from CMS data systems. We also interviewed  CMS officials to obtain an understanding of the application data that CMS  maintains and reports.", "To determine the reliability of the agency summary data on data hub  responses, we interviewed officials responsible for their respective data  and reviewed relevant documentation. To determine the reliability of the  CMS applicant data on inconsistencies, we performed electronic testing  to determine the validity of specific data elements we used to perform our  work. We also interviewed CMS officials and reviewed relevant  documentation. For both sets of data, based on the reliability examination  we undertook for each, we concluded that the data we used for this report  were sufficiently reliable for our purposes. For a full discussion of our  scope and methodology, including our assessments of data reliability, see  appendix I.", "To perform our undercover testing of the Marketplace application,  enrollment, and eligibility verification process for 2014, we created 12  fictitious identities for the purpose of making applications for individual  health-care coverage by telephone and online. Because the federal  government, at the time of our review, operated a marketplace on behalf  of the state in about two-thirds of the states, we focused our work on  those states. We selected three of these states for our undercover  applications, and further selected target areas within each state. The  results obtained using our limited number of fictional applicants are  illustrative and represent our experience with applications in the three  states we selected. They cannot, however, be generalized to the overall  population of all applicants or enrollees. Our undercover work did not  determine the effectiveness of any particular control.", "In these 12 applicant scenarios, we chose to test controls for verifications  related to the identity or citizenship/immigration status of the applicant.  This approach allowed us to test similar scenarios across different states.  We made half of these applications online and half by phone.", "For both objectives, we reviewed statutes, regulations, and other policy  and related information. We also used federal internal control standards  and GAO\u2019s fraud risk management framework to evaluate CMS\u2019s  controls.", "We conducted our performance audit from January 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards.

CMS operates the  federal Marketplace in about two-thirds of the states.", "To be eligible to enroll in a qualified health plan offered through a  marketplace, an individual must be a U.S. citizen or national, or otherwise  lawfully present in the United States; reside in the marketplace service  area; and not be incarcerated (unless incarcerated while awaiting  disposition of charges). Marketplaces, in turn, are required by law to verify  application information to determine eligibility for enrollment and, if  applicable, determine eligibility for the income-based subsidies. These  verification steps include validating an applicant\u2019s Social Security number,  if one is provided; verifying citizenship, status as a national, or lawful  presence by comparison with SSA or DHS records; and verifying  household income and family size by comparison against tax-return data  from IRS, as well as data on Social Security benefits from SSA.", "In particular, PPACA requires that consumer-submitted information be  verified, and that determinations of eligibility be made, through either an  electronic verification system or another method approved by HHS. To  implement this verification process, CMS developed the data hub, which  acts as a portal for exchanging information between the federal  Marketplace, state-based marketplaces, and Medicaid agencies, among  other entities, and CMS\u2019s external partners, including other federal  agencies. The Marketplace uses the data hub in an attempt to verify that  applicant information necessary to support an eligibility determination is  consistent with external data sources.", "For qualifying applicants, the act provides two forms of subsidies for  consumers enrolling in individual health plans, both of which are paid  directly to insurers on consumers\u2019 behalf. One is a federal income tax  credit, which enrollees may elect to receive in advance, which reduces a  consumer\u2019s monthly premium payment. This is known as the advance  premium tax credit (APTC). The other, known as cost-sharing reduction  (CSR), is a discount that lowers the amount consumers pay for out-of- pocket charges for deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.", "Under PPACA, an applicant\u2019s filing of a federal income tax return is a key  element of \u201cback-end\u201d controls\u2014those that occur later in the application  or enrollment process, versus those occurring at the outset, or \u201cfront end.\u201d  When applicants apply for coverage, they report family size and the  amount of projected income. Based, in part, on that information, the  Marketplace will calculate the maximum allowable amount of APTC. An  applicant can then decide if he or she wants all, some, or none of the  estimated credit paid in advance, in the form of payment to the applicant\u2019s  insurer that reduces the applicant\u2019s monthly premium payment.", "If an applicant chooses to have all or some of his or her credit paid in  advance, the applicant is required to \u201creconcile\u201d on his or her federal tax  return the amount of advance payments the government sent to the  applicant\u2019s insurer on the applicant\u2019s behalf with the tax credit for which  the applicant qualifies based on actual reported income and family size.", "To facilitate this reconciliation process, the Marketplace sends enrollees  Form 1095-A, which reports, among other things, the amount of APTC  paid on behalf of the enrollee. This information is necessary for enrollees  to complete their tax returns. The accuracy of information reported on this  form, then, is important for determining an applicant\u2019s tax liability, and  ultimately, government revenues."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "CMS Does Not Analyze Data Hub Responses Used to Verify Applicant Information and Did Not Resolve One- Third of 2014 Federal Marketplace Applicant Inconsistencies", "paragraphs": [], "subsections": [{"section_title": "CMS Does Not Analyze the Extent to Which the Data Hub Provides Applicant Verification Information", "paragraphs": ["As noted, PPACA requires that consumer-submitted information in  applications for health-care coverage be verified, and CMS uses the data  hub to check external data sources when making eligibility  determinations. Hence, the extent to which federal agencies that support  the verification system can provide or verify applicant information is a key  element of the eligibility and enrollment process.", "Under the data hub process, verification efforts include the following:", "SSA: The agency responds to data hub inquiries with information  from its records on applicant citizenship status, Social Security  number, incarceration status, and death. In responding to data hub  inquiries, SSA employs a two-step process: It first seeks to match an  applicant\u2019s name, Social Security number, and date of birth. If SSA  can successfully establish this initial match, it will then seek to  respond to other requests from the data hub for information, if made,  based on specifics of a particular application, such as an applicant\u2019s  citizenship status. SSA also provides CMS with information on  monthly and annual Social Security benefits paid to individuals under  the Old Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program, if necessary  to determine eligibility.", "IRS: The agency provides federal tax information on household  income and family size, to be used for determining eligibility for  insurance affordability programs, including the APTC and CSR  subsidies.", "DHS: The agency provides applicant citizenship and immigration  status information. If SSA cannot verify citizenship (as described  above) and an applicant has also provided an immigration document  number relating to citizenship, DHS will be asked to verify the  applicant\u2019s citizenship, or other immigration status. Or, if applicants  have identified themselves as eligible noncitizens and provide  immigration document information, DHS will be asked to verify that  status.", "If the eligibility information applicants provide to the federal Marketplace  cannot be verified through the external sources, such as SSA, IRS, and  DHS, an inconsistency will result. In particular, an inconsistency can arise  when the data hub query process yields no information; or when  information is available through the data hub, but it does not match  information the applicant has provided.", "CMS officials told us the key performance measures for the data hub are  computer system availability and the extent to which transmissions of  queries and responses are successfully accomplished; that is, that an  inquiry is made and a corresponding reply received, without regard to  content. According to CMS officials, the data hub only captures a code for  type of reply that is generated when agencies respond to the inquiries,  and those codes are not associated with any other applicant-identifying  information or information that may have been provided in response to  the query. There are no additional data kept on what information might  have been transmitted in the source agency\u2019s response, such as income  or family size. Likewise, the data hub does not track whether information  provided through the data hub matches information originally provided by  the applicant, the officials said.", "Overall, although the data hub plays a key role in the eligibility and  enrollment process, CMS officials said the agency does not track the  extent to which the federal agencies deliver responsive information to a  request, or, alternatively, whether they report that information was not  available. From the standpoint of data hub operations, either outcome is  valid, CMS officials told us, and the agency does not focus on the  distinction. Additionally, CMS officials said they do not analyze data  provided in response to data hub inquiries. By design, the data hub does  not store individual transactional data that could be collectively analyzed  over time. For policy reasons, the officials said, the agency did not want  the data hub to become a data repository itself, and in particular, a  repository of sensitive personal data. The CMS officials also said the  agency is barred legally from maintaining IRS taxpayer information in the  data hub.", "With CMS unable to provide us with information on data hub inquiry  outcomes, we sought available information from the responding federal  agencies. SSA, IRS, and DHS officials generally told us they do not  analyze outcomes of data hub inquiries. Instead, they focus on  responding to inquiries received. Our review also found that SSA, IRS,  and DHS had limited information on the nature and extent of the inquiries  made by the data hub. According to the three agencies, available  statistics reflect data hub inquiries in general, and cannot be broken out  by program, such as a qualified health plan or Medicaid. In addition,  according to agency officials, an unknown number of data hub applicant  inquiries were duplicates, which we could not eliminate from our  examination. Instead, agency officials told us, they generally process  inquiries sequentially as they are received from the data hub. Thus, while  the agencies can provide some information on data hub queries, they  cannot provide comprehensive information specifically on number of  inquiries and individuals represented by those queries.", "Our examination of available statistics from SSA, IRS, and DHS, subject  to the limitations noted, showed that while the agencies could  successfully provide applicant verification information in a large  percentage of cases, they nevertheless did not have data in their records  to verify information for millions of data hub inquiries.", "SSA. According to statistics provided by SSA, the agency accomplished  its match on name, Social Security number, and date of birth in a large  majority of cases for PPACA\u2019s first enrollment cycle, for 2014 coverage,  as shown in table 1.", "However, for about 4.4 million inquiries\u2014or about 5 percent of the total\u2014 the applicant information did not match SSA records. In addition, after  completion of the name, Social Security number, and date of birth match,  when SSA attempted to verify additional information, the agency could  not confirm citizenship in about 8.2 million inquiries where individuals  claimed they were citizens. We also obtained updated figures for the  second enrollment cycle\u2014for 2015 coverage. SSA\u2019s total matching  percentage was slightly higher (96.1 percent vs. 94.9 percent), and the  number of unsuccessful citizenship queries was lower (3.6 million vs. 8.2  million), according to available data from SSA.", "IRS. According to IRS, household income and family size information was  not available for inquiries representing about 30.7 million people,  including the following:  Inquiries representing about 25 million people for whom tax-return  information was unavailable, primarily because, according to IRS, no  tax returns were found in agency records or there was a mismatch  between taxpayer identification number and name.", "Inquiries representing about 3.2 million people where spouse  information reported on an application does not match spouse  information on file. A spouse mismatch may occur when one partner  remarries, or ceases to be a spouse, IRS officials told us.", "Inquiries representing about 1.3 million people involved in identity  theft\u2014victims themselves, or those associated with people who are  victims.", "For 2015 coverage, the total figure for which IRS was unable to provide  income and household size verification information was similar, at 29.2  million people versus 30.7 million people, according to IRS data.", "DHS. Among the major federal agencies involved in the data hub  process, DHS handled the smallest number of inquiries during the first  enrollment cycle\u2014approximately 3.5 million, regarding applicant  immigration status. Of these, DHS provided applicant status information  through its automated inquiry process in about 3 million inquiries. It could  not initially provide information through the data hub process for  approximately 510,000 inquiries, or about 15 percent, of the total. For  2015 coverage, the figure for unresolved queries was about the same:  status information provided in about 3.5 million inquiries, but with about  634,000, or about 15 percent, initially unresolved, according to DHS data.  According to DHS, the reasons for failure to obtain an automated  resolution are: a mismatch between reported name and date of birth;  inability to find the identifying number of immigration documentation  supplied by the applicant; expired documentation; and missing  information on the legal category used to admit an immigrant.", "As noted earlier, CMS does not analyze outcomes of the data hub query  process. A variety of standards, however, call for agencies to routinely  examine performance and progress toward key goals. Internal control  standards for the federal government require that departments and  agencies assess program quality and performance over time and work to  address any identified deficiencies. In addition, management must  continually assess and evaluate controls to assure that the activities the  agency employs to implement its controls are sufficient and effective. In  particular, information critical to achieving agency objectives, including  information related to critical success factors\u2014such as, in this case, the  effectiveness of PPACA\u2019s primary enrollment control process\u2014should be  identified and regularly reported to management. In addition, according  to GAO\u2019s fraud framework, it is a leading practice to conduct ongoing  monitoring and periodic evaluations, to, among other things, provide  assurances to managers they are effectively preventing, detecting, and  responding to potential fraud, and also to support decisions about  allocating resources. Monitoring activities, because of their ongoing  nature, can serve as an early warning system for managers to help  identify and promptly resolve issues and ensure compliance with current  law, regulations, and standards. Moreover, monitoring enables a program  to quickly respond to emerging risks to minimize the impact of fraud. A  centerpiece of federal management and accountability standards, the  Government Performance and Results Act, requires regular review of  progress in achieving objectives, including data-driven analysis on  progress toward key performance goals and management-improvement  priorities. Further, creation of a written plan and timetable for actions to  monitor and analyze outcomes of the data hub query process would  demonstrate organizational commitment to program oversight and  improvement, move such actions closer to fruition, and establish a  schedule for accountability.", "By not assessing the extent to which data hub\u2013provided data matches  consumer\u2013provided information, CMS foregoes analysis of the extent to  which responding agencies successfully deliver applicant verification  information in response to data hub requests. In doing so, CMS foregoes  information that could suggest potential program issues or potential  vulnerabilities to fraud, as well as information that might be useful for  enhancing program management. In addition, to the extent hub inquiries  cannot provide requested verification information\u2014leading to generation  of applicant inconsistencies\u2014there is a greater burden on both the  agency and the applicant to resolve the inconsistency. Also, as our  enrollment testing work showed (see discussion later in this report), the  inconsistency resolution process that occurs after the initial application is  vulnerable to fraudulent submission of applicant documentation. Thus,  analysis of data hub query outcomes could be used to assess whether  additional data sources or processes could be used to improve the front- end verification process.", "CMS officials acknowledged that the current system often leads to  generation of inconsistencies because information applicants submit often  is more current than information maintained by the federal agencies. By  analyzing the outcomes of data hub inquiries, and in particular, clarifying  the nature and extent of inconsistencies arising from this process, CMS  could, for example, assess whether other sources of data, such as the  National Directory of New Hires, could be useful for more current  applicant information on income. Similarly, CMS could analyze the  information to examine whether other sources of citizenship information,  such as the Department of State\u2019s passport data, could be used to aid in  verifying applicant citizenship.", "The data hub\u2019s limited capture of transactional details also means there is  not a detailed audit trail between health marketplaces and the federal  agencies responding to inquiries, to determine whether a query was  appropriately handled. Finally, information that federal agencies maintain,  but that is not currently part of the inquiry response process, could also  enhance the verification process. For example, on the key variable of  household income, IRS reports a limited number of response codes to the  data hub when it cannot provide information in response to a hub inquiry.  Among them is a generalized description that tax-return information is  unavailable. Internally, however, IRS tracks more specific reasons for why  tax-return information is unavailable, such as no tax return on file or a  mismatch between name and taxpayer identification number.", "As for feasibility of scrutinizing data hub inquiry outcomes, CMS officials  told us that, as currently operated, the data hub is not equipped to allow  such analysis, and that the time required for any such analysis would  likely hinder a key data hub goal of providing real-time responses.  Further, they said, in some cases, analysis within the data hub would not  be possible\u2014for example, as noted earlier, the data hub cannot store  protected taxpayer information. We note, however, that any such analysis  need not take place within the data hub itself. CMS officials agreed it is  possible that such analytical work could be performed on outcomes of  hub operations outside the data hub itself, but cautioned that attempting  to institute performance criteria could be challenging because success of  data hub queries is inherently limited by data available in the source  agencies. A comprehensive feasibility study of actions CMS could take to  monitor and analyze data hub query outcomes, both quantitatively and  qualitatively, would provide a means for the agency to assess a key  operation, as standards provide, and could also lead to improved program  performance and accountability. Such a study, at the least, could examine  not only baseline performance of the data hub process in delivering  usable information for applicant verification, but also examine data more  qualitatively, such as to identify trends or patterns that could suggest  improvements in verification or actions that could reduce the number of  inconsistencies that require further attention."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "The Federal Marketplace Did Not Resolve About One-Third of Applicant Inconsistencies for Coverage Year 2014, Involving $1.7 Billion in Associated Subsidies", "paragraphs": ["As part of our review, we obtained data from CMS on applicant  inconsistencies generated for the federal Marketplace and the value of  APTC and CSR subsidies associated with them, for the 2014 coverage  year. In particular, to observe the number of inconsistencies created  and subsequently resolved, we examined applications that were awarded  subsidies and that were created and submitted during the 2014 open- enrollment period plus a special enrollment period extension that  followed.", "Overall, based on this population, we identified about 1.1 million  applications with a total of about 2 million inconsistencies. These  applications had combined APTC and CSR subsidies of about $4.4 billion  associated with them for coverage year 2014. We found, based on our  analysis of CMS data, that the agency resolved about 58 percent of the  total inconsistencies, meaning the inconsistencies were settled by  consumer action, such as document submission, or removed due to  events such as life change, application deletion, or consumer  cancellation. Meanwhile, our analysis found about 34 percent of  inconsistencies, with about $1.7 billion in associated subsidies, remained  open, as of April 2015\u2014that is, inconsistencies still open several months  following the close of the 2014 coverage year.", "Figure 1 shows the total number of inconsistencies included in our  analyses, plus their resolution status and associated subsidy amounts.", "Among all applications in our analysis, we identified approximately  690,000 applications with about 1.2 million inconsistencies that had  been resolved through consumer or other actions. The subsidies  associated with these applications were about $2.5 billion for APTC  and $534 million for CSR.", "We also identified about 431,000 applications that had about 679,000  unresolved inconsistencies as of April 2015. These applications had  associated with them subsidy amounts of about $1.4 billion for APTC  and $313 million for CSR, for a total of about $1.7 billion.", "CMS, through its contractor, terminated or adjusted the subsidies for  about 128,000 other applications based on failure to submit required  documentation. These terminated or adjusted applications had about  159,000 inconsistencies. The total value of subsidies associated with  these applications was about $360 million, with about $293 million in  APTC and $67 million in CSR subsidies.", "Appendix II presents further details of our analysis of application  inconsistencies, including breakouts by number and category of  inconsistencies.", "Because unresolved inconsistencies can lead to termination or  adjustment of subsidies, which in turn affects government costs for the  program, we asked CMS for details of such actions. CMS officials told us  the agency does not track the value of APTC or CSR subsidies that  change when CMS terminates or adjusts subsidy amounts. Instead, CMS  compiles the number of individuals or households affected by such  actions. According to federal internal control standards, managers should  obtain financial information to make operating decisions, monitor  performance, and allocate resources. Tracking the amount of subsidies  eliminated or reduced would provide financial information on direct cost to  the federal government for such subsidies in a manner that tallies of  individuals or households cannot. Hence, by not tracking the magnitude  of such subsidy changes, CMS does not collect and have available key  financial information relevant to effective program management. In  addition, according to GAO\u2019s fraud framework, it is a leading practice to  assess expected costs and benefits of control activities, to determine  whether a particular control is cost-effective. The costs to the  government for these subsidies would be a key element of an  assessment of the cost-effectiveness of eligibility and enrollment control  activities. By not tracking such costs, CMS cannot make a fully informed  judgment on best implementation of such control activities.", "Relatedly, we also identified that, unlike APTC subsidies, CSR subsidies  are not subject to a recapture process at the individual level, such as  reconciliation on the taxpayer\u2019s federal income tax return. In particular, in  discussions with CMS and IRS officials, we found that no entity has  established a process to identify and recover the value of CSR subsidies.  The CSR subsidies increase government costs; and, according to IRS,  excess CSR payments, if not recovered by CMS, would be taxable  income to the individual for whom the payment was made. CMS officials  told us the agency plans to reconcile CSR payments made from the  government to insurers. But CMS officials said neither PPACA nor its  implementing regulations currently provide for reconciliation or recapture  of CSR subsidies at the individual level.", "According to federal internal control standards, program managers should  be effective stewards of public resources and detect or prevent  unauthorized use of agency assets. In addition, according to GAO\u2019s  framework for managing fraud risk in federal programs, it is a leading  practice for program managers to seek to ensure program integrity by,  among other things, ensuring that funds are spent effectively and assets  are safeguarded. While there is already a recapture process for APTC  subsidies, CMS has not evaluated the feasibility, including whether new  statutory authority would be required, as well as the expected costs and  benefits, of creating a mechanism to recapture CSR subsidies. By doing  so, the agency can be more assured it is fulfilling its responsibility to  spend funds effectively. Given the multiagency approach to reconciling  APTC, any such feasibility evaluation could likewise involve another  agency.

If the Marketplace is unable to validate the Social Security  number, it must follow the standard process for resolving all types of  inconsistencies.", "In our inconsistency analysis (discussed in further detail in app. II), we  identified about 35,000 applications having an unresolved Social Security  number inconsistency, which were associated with about $154 million in  combined subsidies. CMS officials told us they did not take action to  terminate coverage or adjust subsidies during 2014 based on Social  Security number inconsistencies. They said this decision was because  such inconsistencies are generally related to other inconsistencies, such  as citizenship or immigration status, and that document submissions for  citizenship or immigration status may also resolve Social Security number  inconsistencies. Overall, CMS officials told us they do not consider  missing or invalid Social Security number information to be a stand-alone  inconsistency that must be resolved, and do not take adverse action in  such cases. However, CMS regulations state that \u201cto the extent that the   is unable to validate an individual\u2019s Social Security number  through the Social Security Administration,\u201d the Marketplace must follow  its standard inconsistency procedures.

We also identified nearly 5,500 applications  with Social Security number inconsistencies that had no corresponding  income inconsistency. These applications had total subsidies of about  $10 million and $31 million associated with them, respectively. They  indicate that Social Security number inconsistencies can stand alone,  unrelated to other inconsistencies. Moreover, as discussed in our July  2015 testimony and summarized later in this report, we successfully  enrolled and received subsidies for eight undercover identities that either  did not provide a Social Security number or had an invalid Social Security  identity. Thus, we view unresolved Social Security inconsistencies as a  potential fraud vulnerability in the application process.", "Social Security number inconsistencies also affect tax compliance. As  noted earlier, if an applicant chooses to have all or some of his or her  premium tax credit paid in advance, the applicant must reconcile the  amount of APTC with the tax credit for which he or she ultimately qualifies  based on actual reported income and family size. Although CMS officials  told us they do not consider missing or invalid Social Security number  information to be a stand-alone inconsistency that must be resolved, IRS  officials told us a valid Social Security number is critical to tax compliance  efforts.", "In particular, according to the officials, IRS receives applicant information,  including amount of APTC subsidy received, from the federal Marketplace  and state-based marketplaces. If this information does not include a  Social Security number, or has an invalid Social Security number, IRS  cannot use the marketplace data to verify that taxpayers have properly  filed APTC information on their tax returns.", "Specifically, according to IRS officials, Social Security numbers are a key  identifier for tax reconciliation under the act. If a health-insurance  marketplace does not provide valid Social Security information to IRS, but  a taxpayer nevertheless reports receipt of APTC on his or her tax return,  IRS can then contact the taxpayer, the officials told us. This situation  results in greater burden on the taxpayer and IRS to resolve the  discrepancy. However, if a marketplace does not provide Social Security  information to IRS, and a taxpayer does not report receipt of APTC\u2014as a  fraudulent filer might do\u2014then IRS is unable to identify unreported APTC  benefits (that should be subject to reconciliation) at the time of filing, the  officials said.", "In addition, a missing or invalid Social Security number impairs IRS  outreach to taxpayers who have received the APTC subsidy, IRS officials  told us. IRS uses information from the marketplaces to identify those who  received APTC, but who did not file a tax return, or who did file a return  but requested a filing deadline extension. After close of the filing deadline,  IRS sends letters to these taxpayers, reminding them to file a return and  reconcile the APTC amount. Without Social Security number information,  IRS cannot know who filed a tax return, and thus does not include those  taxpayers in its APTC outreach efforts, officials told us.", "Thus, according to IRS officials, it is important for tax compliance efforts  that CMS validate Social Security numbers\u2014for reconciling APTC, and  for outreach efforts. If IRS does not receive valid Social Security  numbers, the key back-end control intended by the tax reconciliation  process can be frustrated, they said. If IRS is unable to reconcile APTC  subsidies, that inability could lead to loss of tax revenue that should  otherwise be collected by the government. We asked IRS whether it could  provide information on the amount of APTC that went unreconciled, or  outreach efforts foregone, due to missing or invalid Social Security  numbers, but officials told us such information was not readily available  and would take substantial effort to obtain.", "CMS could make greater efforts to resolve Social Security number  inconsistencies within its existing system and in the same fashion as it  handles other inconsistencies.

CMS officials, however, told us they did not terminate eligibility for  incarceration inconsistencies, because the agency determined in fall 2014  that PUPS was unreliable for use by the Marketplace. Specifically, CMS  determined that PUPS data were not sufficiently current or accurate for  use by the Marketplace after receiving reports that people were  misidentified as incarcerated, officials told us. PUPS data for inmate  release were also unreliable, they said. As a result, CMS officials told us  the agency elected to rely on applicant attestations on incarceration  status. Under this approach, CMS officials told us, the Marketplace  continues to make an initial verification attempt using the PUPS data.

They told us CMS requested a modification to the PUPS  data that would result in fewer false positives\u2014where a person is  identified as incarcerated but actually has never been so, according to the  SSA officials. SSA estimated a cost of $100,000 to provide the  modification. However, according to SSA officials, CMS was unable to  fund the modification and thus deferred the enhancement until after 2016  enrollment.", "SSA officials also noted to us that although CMS has expressed concerns  about use of PUPS data under PPACA, it continues to use PUPS for the  Medicare program. CMS officials explained that PUPS data are  acceptable for Medicare because that program uses the data to  determine whether Medicare payments are prohibited for claims  (regulations generally bar Medicare payments for those jailed), but not for  determining overall Medicare eligibility.", "SSA considers PUPS data to be accurate for its purposes, because it  verifies information about its beneficiaries before taking action, agency  officials told us. SSA provides more information to CMS through the data  hub than is actually validated by SSA. As a result, SSA officials told us it  is imperative that an agency obtaining PUPS information take steps to  verify that information. CMS officials told us that, thus far, the agency has  not used PUPS data as an indicator for additional follow-up on individual  applicant information. Reflecting SSA\u2019s use of its PUPS data as a lead for  further investigation, a relatively small portion of prisoner alerts generated  eventually led to benefit suspensions, according to agency officials.  PUPS generated about 1.01 million alerts from October 2012 to August  2015, which prompted notices being sent to beneficiaries. Ultimately, SSA  officials said the agency suspended about 131,000 Social Security and  237,000 Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries.", "Our review of documentation CMS provided for its decision to take no  adverse action on incarceration inconsistencies showed it did not contain  key information supporting the agency\u2019s decision to not use PUPS data.  Specifically, the documentation did not provide specific details on why, or  to what extent, people were misidentified as incarcerated; why CMS also  judged inmate release information to be unreliable; any criteria or  assessment employed to conclude that the PUPS data were not  sufficiently current or accurate; or the potential cost associated with not  verifying incarceration status. According to federal internal control  standards, significant events must be clearly documented, and the  documentation should be readily available for examination. Without  clearly identifying such elements as analysis, scope, and costs of  significant decisions, CMS is at greater risk of providing benefits to  ineligible applicants, and also may undermine confidence in the applicant  verification process and compromise overall program integrity. Although  SSA acknowledges that PUPS has a lower level of reliability than other  SSA data sources, CMS nevertheless could use information from PUPS  in the manner in which it was intended to be used\u2014as a lead for further  investigation\u2014to identify individuals who may be required to provide  additional documentation for their eligibility determinations. By not using  PUPS data in such a fashion, and by relying on applicant attestation in  the alternative, CMS may be granting eligibility to, and making subsidy  payments on behalf of, individuals who are ineligible to enroll in qualified  health plans.", "Further, if CMS has determined that PUPS or other data sources are not  sufficiently reliable, CMS is maintaining an inconsistency resolution  process that is not necessary, given the decision to ultimately rely on  applicant attestation. As a result, in continuing to identify incarceration  inconsistencies and directing applicants to submit documentation to  resolve them, and then processing that documentation, CMS imposes  unnecessary cost and burden on both applicants and the Marketplace.

As such, CMS  program management would benefit from the ability to monitor and  analyze the extent to which data hub queries provide requested or  relevant applicant verification information. CMS officials stressed to us  that, by design, the hub itself is not equipped to perform analysis, but  agreed that any such analysis need not take place within the data hub  itself. Data hub inquiries are important not only as a front-end control  measure, but also because what happens at the front end affects back- end controls as well: The more applicant inconsistencies that arise  following data hub queries\u2014because the data hub process cannot  successfully confirm applicant information\u2014the more emphasis accrues  to back-end controls. These back-end controls involve efforts first by  applicants to submit required documentation and then by the Marketplace  to resolve the inconsistencies. But as our work showed, the process is  vulnerable to fraud. A greater understanding of the effectiveness of the  data hub process could inform assessments about effectiveness of  enrollment and eligibility controls, while still incorporating procedures that  seek to safeguard applicant information. Underscoring the need for  comprehensive data collection and analysis is that the agencies  responding to data hub inquiries themselves have limited and inconsistent  information available on query outcomes. CMS could conclude, upon  making a comprehensive review of data hub inquiry outcomes, that  current procedures are adequate. But without such a review, CMS cannot  make a best-informed judgment.", "In the case of not seeking to resolve Social Security number and  incarceration inconsistencies, CMS officials effectively further waived  program eligibility controls.

For example, while saying HHS is working to  provide call center representatives with current status of eligibility  documentation, there is no indication how and when this will be done.  Similarly, while agreeing to reevaluate use of PUPS incarceration data,  HHS said it continues to use PUPS data as a \u201ctrusted data source\u201d while  also questioning its utility. Because actions in response to our  recommendations have yet to be implemented, and it is not yet clear  when and how such steps will be taken, it is too early to determine  whether they will fully address the issues we identified. All four agencies  provided us with technical comments, which we have incorporated, as  appropriate.", "As agreed with your offices, unless you publicly announce the contents of  this report earlier, we plan no further distribution until 30 days from the  report date. At that time, we will send copies to the Secretary of Health  and Human Services, the Acting Administrator of CMS, the Acting  Commissioner of Social Security, the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,  the Secretary of Homeland Security, and other interested parties. In  addition, the report will be available at no charge on the GAO website at  http://www.gao.gov.", "If you or your staff have any questions about this report, please contact  me at (202) 512-6722 or bagdoyans@gao.gov.

We also interviewed agency officials and  reviewed statutes, regulations, and other policy and related information.  To assess the reliability of the agency summary data on data hub  responses, we interviewed officials responsible for their respective data  and reviewed relevant documentation. We concluded the data were  sufficiently reliable for our purposes. In addition, we obtained applicant  data on inconsistencies, subsidies awarded, and submission of required  verification documentation, from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid  Services\u2019 (CMS) Multidimensional Insurance Data Analytics System.  These data include subsidies provided and submission status of required  verification documents as of April 2015, for coverage received for the  act\u2019s first open-enrollment period, including for our undercover  applications. Specifically, the enrollment period included was October 1,  2013, to March 31, 2014, and also included a special enrollment  extension into April 2014. These data included application information, such as application version, date of creation,  date of submission, and total application-level subsidies for coverage  year 2014; and  inconsistency information, such as type of inconsistency and  resolution status as of April 2015.", "For our analysis, we excluded applications modified from their original  version, as well as applications with submission and creation dates after  the special enrollment period ending in April 2014. To examine  inconsistency resolution, we grouped inconsistencies into CMS-identified  categories and determined, at the application level, subsidy amounts  associated with them. As provided to us by CMS, subsidy information is  at the application level, while inconsistencies occur at the individual level.  As a result, subsidy amounts are not mutually exclusive by resolution  status. For example, a single application may have an open inconsistency  in one category, but a resolved inconsistency in another. Thus, subsidy  amounts associated with the application would be reflected in subsidy  totals for each resolution status. This limitation, however, does not affect  our overall calculation of subsidies associated with applications with one  or more unresolved inconsistencies. To identify applications with Social  Security number inconsistencies and no associated  citizenship/immigration or income inconsistency, we first identified  applications with Social Security number inconsistencies. We used those  applications\u2019 unique identifiers to match them to applications with  citizenship/immigration or income inconsistencies, and then removed  those applications appearing in both categories. Additionally, we  interviewed CMS officials to obtain an understanding of the application  data that CMS maintains and reports. To assess the reliability of the CMS  applicant data on inconsistencies, we performed electronic testing to  determine the validity of specific data elements we used to perform our  work. We also interviewed CMS officials and reviewed relevant  documentation. On the basis of our discussions with agency officials and  our own testing, we concluded the data were sufficiently reliable for our  purposes.", "To perform our undercover testing of the Marketplace application,  enrollment, and eligibility verification processes, we created 12 fictitious  identities for the purpose of making applications for individual health-care  coverage by telephone or online. Because the federal government, at the  time of our review, operated a marketplace on behalf of the state in about  two-thirds of the states, we focused our work on those states. We  selected three of these states for our undercover applications, and further  selected target areas within each state. To maintain independence in our  testing, we created our applicant scenarios without knowledge of specific  control procedures, if any, that CMS or other federal agencies may use in  accepting or processing applications. We thus did not create the  scenarios with intent to focus on a particular control or procedure. The  results obtained using our limited number of fictional applicants are  illustrative and represent our experience with applications in the three  states we selected. They cannot, however, be generalized to the overall  population of all applicants or enrollees. In particular, our tests were  intended to identify potential control issues and inform possible further  work. We began our undercover testing in January 2014 and concluded it  in April 2015. We shared details of our work with CMS during the course  of our testing, to seek agency responses to the issues we raised.", "For these 12 applicant scenarios, we chose to test controls for  verifications related to the identity or citizenship/immigration status of the  applicant. This approach allowed us to test similar scenarios across  different states. We made half of these applications online and half by  phone. In these tests, we also stated income at a level eligible to obtain  both types of income-based subsidies available under PPACA\u2014a  premium tax credit and cost-sharing reduction (CSR). Our tests included  fictitious applicants who provided invalid Social Security identities,  noncitizens incorrectly claiming to be lawfully present in the United  States, and applicants who did not provide Social Security numbers. As  appropriate, in our applications for coverage and subsidies, we used  publicly available information to construct our scenarios. We also used  publicly available hardware, software, and materials to produce  counterfeit or fictitious documents, which we submitted, as appropriate for  our testing, when instructed to do so. We then observed the outcomes of  the document submissions, such as any approvals received or requests  to provide additional supporting documentation.", "Overall, our review covered the act\u2019s first open-enrollment period, for  2014 coverage, as well as follow-on work through 2014 and into 2015  after close of the open-enrollment period.", "For both objectives, we reviewed statutes, regulations, and other policy  and related information. We also used federal internal control standards  and GAO\u2019s fraud risk management framework to evaluate CMS\u2019s  controls.", "We conducted this performance audit from January 2014 to February  2016 in accordance with generally accepted government auditing  standards. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to  obtain sufficient, appropriate evidence to provide a reasonable basis for  our findings and conclusions based on our audit objectives.
