Since 2001, State has constructed 52 new embassy compounds (NECs) under this program, and moved over 21,000 U.S. government personnel into more secure and safe facilities. GAO was asked to examine (1) the extent to which new facilities match the space and functionality needs of overseas missions and State's actions to address space and functionality challenges; and (2) operations and maintenance challenges at these new facilities and State's steps to address them. GAO analyzed staffing data and other documentation for 44 NECs built from 2001 to 2009 and interviewed State headquarters and embassy officials at 22 of these 44 NECs to obtain information on their functionality and operations and maintenance issues."]}, {"section_title": "What GAO Found", "paragraphs": ["State has located nearly one-quarter of overseas staff in NECs, which posts said are an improvement over older facilities. However, NECs do not fully meet the space and functionality needs of overseas missions. Current staffing levels exceed the originally-built desk--or office--space at over half of the 44 NECs GAO analyzed. Post management has dealt with space limitations by converting spaces, like conference rooms, into offices, but 4 posts have had to retain space outside the compound for staff that could not fit in the NECs. Also, officials at almost all of the 22 NECs that GAO reviewed in depth reported some spaces, like consular affairs spaces, did not fully meet their functional needs. According to State officials, it is difficult to predict changing foreign policy priorities that can affect staffing levels, and the process for planning NECs has been unable to fully account for these changes. Budget constraints also affected decisions about the size of NECs and types of features provided. State has taken some actions to improve NEC sizing, but does not have sufficient flexibility in its staffing projection and design processes to better address sizing challenges. To address problems with functionality, State implemented a lessons learned program to analyze issues in completed NECs and modify design criteria for future NECs, but State has not completed, in a timely manner, planned evaluations that are designed to identify such issues. While NECs are state-of-the-art buildings, they have presented operations and maintenance challenges, and the larger size and greater complexity of NECs, compared to facilities they replaced, have resulted in increased operations and maintenance costs. In 2010, State developed its first long-range maintenance plan that identifies $3.7 billion in maintenance requirements over 6 years for all overseas facilities, but it does not include time frames for implementing identified maintenance projects or address increased operating costs. Problems with testing, or \"commissioning,\" new building systems have contributed to problems with building systems that do not function as they should, causing higher maintenance costs. State strengthened its commissioning process, though this change only applies to future NECs and does not address problems at existing NECs. Further, State does not currently recommission--or retest--NECs to ensure they are operating as intended. In addition, more than half of the 22 NECs that GAO reviewed in detail experienced problems with some building systems, resulting in the need for premature repair and replacement. Through its lessons learned program, State has changed some design criteria for future NECs to avoid problems with building systems. Finally, State has had problems hiring and training personnel who have the technical skills necessary to manage the complex NEC systems. State has taken initial steps to improve its staff hiring and training, but does not have an overall plan to establish its NEC human resource needs and the associated costs."]}], "report": [{"section_title": "Letter", "paragraphs": ["In the wake of 1998 terrorist bombings of embassies in Dar es Salaam,  Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, that exposed the poor condition of and  security vulnerabilities at U.S. diplomatic facilities overseas, the  Department of State (State) began a multiyear, multibillion dollar program  to replace insecure and aging diplomatic facilities worldwide.

The Boards reported that unless security vulnerabilities at U.S.  embassies and consulates were addressed, U.S. government employees a the public would remain at risk from terrorist attacks at many overseas  facilities. In 1999, the Secretary of State formed the Overseas Presence  Advisory Panel to appraise the condition of overseas facilities and con the future of U.S. overseas representation. The Panel reported on the  unsafe, overcrowded, deteriorating, and \u201cshockingly shabby\u201d co U.S. embassies and consulates.

Some compounds also include an annex building for  USAID or other program or agency functions. In 2003, we found that staf projections for NECs were developed without a systematic approach or  d  comprehensive rightsizing analyses, potentially resulting in wrong-size buildings, and recommended, among other things, that State provide  overseas posts with comprehensive guidance on developing staffing  projections for NECs. In 2004, State created the Office of Manageme Policy, Rightsizing, and Innovation (M/PRI), which now manages the  process for developing NEC staffing projections. In establishing project  requirements, OBO obtains information on a post\u2019s projected staffing from  te. nt  M/PRI, which works closely with officials at the post, State\u2019s regional  bureau, and other U.S. government agencies to develop a 5-year projection  of the post\u2019s staffing needs based on an assessment of mission priorities and  the staffing levels required to pursue those priorities.

In 2008, State\u2019s IG  reported that posts commented favorably about their NECs and praised  their design, space, and security. In 2007, OBO surveyed officials at posts  with NECs, and occupants responded positively about many aspects of  their NECs, particularly when compared with old facilities.

Not all posts have  exceeded the desk space initially provided. For example, our analysis also  shows 13 posts have current staffing levels at least 5 percent below as- built desk space. However, officials at overseas posts noted that having  some excess space can be helpful, as posts may require additional space  over time and it provides flexibility for post management to adapt to  changing circumstances.", "As figure 2 demonstrates, our analysis shows a difference of more than 50  desks for 11 of the 25 posts in which current staffing levels exceed as-built  desk space by at least 5 percent.", "State typically plans NECs with some additional desk space for future  growth, but the amount of growth space provided fluctuated over time and  across posts. When the NECs we examined were designed, State typically  budgeted for NECs to include from 5 percent to 10 percent additional desk  space as future growth space. Some growth space is designed as office  space, with desks or cubicles installed during construction, while other  growth space may initially be designed as conference rooms or file rooms,  with the intention that they can be converted to office space in the future,  if needed. State\u2019s typical growth factor for NECs has fluctuated over time.  Prior to 2003, OBO typically planned for growth space equivalent to 10  percent of the projected desk space in an NEC. However, in 2003, due to  concerns about the high cost of the embassy construction program, OBO  reduced the growth space allowance to 5 percent of an NEC\u2019s projected  desk space needs. In 2008, OBO returned to a 10 percent growth factor to  provide a greater margin to accommodate unanticipated growth. These  policies only serve as general guides, though, and some NECs received  less growth space than is typically budgeted. For example, in Bamako,  Mali, State eliminated growth space in the chancery in order to reduce  total construction costs to meet construction contractor bids that were  higher than anticipated.", "For the 25 posts in which current staffing levels exceed as-built space by  at least 5 percent, we found that, in general, the number of State positions  has grown more than the number of positions for all other agencies,  including the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). As  shown in figure 3, for the 25 posts collectively, the number of current State  desk positions exceeds as-built desk space by more than 1,400 desks, or 38  percent. Comparatively, the number of desk positions for all other U.S.  government agencies combined exceeds as-built desk space by about 200  desks, or 10 percent.

For example, according to one State official, law  enforcement agencies have increased their overseas presence since  September 11, 2001, while the Departments of the Treasury and  Transportation reduced their overseas staffing levels. Additionally, some  of the growth within State may have resulted from consolidating  administrative services once all agencies collocated at the NEC. State has  taken on additional administrative responsibilities while other agencies  were able to reduce administrative staff.", "Some State officials commented that the earliest-built NECs are more  likely to have space shortages, since it is difficult to project staffing levels  farther into the future and there has been more time for the post to  outgrow the space originally provided. However, we found that the age of  an NEC was not a major factor in explaining space shortages. For  example, while 4 of the 6 NECs completed from 2001 to 2003 have  shortages of 5 percent or more, 8 of the 16 NECs occupied since 2007 also  have shortages of 5 percent or more."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Posts Have Used Growth Space, Converted Conference Rooms and Other Common Spaces, and Reduced Cubicle Size to Locate Staff On- Compound", "paragraphs": ["We reviewed 22 posts in greater depth to determine how they found office  space for additional staff.

In the cases in which posts have some staff working off-site, post  management has had to either retain old facilities or lease additional office  space. In the case of Berlin, the most cost-effective option for locating  staff off-site\u2014at an estimated cost of $25 million\u2014involved purchasing  and renovating an office facility the post had formerly leased.

Officials also  noted that other actions, such as having staff share desks or locating new  staff in available spaces far from the rest of their agency or section, can  result in operational inefficiencies. For example, at one African post, some  FBI staff have to work in shifts in order to share a limited number of  classified computers.", "Additionally, officials at some of the posts we reviewed expressed  concerns that space could increasingly become a consideration in  approving requests for new overseas positions, potentially reducing the  post\u2019s ability to execute its mission.

In considering new position requests, State  advises Chiefs of Mission to consider space availability, among other  issues, and we found that a few position requests at posts with NECs have  been denied, at least in part, because of space constraints. According to  State data, in a few instances, posts have cited resource limitations,  including space constraints, when denying requests for new overseas  positions. Of the seven posts that cited resource limitations when denying  requests for overseas positions in 2008 and 2009, three currently occupy  NECs and one is scheduled to move into an NEC with known space  shortages in 2010. Some post officials also noted that space shortages can  make it difficult to accommodate short-term, or temporary duty, positions.  Officials noted that, in cases where the NEC has little or no available office  space, it can be difficult to find places for short-term staff to work. At  some posts, the number of short-term positions can be quite large.

Because of the time required to plan and  construct an NEC, there can be a lag of multiple years from the time  staffing projections are finalized to the time a post moves into an NEC.  The process for projecting future staffing needs starts with an assessment  of mission priorities and the staffing levels necessary for carrying out  those priorities. Therefore, State officials noted it can be very difficult to  predict future staffing levels when changes occur as a result of unexpected  events or initiatives. Officials at overseas posts, OBO, the regional  bureaus, and M/PRI all agreed that changes in U.S. foreign policy priorities  following the planning or construction of an NEC resulted in significant  growth at many posts, contributing to the differences between current  staffing levels and as-built desk space. According to State officials, some  posts have had large increases in staffing due to recent initiatives, such as  the President\u2019s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and recent  State and USAID initiatives to substantially increase their Foreign Service  presences. For example, according to officials in Kigali, Rwanda, the  post\u2019s staffing projections predicted that the Centers for Disease Control  and Prevention would have 18 desk positions at the time the NEC opened,  but it actually had 34 desk positions when the NEC opened because of  increases associated with PEPFAR. Staffing levels have also reflected  changing needs in response to world events. For example, according to an  M/PRI report, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, many  law enforcement, security, and military agencies increased their overseas  presence. According to State officials, many of these initiatives were not  anticipated when NECs were planned.", "Additionally, when staffing projections are prepared, an agency may not  have clearly planned for or articulated future needs. According to State  officials, some agencies have historically been better than others in  developing staffing projections and articulating the policy justifications for  staffing growth. However, other agencies have been less clear in their  planning, complicating State\u2019s ability to plan an NEC. For example, State  officials report that USAID frequently revises its projected staffing levels,  sometimes even after construction of a facility has begun. Also, as our  earlier analysis showed, at the posts that have exceeded as-built desk  space by at least 5 percent, State has grown substantially more than other  agencies, indicating it has also been challenging for State to predict its  own future staffing levels.", "State officials also noted that the staffing projections that determine an  NEC\u2019s size are not directly tied to the process for approving actual staffing  levels at each post. OBO sizes NECs based on staffing projections  provided in a post\u2019s rightsizing report. While posts, tenant agencies, and  the regional bureaus all have input into the rightsizing process, M/PRI has  final approval for these staffing projections. However, State officials noted  that the Chief of Mission has authority over actual staffing levels at each  post and may approve positions beyond the levels planned for in the NEC.  According to State officials, in cases where M/PRI and the Chief of Mission  do not agree on the appropriate staffing levels for a post, discrepancies  can result between an NEC\u2019s planned size and the post\u2019s actual staffing  levels. For example, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, the post\u2019s initial projections  anticipated the post would expand and become a regional center. Both  M/PRI and State\u2019s IG disputed the premise that Addis Ababa should be a  regional center, noting that Nairobi, Kenya, already serves a regional role  in East Africa. In addition, M/PRI found the post\u2019s initial projections  included substantial growth even though the post had dozens of unfilled  positions. Therefore, the rightsized staffing projections anticipated more  limited growth, reducing the post\u2019s initial projections by 47 desk positions.  However, the Chief of Mission continued to add new positions at a rate  even faster than the post initially projected and, in 2009, OBO had to  initiate changes after construction of the Addis Ababa NEC had already  begun in order to accommodate 96 additional desk positions at a cost of  about $13 million.", "OBO officials report it is difficult to make changes to a project to  accommodate changing needs after the staffing projections have been  finalized. The NEC construction process typically requires a 2-year lag  from the time staffing projections are initiated to the time a contract is  issued and an additional 3-year lag between contract issuance and the time  a post moves into the NEC. When changes are requested, State officials  said State and other tenant agencies may reassess the project to determine  whether the requirements are critical enough to warrant changing the  project\u2019s planned schedule and budget. In some instances, State officials  reported changes could be accommodated to the program and in other  cases changes could not. OBO officials noted it is easier to make changes  to a project before a contract has been awarded.

According to OBO officials, congressional and  executive concerns about the high cost of the embassy construction  program were a primary reason for the 2003 decision to reduce the NEC  growth factor from 10 percent to 5 percent. Budget limitations also  impacted decisions about the overall size of the NEC at some posts with  significant desk shortages. For example, State officials noted that, the  overall size of the NEC in Dushanbe, Tajikistan\u2014where, according to our  analysis, current staffing levels are more than double the number of desks  initially provided\u2014was largely based on the planned budget. We  identified 10 posts in which some spaces or features were reduced or  eliminated between the initial planning and final construction of the NEC.  Some NECs were significantly affected by budget limitations. In Berlin,  Germany, for example, more than one-third of the originally planned space  in the new facility was cut due to budget limitations. In Conakry, Guinea,  functional spaces\u2014including the cafeteria, multipurpose room, and most  conference rooms\u2014were cut in order to meet the project\u2019s planned  budget. According to OBO officials, programmatic support facilities, such  as warehouses, recreational facilities, and cafeterias, were eliminated from  a project\u2019s scope before any changes were made to office space.

In Dushanbe,  Tajikistan, OBO developed a plan to rearrange space within the existing  chancery to accommodate new and projected desk positions, as well as  build a warehouse and maintenance shops on-compound. In total, OBO  estimates the changes will cost about $7.5 million, but notes that, even  with the recommended changes to add office space, there will be no  available space for future growth beyond the staffing levels projected for  2013.

M/PRI now directs the process and  has developed formal guidance on developing staffing projections for  posts. According to State officials, in combination with the 2005  establishment of the Capital Security Cost Sharing program, through  which each agency with an overseas presence contributes funds for  construction on the basis of its overseas staffing levels and the type of  space occupied, changes made through the rightsizing process have  brought greater discipline to the planning process and have provided  greater incentive for State and other agencies operating overseas to  seriously consider their long-term staffing needs.

OBO  officials reported that starting in 2008, State generally extended the  duration of NEC project schedules by 4 to 5 months, in part, to allow more  time for commissioning and transfer activities at the end of projects.", "Some posts questioned the independence of commissioning agents that  were working for the construction contractor. Officials at the NEC in  Managua, Nicaragua, believe that OBO\u2019s former commissioning process  resulted in many problems that post officials have had to resolve. For  example, they said post had to hire a contractor to fix problems with air  pressurization controlled by the building\u2019s air handling and ventilation  system, which they said is due to the incorrect set up of the building  automation system. They believe there would have been fewer problems  after moving into the building had OBO used an independent  commissioning agent. In addition, in response to our written questions on  what could have been done differently to eliminate operations and  maintenance problems that occurred, embassy officials in Belmopan,  Belize, indicated that OBO should have hired an independent  commissioning agent, which they believe would have resulted in OBO  identifying many of the problems that post staff identified on their own  after occupying the NEC."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Several Posts Reported the Transfer of an NEC from OBO to the Post Resulted in a Lack of Information", "paragraphs": ["In addition to commissioning issues, we found that at 11 of 22 NECs,  transferring of completed facilities from OBO\u2019s on-site project director,  who managed the construction of the NEC, to posts and their facility  managers was not always well coordinated or without problems, resulting  in some information\u2014such as preventative maintenance plans, operations  and maintenance manuals for building systems, and as-built drawings\u2014 either not being turned over to the maintenance staff or being incomplete.  In addition, officials at many posts reported that the training for NEC  maintenance staff to support effective operations and maintenance  activities is inadequate.

In Belmopan,  Belize, for example, post officials said that wiring diagrams for the  building automation system showing the connections between it and the  NEC building systems it controlled were not provided with the as-built  drawings.

Senior OBO officials emphasize that while they believe that on-site project  directors fully enforced contract requirements related to commissioning,  there may have been some instances when commissioning by the  construction contractor was rushed. In 2008, OBO changed its process for  commissioning NECs; OBO now contracts with independent  commissioning agents to oversee the commissioning process on behalf of  the government and provide a more independent assessment of the testing  of building systems than State had in the past. In 2009, in briefing its  Industry Advisory Panel, OBO\u2019s Director reported there was a disconnect  between OBO\u2019s on-site project directors, who oversaw construction, and  posts\u2019 facility managers with regard to expectations on system  performance and turnover documentation that resulted in instances of  each blaming the other for building systems\u2019 problems. In recognition of  the organizational disconnect between those constructing the NECs and  those maintaining them, the OBO Director combined OBO\u2019s Office of  Construction Management and its Office of Facility Management under a  single managing director to improve communication, coordination, and  efficiency related to both commissioning and turnover of completed  projects from OBO\u2019s construction project directors to posts and their  facility managers. In addition, given issues with commissioning and  maintenance of fire protection systems, OBO\u2019s Director removed the fire  engineers from OBO\u2019s Office of Design and Engineering and assigned them  to OBO\u2019s Office of Fire Protection. In written comments to us, OBO  officials reported those staff engineers did not have the direct authority to  prevent occupancy of NECs. According to the director of the Office of Fire  Protection, starting in January 2009, that office now has full authority for  overseeing commissioning tests of the fire protection systems in NECs and  provides the final approval authority on acceptance of those systems prior  to issuance of a certificate of occupancy that allows post to move into the  NEC. Furthermore, that office is organized so that staff conducting and  overseeing commissioning reviews and testing are fully independent of the  fire protection engineers who conduct the design and construction  reviews of the fire protection systems to support the on-site construction  project director. This is to ensure OBO\u2019s fire commissioning officials are  not pressured by project director concerns related to completion  schedules and that they have an independent perspective on the project.", "OBO has also made changes to the process it uses to transfer a completed  NEC to post.

Industry  commissioning experts cite that, while some building owners (e.g., the  federal government) do undertake limited commissioning on existing  building systems, focusing on a single system does not typically result in a  facility that operates optimally overall; an integrated approach maximizes  positive results to ensure the building is operating efficiently and safely.  For example, the building cooling system may be affected by electrical  power conditioning problems. One OBO management official indicated  that he would like State\u2019s goal to be to recommission NECs every 5 years  but further noted there is no established budget for recommissioning.

The report shows that over 100 chillers, installed  since 2001, have either failed or experienced serious operating problems.  OBO identified 22 completed NECs that have experienced problems that  affected the proper operation of the units, including chiller failures. At the  NEC in Panama City, Panama, for example, post officials noted that one of  the chillers failed on several occasions, resulting in critical spaces being  flooded with water used within the cooling system and causing damage to  equipment. One post official further noted that to adequately address the  problem, major portions of the cooling system had to be redesigned and that  OBO is planning to replace the system in 2010. In 2009, OBO funded  emergency repairs of two chillers that failed in Conakry, Guinea, at a  reported cost of $250,000. In 2008, State\u2019s IG reported that in Abuja, Nigeria,  chillers did not work properly for at least 2 years after the post opened. One  OBO official reported that a new chiller is planned to be installed in Abuja  sometime in 2010.", "OBO officials identified that most chiller problems are associated with a  single manufacturer\u2019s units and characterized some problems as \u201clatent  defects,\u201d meaning that the problems were not detectable at the time of  inspection and acceptance. Circuit board burn outs, refrigerant loss or  leakage, defective refrigerant valves, and compressor failures have led to  failures of the chillers. OBO reports that the manufacturer has addressed  some of the problems with the chillers during the one year warranty period.  However, our review of OBO reports found that some chillers have been  replaced prior to the units\u2019 expected useful life, which is estimated to be at  least 25 years. Our review found that OBO has already identified a need to  replace chillers in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon (completed in 2005), and  Kathmandu, Nepal (completed in 2007). In interviews with OBO, the chief of  the mechanical engineering branch reported that OBO is starting to develop  a program to replace chillers where critical problems exist; however, OBO  does not yet have a clear idea of which posts will definitively need their  chillers replaced. OBO\u2019s 2007 study estimated the cost to replace a single  post\u2019s chillers to range from $500,000 to over $1 million.", "Our review of OBO\u2019s study on chillers found OBO\u2019s mechanical  engineering branch was neither fully involved in the selection and  approval of chillers as proposed by the contractor nor the commissioning  of building cooling systems. In addition, OBO\u2019s mechanical engineering  branch chief noted the NEC design specifications for chillers were \u201cnot as  tight as they perhaps could have been.\u201d In some instances, he noted the  building cooling systems were oversized resulting in chillers not operating  properly. Those issues reveal that some problems State experienced were  not due solely to problems with the units but rather were also due, in part,  to problems with OBO\u2019s internal processes. In addition, both OBO and  post officials have reported that local facilities staff at some posts may not  have the requisite technical skills to adequately maintain the chillers and  could have also contributed to problems posts experienced. An OBO  official reported that the design criteria for NECs prior to 2007 allowed  contractors to install either water-cooled or air-cooled chillers based on  life-cycle cost considerations. They further reported that maintaining  water-cooled chillers is challenging due to technical issues, such as having  to treat the water-cooled systems by using potentially hazardous  chemicals. In 2007, after learning of the problems that facilities staff had  maintaining the water-cooled systems, OBO changed its design criteria to  require air-cooled chillers to be installed in future NECs. OBO based its  decision on its conclusion that the units are less difficult to operate, in  part, due to not having cooling towers to maintain. OBO reported that  water-cooled systems will no longer be used in NECs, despite being  generally more cost effective with regard to energy use. OBO officials  believe there is no case where energy savings of using water cooled  chillers would outweigh the costs of maintaining those systems.", "In addition to problems with chillers, we found evidence of other issues  related to the NECs cooling systems, including temperature control  problems, building air pressure issues, condensation on pipes and in  ductwork, mold, and inadequate cooling of computer server rooms. Some  of the contributing factors include design and installation issues and lack  of required preventative maintenance on the systems. (See figs. 13 and 14  for examples of problems we found that are related to the design,  installation, operation, or maintenance of the NEC cooling systems.)", "Several posts we reviewed have experienced false alarms or other  repeated problems with operations of their fire alarm systems. These  alarms disrupt operations\u2014particularly consular services and classified  operations\u2014when post personnel need to cease activities and secure  classified materials and workspaces prior to evacuating the building in the  event of an alarm. Embassy officials in Sofia, Bulgaria, reported, for  example, repeated false alarms during the first 4 years of occupancy that  took several visits from OBO and contractor teams to troubleshoot and  resolve. In Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon, officials reported they experienced four  false alarms per week and that OBO spent $120,000 on repairs to the NEC  fire alarm system. At one NEC, officials said the ambassador would  advise people he was meeting with that the NEC fire alarm system had  problems and they need not evacuate the building unless the public  address system indicated there was an actual fire incident.", "In addition to false alarms, several NECs have had repeated problems with  fire alarm control panels, with illuminated \u201ctrouble\u201d or \u201csupervisory\u201d  lights, or the sounding of an alarm on the panel that signals a problem with  the system. OBO fire officials report that the problems with the fire alarm  control panels are related to one manufacturer\u2019s products that are  complex to operate and cannot easily be corrected by the maintenance  staff because of special tools and programming codes from the  manufacturer that are needed to troubleshoot and fix the problems. These  alarms can cause disruptions. For example, in Kigali, Rwanda, the General  Service Officer who oversees warehouse operations commented that the  fire alarm control panel in the warehouse routinely sounds an audible  alarm. The alarm is very loud and disturbing to warehouse staff. While the  alarm has been reset many times, she noted it has been an issue since the  facility was completed in 2008. During our visit, we found the panel had  both trouble and supervisory lights lit. Post facilities personnel noted they  have been waiting for nearly 8 months for OBO to find a solution. Figure  15 shows the fire alarm control panel at Kigali, Rwanda, which we  observed had warning lights indicating a condition in the system that  requires attention. Similar trouble and supervisory conditions were found  at some of the other posts we visited as well.", "OBO fire officials report that while they assess most problems as being  minor in nature, they report there are some problems that are more  significant and require extensive troubleshooting by trained technicians.

Problems with  doors and windows relate to a combination of design, manufacturing, and  installation defects. For example, doors used in early NECs were fitted  with hinges that were incapable of supporting the door\u2019s weight and prone  to premature failure, especially in high-traffic areas such as main lobbies  and the consular applicant waiting areas. Doors installed at NECs built  prior to 2005 also presented maintenance challenges because their design  specifications did not adequately allow for adjustment to keep doors  properly aligned in relation to the door frame and building structure. State  has revised its specifications to ensure the doors are installed correctly  and that they allow for future adjustment to properly maintain the doors.  Similarly, windows used at early NECs exhibited manufacturing defects  that contributed to their cracking, especially in locations with high  temperatures. Also, because some contractors were not experienced with  these products, doors and windows were not always installed correctly,  and as a result, did not operate properly after the facilities were occupied.", "While OBO expects fewer problems with security doors and windows in  the future because of improvements made to design specifications,  manufacturing processes, and installation techniques, it is systematically  managing efforts to repair or replace defective doors and windows at  several existing NEC locations.

As a result, State has had to  build additional office space at some locations, and may need to construct  more, and has also faced higher operating, maintenance, and repair costs.", "Currently, the process to determine the size of an NEC does not allow  enough flexibility to ensure that NECs have sufficient space to  accommodate staffing changes related to ever-shifting foreign policy  priorities. State has not analyzed post-specific characteristics in completed  projects that have been associated with rapid staff growth, such as  geographic location, nor have officials been able to explain the analytical  basis for determining the amount of growth space to include in building an  NEC. In addition, overseas officials have found that the design of some  spaces does not fully meet functional needs. While State has been able to  identify and address certain design issues, identifying these design  problems earlier, by, for example, conducting timely post-occupancy  evaluations in accordance with State\u2019s plans, is crucial to avoid similar  problems in future NECs. Since State expects NECs to support U.S policy  efforts for several decades, it is important that the facilities are large  enough to safely and securely house the changing number of overseas staff  in a manner in which staff are able to effectively carry out their missions.", "State has not fully addressed the increased operations and maintenance  requirements of the more technologically sophisticated NECs. Problems  with commissioning and transferring the NECs from the contractors to the  posts have resulted in some building systems that do not function as they  should and led to added costs to repair and replace systems, contributed to  higher operating costs, and created potential safety risks for staff. State has  made changes to building design requirements to avoid future problems  with NEC building systems. However, since changes can take at least 4  years to materialize in completed NECs, due to time to contract for and  construct NECs, the changes are too recent to assess. State does not have a  formal plan to recommission, or retest, the building systems at NECs that  have already been completed. Recommissioning NECs would help ensure  that the systems operate as efficiently as possible and that the problems  with building systems are being fully addressed. State\u2019s recent LROMP  outlines\u2014for the first time\u2014NEC maintenance costs over a number of  years and identifies the need for improvements in future editions, but it does  not establish a time table for when specific projects should be completed  which would help to further strengthen the planning process. In addition,  the LROMP is focused solely on maintenance costs and does not address  operating costs, resulting in an incomplete assessment of all costs  associated with the functioning of NECs. Finally, without a plan that  comprehensively outlines all human resources required to operate and  maintain NECs, including identifying hiring and training needs, State will  have difficulty ensuring NECs operate in an efficient and cost-effective  manner. As State continues building NECs and strives to maintain those  already constructed, addressing these challenges is important to provide  U.S. employees with a secure and dependable working environment and  ensure that State protects the country\u2019s investment in these facilities."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Recommendations for Executive Action", "paragraphs": ["In order to strengthen the operations of the extensive U.S. program that  provides for new embassy compounds around the world, we recommend  that the Secretary of State take the following six actions.", "Take steps to improve the process for determining the appropriate size for  an NEC, including reassessing the analytical basis for projecting future  staffing levels and determining how much growth space is allocated.", "Ensure that OBO conducts post-occupancy evaluations of completed  NECs as planned.", "Develop a plan to recommission those NECs completed before 2008 to, for  example, resolve any problems posts may still have with building systems,  and ensure that the operating costs are not being incurred unnecessarily as  a result of building systems that are not operating as efficiently as intended.", "Identify time frames for implementing the maintenance projects that are  outlined in the LROMP.", "Expand on future editions of the LROMP to include reporting on operating  costs to allow for a more complete assessment of the costs to maintain  and operate NECs.", "Develop a human resource plan that addresses the requirements and cost  implications for hiring required NEC facilities maintenance staff and  sufficiently training the local maintenance staff."], "subsections": []}, {"section_title": "Agency Comments", "paragraphs": ["We received written comments on a draft of this report from the  Department of State.

We do not dispute that NEC maintenance costs may be in line with  those for similar facilities as suggested by OBO\u2019s analysis. Rather, our  intent in comparing operations and maintenance costs of NECs to  those at the facilities they replaced is to show that because of their  larger size and the increased complexity of building systems, among  other factors, NEC operations and maintenance costs are higher. Our  analysis of utility costs indicates, for example, that NECs have a  comparatively higher utility demand than previous facilities and pay  correspondingly higher amounts for utilities. As the higher costs to  operate and maintain NECs present long-term budget implications, we  believe it is important for State to continue its efforts, as it has begun  to do with the recent development of its Long Range Overseas  Maintenance Plan (LROMP), to comprehensively plan for the long-term  resource requirements necessary for protecting its investment in  NECs. 2.  We acknowledge that NECs provide an improved level of safety  compared to the facilities they replaced. However, the intent of our  discussion is to convey that safety concerns, particularly concerning  the operation of fire protection systems, were apparent at some of the  earlier NECs as a result of deficiencies with the commissioning  process. For example, OBO\u2019s Office of Fire Protection reported that  some early NECs were occupied without the correction of critical  deficiencies affecting operation of their fire protection systems, a  situation that we believe would not have occurred if commissioning  had been properly conducted. Because of the paramount importance  of safety, we believe it is necessary to report on issues that potentially  result in reduced safety levels. 3.  We support State\u2019s intention to place greater emphasis on proactive  analysis and objective comparison. State concludes that its analysis of  the 16 NECs planned since the inception of M/PRI, many of which are  still under construction, indicates that \u201cthe problem of inadequate  office space is gradually being resolved.\u201d However, State\u2019s analysis  does not clearly demonstrate whether these NECs match the space  needs of overseas posts. For example, State\u2019s analysis includes all  positions at overseas posts and does not distinguish between those  positions that require office space in the NEC (referred to in our report  as \u201cdesk\u201d positions) and those, such as warehouse or maintenance  personnel, that do not. While such an analysis could be appropriate for  determining whether the rightsizing process is resulting in greater  accuracy projecting overall staffing levels, it is does not provide a clear  picture of whether the amount of office space that was planned for the  NECs is adequate for current office space needs.", "In addition to having concerns that State\u2019s analysis may not provide a  clear assessment of space requirements, we also believe that the  results of State\u2019s analysis do not indicate that NECs planned under  rightsizing will face fewer space challenges than their predecessors.  For example, State\u2019s analysis of all positions shows that 7 of the 16 (44  percent) NECs planned under rightsizing have at least 5 percent m staff than were included in the initial projections, even though none o the NECs planned under rightsizing is more than 3 years old and ma are still under construction. Our analysis of 44 completed NECs  showed that over half have current desk space needs that exceed the  nally,  amount of desk space constructed by at least 5 percent. Additio we found that 4 of the 6 NECs completed since the inception of M/PRI  had current staffing levels that exceeded constructed desk space b more th analysis support our finding that many NECs have already run out of  desk space and, therefore, the planning process might benefit from  additional analysis of the relationship between post-specific  characteristics and staffing growth.  an 20 percent. We believe that both our analysis and State\u2019s  4.  We acknowledge OBO\u2019s intention to revise the growth factor formula which would provide additional space in NECs. However, this does n address our concern that OBO has not provided any analytical basi demonstrate that a growth factor of 10 percent, applied uniformly  across all projects, is appropriate.  5.  We support State\u2019s initial effort in taking action to identify and  prioritize its maintenance needs as d the LROMP. Establishing a timeline concurrent with availability of  funds would provide greater transparency for projects to be initiated  during a specific funding period. However, we also believe State  should consider outlining notional implementation time frames for  requirements identified over each of the future budget years covered ocumented in its first edition of  by the LROMP, including those years for which future funding is not certain. By identifying notional time frames, based on forecasted  budget scenarios and not solely on available funds, we believe State  will be better able to demonstrate whether the plan can effectively be  resourced by future anticipated budget scenarios or whether  maintenance requirements potentially exceed likely funding scenarios.  We believe such an approach would strengthen State\u2019s efforts to show  how timely investments in maintenance can protect the multibillion dollar investment State is making in constructing NECs. 6.  We support OBO\u2019s efforts in developing first-year  stimates for NECs when they open. However, we still maintain State  e needs to develop an assessment of future operating costs that is  included in the LROMP. A plan that outlines future operating costs is  particularly important since, as our analysis shows, the operating co at NEC posts have clearly increased relative to the facilities they  replaced. By developing estimates of future years\u2019 operating costs and  combining those with estimates of future maintenance costs that State  has already outlined in its LROMP, we believe State will have a more  complete assessment of the financial resources that State and other  contributing agencies will need in future budget years to operate and  maintain overseas facilities.", "7.", "We maintain that State needs a human resources plan for NEC  facilities maintenance staff, regardless of the funding mechanism.
